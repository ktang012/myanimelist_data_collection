            "content": "Now, now, now. I've been informed that certain people think that Nazo no Kanojo is ecchi. I've also been informed that a lot of people think it's bad that it has some originality. Well, guess what? It ain't so. Not often will you find an anime which revolves around drool, and this one did a damn fine job in doing so. So, you think that people sharing drool is nasty? Well, guess what, it is. Oh, but you watched only the first episode of the anime and took upon yourself to be an arse and immediatelly toss it aside? Well, guess what, not all animestart off great. There needs to be progress. Fluidity. And damn right I'm not gonna sit by idly while a perfectly good anime is being dissed.\\n\r\nNow, let me start this review right.\\n\r\nThe storyline is about a guy. Not your generic anime guy without a personality/cowardly/insanely courageous guy, no; it's about a simple highschool boy with his unique personality. And, by a game of chance, he tastes the spit(yeah, kinda gross, but come on, you do that when kissing as well) of a new girl in class. Now, that new girl is kind of weird. She starts laughing in the middle of class without apparent reason, she's not socialising with anyone, and half her face is covered with bangs. And yet, this guy falls in love with her. And then, in time, he realises he's hit the jackpot. Now, her personality has been presented extraordingly. She's unorthodox, and mysterious, and I think that this anime will need a season 2 in order to fully explain her backstory. Now, let me move on from the characters.\\n\r\nThe storyline progresses pretty slowly, as it should with highschoolers, but not slow enough to make you bored. It's reasonably paced and will make you anxious in about what'll happen in the next episode. I think they were low on budget, so they couldn't make more episodes, but if there were more, I'm damn sure they would be even more awesome.\\n\r\nThe animation reminded me of old style. I'm talking before 2000 animation here, and it invokes a wonderful feeling of nostalgy and familiarity. Not too much fanservice in my oppinion, just the right mix. Didn't register many flaws in it, really.\\n\r\nNow, the music. It's WONDERFUL. Track 04 from the anime, dream, is composed to reflect the mystique and the weird nature of Urabe (female protagonist). Not too thrilled about op and ed though, but thye're not bad. The songs playing during certain scenes in the anime are exceptionally fitting and they don't get boring quickly.\\n\r\nAnd, finally, my overall and my grade.\\n\r\nOverall, this is an unorthodox anime, with an original storyline and plot, and damn right it shouldn't be cast aside for trying something new. It has almost no mistakes/errors and it's pretty well made. It's one of the better romances I watched, and it differs from all others with it's unique way of presenting and developing the feelings of the characters; and that's why, this anime will make it in my top 5, along with GITS, NGE, Bakemonogatari and Toradora.\\n\r\nMy overall grade is 9, and I reccomend everyone to watch this anime, and not to give up in the first episode.\\n\r\nOver and out, please submit your feedback about my first review :D",

            "content": "It is safe to say that the core concept of which this anime is built on, the saliva mind meld, is pretty obscure, if not totally weird. However, although Nazo no Kanojo X goes to the absolute extremes of weirdness in some areas, it is perhaps the single most realistic in others.\r\nSo I'm not going to talk about the drool, that may be what drew me to Nazo no Kanojo X initially, but it is not what kept me watching, it is not the part that I love about this anime.\r\nMost romance anime, especially school-based romance, are ludicrously unrealistic. We see the tsundere girl, theweak, whingey guy. We see the noble, unfaltering cool guy and the submissive girl. Characters that are, for all intents and purposes, completely rooted in fiction. \\n\\n\r\nWorse yet, we're often presented with a female character that has absolutely no control over her sexual urges, once the MC breaks down a few walls. We are given characters who are offensive to men, offensive to women and completely unrealistic. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, we are often presented with a type of romance which can only exist in the anime world. A type of romance that, if we were to try to emulate in real life, would end in utter catastrophe. This is where Nazo no Kanojo X surpasses all others and stands up as the pinnacle of anime romance, in my book. The utter realism that it shows us.\\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of myself, or perhaps my former self, in Tsubaki. Everything he does, I can remember myself doing at-least once in a previous relationship. From flirting with an ex-crush, to not wanting others to see her after a new haircut, wanting her all to myself.\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki is a good reflection of most of the 'regular guys' in their first relationships. We, who watch anime and may not be the best at sports. We might not be the top of our class, but we know a thing or two. The regular guy.\\n\\n\r\nHe is a cacophony of contradictions. He has an inferiority complex, but believes he can get better. He is needy, but sometimes wants space away from Urabe. He is proud of his girlfriend, but in some ways ashamed. Love doesn't make sense, love is rife with contradictions and Tsubaki represents them perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nHe is almost like a mirror of myself, back in the day but, hopefully, not anymore. Don't get me wrong, he is very likable. He is not the whingey MC we're used to, he's not the asshole, he's not clueless. But that doesn't mean I necessarily want to be him.\\n\\n\r\nNow we see Urabe. Beautiful, shy, strange, kind, strong, talented, awkward, uncomfortable. There are so many words to describe Urabe, but submissive and reliant aren't some of them.\\n\\n\r\nShe represents the real girl. She gets sad when Tsubaki hurts her, very sad. But she doesn't get on her knees and beg. She gets turned on by Tsubaki, sure. But she isn't taken aback by sexual emotions, emotions which take complete control of her mind and body.\\n\\n\r\nShe's not quite an open book, but she's not mean - she's very kind. She's not submissive, dependent or a tsundere. She doesn't represent any of the offensive female characters we see in most romance anime. She is real.\\n\\n\r\nAnd best yet, although there are other love interests - there is no ridiculously unrealistic harem.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a girl, so I don't know what this anime gives them. But if you're a single guy wanting to know what real first relationships are like, watch this anime. If you're a needy, dependent, possessive guy in a relationship and want to see a reflection of all of your negative aspects; watch this anime. I wholeheartedly believe that Nazo no Kanojo X can teach you about love, about real love. An aspect which most romance anime fall completely flat on.",

            "content": "Ah yes. Mysterious Girlfriend X. When I heard that the manga was getting an anime adaption, I looked forward to seeing other people's reactions to the synopsis almost as much as the show itself. Perhaps a fair few WTFs amongst viewers who've never read the manga?\r\nThe story is simple. Boy encounters transfer girl. Boy deliberately tastes girl's drool on a desk. Boy falls in love with girl after that. Um, yeah. \r\nThe drool. If there's anything in this series that would turn off those who watch it, it'll obviously be the various saliva-swapping scenes. Personally, I don't think it's that bad. If it helps, thinkof it as an inevitable aspect of French kissing except without any lips touching. Nor tongues. Nor sensation. Well maybe sensation, in the form of the recipient of the drool experiencing the other's mood or feelings. Perhaps not as romantic though. But it's mostly down to individual tolerance levels for the things you find okay in anime; the same with fanservice, blood and gore, hentai, etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe series closely explores the slow-building but charming relationship between the main characters, inside and outside of high school. It's quite different to the romances found in other anime. After all, who shows affection by ripping up a photo of a previous crush as opposed to holding hands or kissing to start a relationship? And that's just one of many examples. Although it rarely feels out of place, there is some ecchi and fanservice present.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that Mikoto Urabe is weird would be a huge understatement. At times in her relationship she just seems like a normal shy and compassionate girl underneath a cold demeanour, but her hobbies and certain superhuman abilities makes her more than that. She's a compelling character to watch however, and her various quirks (Fits of laughter? Scissors?!) are what makes the anime so addictive, along with her bond to Akira Tsubaki. Tsubaki is a relatively normal character, despite his attraction to Urabe's drool, and it's fun to see him cope with being the boyfriend of such a strange person and the requirements that come with the role; romancing Urabe is much harder than he thinks. The anime mainly focuses on the odd couple so important side characters are limited, but two of their classmates, Kouhei Ueno and Ayuko Oka, provide some extra entertainment; the playful and wild Oka has a particularly big influence in how the relationship develops between Urabe and Tsubaki.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of Mysterious Girlfriend X is excellent and rather interesting. It goes for an older style of animation, and reminds me of anime that were made a decade or two ago, back when clich\u00e9s were still original ideas. Backgrounds are also quite nice, especially parts of the school like the classroom and gardens as well as the surrounding town. However, I'm still undecided as to whether I like the character models retained from the manga, which are sharp and detailed but make the 17-year old students look like they're in middle school rather than high school.\\n\\n\r\nThe series makes use of a variety of background music that is sombre and mysterious, but also some which makes you think of a circus, and this works well with Urabe's character and the strangeness of the show itself. A few soothing melodies are thrown into the mix too. The OP is a catchy and upbeat song that fits with the high school setting, while the ED is also good and has a nice tune. The voice acting is decent all around; the voice actress for the role of Urabe is a newcomer but she's done an especially good job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mysterious Girlfriend X, or Nazo no Kanojo X, is about a bizarre high school romance with unique additions in the form of drool with multiple and mysterious effects, excessive nose-bleeding and a very weird yet enjoyable character in Mikoto Urabe. This anime is sure to captivate some viewers while alienating others but like the manga, it does what it sets out to do with a passing grade. And that is to provide us with an entry in the genre that feels fun and more than just a little different. Assuming it doesn't make its audience sick to the stomach first.",

They wonder what kind of girl they'll be with for their first time.\"\r\nTL;DR: boy meets girl, hen things happen, no general romantic shit.\r\nThe series starts very cliched. We have The Ordinary High School Student, we have The Ordinary New Transfer Student... or not that Ordinary? Yepp, new girl looks weirdo, do weirdo things, drooling as hell and, in nearly everything, isn't usual high school girl, filled with shyness and taboos. That's cool, if you gonna ask me. Main Hero aka Akira-kun despite being at top of his sexual maturation is all round nice guy,not pervert, not bookworm etc. Perfect character to project with yourself. Also, this is goin' to be very unusual romantic anime, just because it's targeted on boys and ant the same time it's not Yet Another Harem. There is also one feature, makes this title so special, but I'm not gonna spoil it. So for the story 8pts and 9pts for the girl (she's really mysterious, lol).\\n\\n\r\nIt's also 8pts for the art. It's quite oldschool, but not that dried mammoth shit like in parallel Ozuma. It have that 90-s flava. So if you're not scred of that, you'll like it. I'm glad to see so different art styles presented today at TV-anime market. 8pts.\\n\\n\r\nSound. Is. Quite. Amazing. Especially for the last scene of the first episode. It's some parade music with trumpets and stuff. Really brings feelings of craziness, madness and only God knows what else. 9pts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. That's very undebatable part since it's quite personal. 10pts. I'm gonna reccomend it to anyone. It's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9pts after 1st episode. That's gonna be one of the very few sweets this season.",

            "content": "Intro:\r\nThis is a review I've been planning to write for a long time. I've been putting it off in part because reviews like this are by FAR the hardest to write. Here is what I mean. The easiest reviews to write are bashing bad anime that absolutely nobody cares about. They get quick and easy laughs from readers. Nobody gets angry or offended. You can just say whatever you want with no fear of the consequences. \r\nThe second easiest to write are gushing praise onto a universally beloved classic. Have you ever seen an \"Anime everyday\" review? I'm not trying to be mean, I'm totallyserious. All you must do is repeat the same praises that other people have said countless times before and suddenly most people will think you are a deep thinker and sophisticated intellectual. I could go on IMDB and copy/paste pieces of essays written about Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and come across as brilliant without ever putting an ounce of effort or thought into the review. \\n\\n\r\nThe 3rd most difficult type of review is bashing a series that is well loved. This can be a bit tricky and requires some thought, but it's still workable if you know how. The most common tactic would be to acknowledge the things the series does well, but also point out its flaws and basically say \"maybe this series isn't quite as good as people are saying\". \\n\\n\r\nThe absolute hardest type of review is defending and praising a series that is widely disliked. Since few people will dare to do this, you can't rely on the words and arguments of others. You are on your own. Even if your words are elegant and your defense is Johnny Cochran worthy, it is slamming hard against your reader's preconceived notions. This means you will likely get a lot of bashing and \"thumbs down\" regardless. Defending an unpopular series is a Pyrrhic victory. No massively popular anime critic I can think of made their fame and popularity by commonly defending series that are widely loathed. Despite knowing this, I'm writing this review anyways. Now as the great poet Pushkin wrote in his poem Wagon of Life, \"Let's get going for Fuck's sake!\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\\n\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X is essentially the story of a quirky romance between 2 extremely socially awkward youths. So\u2026this will be like Wes Anderson\u2019s Moonrise Kingdom? Nope. This is a series featuring psychic saliva that creates a mental and physical link between those who share it. Basically, think Alexander Dumas\u2019 short story The Corsican Brothers only gross. This is a WEIRD anime, but if you give it a chance it is surprisingly pretty good!\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a highschool, as romance anime tend to do. Our hero is a guy named Akira Tsubaki. Akira is a lonely and withdrawn boy who lives with his father and older sister since his mother died when he was young. Akira has never had a girlfriend before, but is intrigued by an odd transfer student who is even more introverted than he is. This girl is named Urabe and she is\u2026odd. She sleeps through most of her classes and quickly becomes a social pariah through her bizarre behavior. Her hobby is making art with scissors, which she has learned to use with superhuman speed and accuracy. One day after school, Akira notices that Urabe left a large puddle of drool on her desk and decides to taste a sample of it because he had never kissed a girl. Soon he develops a fever and starts having unusual dreams. It turns out that Urabe is psychic and can transfer her emotions and feelings through her bodily fluids. This link is also physical and causes any pain or injury inflicted on one to affect the other. Urabe quickly senses that someone must have tasted her drool and figures out it was Akira. She tells him that he will go through painful withdrawal unless he tastes a sample of her saliva every day. Now these 2 oddballs must learn to form a relationship and adjust to their new psychic link. The relationship between Urabe and Akira is also contrasted against the far more normal relationship between Akira\u2019s only friend named Kouhei and his girlfriend Oka. \\n\\n\r\nMost romance anime rely on tired gags and a strict formula. The boy will accidentally see the girl naked or feel her up, then she will yell at him and punch him. BAKA! The next minute, the fight is over and the relationship is back to normal. Mysterious Girlfriend X manages to entirely avoid this. Not only is there a noticeable absence of bad romance anime gags and clich\u00e9s, but just when you think you know where the series is going it completely surprises you. What is astounding is that it actually feels like a realistic relationship despite the whole psychic drool thing. I\u2019m serious! Akira wants them to be public with their romance, but Urabe is shy about it. Akira wants to advance their physical relationship faster than Urabe is comfortable with, so this leads to a believable quarrel and gradual compromise. The relationship between Urabe and Akira has ups and downs like any real relationship, but grows stronger as both realize what it means to be in a long term romance and how they must now always consider their partner\u2019s desires, hopes, and feelings.  Romance anime typically either move WAY too slow to keep a status quo, or they move far too fast and characters are having sex 5 minutes after meeting. Mysterious Girlfriend X has a gradual and satisfying romance that feels more organic. \\n\\n\r\nThe final element that makes Mysterious Girlfriend a quality romance anime is the characters. Urabe is indeed highly unusual, but besides the whole psychic powers thing feels like a person you could meet in real life. She doesn\u2019t really fit into an anime archetype of \u201cTsundere\u201d or \u201cYandare\u201d. Instead she seems to exhibit traits you would expect from someone with Aspergers or \u201cAutistic tendencies\u201d. She is extremely aloof, anti-social, dislikes physical contact, and has a very hard time making friends. She doesn\u2019t understand social norms and has gotten to the point where she has stopped caring. However, she is warm and caring to the few people close to her. She has a good heart, but has a hard time relating to other people and forming meaningful bonds. Akira like many romance lead is the clumsy and awkward male virgin. However, he is far more realistic and relatable than most. Akira doesn\u2019t put up with comedic abuse. He actually wants to get more physically intimate and is understandably frustrated by Urabe\u2019s extreme reluctance. He isn\u2019t an abusive asshole who forces himself on Urabe, but he also isn\u2019t a stepping stone or whipping boy. He\u2019s a fairly realistic teenager going through his first serious relationship.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nVery solid opening and closing. Most of the soundtrack is quite good and really fits the atmosphere\u2026 then there is Urabe\u2019s theme. WTF were they thinking?! The track is called \u201cDream\u201d and I think they were attempting to instill a sense of mystery and awe. Instead we got creepy, sinister, circus music. Why? Just why?!\\n\\n\r\n Here is Urabe\u2019s Leitmotif: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5YRokOjrdY   \\n\\n\r\nHere is the theme to the shitty IT miniseries from 1990: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC4zgfVj-K4  \\n\\n\r\n Basically the same shit. If anything, Urabe\u2019s theme is creepier.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nNow since this is a series with a WEIRD premise it needed to find an animation studio that gives zero fucks and is willing to draw some weird shit. Unfortunately, that means it really had only a couple choices: Studio ARMS or Hoods Entertainment. Ultimately, they went with Hoods, who is best known for the brother/sister fucking hentai Aki no Sora and breastfeeding stupidity that is Seikon no Qwasar. Hoods is\u2026not exactly known as a maker of quality titles and this really hurts the perception of Mysterious Girlfriend  X . Basically the same way that being an ARMS title hurts Elfen Lied or Kurosawa\u2019s Runaway Train was completely overlooked or slammed because Cannon Films produced it. While most of the art and animation is fine, I do have one gripe. We are told over and over again that we are looking at \u201cdrool\u201d or \u201csaliva\u201d but it is far too thick, viscous, and green. Hoods decided to draw phlegm or a \u201cloogie\u201d, which makes the series WAY grosser than it needed to be. This choice is a self-inflicted injury that wasn\u2019t present in the manga and serves only to repel most viewers away. God damn it Hoods Entertainment!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X is not a perfect series, but it is still heavily underrated and gets way more shit than it deserves. This is the only anime I\u2019ve ever seen where the back of the DVD cover for the English release actually bashes it. The entire back cover is basically \u201cLOL, can you BELIEVE this stupid shit!\u201d I live by a used DVD store and I\u2019ve purchased a LOT of shitty anime to watch with friends. Here are some anime I own with only positive comments on the DVD cover: Mad Bull 34, Plastic Little, Garzey\u2019s Wing, Kite, Legend of Lemnear, and even fucking Dark Cat!\\n\\n\r\nThe tragedy in this is that many highly talented people worked on Mysterious Girlfriend X and actually put effort into it. There is a legitimately good anime buried underneath the thin outer layer of mucus and scorn. The series director is Ayumu Watanabe, who also directed Space Brothers. You know, one of the highest rated series on all of MAL. The series writer is Hitomi Mieno, who also wrote Arakawa Under the Bridge and of course Gintama. The guy that did the storyboard is the same guy that did the storyboards for Shinsekai Yori , parts of One Piece, and Penguindrum. I highly recommend checking out this series if you are looking for underrated, buried treasure.\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever found an anime that \"SALIVA\" or \"DROOL\" is become a proof to the bonds of love? if you're havent, then maybe you could try Nazo no Kanojo X.\r\nNazo no Kanojo or Mysterious Girlfriend in english is not your typical comedy - romance anime, why? First of all, if you're an easy people to puke because of something weird then maybe this anime is not for you, since this anime will have SO MANY scenes that will make several people go puke. like i said before, your first impression while watching this anime is DROOL, yeah, i am not kidding. but dont takethis drool is something that revolting, but take it as the PROOF of the couple's bond.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nThe story began with Tsubaki Akira, our normal main character that unexpectedly meet with a weird girl, i mean REALLY weird. that girl was Urabe Mikoto. she was transfered into Tsubaki's school, she is known as the weirdo because yeah... she is weird in many ways. Later, in afternoon after school, Tsubaki found Urabe in classroom and still sleep. without any ecchi or dirty minds Tsubaki wakes Mikoto, after Mikoto leaves he found a pool of DROOL in her table. And surprisingly, Mikoto without any particular reason lick the drool. A few days later he become sick and Mikoto comes to his house and cure him with a weird ways, and after that again, he date with her.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime story is very unique or maybe the uniquest one that i've ever watched in another rom-com series. Maybe you will think this anime will about lovey dovey, that they will kissing, flirting, or maybe make out. if you think that way, then you're VERY WRONG. what makes this story interesting is Urabe Mikoto, she is not your normal-type-moe girl. I am not gonna spoil it on how weird this girl was. anyway, The execution of this anime in the storyplot os really good. i mean, at the way they end each episode was really amazing. Usually they put some cute and heartwarming scenes in the end of each episodes. and with this strategy, they really attract (especially me) the viewer to keep watching this. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes, this anime maybe will make you bored if you're not into a romance story. Since this anime is more focussing on the way how they develops their drool-lationship and moreover, this is not-your-all-anime since some of people will probably said disgusting with \"droll\" as the main themes. But however they said, i still found this anime is romantic and pretty enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that will comes to my mind while trying this anime is 90s. I guess several people will saying the same things since this anime art was like the anime from 90s. Small eyes, the contour of the hairstyle, and even the character design Its kinda rare to see this kind of art especially in nowdays, while other anime are trying to improve their art (like SHAFT's anime which have an amazing art) but this anime take a risk to use an old style, but does it bad? No! its really suitable with the story itself and moreover, its like they're bringing you back to the 90s, nostalgic. When i thought this art will irritate me with their old style,but it didnt happen and surprisingly i really fell in love with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe background is pretty much increasing the atmosphere of romance feels. like when in the afternoon, the sunset is pretty beautiful and when it adds with romance scenes, it feels like the scenes is getting more romantic. The coloring in this anime are also pretty colorful and bright. They really representing the mood in the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nFrom the sound section, there was nothing special in this. though The OP and the ED wasnt so bad, in fact it was really good, when i hear the OP and the ED, the feel of 90s really exquisite, especially the OP \"Koi no Orchestra\" by Ayako Yoshitani which is also voicing Urabe in this anime. Piano and violin is really dominant in this song. The song itself is really catchy and easy listening and moreover its really suitable with the anime which is focussing on the romance thing. For the seiyuu, they have done well with their roles. Especially for Yoshitani Ayaka. she hasnt voicing any anime characters beside Urabe but surprisingly she is good and really suits with the Urabe personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nThe last, Character. The focus on this anime was between the couples, Urabe Mikoto and Tsubaki Akira. since this anime was focussing on these, the character development between two of them is really touching, there was sadness, happiness, jealous, and anything like that, furthermore In my opinion this one is what makes this anime is so appealing, i cant deny that i have fallen in love with Mikoto, you can said she is weird but sometimes she shows her cute side (Until now i dont know what kind of dere she is, i think this one is a new dere type). and for Tsubaki, none to much to say for this boy, he is kind and easy to nervous around the girls. but of course he wont be a main character if he doesnt have any special nature, and for him is loyalty.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nWell, many people said this anime was weird and feel so old, i dont deny if many people saying that. but i am sure what they said are cannot be accounted, since i am sure they havent see the whole episodes. and for those who are saying that, boy you have missed an amazing unique romance anime. Giving it a 8 because this anime is not especially for all, but for me, this anime is pretty much enjoyable and really fun ride to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, If you're looking for something special and bored with usual romance anime, then this anime is for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S : Feedbacks are welcome*",

            "content": "This show is unique to say the least. I was expecting something f**ked up and weird, but I must admit I was expecting something more on the comedy side for some reason. Not that I dislike how f**ked up and serious this show actually is, I actually think I love it even more that way. I was expecting some crazy ecchi with just some original characters, but it doesn\u2019t look anyway like that at all.\r\nThe first thing that caught my attention with this anime is how old the animations looked. It had this grainy and low definition look to it, It was kind of aminor disappointment. But at the same time, the animation and style reminded me of some other special show like Paprika or Serial Experiment Lain, so it did add to the seinen and dreamy style of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that caught my attention was this artistic and seinen way to present the story. There is this weird atmosphere in the show, were it looks like everything is just a little bit too normal to be real. There is this calm and constant feeling that everything you are watching at the moment is important. Because every dialogue and actions are so slow, we can really appreciate the feelings behind them.\\n\\n\r\nNext thing that caught my attention was obviously the characters. They are unique to say the least. While Urabe is quite rapidly labelled as a weirdo, I don\u2019t think Tsubaki is any better. Who in their right mind would taste the saliva of someone else on a whim like that? No wonder he got sick in the first place, even if it was not love sickness. But let us return to our characters, Tsubaki might look like a regular guy, but he has some pretty weird and colorful dreams, not only that, he fell in love at first sight with a girl whose face looked retarded and she had drool on her cheek while looking at him with a confused look.  I think Urabe isn\u2019t the only one who has some mental issues.\\n\\n\r\nBut talking of the mysterious girlfriend in question, Urabe is a lost cause, she hear voices while she sleeps in class and proceed to laugh her ass off and roll on the floor laughing. She is so antisocial that even when everyone tried to talk to her and be compassionate towards her, she still managed to avoid all the attention and stay lonely at her desk. She spent her time sleeping during lunch break, so I wonder if that girl ever actually eat and while it was only revealed in the preview for next episode, we also know that she carries around scissor in her panties to cut paper. If anything, this girl sure has a personality of her own.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am positively surprised and impressed by this show, I was not expecting something so mysterious and serious from characters that are that special. I will most definitively watch this show and cover it. I think it might fit exactly in the kind of show I love and dream of.\\n\\n\r\nPossibility of Watching: High",

            "content": "Mysterious Girlfriend X. What hooked me to watch this was, of course, the drool tasting. This series made me more open-minded to watch romance-ecchi, since this was ecchi but has a good storyline.\r\nWhat makes this anime different from others is its uniqueness. Drool as bond is not something a couple usually has, and drool tasting is something you can't see everyday. Now, on to the details.\r\nThis review may contain spoilers.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nHonestly, after seeing \"ecchi\" in the tags, I thought this anime was about sex, but man I was wrong. The story is surprisingly really good. It's not based on sex, though you can sometimes seeAkira loosing control, since he's in puberty and he has a girlfriend. The story is about how Akira, live his lovelife with his mysterious girlfriend, Urabe. Urabe's not your ordinary girlfriend. In fact, she's one of the weirdest girls I've seen in anime. But the plot is solid. There are scenes that made me emotional, laugh, and surprised.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode, I thought that the art sucked, but in the long run I realized that the art contributed to the uniqueness of the anime. It's kind of an old-style looking anime, comparable to Ranma 1/2 or Dragonball Z, but there were looks that I really liked. I liked how the following characters were drawn:\\n\\n\r\nOka, Urabe (with her other hairstyle), and Youko.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis rating might be a bit biased, since I'm a sucker to Violin, Cello, and Piano music. The producers did a pretty good job in providing background music, since the BGM matches the atmosphere of a particular scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy expectations were met (and blown away) by Urabe's character. Since the title of this anime was \"Mysterious Girlfriend X\", I really expected that the female protagonist should be weird, and Urabe's character was right on the money. Other characters like Oka, Ueno, and Akira portrayed the \"high-school student\" role very well, especially when it comes to love and dating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really, really enjoyed this anime. The drool thing was very amusing. Made me laughed a lot. This series also made me think and reflect deeply on situations related to love and dating since I never thought of drool to become a couple's bond.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X really reached my \"must-watch list\". I enjoyed this series a lot. I recommend this to anyone, especially those who just started dating.",

            "content": "Mysterious Girlfriend X is a show that\u2019s pretty icky. There\u2019s no getting around it. As a viewer, one always has options, one can always make decisions. So, if you\u2019re planning on watching this show, you have to get past the hurdle that is the synopsis of this show. A high school student one day discovers the new transfer student asleep at her desk after school. After she hurriedly leaves, he sees a small pool of her drool on the desk, and for some unfathomable reason, he puts his finger in said drool, and takes this finger into his mouth. He licks her drool.\r\nWithout getting intothe other bizarre things about this anime (the main character\u2019s proclivity for randomly laughing, the scissors she keeps in her panties, etc.), the drool issue is the most major one to contend with. Part of this piece will be about hopefully putting \u201cthe drool issue\u201d into a larger context regarding what this show\u2019s actually doing. It\u2019s fairly obvious that the show is on some level about how love, at one point or another, must lead to intimacy. The protagonists of our show, because they\u2019re weird, don\u2019t take the usual path in these matters. They\u2019re inching toward intimacy, but they do it in their own particular way. Mysterious Girlfriend X, in its own weird way, celebrates the time of our lives where we groped and felt around and decided what worked and didn\u2019t work for us, what felt right; it\u2019s a show about our sexual exploration, and how it\u2019s a necessary aspect of relationships.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Tsubaki, our male protagonist, tastes Urabe\u2019s drool, he just knows he has to be with her. It\u2019s not a question of psychology or of motivation; his body dictates it. After not tasting her drool for a couple of weeks, he\u2019s actually bedridden and sick. It\u2019s only after Urabe shows up and gives him her drool that he recovers. So he asks her out. She says yes. The reason behind this is simple \u2013 he had a reaction to her drool, and to her that means he\u2019s special. Every day after school, in order to stave off sickness, Urabe sticks a finger in her mouth and lets Tsubaki suck on it for a bit. It\u2019s a moment of an awkward physical intimacy; and, I think, an undeniably erotic moment for both of them. Later on, we find out that Urabe\u2019s drool can also serve as a communication tool (Urabe can find out about Tsubaki\u2019s dreams and they can even find out what the other is feeling because of it). This daily ritual is no different than kissing before saying goodbye.\\n\\n\r\nI think if the drool itself were animated in a more tasteful way there wouldn\u2019t be as much resistance to this show. Hoods Entertainment, the company who made it, do the series no favors when they choose to animate the drool, as being not at all dissimilar to other bodily fluids. The drool lingers, drips from fingers, forms puddles; in the op, it even splashes like we\u2019re suddenly in a hentai or something. It\u2019s distracting. In Mysterious Girlfriend X, the exchange of drool comes to represent other possible exchanges of bodily fluids. The act is both literal and metaphorical. This is really what we are talking about, isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki and Urabe both understand where their relationship will end up. Every time they exchange drool, they come to realize the fact of it. This is where we\u2019re heading, this is what\u2019s going to happen. But many of the 13 episodes are about the slow crawl toward that goal (in this series, that goal is unfulfilled). One episode finds Urabe going over to visit Tsubaki wearing nothing but a coat, because apparently this is a normal remedy for the common cold. Like Junko Nakano\u2019s Chisa x Pon (though nowhere near as explicit), the series maps out how over time, they become more comfortable with each other. Whereas in the first few episodes, Urabe almost kills Tsubaki when he tries to hug her; near the end, it\u2019s Urabe who demands that she be hugged.  There\u2019s even a moment later on where in a fit of blind passion, Tsubaki licks Urabe\u2019s ear, and she\u2019s completely overwhelmed by the sensation. Although this sense of experimentation and play is lighthearted in the show, I believe the show takes absolutely serious the drives of the main characters. Tsubaki has nightly dreams about Urabe where they dance in some strange circus-like town (not hard to understand what\u2019s happening there), and Urabe herself often finds herself blushing and testing her own limits regarding what she\u2019ll do (one episode finds her stripping completely down and letting Tsubaki lick her drool while his eyes are closed). The way they approach the issue is unorthodox, sure, but everyone\u2019s different. The show even provides a foil couple to accentuate how different they are.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the show is relatively straightforward in its depiction of teenage confusion, hormones and love, there\u2019s one really interesting strand that I haven\u2019t mentioned. Tsubaki and his friend, Ueno, both get girlfriends during the show, but they insist on keeping this a secret. Whereas in other shows, there\u2019d usually be a scene where everyone whispers about the new couple, in this show our main characters never acknowledge their girlfriends in any special way while they\u2019re at school. While I don\u2019t think this is done for any real reason by the characters, it betrays an uneasiness about their own sexual development. I couldn\u2019t help thinking that they were hiding their relationships because it meant that they were growing up, that they were embarrassed by their sexual curiosity/progress/etc. And, yeah, it\u2019s completely embarrassing. During this time in their lives, we have no idea what we\u2019re doing. Tsubake and Urabe may understand the mechanics of where this is all going, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they have any idea of what it means, of what it looks like, of what it feels like; and not knowing, looking foolish while you figure out, is completely embarrassing. It\u2019s easier to pretend you don\u2019t have a girlfriend, because then you can keep that side of yourself completely separate from people\u2019s image of you. The only one who can see you at your most vulnerable, most ridiculous, state is your Mysterious Girlfriend; and only she knows how much her drool turns you on.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nSaliva is a basic necessity for most animals. It provides humans with a way to break down food, aids in protecting our teeth, and allows us to have the ability to swallow easily. It's so ingrained in our daily lives that, for the most part, we pay it no mind. However, once it leaves the mouth, it usually goes from a friendly companion to a disgusting byproduct. In short, while saliva is seen as a benefactor to our everyday lives, drool is not. But this anime, Mysterious Girlfriend X, would like you to think otherwise.\r\nSTORY\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X beginsrather cliche but then takes a rather interesting turn. Urabe is a new transfer student who gets close to no one and is usually found sleeping. One day, for whatever reason, our MC Tsubaki tastes the drool left behind on her desk.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as premises go, X certainly stands up there as one of the more unique. Essentially, the connections that are established between the characters are based on the drool that they consume. In a metaphorical sense, drool represents love. Drool is this liquid, slimy, and foreign substance that isn't particularly appealing to someone unless that person desires it to be. Love isn't a liquid, but it certainly \"flows\" like one, cascading through and between people, taking shape in whatever form it has to. It's not particularly slimy, but it manifests itself as these rather strange feelings that are quite unlike anything else. And while we say we know what love is, it's definitely foreign to those of us who have yet to give or receive it in a deeply emotional way.\\n\\n\r\nI could go a step further and say that the pair of scissors Urabe is so fond of is a physical representation of her emotions. She hides behind it when she feels scared, threatened, or jealous, are used with tactical precision depending on the situation, and are worn \"on her sleeve\" despite her appearance. Maybe I can make another leap and argue that the X in the title isn't the scissors, but is instead the x-chromosome that, like love, is \"shared\" between Tsubaki and Urabe.\\n\\n\r\nThe last one is probably too much of a stretch. But here's my point; where is it appropriate to draw the line between simply making connections and discovering the true intentions of the writer and producers? What I've said before may sound pretty good, but if its just some reviewer's attempt at making the message sound nice then that isn't being fair to the anime in question.\\n\\n\r\nLet's diverge for just a moment and talk about the more obvious. X does something quite well, and that is demonstrating a mature relationship. Whether it be through drool or through words, both Tsubaki and Urabe almost always \"communicate\" in a respectful and realistic manner. There aren't any major misunderstandings, no one is fumbling around for words, and neither of them act particularly wishy-washy in the way they interact. Simply put, they are a believable couple.\\n\\n\r\nTying this back in with the first few remarks, is it fair to say that X's overall theme is that drool is a lot like love? I believe so. While one is a physical entity and the other is a spiritual feeling, what this show is trying to get at is that the premise, like love itself, doesn't have to make sense. It's this strange occurrence that often pops up out of nowhere, usually when we least expect it. And while it may seem embarrassing to deal with in the beginning, over time everything more or less \"drips\" into place.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhen first looking at Mysterious Girlfriend X, the phrase \"don't judge a book by its cover\" comes to mind. From the outside it looks rather old or outdated. While these descriptions aren't entirely accurate, they do have some basis. Both the character designs and the locations are nothing extravagant. Rather, they appear to be something taken from the late 90's instead of the early 2010's.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to actual animation, there isn't much attention given to it outside of two areas: Urabe's furious cutting and the drool. The former has at least a pretty cool effect attached to it where she seemingly moves faster than sound. The latter, understandably being the focal point, sees much glistening, movement, and fluidity.\\n\\n\r\nOne small note is that on a handful of occasions, the animation was \"wrong.\" In other words, things happening with the left hand suddenly were happening with the right hand. This may be nit-picky, but catching it in more than one instance is definitely something against the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X focuses mostly on two characters, Tsubaki the boyfriend and Urabe the girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki is particularly interesting for his competency, his straight-forward behavior, and his willingness to trust Urabe. At certain points in the show, he may let his feelings or desires somewhat get the better of him, but instead of finding this perverted or possessive, it seemed rather natural. He's a high school boy, with the first girlfriend he's ever had, sharing a connection with someone on a deep level. Of course he is going to want to embrace Urabe, feel her, or keep her for himself. As a character, it felt like I was watching an adolescent boy experience his first true love. In short, as his sister would say, \"he's at that age.\"\\n\\n\r\nUrabe most definitely earns the moniker of mysterious. Quiet, kind, and seemingly simple, it's revealed quite quickly that this isn't necessarily the case. Her hair hides her face, she always carries with her a pair of scissors, and her drool has a supernatural power. At certain times, she is asked why she is like this. Her answer, while small, speaks volumes: \"That's just the way I am.\" This offhand and non-explanatory comment is further evidence for the ideas presented previously. Love isn't something that is easily describable, nor is it something that needs to be. It's this feeling that is born out of nowhere, often times without a specific moment to attach to. Nobody questions why Urabe is the way she is, and her character demonstrates this same approach towards love.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for Mysterious Girlfriend X is rather generic. It doesn't attempt anything new, and while the vocalist does have small moments at the beginning and the end it isn't enough to warrant recognition.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED suffers the same fate, but is probably worse both as a song and with the visuals attached to them. The song itself is \"relaxing\" in its beat and gives off a feeling of being mellow. This coincides with the visuals, which are rather unappealing not because of the drool but because they are simple still shots without much life.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mostly forgettable except for the circus track that plays. It's most often used during the dream sequences and when Urabe is being her usual weird self. I thought the piece fit well with the show's general air of strangeness and mysteriousness.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting has no notable mentions to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen first delving into this one, I will admit that the drool aspect was pretty gross. \"But Banjo, things like kissing involve saliva and sex has even more fluids involved!\" That's true, and I agree, but I think its the context of the situation. I would like to believe most couples aren't offering their drool-covered finger on a daily basis. As an onlooker, that just seems rather silly. It took an episode or two, but eventually me being perturbed by it went away.\\n\\n\r\nWhat came as a surprise was the show's \"Ecchi\" tag. It's not in your face about it for the most part, but there are shots of the girls involved being naked, dreams of playing with breasts, and a few panty-shots here or there. For the most part, the eroticism is supposed to be derived from the eating of the drool and the sucking of the fingers. Minus that, the fan-service overall seemed quite tame given the genre it fell under.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the anime is a romance story. It's definitely not your typical one, but there is blushing, stuttering, and lovey-dovey moments abound. Tsubaki and Urabe's relationship is almost too real, which is most likely why they are not often talked about. Besides the drool they share, what they have is so common it just doesn't standout. That's not a bad thing, it just makes them less memorable overall.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Mysterious Girlfriend X starts off with a peculiar premise, dealing mostly in drool. But by the show's conclusion, Urabe, her relationship with Tsubaki, and the show's final message are no longer mysterious. Instead, they are all quite apparent for any fan of anime to see.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, drool is love surrounding a mature couple\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, old art style with boring actual animation and a few hiccups\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, \"believable\" high school kids\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, bland OP, ED, soundtrack, and VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, quite the weird romance story\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "If you've got this far, you know the show's synopsis. Your standard anime transfer student doesn't quite fit in, as expected, but due to a series of events ranging from ordinary to a bit weird, the show's main character ends up falling for the weird transfer student. All this made possible due to the strange effect her drool has on him, creating a bond between the two that makes him physically ill if he goes without it.\r\nWhile this may not sound all that interesting, and perhaps down right gross with the drool aspect, Mysterious Girlfriend X stands out as one of the most unique andcharming romance anime's I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to beat around the bush - the drool part is a bit disgusting to begin with, even if it's generally limited to licking it off fingers. The first episode serves to set up the circumstances and plot of the rest of the show, and while it's mildly intriguing to begin with, it's not until the end of the episode that you get the first glimpse of the more honest approach the show takes with young and/or first loves.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first hint that MGX is going to be different from most other Anime. Love and relationships with teens is usually dealt with in love triangles and harems/reverse harems, with the entire show mostly having unresolved sexual tension for either Japanese cultural reasons or just because it's the done thing. A lot of these and other relationship tropes get subverted throughout the show, and it doesn't get preachy about the romanticised pre-conceptions of love in media either.\\n\\n\r\nYou don't have to wait long for any of this to start though, as the second episode is when the story really gets going. By the third you'll probably have gotten used to the drool aspect, and by then you'll be hooked. The drool is just a mechanism for the two main characters to understand each others feelings, both emotionally and physically, and aids them in the developments of their love life. Understanding is a big theme in the series, and leads to some genuinely tender moments.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just about the two characters getting to know each other, the viewer themselves is in on the process of getting to know the protagonists and the meaning of the show. While Akira Tsubaki, our eyes into the world, is portrayed as a fairly normal and relatable guy, Mikoto Urabe, his girlfriend, is a mystery. As the name of the anime suggests. However, while she has the almost supernatural drool, an odd manner, and is freakishly adept with a pair of scissors she keeps in her panties, it all seems like an allegory for the mystery and unknown of being in love for the first time.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a bit of ecchi in the series as well - with the two main girls drawn as being quite busty. I honestly think this is commentary on how teenage boys see the world, and how love can sometimes alter your perceptions of your partners. Which in this case is shown by giving the girls big tits, as you do. The art style in general though is a little retro, which fits the atmosphere of the show a lot better than spindly limbs or soft moe features.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the manga, it's usually very spot on, and any small changes made to the story, whether they're chronological or characters reactions, mostly better the flow of events. Due to the short nature of the anime, and the fact the manga is still ongoing, some stories have been dropped or blended together. However nothing feels rushed, forced, or out of place, and it at least means there's probably enough material for a second season if it gets that far.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few words that have been tossed around in this review that do manage to sum up the show better than others - that it is a charming, sweet, honest look at young and first loves. I hope they make more after the OVA.",

Although it comes off a little weird with the drool bond i think that it is just something you have to see as a beautiful bond between two people. The creativity of this bond is art. The Romance and Comedy are a great mix as well, there wasn't a point were the one overpowered the other it was a smooth mix. The way the two dreamed about each other was really cute and reminds me of myself. The dream world was so crazy and wonderful it broughteverything fun into one small town. Another awesome thing about this anime was the music! The music was perfect for every scene or tense moment. I now after finishing this show find myself humming the dream theme haha. The characters were also great. There was only 4 main characters so you got to know them pretty well! Plus Urabe and Tsubaki are such a wonderful couple with such strong feelings for each other but so little experience and differences they don't know how to show affection besides the swap of drool they share! I dunno i really enjoyed this anime and i hope anyone who reads this does too! Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "The whole concept of exchanging saliva is gross. I\u2019ll say it. But to be fair, the story and the interactions of the other characters are good enough that most can bypass this. After a while, I noticed that I cringed less and less every time I had to see the two love birds put their drool in each other\u2019s mouths.\r\n       At times the show dragged. There were a couple episodes that really seemed to do a whole lot of nothing. Overall, I\u2019m glad that it only ran for 13 episodes. Thepacing over the course of the whole series was alright though.\\n\\n\r\n        As for the comedic value, it really depends on your personal tastes. As with most comedies, especially in the anime industry, it\u2019s very subjective. It either syncs up with you or it doesn\u2019t. With this particular series, you\u2019ll need to give it at least three episodes to determine whether or not it falls within your personal taste.\\n\\n\r\n         But even if the humor isn\u2019t your thing, the story is still relatively interesting. I found myself really wanting to find out how the relationship between Mikoto and Akira would turn out. There\u2019s quite a few surprises along the way, and although they didn\u2019t end it the way the manga progressed, it was still acceptable whether you read the manga or not. If you\u2019ve read the manga, give it a shot. They aren\u2019t far off from it. If not, it\u2019s still a decent pick if you want a romantic comedy with a weird concept. Just don\u2019t think about it too much. If you do, it\u2019ll just end up bothering you the whole way through and at that point it\u2019s not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall i give this show 6/10, it took me a while to get into it, and at times I found myself getting an episode or two behind, prioritizing several other shows. It\u2019s not horrible for what it is. It just didn\u2019t have the \u201cwow\u201d effect on me.\\n\\n\r\n           If you don\u2019t like the animation style, and cannot get past the saliva concept, go ahead and pass on this one. Also, as always, if romantic comedy isn\u2019t what you are looking for, this is not the right pick.",

            "content": "If you can somehow, in some way that is not life threatening, remove your stomach from the rest of your body and sit right next to you, then this anime is a bizarre treat. . . Or at least I wanted to say that. . . .\r\nIt's quite a feat to be both an intriguing and somewhat fresh look at the highschool romance genre and physically sickening at the same time, Nazo no Kanojo X is a rare case of doing something different yet doing something that immediately pushes you away, literally.\r\nIt's starts out with Akira Tsubaki wondering about how his first girlfriend will belike, and that's when Mikoto Urabe comes in. Mikoto is the new transfer student at Akira's class and is far from being an average and typical school kid, from randomly bursting out laughing in the middle of class to sleeping face flat on her school desk in between classes, she easily becomes what the class now considers her, a straight up weirdo. Then one day. . .  Why do I feel queasy. . . .\\n\r\nOkay, I need to get this done and over with. This is the ultimate deciding factor of the show, one day as school ends for the day, Akira finds Mikoto asleep and unaware of class ending for that day. He wakes her up, with drool slowly pouring down her mouth, and proceeds to leave leaving a wide eyed Akira staring at what she left behind. . . and for some reason. . . Licks it up. . . .\\n\\n\r\nNow here's the thing, that's disgusting, Even though the anime does start off showing that Akira has some kind of fixation on liquid in general, it still churns my stomach in a way that tells me that watching this isn't a good idea for my physical health. But I tried to be open minded enough to almost look past that, especially since the show really is delightful in an offbeat way and shows it can be really something different. . . But, damn. . . It's an entry hazard of epic proportions.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is also a shame too, visually the anime is fascinating. It goes for an old school look and the imagery is bizarre, a bizarrely delightful kind that can hook you in alone. Heck the music is more busy focusing on the oddity of the show and wants you to ignore the umm, drool, and instead want you to pay attention the strange and weird (Also, Mitoko's voice actor is a really unique choice by, instead of a typical high pitched voice, it's a lot deeper than you'd expect).\\n\\n\r\nWhich is married by unexpected (Though in hindsight is a bit cliched) turns in the development of the central characters. Akira becomes quite addicted to Mikoto's... saliva to the point of having withdrawn symptoms and requires more of Mikoto's. . . Saliva on a regular basis. And by the end of the first episode, the shows keeps up with it's promise of it's title and they become a couple. . . right after Mikoto. . . UGh, vomits a pool of saliva (I'm over exaggerating of course) over the sudden and different way she wants Akira to confess to her, with talks of who and who is still a virgin. . . It's just her way of being surprised. . . .\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'm not going to blame anyone on wanting to past this up and never look back, especially with how the episode ends. But it's totally something out there and different with a genre that loves to stick with the usual cliches. This is a show that's trying to do something different, but one of it's methods is a clear deal breaker.\\n\r\nA deal breaker, that honestly, would make this anime a whole deal better if the drool was never a part of the premise. In the second episode there are already hints of the plot starting to get loose at the stitches. Clearly we hear that Mikoto's drool isn't anything special, yet she produces a special kind of drool that, umm, gets you horny? It's something along those lines, and it's one of two things that are immediately pointless. The other being Mikoto's hobby(?), keeping a pair of scissors in her underwear for occasions when she cuts up paper into those paper cut out ornaments. I can hardly see where that \"talent\" will have any importance, other than to flash Mikoto's panties (Though she mentions that she doesn't mind Akira seeing them, at least she doesn't get all embarrassed about). Trying to do something different is fine, but having pointless quirks isn't a way to do it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you can manage not to lose your lunch (Terrible way to put it, ugh, I apologize for the bad imagery), then Nazo no Kanojo X might end up being something totally strange in a delightful way, or become a new way to over sexualize something and go down a bizarro path into obscurity (The ending theme song kinda fetishises drool coming down a girls mouth), unfortunately I will never see where it'll lead up to.\\n\\n\r\nClearly this anime requires an acquired taste so to speak. The romance itself is very competent but the premise and subject matter however completely holds the anime back from the part of it that deserves praise, but with each episode more and more focus goes towards the drool (Like for example: Mikoto can \"transfer\" her feelings via saliva, the underlining purpose is great as it invokes a bond you can see between the main couple that needs no words. . . But it's revolting on the surface and becomes less \"special\" with the introduction of another person who's saliva is also \"special\").\\n\\n\r\nEither way, you'll need to stomach the premise out before going any further, I wish you good luck because it had me beat. . . Now excuse while I go grab some tums or something. . . Ugh. . . .",

            "content": "Wait\u2026 Did that guy just lick her drool? Why man, why you do this. \r\nUpon first look one might be turned away from this anime. The anime style is a bit older, having being published in 2012. And the synopsis of the anime doesn\u2019t give it justice for the amazing anime it actually is. In my opinion, this anime was just shy of becoming a masterpiece. It is a simple romance anime with a strange theme to go around it. And while some parts of the anime are shocking and seems strange at first, they become a core part of the story and becomes keyin how the main characters interact and the progression of the story. I really did get drawn into the anime and while the anime is a bit old, I thought I would do my best to do a review so I can share my thoughts on the anime 5 years later. \\n\\n\r\n*BEFORE WE GO FURTHER INTO THE REVIEW - WARNING *Minor Spoilers* Let's continue :) \\n\\n\r\nSTORY \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start this review by looking at the story. \\n\\n\r\nUrabe Mikoto is a strange 16 old girl who transfers to the same school as Tsubaki Akira. In the classroom she sits right next to Tsubaki and she is labeled someone who is weird by the entire class. She sleeps during most of the day at her desk and sometimes randomly erupts in a fit of laughter. One day Tsubaki returns to the classroom after school to see Urabe asleep at her desk. Once she wakes up, he sees her face for the first time and says she is cute. Once she leaves to go home Tsubaki sees a puddle of her drool on the desk. Curious to know what it tastes like, he picks some up and licks it - to find that her drool is very sweet. This drool starts a \"bond\" between these characters and they begin to form a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nMy first thoughts of watching the anime I didn\u2019t know how it would play out. As I continued watching the anime I saw the creators of the anime use the bond of drool in a very interesting way and it no longer became weird to see. Something I loved in this anime was seeing Tsubaki and Urabe exchange drool. In the anime there was also an added supernatural element where they could express feelings, thoughts and even sensation through drool. This allowed the two characters - Tsubaki and Urabe - who were in love, to explore each other and understand each other. It was interesting to see the bond between these two characters through drool and that helped them develop a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, in the anime Urabe falls over and hurts her knee, when Urabe gives Tsubaki her drool his knee also begins to hurt. So in some supernatural way, they have a bond and are connected by drool. \\n\\n\r\nThis bond of drool becomes the basis of the story progression as the characters progress in their relationship and grow more deeply in love. At the heart of the story this anime is a romance anime. The romance is very simple: we see jealously, lust, love and the characters being possessive. This very simple romance story is great and is spiced up by the experience drool adds in the anime - making a very interesting anime with a story that pulls in the viewer and provides a very different experience than conventional romance anime. This story, it\u2019s ideas and how it\u2019s displayed in the anime are well crafted, so rightfully I say that the story was a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\\n\r\nNow the story had two main characters in it, there was Urabe Mikito and Tsubaki Akira. There are other supporting characters but today I\u2019ll just focus on those two. \\n\\n\r\nTsubaki Akira seems like an average Japanese high-schooler, he finds that Urabe\u2019s drool is very sweet. Other people who have tasted Urabe\u2019s drool did not have a reaction on the same level as Tsubaki. We see his love grow for this girl, we see him succumb to his libido, lust after his girlfriend and become possessive of her when she is noticed by other guys. Most people (wether or not you have been in a relationship before) will be able to understand this. This guy is simply a boy who is in love with a girl. Again we see this idea of a simple romance anime done right. And they really have, in the character of Tsubaki we see by his actions and thoughts. This is a guy in love. And because we can relate to that on some level we enjoy him as a character. \\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at Tsubaki\u2019s other half, and by that I mean let\u2019s talk about Urabe Mikito. Urabe is a mysterious girl. If I were to compare her to character in other anime, she similar in some ways to Rikka Takanashi from Chuunibyou. Urabe is mysterious, withdrawn and seemingly doesn\u2019t know how to reciprocate her feelings to Tsubaki. The bond of drool she has with Tsubaki allows her to convey her feelings, sensation, memories and dreams. This allows Urabe to connect with Tsubaki on a different level. By drool he can feel what she feels. And it\u2019s interesting to see the many different ways she expresses herself to Tsubaki by drool. I feel that this bond between them is a level of connection that I haven\u2019t seen in anime before. This is what spices the romance aspect of the anime, and the nature of Urabe as a character as someone who can express her love for Tsubaki through a bond of drool is something so unique, cute and unconventional - yet is easily understood and meaningful to both Tsubaki and Urabe. \\n\\n\r\nSo my final thoughts are - for a romance anime - these characters are done simply and right. Made interesting by their bond of drool. \\n\\n\r\nART \\n\\n\r\nNow when it comes to art I wasn\u2019t really turned away by the idea of two people exchanging drool. The anime does a great job in making drool appetising. Drool is made out to be something like honey. It\u2019s a clear, thick and glistening liquid that apparently tastes sweet. Now because drool is one of the most important features in the anime - I think the studios did well to make drool appetising, otherwise the viewers would cringe every-time they exchanged drool. So the art in general was pretty consistent and good throughout the anime. It was good to see Urabe\u2019s character design, where her hair would mask most of her face so she would appear a bit more mysterious. Whenever her hair moved and we saw her eyes, we were able to see that she is actually quite cute. The art style of the scenery was just as good as the character design and captured that high school lifestyle quite well. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the anime was good, the opening and ending songs were catchy, the voice acting was great and they were able to express the characters feelings very well, when they were flustered, nervous or upset, we were able to understand. The voice actors performed to their characters well. Urabe was quite monotone and quiet, but spoke with confidence and with insecurity when the anime called for it. And tsubaki sounded like an average high school boy like in most other Japanese anime. Overall the sound was great, the voice acting, soundtrack, opening and ending. I honestly can\u2019t find fault in the sound for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT \\n\\n\r\nWhile writing this review, I\u2019m struggling to articulate how amazing this anime is. For a romance anime it did all the simple things right. For a school setting it portrayed the high school scene very well. And for a seinen anime, which is targeted at people my age I thought that the themes were interesting and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nSo what am I\u2019m trying to say? I\u2019m trying to say, if you love simple romance in anime then go watch this anime. The use of drool as a bond between the two main characters is not too strange, and I\u2019ve come to admire and value how drool has bonded them, especially the supernatural elements. It sounds weird coming from me, and of course it is just an anime. But I found it so interesting how drool was used to express feelings and sensation. It\u2019s a level of connection and deepness that is unique to this anime and distinguishes this anime from all other of it\u2019s genre. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed other anime like chuunbyou there are some similarities. \\n\\n\r\nBoth anime have a mysterious girl, who has a bond to the male protagonist, with a school setting. I definitely recommend you give this anime a go and see where it takes you. You\u2019ll be surprised after watching this anime how much you enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\n- Oh yeah, i'd give this anime a 9/10 :)",

            "content": "Now, now, now. I've been informed that certain people think that Nazo no Kanojo is ecchi. I've also been informed that a lot of people think it's bad that it has some originality. Well, guess what? It ain't so. Not often will you find an anime which revolves around drool, and this one did a damn fine job in doing so. So, you think that people sharing drool is nasty? Well, guess what, it is. Oh, but you watched only the first episode of the anime and took upon yourself to be an arse and immediatelly toss it aside? Well, guess what, not all animestart off great. There needs to be progress. Fluidity. And damn right I'm not gonna sit by idly while a perfectly good anime is being dissed.\\n\r\nNow, let me start this review right.\\n\r\nThe storyline is about a guy. Not your generic anime guy without a personality/cowardly/insanely courageous guy, no; it's about a simple highschool boy with his unique personality. And, by a game of chance, he tastes the spit(yeah, kinda gross, but come on, you do that when kissing as well) of a new girl in class. Now, that new girl is kind of weird. She starts laughing in the middle of class without apparent reason, she's not socialising with anyone, and half her face is covered with bangs. And yet, this guy falls in love with her. And then, in time, he realises he's hit the jackpot. Now, her personality has been presented extraordingly. She's unorthodox, and mysterious, and I think that this anime will need a season 2 in order to fully explain her backstory. Now, let me move on from the characters.\\n\r\nThe storyline progresses pretty slowly, as it should with highschoolers, but not slow enough to make you bored. It's reasonably paced and will make you anxious in about what'll happen in the next episode. I think they were low on budget, so they couldn't make more episodes, but if there were more, I'm damn sure they would be even more awesome.\\n\r\nThe animation reminded me of old style. I'm talking before 2000 animation here, and it invokes a wonderful feeling of nostalgy and familiarity. Not too much fanservice in my oppinion, just the right mix. Didn't register many flaws in it, really.\\n\r\nNow, the music. It's WONDERFUL. Track 04 from the anime, dream, is composed to reflect the mystique and the weird nature of Urabe (female protagonist). Not too thrilled about op and ed though, but thye're not bad. The songs playing during certain scenes in the anime are exceptionally fitting and they don't get boring quickly.\\n\r\nAnd, finally, my overall and my grade.\\n\r\nOverall, this is an unorthodox anime, with an original storyline and plot, and damn right it shouldn't be cast aside for trying something new. It has almost no mistakes/errors and it's pretty well made. It's one of the better romances I watched, and it differs from all others with it's unique way of presenting and developing the feelings of the characters; and that's why, this anime will make it in my top 5, along with GITS, NGE, Bakemonogatari and Toradora.\\n\r\nMy overall grade is 9, and I reccomend everyone to watch this anime, and not to give up in the first episode.\\n\r\nOver and out, please submit your feedback about my first review :D",

            "content": "It is safe to say that the core concept of which this anime is built on, the saliva mind meld, is pretty obscure, if not totally weird. However, although Nazo no Kanojo X goes to the absolute extremes of weirdness in some areas, it is perhaps the single most realistic in others.\r\nSo I'm not going to talk about the drool, that may be what drew me to Nazo no Kanojo X initially, but it is not what kept me watching, it is not the part that I love about this anime.\r\nMost romance anime, especially school-based romance, are ludicrously unrealistic. We see the tsundere girl, theweak, whingey guy. We see the noble, unfaltering cool guy and the submissive girl. Characters that are, for all intents and purposes, completely rooted in fiction. \\n\\n\r\nWorse yet, we're often presented with a female character that has absolutely no control over her sexual urges, once the MC breaks down a few walls. We are given characters who are offensive to men, offensive to women and completely unrealistic. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, we are often presented with a type of romance which can only exist in the anime world. A type of romance that, if we were to try to emulate in real life, would end in utter catastrophe. This is where Nazo no Kanojo X surpasses all others and stands up as the pinnacle of anime romance, in my book. The utter realism that it shows us.\\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of myself, or perhaps my former self, in Tsubaki. Everything he does, I can remember myself doing at-least once in a previous relationship. From flirting with an ex-crush, to not wanting others to see her after a new haircut, wanting her all to myself.\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki is a good reflection of most of the 'regular guys' in their first relationships. We, who watch anime and may not be the best at sports. We might not be the top of our class, but we know a thing or two. The regular guy.\\n\\n\r\nHe is a cacophony of contradictions. He has an inferiority complex, but believes he can get better. He is needy, but sometimes wants space away from Urabe. He is proud of his girlfriend, but in some ways ashamed. Love doesn't make sense, love is rife with contradictions and Tsubaki represents them perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nHe is almost like a mirror of myself, back in the day but, hopefully, not anymore. Don't get me wrong, he is very likable. He is not the whingey MC we're used to, he's not the asshole, he's not clueless. But that doesn't mean I necessarily want to be him.\\n\\n\r\nNow we see Urabe. Beautiful, shy, strange, kind, strong, talented, awkward, uncomfortable. There are so many words to describe Urabe, but submissive and reliant aren't some of them.\\n\\n\r\nShe represents the real girl. She gets sad when Tsubaki hurts her, very sad. But she doesn't get on her knees and beg. She gets turned on by Tsubaki, sure. But she isn't taken aback by sexual emotions, emotions which take complete control of her mind and body.\\n\\n\r\nShe's not quite an open book, but she's not mean - she's very kind. She's not submissive, dependent or a tsundere. She doesn't represent any of the offensive female characters we see in most romance anime. She is real.\\n\\n\r\nAnd best yet, although there are other love interests - there is no ridiculously unrealistic harem.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a girl, so I don't know what this anime gives them. But if you're a single guy wanting to know what real first relationships are like, watch this anime. If you're a needy, dependent, possessive guy in a relationship and want to see a reflection of all of your negative aspects; watch this anime. I wholeheartedly believe that Nazo no Kanojo X can teach you about love, about real love. An aspect which most romance anime fall completely flat on.",

            "content": "Ah yes. Mysterious Girlfriend X. When I heard that the manga was getting an anime adaption, I looked forward to seeing other people's reactions to the synopsis almost as much as the show itself. Perhaps a fair few WTFs amongst viewers who've never read the manga?\r\nThe story is simple. Boy encounters transfer girl. Boy deliberately tastes girl's drool on a desk. Boy falls in love with girl after that. Um, yeah. \r\nThe drool. If there's anything in this series that would turn off those who watch it, it'll obviously be the various saliva-swapping scenes. Personally, I don't think it's that bad. If it helps, thinkof it as an inevitable aspect of French kissing except without any lips touching. Nor tongues. Nor sensation. Well maybe sensation, in the form of the recipient of the drool experiencing the other's mood or feelings. Perhaps not as romantic though. But it's mostly down to individual tolerance levels for the things you find okay in anime; the same with fanservice, blood and gore, hentai, etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe series closely explores the slow-building but charming relationship between the main characters, inside and outside of high school. It's quite different to the romances found in other anime. After all, who shows affection by ripping up a photo of a previous crush as opposed to holding hands or kissing to start a relationship? And that's just one of many examples. Although it rarely feels out of place, there is some ecchi and fanservice present.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that Mikoto Urabe is weird would be a huge understatement. At times in her relationship she just seems like a normal shy and compassionate girl underneath a cold demeanour, but her hobbies and certain superhuman abilities makes her more than that. She's a compelling character to watch however, and her various quirks (Fits of laughter? Scissors?!) are what makes the anime so addictive, along with her bond to Akira Tsubaki. Tsubaki is a relatively normal character, despite his attraction to Urabe's drool, and it's fun to see him cope with being the boyfriend of such a strange person and the requirements that come with the role; romancing Urabe is much harder than he thinks. The anime mainly focuses on the odd couple so important side characters are limited, but two of their classmates, Kouhei Ueno and Ayuko Oka, provide some extra entertainment; the playful and wild Oka has a particularly big influence in how the relationship develops between Urabe and Tsubaki.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of Mysterious Girlfriend X is excellent and rather interesting. It goes for an older style of animation, and reminds me of anime that were made a decade or two ago, back when clich\u00e9s were still original ideas. Backgrounds are also quite nice, especially parts of the school like the classroom and gardens as well as the surrounding town. However, I'm still undecided as to whether I like the character models retained from the manga, which are sharp and detailed but make the 17-year old students look like they're in middle school rather than high school.\\n\\n\r\nThe series makes use of a variety of background music that is sombre and mysterious, but also some which makes you think of a circus, and this works well with Urabe's character and the strangeness of the show itself. A few soothing melodies are thrown into the mix too. The OP is a catchy and upbeat song that fits with the high school setting, while the ED is also good and has a nice tune. The voice acting is decent all around; the voice actress for the role of Urabe is a newcomer but she's done an especially good job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mysterious Girlfriend X, or Nazo no Kanojo X, is about a bizarre high school romance with unique additions in the form of drool with multiple and mysterious effects, excessive nose-bleeding and a very weird yet enjoyable character in Mikoto Urabe. This anime is sure to captivate some viewers while alienating others but like the manga, it does what it sets out to do with a passing grade. And that is to provide us with an entry in the genre that feels fun and more than just a little different. Assuming it doesn't make its audience sick to the stomach first.",

I found this series by clicking through recommendations starting from 'Kimi ni Todoke', how I arrived here I don't recall, but thank goodness I did.\r\nI don't think I've come across anything as unique as this. The story line was out of this world but not so far out that it is unwatchable. \r\nThe art was a plus for me, it was clean and easy to look at. The characters are very well designed.

            "content": "\"Upon discovering the existence of sex, every boy wonders one thing. They wonder what kind of girl they'll be with for their first time.\"\r\nTL;DR: boy meets girl, hen things happen, no general romantic shit.\r\nThe series starts very cliched. We have The Ordinary High School Student, we have The Ordinary New Transfer Student... or not that Ordinary? Yepp, new girl looks weirdo, do weirdo things, drooling as hell and, in nearly everything, isn't usual high school girl, filled with shyness and taboos. That's cool, if you gonna ask me. Main Hero aka Akira-kun despite being at top of his sexual maturation is all round nice guy,not pervert, not bookworm etc. Perfect character to project with yourself. Also, this is goin' to be very unusual romantic anime, just because it's targeted on boys and ant the same time it's not Yet Another Harem. There is also one feature, makes this title so special, but I'm not gonna spoil it. So for the story 8pts and 9pts for the girl (she's really mysterious, lol).\\n\\n\r\nIt's also 8pts for the art. It's quite oldschool, but not that dried mammoth shit like in parallel Ozuma. It have that 90-s flava. So if you're not scred of that, you'll like it. I'm glad to see so different art styles presented today at TV-anime market. 8pts.\\n\\n\r\nSound. Is. Quite. Amazing. Especially for the last scene of the first episode. It's some parade music with trumpets and stuff. Really brings feelings of craziness, madness and only God knows what else. 9pts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. That's very undebatable part since it's quite personal. 10pts. I'm gonna reccomend it to anyone. It's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9pts after 1st episode. That's gonna be one of the very few sweets this season.",

            "content": "Intro:\r\nThis is a review I've been planning to write for a long time. I've been putting it off in part because reviews like this are by FAR the hardest to write. Here is what I mean. The easiest reviews to write are bashing bad anime that absolutely nobody cares about. They get quick and easy laughs from readers. Nobody gets angry or offended. You can just say whatever you want with no fear of the consequences. \r\nThe second easiest to write are gushing praise onto a universally beloved classic. Have you ever seen an \"Anime everyday\" review? I'm not trying to be mean, I'm totallyserious. All you must do is repeat the same praises that other people have said countless times before and suddenly most people will think you are a deep thinker and sophisticated intellectual. I could go on IMDB and copy/paste pieces of essays written about Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and come across as brilliant without ever putting an ounce of effort or thought into the review. \\n\\n\r\nThe 3rd most difficult type of review is bashing a series that is well loved. This can be a bit tricky and requires some thought, but it's still workable if you know how. The most common tactic would be to acknowledge the things the series does well, but also point out its flaws and basically say \"maybe this series isn't quite as good as people are saying\". \\n\\n\r\nThe absolute hardest type of review is defending and praising a series that is widely disliked. Since few people will dare to do this, you can't rely on the words and arguments of others. You are on your own. Even if your words are elegant and your defense is Johnny Cochran worthy, it is slamming hard against your reader's preconceived notions. This means you will likely get a lot of bashing and \"thumbs down\" regardless. Defending an unpopular series is a Pyrrhic victory. No massively popular anime critic I can think of made their fame and popularity by commonly defending series that are widely loathed. Despite knowing this, I'm writing this review anyways. Now as the great poet Pushkin wrote in his poem Wagon of Life, \"Let's get going for Fuck's sake!\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\\n\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X is essentially the story of a quirky romance between 2 extremely socially awkward youths. So\u2026this will be like Wes Anderson\u2019s Moonrise Kingdom? Nope. This is a series featuring psychic saliva that creates a mental and physical link between those who share it. Basically, think Alexander Dumas\u2019 short story The Corsican Brothers only gross. This is a WEIRD anime, but if you give it a chance it is surprisingly pretty good!\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a highschool, as romance anime tend to do. Our hero is a guy named Akira Tsubaki. Akira is a lonely and withdrawn boy who lives with his father and older sister since his mother died when he was young. Akira has never had a girlfriend before, but is intrigued by an odd transfer student who is even more introverted than he is. This girl is named Urabe and she is\u2026odd. She sleeps through most of her classes and quickly becomes a social pariah through her bizarre behavior. Her hobby is making art with scissors, which she has learned to use with superhuman speed and accuracy. One day after school, Akira notices that Urabe left a large puddle of drool on her desk and decides to taste a sample of it because he had never kissed a girl. Soon he develops a fever and starts having unusual dreams. It turns out that Urabe is psychic and can transfer her emotions and feelings through her bodily fluids. This link is also physical and causes any pain or injury inflicted on one to affect the other. Urabe quickly senses that someone must have tasted her drool and figures out it was Akira. She tells him that he will go through painful withdrawal unless he tastes a sample of her saliva every day. Now these 2 oddballs must learn to form a relationship and adjust to their new psychic link. The relationship between Urabe and Akira is also contrasted against the far more normal relationship between Akira\u2019s only friend named Kouhei and his girlfriend Oka. \\n\\n\r\nMost romance anime rely on tired gags and a strict formula. The boy will accidentally see the girl naked or feel her up, then she will yell at him and punch him. BAKA! The next minute, the fight is over and the relationship is back to normal. Mysterious Girlfriend X manages to entirely avoid this. Not only is there a noticeable absence of bad romance anime gags and clich\u00e9s, but just when you think you know where the series is going it completely surprises you. What is astounding is that it actually feels like a realistic relationship despite the whole psychic drool thing. I\u2019m serious! Akira wants them to be public with their romance, but Urabe is shy about it. Akira wants to advance their physical relationship faster than Urabe is comfortable with, so this leads to a believable quarrel and gradual compromise. The relationship between Urabe and Akira has ups and downs like any real relationship, but grows stronger as both realize what it means to be in a long term romance and how they must now always consider their partner\u2019s desires, hopes, and feelings.  Romance anime typically either move WAY too slow to keep a status quo, or they move far too fast and characters are having sex 5 minutes after meeting. Mysterious Girlfriend X has a gradual and satisfying romance that feels more organic. \\n\\n\r\nThe final element that makes Mysterious Girlfriend a quality romance anime is the characters. Urabe is indeed highly unusual, but besides the whole psychic powers thing feels like a person you could meet in real life. She doesn\u2019t really fit into an anime archetype of \u201cTsundere\u201d or \u201cYandare\u201d. Instead she seems to exhibit traits you would expect from someone with Aspergers or \u201cAutistic tendencies\u201d. She is extremely aloof, anti-social, dislikes physical contact, and has a very hard time making friends. She doesn\u2019t understand social norms and has gotten to the point where she has stopped caring. However, she is warm and caring to the few people close to her. She has a good heart, but has a hard time relating to other people and forming meaningful bonds. Akira like many romance lead is the clumsy and awkward male virgin. However, he is far more realistic and relatable than most. Akira doesn\u2019t put up with comedic abuse. He actually wants to get more physically intimate and is understandably frustrated by Urabe\u2019s extreme reluctance. He isn\u2019t an abusive asshole who forces himself on Urabe, but he also isn\u2019t a stepping stone or whipping boy. He\u2019s a fairly realistic teenager going through his first serious relationship.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nVery solid opening and closing. Most of the soundtrack is quite good and really fits the atmosphere\u2026 then there is Urabe\u2019s theme. WTF were they thinking?! The track is called \u201cDream\u201d and I think they were attempting to instill a sense of mystery and awe. Instead we got creepy, sinister, circus music. Why? Just why?!\\n\\n\r\n Here is Urabe\u2019s Leitmotif: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5YRokOjrdY   \\n\\n\r\nHere is the theme to the shitty IT miniseries from 1990: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC4zgfVj-K4  \\n\\n\r\n Basically the same shit. If anything, Urabe\u2019s theme is creepier.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nNow since this is a series with a WEIRD premise it needed to find an animation studio that gives zero fucks and is willing to draw some weird shit. Unfortunately, that means it really had only a couple choices: Studio ARMS or Hoods Entertainment. Ultimately, they went with Hoods, who is best known for the brother/sister fucking hentai Aki no Sora and breastfeeding stupidity that is Seikon no Qwasar. Hoods is\u2026not exactly known as a maker of quality titles and this really hurts the perception of Mysterious Girlfriend  X . Basically the same way that being an ARMS title hurts Elfen Lied or Kurosawa\u2019s Runaway Train was completely overlooked or slammed because Cannon Films produced it. While most of the art and animation is fine, I do have one gripe. We are told over and over again that we are looking at \u201cdrool\u201d or \u201csaliva\u201d but it is far too thick, viscous, and green. Hoods decided to draw phlegm or a \u201cloogie\u201d, which makes the series WAY grosser than it needed to be. This choice is a self-inflicted injury that wasn\u2019t present in the manga and serves only to repel most viewers away. God damn it Hoods Entertainment!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X is not a perfect series, but it is still heavily underrated and gets way more shit than it deserves. This is the only anime I\u2019ve ever seen where the back of the DVD cover for the English release actually bashes it. The entire back cover is basically \u201cLOL, can you BELIEVE this stupid shit!\u201d I live by a used DVD store and I\u2019ve purchased a LOT of shitty anime to watch with friends. Here are some anime I own with only positive comments on the DVD cover: Mad Bull 34, Plastic Little, Garzey\u2019s Wing, Kite, Legend of Lemnear, and even fucking Dark Cat!\\n\\n\r\nThe tragedy in this is that many highly talented people worked on Mysterious Girlfriend X and actually put effort into it. There is a legitimately good anime buried underneath the thin outer layer of mucus and scorn. The series director is Ayumu Watanabe, who also directed Space Brothers. You know, one of the highest rated series on all of MAL. The series writer is Hitomi Mieno, who also wrote Arakawa Under the Bridge and of course Gintama. The guy that did the storyboard is the same guy that did the storyboards for Shinsekai Yori , parts of One Piece, and Penguindrum. I highly recommend checking out this series if you are looking for underrated, buried treasure.\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever found an anime that \"SALIVA\" or \"DROOL\" is become a proof to the bonds of love? if you're havent, then maybe you could try Nazo no Kanojo X.\r\nNazo no Kanojo or Mysterious Girlfriend in english is not your typical comedy - romance anime, why? First of all, if you're an easy people to puke because of something weird then maybe this anime is not for you, since this anime will have SO MANY scenes that will make several people go puke. like i said before, your first impression while watching this anime is DROOL, yeah, i am not kidding. but dont takethis drool is something that revolting, but take it as the PROOF of the couple's bond.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nThe story began with Tsubaki Akira, our normal main character that unexpectedly meet with a weird girl, i mean REALLY weird. that girl was Urabe Mikoto. she was transfered into Tsubaki's school, she is known as the weirdo because yeah... she is weird in many ways. Later, in afternoon after school, Tsubaki found Urabe in classroom and still sleep. without any ecchi or dirty minds Tsubaki wakes Mikoto, after Mikoto leaves he found a pool of DROOL in her table. And surprisingly, Mikoto without any particular reason lick the drool. A few days later he become sick and Mikoto comes to his house and cure him with a weird ways, and after that again, he date with her.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime story is very unique or maybe the uniquest one that i've ever watched in another rom-com series. Maybe you will think this anime will about lovey dovey, that they will kissing, flirting, or maybe make out. if you think that way, then you're VERY WRONG. what makes this story interesting is Urabe Mikoto, she is not your normal-type-moe girl. I am not gonna spoil it on how weird this girl was. anyway, The execution of this anime in the storyplot os really good. i mean, at the way they end each episode was really amazing. Usually they put some cute and heartwarming scenes in the end of each episodes. and with this strategy, they really attract (especially me) the viewer to keep watching this. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes, this anime maybe will make you bored if you're not into a romance story. Since this anime is more focussing on the way how they develops their drool-lationship and moreover, this is not-your-all-anime since some of people will probably said disgusting with \"droll\" as the main themes. But however they said, i still found this anime is romantic and pretty enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that will comes to my mind while trying this anime is 90s. I guess several people will saying the same things since this anime art was like the anime from 90s. Small eyes, the contour of the hairstyle, and even the character design Its kinda rare to see this kind of art especially in nowdays, while other anime are trying to improve their art (like SHAFT's anime which have an amazing art) but this anime take a risk to use an old style, but does it bad? No! its really suitable with the story itself and moreover, its like they're bringing you back to the 90s, nostalgic. When i thought this art will irritate me with their old style,but it didnt happen and surprisingly i really fell in love with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe background is pretty much increasing the atmosphere of romance feels. like when in the afternoon, the sunset is pretty beautiful and when it adds with romance scenes, it feels like the scenes is getting more romantic. The coloring in this anime are also pretty colorful and bright. They really representing the mood in the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nFrom the sound section, there was nothing special in this. though The OP and the ED wasnt so bad, in fact it was really good, when i hear the OP and the ED, the feel of 90s really exquisite, especially the OP \"Koi no Orchestra\" by Ayako Yoshitani which is also voicing Urabe in this anime. Piano and violin is really dominant in this song. The song itself is really catchy and easy listening and moreover its really suitable with the anime which is focussing on the romance thing. For the seiyuu, they have done well with their roles. Especially for Yoshitani Ayaka. she hasnt voicing any anime characters beside Urabe but surprisingly she is good and really suits with the Urabe personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nThe last, Character. The focus on this anime was between the couples, Urabe Mikoto and Tsubaki Akira. since this anime was focussing on these, the character development between two of them is really touching, there was sadness, happiness, jealous, and anything like that, furthermore In my opinion this one is what makes this anime is so appealing, i cant deny that i have fallen in love with Mikoto, you can said she is weird but sometimes she shows her cute side (Until now i dont know what kind of dere she is, i think this one is a new dere type). and for Tsubaki, none to much to say for this boy, he is kind and easy to nervous around the girls. but of course he wont be a main character if he doesnt have any special nature, and for him is loyalty.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nWell, many people said this anime was weird and feel so old, i dont deny if many people saying that. but i am sure what they said are cannot be accounted, since i am sure they havent see the whole episodes. and for those who are saying that, boy you have missed an amazing unique romance anime. Giving it a 8 because this anime is not especially for all, but for me, this anime is pretty much enjoyable and really fun ride to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, If you're looking for something special and bored with usual romance anime, then this anime is for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S : Feedbacks are welcome*",

            "content": "This show is unique to say the least. I was expecting something f**ked up and weird, but I must admit I was expecting something more on the comedy side for some reason. Not that I dislike how f**ked up and serious this show actually is, I actually think I love it even more that way. I was expecting some crazy ecchi with just some original characters, but it doesn\u2019t look anyway like that at all.\r\nThe first thing that caught my attention with this anime is how old the animations looked. It had this grainy and low definition look to it, It was kind of aminor disappointment. But at the same time, the animation and style reminded me of some other special show like Paprika or Serial Experiment Lain, so it did add to the seinen and dreamy style of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that caught my attention was this artistic and seinen way to present the story. There is this weird atmosphere in the show, were it looks like everything is just a little bit too normal to be real. There is this calm and constant feeling that everything you are watching at the moment is important. Because every dialogue and actions are so slow, we can really appreciate the feelings behind them.\\n\\n\r\nNext thing that caught my attention was obviously the characters. They are unique to say the least. While Urabe is quite rapidly labelled as a weirdo, I don\u2019t think Tsubaki is any better. Who in their right mind would taste the saliva of someone else on a whim like that? No wonder he got sick in the first place, even if it was not love sickness. But let us return to our characters, Tsubaki might look like a regular guy, but he has some pretty weird and colorful dreams, not only that, he fell in love at first sight with a girl whose face looked retarded and she had drool on her cheek while looking at him with a confused look.  I think Urabe isn\u2019t the only one who has some mental issues.\\n\\n\r\nBut talking of the mysterious girlfriend in question, Urabe is a lost cause, she hear voices while she sleeps in class and proceed to laugh her ass off and roll on the floor laughing. She is so antisocial that even when everyone tried to talk to her and be compassionate towards her, she still managed to avoid all the attention and stay lonely at her desk. She spent her time sleeping during lunch break, so I wonder if that girl ever actually eat and while it was only revealed in the preview for next episode, we also know that she carries around scissor in her panties to cut paper. If anything, this girl sure has a personality of her own.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am positively surprised and impressed by this show, I was not expecting something so mysterious and serious from characters that are that special. I will most definitively watch this show and cover it. I think it might fit exactly in the kind of show I love and dream of.\\n\\n\r\nPossibility of Watching: High",

            "content": "Mysterious Girlfriend X. What hooked me to watch this was, of course, the drool tasting. This series made me more open-minded to watch romance-ecchi, since this was ecchi but has a good storyline.\r\nWhat makes this anime different from others is its uniqueness. Drool as bond is not something a couple usually has, and drool tasting is something you can't see everyday. Now, on to the details.\r\nThis review may contain spoilers.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nHonestly, after seeing \"ecchi\" in the tags, I thought this anime was about sex, but man I was wrong. The story is surprisingly really good. It's not based on sex, though you can sometimes seeAkira loosing control, since he's in puberty and he has a girlfriend. The story is about how Akira, live his lovelife with his mysterious girlfriend, Urabe. Urabe's not your ordinary girlfriend. In fact, she's one of the weirdest girls I've seen in anime. But the plot is solid. There are scenes that made me emotional, laugh, and surprised.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode, I thought that the art sucked, but in the long run I realized that the art contributed to the uniqueness of the anime. It's kind of an old-style looking anime, comparable to Ranma 1/2 or Dragonball Z, but there were looks that I really liked. I liked how the following characters were drawn:\\n\\n\r\nOka, Urabe (with her other hairstyle), and Youko.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis rating might be a bit biased, since I'm a sucker to Violin, Cello, and Piano music. The producers did a pretty good job in providing background music, since the BGM matches the atmosphere of a particular scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy expectations were met (and blown away) by Urabe's character. Since the title of this anime was \"Mysterious Girlfriend X\", I really expected that the female protagonist should be weird, and Urabe's character was right on the money. Other characters like Oka, Ueno, and Akira portrayed the \"high-school student\" role very well, especially when it comes to love and dating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really, really enjoyed this anime. The drool thing was very amusing. Made me laughed a lot. This series also made me think and reflect deeply on situations related to love and dating since I never thought of drool to become a couple's bond.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X really reached my \"must-watch list\". I enjoyed this series a lot. I recommend this to anyone, especially those who just started dating.",

            "content": "Mysterious Girlfriend X is a show that\u2019s pretty icky. There\u2019s no getting around it. As a viewer, one always has options, one can always make decisions. So, if you\u2019re planning on watching this show, you have to get past the hurdle that is the synopsis of this show. A high school student one day discovers the new transfer student asleep at her desk after school. After she hurriedly leaves, he sees a small pool of her drool on the desk, and for some unfathomable reason, he puts his finger in said drool, and takes this finger into his mouth. He licks her drool.\r\nWithout getting intothe other bizarre things about this anime (the main character\u2019s proclivity for randomly laughing, the scissors she keeps in her panties, etc.), the drool issue is the most major one to contend with. Part of this piece will be about hopefully putting \u201cthe drool issue\u201d into a larger context regarding what this show\u2019s actually doing. It\u2019s fairly obvious that the show is on some level about how love, at one point or another, must lead to intimacy. The protagonists of our show, because they\u2019re weird, don\u2019t take the usual path in these matters. They\u2019re inching toward intimacy, but they do it in their own particular way. Mysterious Girlfriend X, in its own weird way, celebrates the time of our lives where we groped and felt around and decided what worked and didn\u2019t work for us, what felt right; it\u2019s a show about our sexual exploration, and how it\u2019s a necessary aspect of relationships.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Tsubaki, our male protagonist, tastes Urabe\u2019s drool, he just knows he has to be with her. It\u2019s not a question of psychology or of motivation; his body dictates it. After not tasting her drool for a couple of weeks, he\u2019s actually bedridden and sick. It\u2019s only after Urabe shows up and gives him her drool that he recovers. So he asks her out. She says yes. The reason behind this is simple \u2013 he had a reaction to her drool, and to her that means he\u2019s special. Every day after school, in order to stave off sickness, Urabe sticks a finger in her mouth and lets Tsubaki suck on it for a bit. It\u2019s a moment of an awkward physical intimacy; and, I think, an undeniably erotic moment for both of them. Later on, we find out that Urabe\u2019s drool can also serve as a communication tool (Urabe can find out about Tsubaki\u2019s dreams and they can even find out what the other is feeling because of it). This daily ritual is no different than kissing before saying goodbye.\\n\\n\r\nI think if the drool itself were animated in a more tasteful way there wouldn\u2019t be as much resistance to this show. Hoods Entertainment, the company who made it, do the series no favors when they choose to animate the drool, as being not at all dissimilar to other bodily fluids. The drool lingers, drips from fingers, forms puddles; in the op, it even splashes like we\u2019re suddenly in a hentai or something. It\u2019s distracting. In Mysterious Girlfriend X, the exchange of drool comes to represent other possible exchanges of bodily fluids. The act is both literal and metaphorical. This is really what we are talking about, isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki and Urabe both understand where their relationship will end up. Every time they exchange drool, they come to realize the fact of it. This is where we\u2019re heading, this is what\u2019s going to happen. But many of the 13 episodes are about the slow crawl toward that goal (in this series, that goal is unfulfilled). One episode finds Urabe going over to visit Tsubaki wearing nothing but a coat, because apparently this is a normal remedy for the common cold. Like Junko Nakano\u2019s Chisa x Pon (though nowhere near as explicit), the series maps out how over time, they become more comfortable with each other. Whereas in the first few episodes, Urabe almost kills Tsubaki when he tries to hug her; near the end, it\u2019s Urabe who demands that she be hugged.  There\u2019s even a moment later on where in a fit of blind passion, Tsubaki licks Urabe\u2019s ear, and she\u2019s completely overwhelmed by the sensation. Although this sense of experimentation and play is lighthearted in the show, I believe the show takes absolutely serious the drives of the main characters. Tsubaki has nightly dreams about Urabe where they dance in some strange circus-like town (not hard to understand what\u2019s happening there), and Urabe herself often finds herself blushing and testing her own limits regarding what she\u2019ll do (one episode finds her stripping completely down and letting Tsubaki lick her drool while his eyes are closed). The way they approach the issue is unorthodox, sure, but everyone\u2019s different. The show even provides a foil couple to accentuate how different they are.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the show is relatively straightforward in its depiction of teenage confusion, hormones and love, there\u2019s one really interesting strand that I haven\u2019t mentioned. Tsubaki and his friend, Ueno, both get girlfriends during the show, but they insist on keeping this a secret. Whereas in other shows, there\u2019d usually be a scene where everyone whispers about the new couple, in this show our main characters never acknowledge their girlfriends in any special way while they\u2019re at school. While I don\u2019t think this is done for any real reason by the characters, it betrays an uneasiness about their own sexual development. I couldn\u2019t help thinking that they were hiding their relationships because it meant that they were growing up, that they were embarrassed by their sexual curiosity/progress/etc. And, yeah, it\u2019s completely embarrassing. During this time in their lives, we have no idea what we\u2019re doing. Tsubake and Urabe may understand the mechanics of where this is all going, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they have any idea of what it means, of what it looks like, of what it feels like; and not knowing, looking foolish while you figure out, is completely embarrassing. It\u2019s easier to pretend you don\u2019t have a girlfriend, because then you can keep that side of yourself completely separate from people\u2019s image of you. The only one who can see you at your most vulnerable, most ridiculous, state is your Mysterious Girlfriend; and only she knows how much her drool turns you on.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nSaliva is a basic necessity for most animals. It provides humans with a way to break down food, aids in protecting our teeth, and allows us to have the ability to swallow easily. It's so ingrained in our daily lives that, for the most part, we pay it no mind. However, once it leaves the mouth, it usually goes from a friendly companion to a disgusting byproduct. In short, while saliva is seen as a benefactor to our everyday lives, drool is not. But this anime, Mysterious Girlfriend X, would like you to think otherwise.\r\nSTORY\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X beginsrather cliche but then takes a rather interesting turn. Urabe is a new transfer student who gets close to no one and is usually found sleeping. One day, for whatever reason, our MC Tsubaki tastes the drool left behind on her desk.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as premises go, X certainly stands up there as one of the more unique. Essentially, the connections that are established between the characters are based on the drool that they consume. In a metaphorical sense, drool represents love. Drool is this liquid, slimy, and foreign substance that isn't particularly appealing to someone unless that person desires it to be. Love isn't a liquid, but it certainly \"flows\" like one, cascading through and between people, taking shape in whatever form it has to. It's not particularly slimy, but it manifests itself as these rather strange feelings that are quite unlike anything else. And while we say we know what love is, it's definitely foreign to those of us who have yet to give or receive it in a deeply emotional way.\\n\\n\r\nI could go a step further and say that the pair of scissors Urabe is so fond of is a physical representation of her emotions. She hides behind it when she feels scared, threatened, or jealous, are used with tactical precision depending on the situation, and are worn \"on her sleeve\" despite her appearance. Maybe I can make another leap and argue that the X in the title isn't the scissors, but is instead the x-chromosome that, like love, is \"shared\" between Tsubaki and Urabe.\\n\\n\r\nThe last one is probably too much of a stretch. But here's my point; where is it appropriate to draw the line between simply making connections and discovering the true intentions of the writer and producers? What I've said before may sound pretty good, but if its just some reviewer's attempt at making the message sound nice then that isn't being fair to the anime in question.\\n\\n\r\nLet's diverge for just a moment and talk about the more obvious. X does something quite well, and that is demonstrating a mature relationship. Whether it be through drool or through words, both Tsubaki and Urabe almost always \"communicate\" in a respectful and realistic manner. There aren't any major misunderstandings, no one is fumbling around for words, and neither of them act particularly wishy-washy in the way they interact. Simply put, they are a believable couple.\\n\\n\r\nTying this back in with the first few remarks, is it fair to say that X's overall theme is that drool is a lot like love? I believe so. While one is a physical entity and the other is a spiritual feeling, what this show is trying to get at is that the premise, like love itself, doesn't have to make sense. It's this strange occurrence that often pops up out of nowhere, usually when we least expect it. And while it may seem embarrassing to deal with in the beginning, over time everything more or less \"drips\" into place.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhen first looking at Mysterious Girlfriend X, the phrase \"don't judge a book by its cover\" comes to mind. From the outside it looks rather old or outdated. While these descriptions aren't entirely accurate, they do have some basis. Both the character designs and the locations are nothing extravagant. Rather, they appear to be something taken from the late 90's instead of the early 2010's.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to actual animation, there isn't much attention given to it outside of two areas: Urabe's furious cutting and the drool. The former has at least a pretty cool effect attached to it where she seemingly moves faster than sound. The latter, understandably being the focal point, sees much glistening, movement, and fluidity.\\n\\n\r\nOne small note is that on a handful of occasions, the animation was \"wrong.\" In other words, things happening with the left hand suddenly were happening with the right hand. This may be nit-picky, but catching it in more than one instance is definitely something against the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X focuses mostly on two characters, Tsubaki the boyfriend and Urabe the girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki is particularly interesting for his competency, his straight-forward behavior, and his willingness to trust Urabe. At certain points in the show, he may let his feelings or desires somewhat get the better of him, but instead of finding this perverted or possessive, it seemed rather natural. He's a high school boy, with the first girlfriend he's ever had, sharing a connection with someone on a deep level. Of course he is going to want to embrace Urabe, feel her, or keep her for himself. As a character, it felt like I was watching an adolescent boy experience his first true love. In short, as his sister would say, \"he's at that age.\"\\n\\n\r\nUrabe most definitely earns the moniker of mysterious. Quiet, kind, and seemingly simple, it's revealed quite quickly that this isn't necessarily the case. Her hair hides her face, she always carries with her a pair of scissors, and her drool has a supernatural power. At certain times, she is asked why she is like this. Her answer, while small, speaks volumes: \"That's just the way I am.\" This offhand and non-explanatory comment is further evidence for the ideas presented previously. Love isn't something that is easily describable, nor is it something that needs to be. It's this feeling that is born out of nowhere, often times without a specific moment to attach to. Nobody questions why Urabe is the way she is, and her character demonstrates this same approach towards love.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for Mysterious Girlfriend X is rather generic. It doesn't attempt anything new, and while the vocalist does have small moments at the beginning and the end it isn't enough to warrant recognition.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED suffers the same fate, but is probably worse both as a song and with the visuals attached to them. The song itself is \"relaxing\" in its beat and gives off a feeling of being mellow. This coincides with the visuals, which are rather unappealing not because of the drool but because they are simple still shots without much life.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mostly forgettable except for the circus track that plays. It's most often used during the dream sequences and when Urabe is being her usual weird self. I thought the piece fit well with the show's general air of strangeness and mysteriousness.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting has no notable mentions to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen first delving into this one, I will admit that the drool aspect was pretty gross. \"But Banjo, things like kissing involve saliva and sex has even more fluids involved!\" That's true, and I agree, but I think its the context of the situation. I would like to believe most couples aren't offering their drool-covered finger on a daily basis. As an onlooker, that just seems rather silly. It took an episode or two, but eventually me being perturbed by it went away.\\n\\n\r\nWhat came as a surprise was the show's \"Ecchi\" tag. It's not in your face about it for the most part, but there are shots of the girls involved being naked, dreams of playing with breasts, and a few panty-shots here or there. For the most part, the eroticism is supposed to be derived from the eating of the drool and the sucking of the fingers. Minus that, the fan-service overall seemed quite tame given the genre it fell under.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the anime is a romance story. It's definitely not your typical one, but there is blushing, stuttering, and lovey-dovey moments abound. Tsubaki and Urabe's relationship is almost too real, which is most likely why they are not often talked about. Besides the drool they share, what they have is so common it just doesn't standout. That's not a bad thing, it just makes them less memorable overall.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Mysterious Girlfriend X starts off with a peculiar premise, dealing mostly in drool. But by the show's conclusion, Urabe, her relationship with Tsubaki, and the show's final message are no longer mysterious. Instead, they are all quite apparent for any fan of anime to see.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, drool is love surrounding a mature couple\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, old art style with boring actual animation and a few hiccups\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, \"believable\" high school kids\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, bland OP, ED, soundtrack, and VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, quite the weird romance story\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "If you've got this far, you know the show's synopsis. Your standard anime transfer student doesn't quite fit in, as expected, but due to a series of events ranging from ordinary to a bit weird, the show's main character ends up falling for the weird transfer student. All this made possible due to the strange effect her drool has on him, creating a bond between the two that makes him physically ill if he goes without it.\r\nWhile this may not sound all that interesting, and perhaps down right gross with the drool aspect, Mysterious Girlfriend X stands out as one of the most unique andcharming romance anime's I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to beat around the bush - the drool part is a bit disgusting to begin with, even if it's generally limited to licking it off fingers. The first episode serves to set up the circumstances and plot of the rest of the show, and while it's mildly intriguing to begin with, it's not until the end of the episode that you get the first glimpse of the more honest approach the show takes with young and/or first loves.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first hint that MGX is going to be different from most other Anime. Love and relationships with teens is usually dealt with in love triangles and harems/reverse harems, with the entire show mostly having unresolved sexual tension for either Japanese cultural reasons or just because it's the done thing. A lot of these and other relationship tropes get subverted throughout the show, and it doesn't get preachy about the romanticised pre-conceptions of love in media either.\\n\\n\r\nYou don't have to wait long for any of this to start though, as the second episode is when the story really gets going. By the third you'll probably have gotten used to the drool aspect, and by then you'll be hooked. The drool is just a mechanism for the two main characters to understand each others feelings, both emotionally and physically, and aids them in the developments of their love life. Understanding is a big theme in the series, and leads to some genuinely tender moments.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just about the two characters getting to know each other, the viewer themselves is in on the process of getting to know the protagonists and the meaning of the show. While Akira Tsubaki, our eyes into the world, is portrayed as a fairly normal and relatable guy, Mikoto Urabe, his girlfriend, is a mystery. As the name of the anime suggests. However, while she has the almost supernatural drool, an odd manner, and is freakishly adept with a pair of scissors she keeps in her panties, it all seems like an allegory for the mystery and unknown of being in love for the first time.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a bit of ecchi in the series as well - with the two main girls drawn as being quite busty. I honestly think this is commentary on how teenage boys see the world, and how love can sometimes alter your perceptions of your partners. Which in this case is shown by giving the girls big tits, as you do. The art style in general though is a little retro, which fits the atmosphere of the show a lot better than spindly limbs or soft moe features.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the manga, it's usually very spot on, and any small changes made to the story, whether they're chronological or characters reactions, mostly better the flow of events. Due to the short nature of the anime, and the fact the manga is still ongoing, some stories have been dropped or blended together. However nothing feels rushed, forced, or out of place, and it at least means there's probably enough material for a second season if it gets that far.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few words that have been tossed around in this review that do manage to sum up the show better than others - that it is a charming, sweet, honest look at young and first loves. I hope they make more after the OVA.",

Although it comes off a little weird with the drool bond i think that it is just something you have to see as a beautiful bond between two people. The creativity of this bond is art. The Romance and Comedy are a great mix as well, there wasn't a point were the one overpowered the other it was a smooth mix. The way the two dreamed about each other was really cute and reminds me of myself. The dream world was so crazy and wonderful it broughteverything fun into one small town. Another awesome thing about this anime was the music! The music was perfect for every scene or tense moment. I now after finishing this show find myself humming the dream theme haha. The characters were also great. There was only 4 main characters so you got to know them pretty well! Plus Urabe and Tsubaki are such a wonderful couple with such strong feelings for each other but so little experience and differences they don't know how to show affection besides the swap of drool they share! I dunno i really enjoyed this anime and i hope anyone who reads this does too! Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "The whole concept of exchanging saliva is gross. I\u2019ll say it. But to be fair, the story and the interactions of the other characters are good enough that most can bypass this. After a while, I noticed that I cringed less and less every time I had to see the two love birds put their drool in each other\u2019s mouths.\r\n       At times the show dragged. There were a couple episodes that really seemed to do a whole lot of nothing. Overall, I\u2019m glad that it only ran for 13 episodes. Thepacing over the course of the whole series was alright though.\\n\\n\r\n        As for the comedic value, it really depends on your personal tastes. As with most comedies, especially in the anime industry, it\u2019s very subjective. It either syncs up with you or it doesn\u2019t. With this particular series, you\u2019ll need to give it at least three episodes to determine whether or not it falls within your personal taste.\\n\\n\r\n         But even if the humor isn\u2019t your thing, the story is still relatively interesting. I found myself really wanting to find out how the relationship between Mikoto and Akira would turn out. There\u2019s quite a few surprises along the way, and although they didn\u2019t end it the way the manga progressed, it was still acceptable whether you read the manga or not. If you\u2019ve read the manga, give it a shot. They aren\u2019t far off from it. If not, it\u2019s still a decent pick if you want a romantic comedy with a weird concept. Just don\u2019t think about it too much. If you do, it\u2019ll just end up bothering you the whole way through and at that point it\u2019s not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall i give this show 6/10, it took me a while to get into it, and at times I found myself getting an episode or two behind, prioritizing several other shows. It\u2019s not horrible for what it is. It just didn\u2019t have the \u201cwow\u201d effect on me.\\n\\n\r\n           If you don\u2019t like the animation style, and cannot get past the saliva concept, go ahead and pass on this one. Also, as always, if romantic comedy isn\u2019t what you are looking for, this is not the right pick.",

            "content": "If you can somehow, in some way that is not life threatening, remove your stomach from the rest of your body and sit right next to you, then this anime is a bizarre treat. . . Or at least I wanted to say that. . . .\r\nIt's quite a feat to be both an intriguing and somewhat fresh look at the highschool romance genre and physically sickening at the same time, Nazo no Kanojo X is a rare case of doing something different yet doing something that immediately pushes you away, literally.\r\nIt's starts out with Akira Tsubaki wondering about how his first girlfriend will belike, and that's when Mikoto Urabe comes in. Mikoto is the new transfer student at Akira's class and is far from being an average and typical school kid, from randomly bursting out laughing in the middle of class to sleeping face flat on her school desk in between classes, she easily becomes what the class now considers her, a straight up weirdo. Then one day. . .  Why do I feel queasy. . . .\\n\r\nOkay, I need to get this done and over with. This is the ultimate deciding factor of the show, one day as school ends for the day, Akira finds Mikoto asleep and unaware of class ending for that day. He wakes her up, with drool slowly pouring down her mouth, and proceeds to leave leaving a wide eyed Akira staring at what she left behind. . . and for some reason. . . Licks it up. . . .\\n\\n\r\nNow here's the thing, that's disgusting, Even though the anime does start off showing that Akira has some kind of fixation on liquid in general, it still churns my stomach in a way that tells me that watching this isn't a good idea for my physical health. But I tried to be open minded enough to almost look past that, especially since the show really is delightful in an offbeat way and shows it can be really something different. . . But, damn. . . It's an entry hazard of epic proportions.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is also a shame too, visually the anime is fascinating. It goes for an old school look and the imagery is bizarre, a bizarrely delightful kind that can hook you in alone. Heck the music is more busy focusing on the oddity of the show and wants you to ignore the umm, drool, and instead want you to pay attention the strange and weird (Also, Mitoko's voice actor is a really unique choice by, instead of a typical high pitched voice, it's a lot deeper than you'd expect).\\n\\n\r\nWhich is married by unexpected (Though in hindsight is a bit cliched) turns in the development of the central characters. Akira becomes quite addicted to Mikoto's... saliva to the point of having withdrawn symptoms and requires more of Mikoto's. . . Saliva on a regular basis. And by the end of the first episode, the shows keeps up with it's promise of it's title and they become a couple. . . right after Mikoto. . . UGh, vomits a pool of saliva (I'm over exaggerating of course) over the sudden and different way she wants Akira to confess to her, with talks of who and who is still a virgin. . . It's just her way of being surprised. . . .\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'm not going to blame anyone on wanting to past this up and never look back, especially with how the episode ends. But it's totally something out there and different with a genre that loves to stick with the usual cliches. This is a show that's trying to do something different, but one of it's methods is a clear deal breaker.\\n\r\nA deal breaker, that honestly, would make this anime a whole deal better if the drool was never a part of the premise. In the second episode there are already hints of the plot starting to get loose at the stitches. Clearly we hear that Mikoto's drool isn't anything special, yet she produces a special kind of drool that, umm, gets you horny? It's something along those lines, and it's one of two things that are immediately pointless. The other being Mikoto's hobby(?), keeping a pair of scissors in her underwear for occasions when she cuts up paper into those paper cut out ornaments. I can hardly see where that \"talent\" will have any importance, other than to flash Mikoto's panties (Though she mentions that she doesn't mind Akira seeing them, at least she doesn't get all embarrassed about). Trying to do something different is fine, but having pointless quirks isn't a way to do it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you can manage not to lose your lunch (Terrible way to put it, ugh, I apologize for the bad imagery), then Nazo no Kanojo X might end up being something totally strange in a delightful way, or become a new way to over sexualize something and go down a bizarro path into obscurity (The ending theme song kinda fetishises drool coming down a girls mouth), unfortunately I will never see where it'll lead up to.\\n\\n\r\nClearly this anime requires an acquired taste so to speak. The romance itself is very competent but the premise and subject matter however completely holds the anime back from the part of it that deserves praise, but with each episode more and more focus goes towards the drool (Like for example: Mikoto can \"transfer\" her feelings via saliva, the underlining purpose is great as it invokes a bond you can see between the main couple that needs no words. . . But it's revolting on the surface and becomes less \"special\" with the introduction of another person who's saliva is also \"special\").\\n\\n\r\nEither way, you'll need to stomach the premise out before going any further, I wish you good luck because it had me beat. . . Now excuse while I go grab some tums or something. . . Ugh. . . .",

The anime style is a bit older, having being published in 2012. And the synopsis of the anime doesn\u2019t give it justice for the amazing anime it actually is. In my opinion, this anime was just shy of becoming a masterpiece. It is a simple romance anime with a strange theme to go around it. And while some parts of the anime are shocking and seems strange at first, they become a core part of the story and becomes keyin how the main characters interact and the progression of the story. I really did get drawn into the anime and while the anime is a bit old, I thought I would do my best to do a review so I can share my thoughts on the anime 5 years later. \\n\\n\r\n*BEFORE WE GO FURTHER INTO THE REVIEW - WARNING *Minor Spoilers* Let's continue :) \\n\\n\r\nSTORY \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start this review by looking at the story. \\n\\n\r\nUrabe Mikoto is a strange 16 old girl who transfers to the same school as Tsubaki Akira. In the classroom she sits right next to Tsubaki and she is labeled someone who is weird by the entire class. She sleeps during most of the day at her desk and sometimes randomly erupts in a fit of laughter. One day Tsubaki returns to the classroom after school to see Urabe asleep at her desk. Once she wakes up, he sees her face for the first time and says she is cute. Once she leaves to go home Tsubaki sees a puddle of her drool on the desk. Curious to know what it tastes like, he picks some up and licks it - to find that her drool is very sweet. This drool starts a \"bond\" between these characters and they begin to form a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nMy first thoughts of watching the anime I didn\u2019t know how it would play out. As I continued watching the anime I saw the creators of the anime use the bond of drool in a very interesting way and it no longer became weird to see. Something I loved in this anime was seeing Tsubaki and Urabe exchange drool. In the anime there was also an added supernatural element where they could express feelings, thoughts and even sensation through drool. This allowed the two characters - Tsubaki and Urabe - who were in love, to explore each other and understand each other. It was interesting to see the bond between these two characters through drool and that helped them develop a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, in the anime Urabe falls over and hurts her knee, when Urabe gives Tsubaki her drool his knee also begins to hurt. So in some supernatural way, they have a bond and are connected by drool. \\n\\n\r\nThis bond of drool becomes the basis of the story progression as the characters progress in their relationship and grow more deeply in love. At the heart of the story this anime is a romance anime. The romance is very simple: we see jealously, lust, love and the characters being possessive. This very simple romance story is great and is spiced up by the experience drool adds in the anime - making a very interesting anime with a story that pulls in the viewer and provides a very different experience than conventional romance anime. This story, it\u2019s ideas and how it\u2019s displayed in the anime are well crafted, so rightfully I say that the story was a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\\n\r\nNow the story had two main characters in it, there was Urabe Mikito and Tsubaki Akira. There are other supporting characters but today I\u2019ll just focus on those two. \\n\\n\r\nTsubaki Akira seems like an average Japanese high-schooler, he finds that Urabe\u2019s drool is very sweet. Other people who have tasted Urabe\u2019s drool did not have a reaction on the same level as Tsubaki. We see his love grow for this girl, we see him succumb to his libido, lust after his girlfriend and become possessive of her when she is noticed by other guys. Most people (wether or not you have been in a relationship before) will be able to understand this. This guy is simply a boy who is in love with a girl. Again we see this idea of a simple romance anime done right. And they really have, in the character of Tsubaki we see by his actions and thoughts. This is a guy in love. And because we can relate to that on some level we enjoy him as a character. \\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at Tsubaki\u2019s other half, and by that I mean let\u2019s talk about Urabe Mikito. Urabe is a mysterious girl. If I were to compare her to character in other anime, she similar in some ways to Rikka Takanashi from Chuunibyou. Urabe is mysterious, withdrawn and seemingly doesn\u2019t know how to reciprocate her feelings to Tsubaki. The bond of drool she has with Tsubaki allows her to convey her feelings, sensation, memories and dreams. This allows Urabe to connect with Tsubaki on a different level. By drool he can feel what she feels. And it\u2019s interesting to see the many different ways she expresses herself to Tsubaki by drool. I feel that this bond between them is a level of connection that I haven\u2019t seen in anime before. This is what spices the romance aspect of the anime, and the nature of Urabe as a character as someone who can express her love for Tsubaki through a bond of drool is something so unique, cute and unconventional - yet is easily understood and meaningful to both Tsubaki and Urabe. \\n\\n\r\nSo my final thoughts are - for a romance anime - these characters are done simply and right. Made interesting by their bond of drool. \\n\\n\r\nART \\n\\n\r\nNow when it comes to art I wasn\u2019t really turned away by the idea of two people exchanging drool. The anime does a great job in making drool appetising. Drool is made out to be something like honey. It\u2019s a clear, thick and glistening liquid that apparently tastes sweet. Now because drool is one of the most important features in the anime - I think the studios did well to make drool appetising, otherwise the viewers would cringe every-time they exchanged drool. So the art in general was pretty consistent and good throughout the anime. It was good to see Urabe\u2019s character design, where her hair would mask most of her face so she would appear a bit more mysterious. Whenever her hair moved and we saw her eyes, we were able to see that she is actually quite cute. The art style of the scenery was just as good as the character design and captured that high school lifestyle quite well. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the anime was good, the opening and ending songs were catchy, the voice acting was great and they were able to express the characters feelings very well, when they were flustered, nervous or upset, we were able to understand. The voice actors performed to their characters well. Urabe was quite monotone and quiet, but spoke with confidence and with insecurity when the anime called for it. And tsubaki sounded like an average high school boy like in most other Japanese anime. Overall the sound was great, the voice acting, soundtrack, opening and ending. I honestly can\u2019t find fault in the sound for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT \\n\\n\r\nWhile writing this review, I\u2019m struggling to articulate how amazing this anime is. For a romance anime it did all the simple things right. For a school setting it portrayed the high school scene very well. And for a seinen anime, which is targeted at people my age I thought that the themes were interesting and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nSo what am I\u2019m trying to say? I\u2019m trying to say, if you love simple romance in anime then go watch this anime. The use of drool as a bond between the two main characters is not too strange, and I\u2019ve come to admire and value how drool has bonded them, especially the supernatural elements. It sounds weird coming from me, and of course it is just an anime. But I found it so interesting how drool was used to express feelings and sensation. It\u2019s a level of connection and deepness that is unique to this anime and distinguishes this anime from all other of it\u2019s genre. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed other anime like chuunbyou there are some similarities. \\n\\n\r\nBoth anime have a mysterious girl, who has a bond to the male protagonist, with a school setting. I definitely recommend you give this anime a go and see where it takes you. You\u2019ll be surprised after watching this anime how much you enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\n- Oh yeah, i'd give this anime a 9/10 :)",

            "content": "The description for this show is absolutely terrible. I passed it up several times because I thought it sounded gross and fetishy, but its not. The whole \"addicted to drool\" part has nothing to do with the story, and is poor phrasing for what really turns out to be a super interesting and cool plot device.  The show has a great sound track, superb depth of character for the main cast, and is awesomely weird. The psychological motivation of each character is based on their unique personalities and fields of experience, and they behave very realistically within the framework the author has created forthem. The lead girl Urabe, for example, often does bizarre or outlandish things, but when you get a feel for her personality and how her head works, her decision making feels natural and fluid. Especially her, but all the main cast have an amount of depth to their character that is uncommon in anime (as it is a hallmark of excellent writing). Not to mention the supernatural part is beautifully dusted in and doesn't come across as stupid or forced. And the japanese voice acting is great. Watch this show. Watch until the end of the second episode at least if your skeptical. Really you can start on the second one, you won't miss any important content and the second episode is awesome. Watch this show.",

It was pretty weird and kind of stupid, but I've seen stuff that had more stupid premises and that was nonetheless very good.\r\nThis manga and as such the anime was written by someone who obviously has a drool fetish, but it shouldn't be enjoyable only by people who have that kind of fetish.\r\nThe first episode is about the protagonist feeling sick after tasting the girl's drool. The girlreveals that he's actually feeling love sick and is in withdrawal after he tasted the girl's drool. Okay. That sounds pretty stupid, but you do feel bad when you miss people you love. Urabe properly explains that her saliva isn't magical, he's only in love with her.\\n\\n\r\nThe following eps are then all about generic romance situations, except they solve everything with drool. First date, trip to the beach, situations that look like one of them is cheating ... Everytime, solved by tasting each other's drool. Where in other stories people would struggle to explain their feelings, there, they'd just use their cheap trick.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay and does the job. It never looks bad, but never pretty either.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good. Some songs gave some of that MYSTERIOUS feel, and Urabe's voice was a really nice surprise. It's a quiet,husky yet cute voice, which I thought was really fitting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. The protagonist is as generic he can get. He is not TOO stupid like some protagonist can be though, so i guess he does the job.\\n\r\nUrabe is mysterious. What does that mean ? She doesn't speak much and she has scissors in her panties. Mysterious.\\n\r\nI have no explanation for the X tho.\\n\r\nOne thing that annoys me is that the protag just instantly falls in love with Mikoto after seeing her once and tasting her drool once. Similarly, Urabe is foretold that protag would be her first sexual experience, and she just goes along with it. So they start dating.\\n\r\nThe side characters include protag's BFF and his girlfriend. That girlfriend also seems to fall in love with Urabe for some reason, going as far as keeping a naked picture of Urabe, but that never bothers anyone.\\n\r\nThe protag's older sister looked nice, but she never interacts.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't enjoy the story and I couldn't enjoy the drool fanservice, hence the 3.",

            "content": "Well I remember either on my podcast or on a blog I\u2019ve said I have seen countless numbers of anime school rom-coms and really most of them don\u2019t do anything particularly different\u2026\u2026so to that end let me review this new 2012 anime rom-com that has a different / interesting? concept.\r\nSynopsis\r\nThe series follows two central characters Akira Tsubaki and Mikoto Urabe. Urabe is a transfer student who recently moves into Tsubaki's class. \r\nUrabe\u2019s behaviour is particularly strange and soon gets a reputation for being the class weirdo. Later, Tsubaki finds Urabe asleep in the classroom. After Urabe leaves to go home Tsubaki notices Urabe\u2019s drool leftfrom sleeping and wonders if it\u2019s like a bee tasting honey from a flower\u2026.so he gives it a taste\u2026..and finds it tastes sweet\u2026..(whoa lol)\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki later falls ill thinking he has a cold but is soon confronted by Urabe who claims he has actually contracted love sickness from her drool and after Tsubaki takes another dose of her sweet drool and recovers instantly, so he then comes to accept Urabe\u2019s claim as the truth\\n\\n\r\n What follows is a growing relationship between the two characters that stems from their mutual connection to drool / saliva.\\n\\n\r\nWow that\u2019s Shakespeare writing in the making right there lol\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style has an older look to it imo. The character designs feel a bit more rounded then other slimline character designs I usually see in other typical school rom-coms. Fanservice is not so in your face but it is present in moderation. I did actually like the shows colour scheme especially the sunset scenes which are present in many episodes when the main characters are walking home together \\n\\n\r\nThere are also some cool dream sequences with the characters which I thought where done quite well. So overall I liked the animation style\u2026.which btw is very similar to the manga\u2019s\u2026.also a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nNothing really stood out to me as spectacular here\u2026.i didn\u2019t like the opening theme song\u2026closing theme was alright. The character voices seemed spot on and I did actually like Urabe\u2019s Japanese voice actress as she does sound husky but had a little touch of emotion when needed which was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThis was the saving grace for the show to be honest\u2026particularly with our main characters Urabe and Tsubaki. Urabe to begin with does have a particularly detached personality but not so much where it bugs you out\u2026there are plenty of times she holds a conversation and you can even see she is not a total shut in and does things like swim, go shopping etc\u2026.it seems her main problem is expressing her emotions..which she uses her drool to do\u2026.which to be honest gets very annoying at times as this does not only apply to Tsubaki but even with other girls\u2026.but at the same time I guess it\u2019s consistent.\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki on the other hand seems like your typical puberty stricken\u2026nice boy. He is very friendly and a bit too kind for my liking but to his defence he does often say exactly what\u2019s on his mind and has a couple of believably uncontrollable moments with Urabe.\\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters are also pretty good with believable personalities and do sometimes add to the shows progression\\n\\n\r\nStoryline\\n\\n\r\nOkay so with the synopsis this show will pretty much sound like a Hentai to most but its not. The premise is quite ridiculous but at the same time it is actually an interesting concept that yes is somewhat titillation but is done in a surprisingly passive and matter-of-fact manner that comes off more emotional then sexual. \\n\\n\r\nTo me the drool exchanging and making the emotional connection is the central focus of this show and that is interesting however, I feel apart from that single element this show is ultimately nothing special. I mean in terms of comedy\u2026it\u2019s pretty tepid and most of what\u2019s funny is Tsuabaki and Urabes sexual tension / misunderstandings and to be honest I found myself wondering if that was all that the show would be about and yeah that seems to be the case.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode soon feels like a will they or won\u2019t they and it seems they take two steps forward and one step back in every episode and with rom-coms I like to see either the romance blossom at a decent pace or the comedy to keep me hooked until the story develops more\u2026..well in this case it feels like a ranma-ish show without the emphasis on comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAs a guy watching this I thought to myself if my girlfriend kept on telling me to taste her drool so I can fantasize about her when I got to bed I would loose my fuken mind\u2026I mean it\u2019s cool to be patient until your girl is ready n all but this concept was really hard for me to accept in terms of a real guy putting up with the: look but don\u2019t touch, touch but don\u2019t taste \u2013 taste but don\u2019t swallow element\u2026.so in a nutshell the sexual tension starts to build and feels like a big dose of cock-teasing going on here lol\u2026\u2026..but hey maybe it\u2019s just me that feels that way\u2026\u2026\u2026..lol I doubt it\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nFor 13 episodes it was moderately enjoyable but honestly I was getting impatient with the story progression after a while\u2026..even though its pretty short\\n\\n\r\nValue\\n\\n\r\nWell it\u2019s an okay show\u2026.not sure if it would be anything to talk about if there was no drool connection element but yeah I like the rikey-ness of the story and the characters are very likeable but even after looking at the manga which has been going on for a couple years this show seems to be one of those never-ending rom-coms that intends to re-use it\u2019s formula until everybody gets fed up with it and that\u2019s actually a shame as I think if this was written as a 26 episode show with possibly a more dramatic element it would hit harder but as far as rom-coms go this show really has only two things going for it except comedy\u2026drool and somewhat interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nIma have to give this one a double rating\\n\\n\r\nPlanet Tyro Rating: Watchable / Acquired taste\\n\\n\r\nVisual Version: http://bit.ly/1bTm1DC  \\n\\n\r\nPlanettyro.com",

            "content": "Story:\r\nEveryone at one point in their school life fell in love, and had a girlfriend/boyfriend, and they get awkward with each other and try to\u2026.blah blah blah blah.  The point here is that the theme of this anime is that of the super typical ecchi school romance, with a chance of harem \u2013 of course that part did not develop (thankfully).  Many anime have already squeezed this already-dry theme to the max. However, this particular series manage to find a unique, and rather\u2026 Weird aspect that made it stand out: Saliva. Hmmm\u2026 Ok, we\u2019ve all swapped spit (and potentially other bodily fluids aswell ;D) with a significant other before, but not in a way that the series does it, nor does it evoke the emotions the way they did neither. As strange as it sounds, it becomes more integral as the story progresses, and it becomes the vessel that keeps the characters and the viewers to become emotionally enganged. In short, the saliva swapping is weird, but it grows on you. I was apprehensive at first to continue with this series, but now, I can\u2019t seem to stand it when I don\u2019t see Urabe give Tsubaki her spit; it would lack substance. No pun intended. :P\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe plot for this anime at first didn\u2019t seem to go along with the overall animation of everything, especially the character build.  The animation was old-school; simple facial details, with slightly wild hair (at least for Urabe); the simplistic animation that struck me the most was the eye animation. They were so darn simple! It reminded me my animes from the 1990\u2019s. The animation they chose was definitely something out of an action anime, such as Akira.  Again it was awkward at first. Everything didn\u2019t seem to match. However, this becomes second nature as the simplistic design gives way to the complexity that is\u2026 the spit (oh lawd). I mean if one observes this, it\u2019s plainly obvious that they paid attention to the detail of what a spit should look like: it looked thick, almost gelatinous, yet you can see it trail from Urabe\u2019s mouth to her finger, with slight grace \u2013 Yes\u2026 I\u2019m describing DROOL!!!  It works though!\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nNot going to lie, the background music in the anime drives me nuts, even now that I\u2019m 8 episodes in.  It just seemed to me that it overpowers through everything else that\u2019s going on. It\u2019s too loud in my opinion, and any other special effects get distorted.  That\u2019s just my quirk. However, the Opening, I liked. It was pop-like and it definitely sounded something out of the 90\u2019s for me. Sometimes old school music will just beat any modern day music.  This, along with the old school animation just works, and works well. The Ending? I LOVE IT!!! It\u2019s jazzy and pop-like while still being laid back, along with the rather\u2026 sexy shots of the women involved in the anime. It surely adds to the overall \u201cdrool-ish\u201d theme of the whole series in a way, and the lyrics, they contribute to the romance even more. Loved the Ending the most. :D\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development in this series is a bit simplistic, although for a 13-episode one, it\u2019s good enough: two classmate, one introvert, and one extrovert meet at odds with one another, and one of them (the guy) becomes interested. They start going out and things happen, and they discover \u201chow to love\u201d and \u201chow to be the proper bf/gf\u201d. Sounds generic right? Well, it is, but again the whole spin about \u201cswapping spit\u201d gives this an edge. Per-character wise, it\u2019s also generic for the most part, except for Urabe.\\n\r\nThe lead male Tsubaki is your typical guy that kinda struggles in school, has a friend that he shares manly interests in and has those urges, like any boy in his age. He\u2019s chivalrous but at the same time a little too innocent for his own good.  \\n\r\nThe lead female Urabe, however, is anything but simple. She started out weird, as she never talks to anyone, and is very private, while almost dwelling in her own world (as seen in the first episode + hiding scissors in her underwear), and just plain creepy to others.  Her progression to \u201cnormalcy\u201d though is interesting as her friend Oka, who happens to be the girl friend of Tsubaki\u2019s best friend Ueno, gives her the push she needs in order to become a \u201cbetter girlfriend\u201d.  Their interactions \u2013 including swapping spit \u2013 are anything but typical. But they work.\\n\r\nOka is probably the most notable supporting character as she is basically the main catalyst to what\u2019s happening between Urabe and Tsubaki. Her rather aggressive way of socializing with Urabe really becomes the backdrop of Urabe\u2019s actions, either explicitly or suggestively. She\u2019s just LOVES to teas Urabe, that it\u2019s so cute, and almost yuri. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis series might throw people off, it might even make other\u2019s eyes twitch, as no one in their right mind (at least in our society) would just get a wad of drool from their mouth and make someone else eat it.  However, this is what separates the anime from other school romance animes out there. Does it work? Of course it does, or else I\u2019d just drop it. It\u2019s a unique way of conveying one\u2019s series, though not necessarily sanitary(?). Overall, the simplistic, yet riveting character progression is really the aspect that one has to look for, especially for Urabe, as it\u2019s probably the most extreme relative to her everyone else\u2019s.  The OP was very good, and the ED, I\u2019ll be getting the full version definitely. Overall it\u2019s something that has truth in its theme, while giving it a weird twist. Altogether, the series has definitely been something that I\u2019ve been participating throughout this season. \\n",

The synopsis and premise of the story is enough to raise your eyebrow (and possibly retch) before moving on.  This would be a mistake.  Like B Gata H Kei, the precis fails to do justice to the wonderful romantic story that lies within.\r\nThe combination of retro late-80's art and beautifully melodic musical themes with the surreal nature of Tsubaki's dreams are near on a masterpiece.\r\nGranted, the saliva swapping scenes may make some viewers nauseated but if you can deal with that, you will fall intoa captivating series.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, this is not an ecchi anime and I am little disappointed to see it tagged with that because it will certainly push viewers away.  I found myself watching the whole series in one go such was the addictive nature of the story.

            "content": "This is my first review so stay with me on this please.\r\nBefore I start I would like to say I will admit that it is an anime that is probably not for everyone and is a little weird at times but if you can get past the first 2 or 3 episodes then I can say that you will probably enjoy it.\r\n Mysterious Girlfriend X holds a special place in my heart. Why you may ask, because of the story it tells and how much I think people who have been in a relationship for the first time can relate to it and find itrelatable.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 10 : The story follows Akira Tsubaki a normal high school boy who finds himself in a relationship with the strange and peculiar Mikoto Urabe who has just transferred into his class and is a loner for the most part. One day he has a weird dream that prompts him to taste Mikoto's drool and making him fall in love with her and need her drool to keep going. After tasting her drool and forming a strange pact with Mikoto, Tsubaki decides that his feelings for Mikoto are real and asks her to go out with him making her his girlfriend and the story then follows the struggles and un-knownigness of a first time relationship and how bonds no matter how strange they may be keep people together and show how important some special people are to us.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8 : The art style is unusual for me but I still enjoyed it. It was easy for the eyes and even though there wasn't that much need for major animation or artistic need it did a good job and creating a easy and relaxable feeling while watching which I enjoyed a lot\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10 : The sound and Op and Ed songs were really well done. I found myself watching and listening to the Op and Ed songs on each episode which for me is a rarity. The sound and voice acting throughout the series I found to be  perfect for it  and made me enjoy it so much more than I was already enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10 : Now this is where the story thrives at the main characters Akira Tsubaki and  Mikoto Urabe both share a strange bond and throughout the series you learn no matter how strange the two may have seemed at the beginning they both have real world problems they deal with and the problems that arise and anxiety of being in a relationship for the first time.\\n\\n\r\nAkira Tsubaki is more over a normal high school boy who doesn't have that many friends other than Ueno, Kouhei. He isn't all that popular and just seems average which I find relatable and the plites that he has in past and present crushes and relationships that he has had.\\n\\n\r\nMikoto Urabe for the most part throughout the series is as the title says a mysterious girlfriend. Not much is revealed about her unless I talk about spoilers which I refuse to do. Anyways for the most part she is a very loner type of girl who doesn't seem to have any friends at all and doesn't make any attempt to make any either. And even goes as far to say to Tsubaki that he is the only person she needs. Even though she seems like a inscrutable person and hard to approach she is still a girl and has normal feelings as one even if she doesn't act all the time like a regular girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 : The enjoyment I got out of watching this series is unfathomable; even though I had class early the next morning when I started this series I stayed awake just to finish it because of how much I enjoyed watching it and how I just didn't want it to end and even took up reading the manga even though I don't really read manga all that much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 : Overall if you are looking for a good romance story and one with the unknowngness that comes with being in a relationship for the first time I highly recommend this anime. If you are a romance and or drama lover then this is also a very good anime to watch. All I have to say even though it has a weird synopsis about tasting drool all I can say is if you can get past the first 2 or 3 episodes then you should be able to get through this anime and I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy this anime as much as I have. I highly recommend that you give this a watch if you are even thinking about watching it. \\n\\n\\n",

Each episode felt pretty unique/quirky, mysterious, and even suspenseful at times. I found it quite refreshing amongst a backdrop of many other overly clich\u00e9d romances out there. Although, it could be better if the characters were a bit older and perhaps more atmospheric music was woven into the background. The tension between the characters doesn't really need to be held up by any more music to be as wonderful as it is though. It definitely earns its R rating though considering some scenes but itseems to almost have fun/jokes with itself in the process so it's quite entertaining.",

            "content": "They talk about kissing and sex the very first episode, but all they do throughout the entire show is putting fingers in mouths of each other. And other people's mouths. Because apparently when you taste someone's spit, it makes you feel what they feel at the moment or something like that, I don't know why, but I'm like 30% sure there's a completely logical scientific explanation behind all that. \r\nI liked the way romance works here, licking your fingers and putting them in someone's mouth is the symbol of intimacy instead of kissing, which is pretty much a french kiss, only instead of putting yourtongue in someone's mouth, you put your finger in there, no matter how many times you wiped your a** with them that day, how many times you picked your nose or touched the handles in bus acquiring some healthy dose of hepatitis. Just make them lick it off and let them feel your feelings and later on, diarrhea. But yeah, sharing bacteria with others is kinda intimate I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, after a pretty entertaining start due to an original idea of romance, it gets stale real fast and becomes your everyday regular slice of life slash romance slash comedy slash ecchi anime. Tsundere heroine? Check. Stupid, easily controllable MC? Check. Very slow romantic progress? Check.  \\n\r\nSummarized and counted altogether, we got a solid 6/10 captain.",

Most others assume these loners have pent up rage or have some horrible past. On rare occasions others will recruit them for their close circles or these people will form extremely close bonds with a few individuals that they have almost nothing in common with.\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X was a title I was skeptical about simply because it involves bodily fluids. After finishing this I feel it is the most undervalued title of the spring 2012 season. A story of amysterious slow moving romance revolving around drool, now thats original. \\n\\n\r\nIn the current anime industry originality is rare to come across, a good title will appear once in a blue moon.\\n\\n\r\nDrool romance being what I'd like the call the theme probably set off an equal amount of disgust and enjoyment from all parties. The ratings certainly show this is the case. I like how Urabe and Akira meet through this strange idea of drool tasting and how its the basis of their relationship. A lot of romances now a days are based of visual novels that are generally harems, and they tend to become dull after too many are adapted. I particularly enjoyed this shows originality and everything it offered.\\n\\n\r\nThe environment of the story had a dark, gothic feel to it which again would put many viewers off. The carnival dreams that these two hard were probably what interested me the most. The sounds for most of the settings was similar to this dream space and it was almost eerie. A lot of romances feature songs with vocals and light instrumentals but this brought a new sound the table, while dull it was interesting none the less. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation style and old school theme songs is probably where this series was hurt the most. The majority of the new anime audience is attached to the post 2,000 genres of big eyes, large faces and colorful representations. While its a plus in the originality department a lot of fans are looking for new, not old. Another problem this show suffered from was the slow pace and dull VA acting. The pace was grueling and the romance aspect lacked in a traditional sense of what you have come to expect from rom-com's or straight romance. The progress of these two was limited by a bond of drool, and they barely made it out of first base minus naked middle school sweet heart.\\n\\n\r\nNone the less I enjoyed this every step of the way, rarely do we see something new and unusual. The anime industry should focus more on the new and unusual. More titles could gain excellence if they stepped out of boundaries more often that are not set by the best sellers.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a dark and unusual romance, you might just enjoy Mysterious Girlfriend X.",

Assuming the people reading this review already read the synopsis on this page, I'll go ahead and say this, The synopsis is a little misguiding, but true to a certain extent, It isn't just drool but a psychic link that passes on Emotional and Physical changes. That being said.\r\nDo not be fooled or disturbed when this mysterious girl \"Urabe Mikoto\" shares her saliva with \"Akira Tsubaki\", Or do not be fully drawn to the plot either, Due to the beauty of this anime lies on the actionof the characters and the true face of romance. This anime carries a very important hidden message, You need to look past the plot, It isn't what seems to be.\\n\\n\r\nI'm trying not to spoil anything, But i'll say this \"Mysterious Girlfriend X or Nazo no Kanojo X\" It's a masterpiece romance message, It shoots straight at our current belief of romance, Or what we believe it's structure is and shatters it right on our faces and reveals an inconvenient truth about our perception and marketing of romance. As Romance nowadays is branded with steps and marketed with stereotype conduct to the people.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of this anime you'll no the difference between \"True Romance\" and  \"Methodical Romance\" You'll hopefully know by episode 3, If you don't you can message me and i'll tell you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i gave this anime a 10, It's a true masterpiece. It's a well deep thought anime whose beauty lies on perception. I recommend this to anime viewers who always seek to perceive more than the plot or story, or are dazzled or annoyed by visuals. Also if you want to know a thing or two about romance this anime is the one you want.",

Tsubaki and Urabe are every bit as unsure of their relationship as first lovers should be and they approach each other with a refreshing nervousness and intensity.\r\nYou may be turned off by the premise.

            "content": "This was such a strange one...\r\nOkay, so to start. Yes, this is an anime that revolves around saliva. Yes, this is really weird during the first few episodes. However I can say that you likely will get desensitized to it as you progress. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story begins with a boy tasting the drool left on a girl's desk. Not your typical romantic decision, but that's apparently somewhat normal in this universe (given that other characters also share spit in this show). This leads to our MC getting into a relationship with the girl, though it starts as pretty much just him tasting her drool everyday. This is the point where I feel most people would drop the show. It's just such a strange idea to wrap your head around, not to mention how gross most people think it is. However, the story progresses into a quite healthy romance (for an anime), and since I'm a sucker for good romances, I'm giving it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is alright, but not amazing given that this was released in 2012. The art looks more like one would see from the early 2000s. Not awful, not amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nPersonally, I love the way the soundtrack and background music adds to the feel of an anime. This show does a wonderful job in this regard, with a musical accompaniment that seems to come out of the opening to a -- get this -- mystery movie. It's all very Tim Burton-esque, as if we're playing with Victorian-era dolls in an abandoned mansion. This all makes the story run so well, especially in the beginning of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were wonderful and all had their own place in the show. Urabe especially, was an excellently made character, though at first it seems as if she was randomly thought up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAfter I got through the first three episodes or so, it was all uphill. Every interaction we got between the MC and his love interest felt so realistic (apart from the spit of course), and it was a fairly healthy relationship where the couple understood their limits and did their best not to rush anything or cross lines. The communication shown was also something not often seen in romances (though there's one episode where this is not the case, but I will not say which). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a solid 9/10 for an extremely original idea that the creators managed not only to not mess up, but to make it into one of my top 5 romances. Good job creators, you got me to enjoy a love story about drinking saliva!",

            "content": "The more I think about this series, the more I realize just how much I liked it. On the surface, Mysterious Girlfriend X is pretty much your standard high-school romantic comedy, insomuch as many of the characters and situations are almost universal within the genre, yet right out of the gate, it's obvious that there's something unusual going on here.\r\nTsubaki Akira is in every way, your typical high-school boy. He's inexperienced, and awkward as hell, but he's also a nice average guy, with nice, average friends, and living a nice, average high-schooler's life.\r\nUntil that is, the day a new transfer student arrives in his classand turns his existence upside-down.\\n\r\nUrabe Mikoto is that transfer student, and her unorthodox appearance, and curt demeanor immediately set her apart from the rest of the class, a distance which only widens when she displays some of her quirky behaviors, such as sleeping at her desk through lunch, and laughing uproariously, seemingly at nothing during class. \\n\r\nAnd yet Tsubaki can't help but find her fascinating...\\n\\n\r\nIt's not too long after Urabe's arrival that the weird amps up and we're introduced to the concept on which the series is based, and the one that makes this series a little squirmy for a lot of people.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it's drool.\\n\\n\r\nOne day after class, Tsubaki realizes he's left something in class and, upon returning to pick it up, he finds Urabe still sleeping at her desk long after everyone else has gone home for the day. \\n\r\nTsubaki can't help but notice the puddle of drool Urabe is lying in, and waking her up, sends her on her way, but then finds himself transfixed by the glistening pool of saliva she's left behind and...\\n\r\ntastes it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the point where a lot of people make their decision on Mysterious Girlfriend X and choose either to move on to another show, or stick tight to see where this could possibly be heading. Those who choose the former are really doing themselves a disservice, because if you can get over the whole \"ick\" factor, what takes place from that point on is actually something pretty unique and special in the realm of anime rom-com.\\n\\n\r\nTwo weeks pass after the \"drool episode\" and life settles back into the familiar routine of teenage life. Tsubaki finds himself even more fascinated by the mysterious Urabe, but being your typical awkward high-schooler, nothing comes of it until one day he's mysteriously stricken with a fever and passes out during gym class. Several days pass and Tsubaki's condition continues to worsen, forcing him to miss classes and remain in bed suffering from all the symptoms of a terrible cold and fever.\\n\r\nBut Urabe knows differently, and showing up at his home one afternoon, explains that what he's suffering from isn't a cold at all, but in fact is withdrawal. She's correctly deduced that on the day Tsubaki found her sleeping in class in a puddle of drool, he must have tasted it after she left, and, after two weeks without tasting it again, has developed a serious case of \"love sickness\".\\n\r\nTsubaki tries to deny of course, but ultimately admits to his actions at which point Urabe calmly announces that his illness can be cured, and all he needs is another taste of her drool. Tsubaki freaks of course, but eventually relents, allowing Urabe to insert her drool covered finger into his mouth.\\n\r\nAnd sure enough, he's immediately cured.\\n\\n\r\nThis begins their ongoing relationship, and henceforth they meet on a daily basis after school and perform the daily ritual of Urabe providing Tsubaki with a drool covered finger to suck on in order to maintain his equilibrium.\\n\\n\r\nTime passes and we see more of Urabe's eccentricities, such as her \"panty-scissors\" and uncanny skill with them. We're also introduced to some of the supporting cast that make the series so much fun, in the form of Tsubaki's best friend, Ueno Kouhei and his adorable, yet quirky girlfriend, Oka Ayuko.\\n\\n\r\nMysterious Girlfriend X is unusual in many ways. The character design is a bit of a throwback to decades past, being nowhere near as pretty as many current series such as Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai or Chuunibyou, but the characters and scenery are definitely attractive.\\n\r\nThere's the whole \"drool\" factor of course, and the implied theme of dependence that comes with Tsubaki's withdrawal pains in the first episode.\\n\r\nBut what I found the most unusual and seemingly contradictory was the comparatively high level of fanservice.  Mysterious Girlfriend X is in so many ways a sweet and innocent story of first love, and the fanservice seemed almost diametrically opposed to that sweetness. \\n\r\nYet somehow it worked.\\n\r\nThere's no denying there's a lot of panty-shots (how could you have \"Panty-scissors\" be a recurring and important story element without them?), boob shots ( still can't figure out how anime high-school girls can look like skinny 14 year olds in their uniforms, and Playboy center-folds in a bathing suit! lol!), and more sexual allusion and innuendo than you can shake a stick at, yet it never felt gratuitous like it did in Haganai.\\n\r\nWith very few exceptions, the fanservice was integral to the story-line and made sense being there, and let's face it, what 17 year old highschool boy isn't obsessed with sex?\\n\r\nFor all the fanservice and innuendo, Girlfriend was never leering or lecherous.\\n\r\nYeah, there's plenty there for those who appreciate fanservice, but really, this anime was incredibly sweet and endearing, and to be honest, gave a pretty accurate portrayal of just how awkward and inept most of us were at that age.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, I'd highly recommend this series to anyone who loves a sweet and innocent love story. Honestly, people might think I'm nuts comparing it to Clannad, but despite it's brevity (a mere 13 episodes) and admittedly racier aspects, this is still a wonderfully funny and innocent tale of two awkward teenagers falling in love and working through the issues that come with discovering and dealing with some pretty overwhelming new emotions, so man-up and deal with the drool.\\n\r\nYou'll be glad you did! :) \\n",

            "content": "Since the ancient hellinistic dramas, through Romeo & Juliet, lots of romantic novels, movies, and finally in almost every anime. It's really unthinkable that there could still be any fresh and original idea for a romance. But suddenly it turns out that there's one series with completely new concept, so simple, that no one else would come up with the same idea. Nazo Kanojo X.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nContinuing the thought, if you watch a romance there are usually just a few possibilities: there are two lovers, for some reason not able to be together; there are boy and girl that need n episodes to confess loveto each other, proceeding with kiss ending the series; there's \"date me\" proceeded with \"have sex with me\"; there's some love triangle, rectangle or any other awkward polygon, where everything is about settling, who is the 'right' partner to whom.\\n\\n\r\nThe action usually takes place in high school. How many of situations presented above happened to you or someone you know during that period? If at least one, you're already a rare case. Whereas thinking of romantic love or sex is common among teenagers, usually there only are pairs, that are going out together and enjoy themselves. It's just natural. So, you ask why these don't happen in any form of novels, movies, anime? Because authors know that common stories won't sell. Something unusual is just way more appealing to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nNazo Kanojo X is an anime about a boy who falls in love with a girl. The 'love' is declared already in 1st episode and the rest of the series focus on them going together, showing every situation seemingly unimportant to the observer yet vital for them. Situations that seem completely usual, but hardly seen in any kind of media at all. Why? Because, as I already said, media tend to focus on three thing in romances: Confession, Kiss and Sex. The rest in between, which doesn't lead straight to one of these 'checkpoints' is supposed to be unimportant and either missed or treated as 'additional bonus'.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is episodic but not to the degree where you can skip an episode by mistake and not notice that. I would still mention a negative thing here, though: Because of this, the ending is an open one, which is annoying for most of people (\"Will there be a sequel, or it'll just stay like this?\")\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the story itself, it mainly focuses on drool. \"What?\" you probably just thought if you neither saw the series nor read the description. Yes, here we are proceeding into the 'weird' part. Instead of kissing, for which the main couple is \"unready yet\" they are exchanging saliva. It bears a role of bond between characters, and they're able to transfer their feelings through it. Well, it's said that \"You don't need words to understand a person you love.\" Here it's interpreted a bit literally, or to be more precise, literally in strange way.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where originality begins and where disgusted viewers give up on watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole drool thing as well as main female character, Urabe Mikoto, are in complete contrast to the rest of the world, what makes the whole thing even better in book. Although it may be annoying as well - Depends on the person.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I already said, Urabe is, well, unusual. Not to mention that her drool is linking the whole story together, which is odd enough, she has remarkable scissor skills and sleeps all time during breaks in school. Despite she rather enjoy drool exchange, she thinks that she and her boyfriend aren't ready for kiss. She doesn't like hugs either. Her eyes are hidden under long fringe, she doesn't seem to have any friends either. Have you noticed that this part (since not being ready for kiss) isn't THAT unusual. So in the end she is just some lonely girl, who happened to find a boyfriend, who she can exchange drool (yay!) with. And so she begins to be likeable and we start to understand Tsubaki, who chose her over 'standard' girls.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Tsubaki he is 'dear-japanese-virgin-watching-this-anime-you-can-personalise-yourself-with-me' type of character. And he does this job surprisingly well. Used to standard romances, he have problems with understanding unusual (or maybe not?) way of Urabe's thinking. Well, men is trying to understand women (and vice versa) since prehistory to no avail.\\n\\n\r\nAs of rest of the cast: Oka, Urabe's friend (and Tsubaki's friend's girlfriend), often 'test' Urabe's ideas with her boyfriend out of curiosity. Save for her and one another girl, other characters neither know about main couple's relationship nor tend to act weird.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art. The backgrounds are well made, everything is full of details. Animation is ok, still it's not something crucial for such genre.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if I were to rate the character designs, they, well, aren't really pretty. Just take a look at the picture. Is it problem? Nope, it'd rather say it's even a positive aspect. Nowadays, anime creators rely hard on characters' 'moe-level'. They (obviously?) want them to appeal to audience as well as they can, not only with their character but the look. Nazo Kanojo X doesn't show us world made pretty girls and handsome boys. Why? Because real world doesn't look like this. So it makes this anime even more realistic in it's oddity. Also, it's like throwing down the gauntlet to other creators saying \"We don't need pretty girls to attract people to our show, and you?\". Nevertheless, it's also another way to repel potential viewers, not accepting series with non-moe characters. This may however be appreciated by fan of style from '80s and '90s.\\n\\n\r\nAs of music, it's hardly noticeable during the show. Opening is very optimistic, motivating to watch the series, whereas ending is more calm and nostalgic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and other aspects - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI can easily tell that the series is enjoyable as long as you don't mind seeing saliva every now and then, don't mind the fact the characters don't look like taken from K-On or IM@S and aren't too sceptic about romances overall.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could speak of other flaws, it would be a little bit of fanservice. However it's not provided in a form of just another ecchi comedy, but more to emphasize the sexuality appearing in every love affair, even these without any kisses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this anime is really realistic in its complete absurdity. It shows love as it is in completely unusual way. This \"way\" may be both good or bad. In my opinion, it's great one, but even so it'll be best for you to just watch it and decide about it yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal grade: 9 of 10",

Fetishes only look worse when they're portrayed in an unattractive manner. Even putting Urabe in a swimsuit is disturbing simply because she is, simply put, ugly. In conclusion, if you don't mind really ugly characters in romance and a drool fetish, this anime should be fine. However, if these things don't sound very attractive, I would stay away from this show.",

But here I want to add my opinion that every romantic comedy anime, you must seen every type of girls (tsundere, kuudere, yandere). But this anime's heroine is unique one, not your typical everydays tsundere girl. Urabe is most sincere and genuine ever if you talking about her feeling to his boyfriend. If you break her heart in spesific ways, she never complain but you can't guess her being okay while the reality its make her hurt. Maybe you think she's weak girl? You make a big mistake. If youmake wrong moves, touch her or wnat to hugs her suddenly, her panty scissor will traumatized you. Martial arts \\n\r\n+ scissor = ??\\n\\n\r\nRegards",

But somehow I came across the anime recently and I'm glad that I gave it another try. \r\nLet's keep this short & sweet~\r\nFirst of all I have to say that this is not something suitable for the light hearted and narrow minded. The story is very unique and original. It is not your usual high school romance comedy. This is more like mature slice of life. The protagonists are somewhat odd yet interesting. And the situations they go through are sweet and mostly weird. \r\nDrool plays a bigpart in here. So if you are easily rattled by such things you may not like Nazo no Kanojo X. But drool is just a symbolism used throughout the anime to suggest the bond, our main couple shares. It's more like a passionate kiss. The characters's growth is well depicted and the pinch of humor soothes your mind to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nHowever one thing that I didn't like in Nazo no Kanojo X was the graphics and visuals. They looked a bit old and outdated. I guess that's a given though. It's not too bad but I have been too accustomed to modern graphics-that's the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Nazo no Kanojo X is really memorizing. I'm still listening to the OSTs. However I think that it would have been better if they have used a different voice actress to play the female protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nIn short Nazo no Kanojo X was a great watch. I encourage the daring anime lovers to watch this and travel to a weird new world full of enjoyment.",

            "content": "Having first read the manga back in late 2007, like most people who looked at this, I was put off by the whole 'drool' thing but unlike most people I still gave it a chance because there's the element of curiosity. How can they turn this into a story? Where can this thing possibly go? I had a read I found myself unable to stop. This is a true gem. And the anime adaptation was a special treat to see the characters move and talk.\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nStory:\r\nThe story revolves around the main characters, Akira Tsubaki and Mikoto Urabe who have relationship where they share a special 'bond'through the exchange of saliva. This allows them read each others feelings, thoughts, and dreams. In the world of this anime, the 'bond' is determined by the taste of the drool and how one party reacts to it. \\n\\n\r\nThey go through different issues and that can occur in real life relationships, and because they're young, it gives the feel of 'discovery'.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing isn't fast and it's not slow, it always gets to the point so you likely wont sit there being bored to death or missing anything.\\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nUnique, looks quite different from most anime series. It's a simplistic look but the characters, particularly Urabe have the element of elegance. The artists clearly try to get the most out of this design without making it look cheap.\\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music isn't something I'd want to download and listen to but at the same time it does a great job in setting the mood for each scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA's do a great job. I cannot think of a better cast to play these characters. Especially Urabe, played by newcomer Ayako Yoshitani. She can sound quiet and reserved but when displaying a variety of emotion, she can do it without sounding forced. \\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters seen in this anime may come off as familiar, used in butt-loads of anime. Urabe is the quiet depressing girl, Tsubaki is the underconfident male lead. BUT these cliches worked for the story. It took the dull and familiar and made it interesting again and made great use of it. \\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhat may sound sickening to people actually comes off as 'cute' in this anime. It's possible to get used to the drool thing and actually enjoy it. It's great when a show takes such risks, gives it a feel of uniqueness. This series reminded me why I like Japanese comics and animation, they can be weird, they can be odd, they can be cool, they can be ANYTHING. And that's really good every once in a while.\\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe anime is a great watch, the manga is a great read. Unlike shonen action series that tend to drag on and on and on like Naruto and Bleach, (or seinen in the case of Gantz). My only problem is that the anime is ONLY 13 episodes while the manga is still going and certain events from the manga are left out, probably so as not to leave anything unresolved. But it is loyal to the original work for the most part so you can watch the anime and continue the manga from where it left off.\\n\\n\r\nSolid 4/5",

I normally do not watch these types of anime but this has really changed my perspective on the genre itself. The story itself I find very original and before I go into it anymore if you give this anime a try there one thing you will have to get past and I know some folks can not and that is the swapping of drool between the two main characters once see past that you can move on. The art workand sound I give it a 10 because the voice acting for the Japanese version was outstanding I enjoyed Yoshitani, Ayako as Urabe it was sexy and sweet and Irino, Miyu as Tsubaki was the best compliment  of all. I really felt a connection with the characters as the story developed over the course of the show. I overly enjoyed  myself watching this anime than reading the manga which came to an end in September of 2014 I was really sad to see it end but that also shows how great an anime and manga this was. Give this one a chance I am 29 years old and this anime brought me into this genre which I never really was interested in the first place. Give this one a chance and lets be real the swapping of drool is no different from kissing with tongue so just look past that concept because that what makes this story so unique!",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAfter Midori Days I didn't think I'd find another weird Romance anime like that again, then surprisingly months down the line I find this and once again it had a weird concept, but ended up being very entertaining.\r\nThe story concentrates on Mikoto Urabe and Akira Tsubaki, they have a special relationship that consists of them tasting each others drool, even though this a weird thing to do it has a special meaning to this mysterious couple.\r\nYes the story for this anime couple is centred around them tasting their own drool, now at first I thought it was weird, but the more I watchedthe show the more intriguing it got because there was actually a special meaning to this and it was interesting to see that they could feel each others feelings if they tasted each others drool and this would be a major part to their relationship and overtime it would also be a reason to test their relationship, this is another one of those anime's that relies on random intervals to keep the show going so it doesn't really have a major plot, but it is mainly about the development between Urabe and Tsubaki which in my opinion was actually very interesting and enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the characters especially Urabe and Tsubaki because despite both of these characters having a weird side to them like Urabe would carry scissors under her skirt and rip something whenever Tsubaki did something that made her uncomfortable and Tsubaki is weird just by the fact he tasted Urabe's drool while she was sleeping, but these two when they are together was really sweet at times because there are moments in their relationship that hits a bump like when Tsubaki takes advantage of Urabe in a situation, but then realises his mistake and not just apologises, but also asks her to slap him, Urabe also thinks of Tsubaki a lot when she experiences something that she hasn't before and wants to experience it with him and this shows that both of them generally care for each other a lot and it was a relationship I could definitely get behind despite the drool tasting, but that seemed more normal (well for this show) over time.\\n\r\nThere are also two supporting characters Oka and Ueno who are both in a relationship as well and are best friends with Tsubaki and Urabe, Oka gives Urabe relationship advice to her and teases her from time to time because of her shy side and it shows she wanted to help her plus she also had a weird obsession with wrapping foods with bacon and Ueno was Tsubaki's best friend and would sometimes be the cause of some incidents between Urabe and Tsubaki, but he felt like a good friend nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe Artstyle reminded me of older anime's from the early 2000's so it gave off a nostalgic feel, but probably the most interesting part of the artstyle was Tsubaki's dreams now it was mostly CGI however it looked incredibly weird in a good way and seemed so strange to make me think that dreams could look like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance was really good the relationship between Urabe and Tsubaki was weird yet really sweet and it was definitely put to the test a lot like when Tsubaki wanted to kiss Urabe or when Tsubaki encountered an old crush who also had feelings for him so a standoff between her and Urabe happened which was certainly and an interesting way of how it went down, certainly different compared to other Romance anime's.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this was a great show that shows another weird perspective in the Romance genre that turned out to be really good, so if you're someone looking for a weird, but wonderful show then this will definitely be a good watch for you.",

            "content": "Here's what I think precipitated the premise of the manga/anime:\r\nAfter a long night at the bar slamming drinks, the manga artist starts thinking about sex like any red-blooded Japanese guy would. \"Hey,\" he says to his inebriated buddy as they stagger to the train station, \"kissing is pretty disgusting when you think about it, isn't it? I mean, you're licking someone else's saliva, and come to think of it, you use your fingers when--\" \"Hey,\" his buddy interrupts with a slight slur in his words, \"don't you think it'd be cool if school girls carried some kind of weapon in their panties? I mean, it'snot like those uniforms have pockets.\" \"What kind of weapon?\" \"I dunno, a pair of scissors? You know how they say, never run with scissors.\" (Disclaimer: These are 2 fictitious drunk men in my imagination. And I imagine most guys have no idea whether sailor-suit dresses have pockets or not.)\\n\\n\r\nYes, I firmly believe that some form of intoxication, or a really crazy dream, would need to be involved to come up with premises as crazy and hilarious as these. Obliquely, this show's about a guy who learns how to behave around girls in a time before cell phones were ubiquitous, it's just the methods chosen are, shall we say, unusual.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story is concerned, well, it's probably best not to take it seriously. Personally I found the \"relationship Calvinball\" aspect of it funny, but if bodily fluids is not your thing, well, at least you have something in common with at least 1 US president and 1 German chancellor (it's not much of a compliment)-- this is one show that might make the squeamish run away screaming. If the character of Mikoto doesn't appeal to you, find another show, stat. Without her, the show is excruciatingly dull, and Akira most of all, because he, like fans of the show/manga, are wondering just WTF is up with Mikoto. Other than her 2 quirks, she is written as an assertive, yet reserved, young woman, defensive of her boundaries and yet very much a high school girl with the insecurities and fears that entails. I'm not as keen on the rival girls-- one just wants Akira because she wants to take him away from Mikoto, and the other just wants to mess with him. Not a whole lot of depth until the closing episodes.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the production reproduces the manga's general character design. Some of the dream sequences are very well done-- the symbolism and imagery are some of the best in anime outside of Miyazaki films and Shaft productions. There was a \"sunset\" scene that overdid the color grading in the broadcast (I don't remember if it was toned down in the disc release)-- it looked like the Sun was in red giant phase. Otherwise the sunsets (a recurring visual theme) are rendered well, flooding background and characters with orange light. It'll look a bit intense if you watch at night and use a color temperature altering app like f.lux.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a bit like a Tim Burton film (Edward Scissorhands?), at times accompanying the animation with a waltz, at times a simple march with a string orchestra + piano in the style of Prokofiev, or atmospheric riffs reminiscent of radio drama; while simply arranged, the music was a great background to the show. Edit: Oh, right, the drum solo during Mikoto Scissorhands scenes. That was hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is one of my favorite anime songs, this one reminiscent of mid-1990s anime songs, and the accompanying animation completes a catchy music video. Not as keen on the ending theme, but at least the stills of the girls in the show drooling while sleeping is funny. Well, to me at least.\\n\\n\r\nThis romcom had me laughing pretty hard, and I found the pairing of Mikoto and Akira adorable. If you let the drool thing be this thing that Mikoto does, it's a fairly straightforward show to watch.",

This is a major plot point in the manga that she was hard to read the entire time, and her smile was a rarity. This was something I definitely missed in the anime. However on a brighter note I was expecting the art to be severely diminished in the anime (specifically dreams), but I wasdefinitely not disappointed, in fact I was delighted, the scenes I loved in the manga were I would say even better in the anime.

            "content": "Hi guys. I m here to give a review on this Very Unpopular and underrated anime. I will go in the order that You MAL users like to read in.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nJust like any anime this one starts with a guy and his daily routine and his extremely ordinary fantasies. Then the most cliche anime happening occurs. A female transfer student who apparently gets to sit exactly near our protagonist. Like any other anime character who is supposed to look weird to the audience she tries her best to stand out in every scene. This is done by either making her laugh spontaneously or makingher sleep during recess. But then why did I give a 9 to the story. Well after some point the anime takes a strange/unique turn. This is where drool/saliva comes in.\\n\r\nThe protagonist licks our heroins drool when she leaves class after sleeping there. And he gets attracted to it and yabdy yabdy yaa something odd happens (which u guys should see urselfs) and they end up as saliva sharing girlfriend-boyfriend. \\n\r\nThe story goes on to many different happenings around the couple as they try to keep their \"bond\" a secret. We see the usual gags that can be easily seen in any other anime. Then how is this good. You should see that for yourself now shouldnt you.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nI am no Master of Arts (lol) but the art was like any other anime. I will leave the decision up to you coz i don't really like to say things about something i have no idea of. There were drawn people and lots of colours on my computer screen thats it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10\\n\r\nSkipped every OP and ED. They were just irritating. The way the singer said \"SECRET LOVE\" was just annoying as hell. Who made her a singer. BGM was almost unnoticeable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nOnly once a long time there are anime with unique characters. And Nazo no Kanojo was not one of those anime. The characters were your usual Perverted loner with only one friend who is always hanging around him, A mysterious transfer student (Like every second anime has one) etc etc. But the characters never got on your nerves. It was enjoying to see how they go on with the happenings around them. I am not saying they are unique or different but they are not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 9/10\\n\r\nIf you are someone that judges anime by their sound/art Then Get lost and never see anime again. You guys disgust me. Anime should be judged by its Enjoyment only. The source of enjoyment is the Story and the Characters. And that is something no one of us can change. Strangely this anime is really fascinating and i enjoyed it very much. I dont have (and i dont need) a particualr reason for enjoying this anime. I dont want to waste time thinking of one but for your sake here goes. You might like this anime if -\\n\r\n- You like Rom/com with considerable amount of ecchi\\n\r\n- You like the usual anime stuff and the usual comedy stuff\\n\r\n- You can take in a little dose of disgusting things along with the story\\n\r\n- You like short haired anime females\\n\r\n- You like to wait for romance development. \\n\\n\r\nWork on these for now.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not unique or different from your everyday anime. Nothing other than Saliva is different here. So don't watch if you ae tired of that stuff. I have a different taste in animes than you have so i won't say that you will like this anime. But what I say is true for me. If your want unique anime with an original story then please keep looking .\\n\\n\r\nSee ya",

Akira just so happens to see a pile of drool laying on Mikotos desk, and like we know everyone would...(just kidding) he takes his finger and slides it threw and tastes it.  He starts getting sick.  After Mikoto meets him and lets him know it's due to her drool they start meeting every day and swapping drool.  Now as disgusting as that sounds the anime is actually turning out to be a cute romance.  Mikoto seems shy, but doesn't know how to convey her feelings properly without sharing her drool.  So Akira happily accepts and getsto experience her feelings first hand.  They slowly but surely form a bond other than swapping spit.  Akira and Mikoto start to figure out what a relationship means and the things you experience when you are in a relationship.  \\n\\n\r\nI like this anime because of the bond they form. Even though it was a little slow at first, I am glad I stuck it out.  I enjoy watching Mikoto and Akira slowly figure out what a relationship entails like holding hands or possibly calling each other by their first names.  They make speculations that she may be out of this world, so we'll have to wait and see if there is going to be some twists that soon follow.  If you like romance than this anime is really cute, just get passed the first few episodes and you'll see their relationship in a new way.",

            "content": "My Impression: \r\nThis shows separates the men from the boys because it's definitely \"seinen\" material. It has all the moments of excitement, embarrassment, and downright perversion. Yes, the other reviewers are all divided on the unique emphasis and use of saliva in the series, but for me, it's just another, yet strange way for the characters to form a bond. I say the series is underrated and is worth the try, but if you are man enough (perverted) to continue, then I assume you won't be disappointed and will actually long for more like me. Can't wait for more...\r\nStory:\r\nIt's a simple story where Tsubaki uncoverslittle bits of information about his mysterious girlfriend, Urabe, as he journeys through the life of a high school student. I wish the plot goes deeper, but I guess I'll have to wait as the manga is still continuing and there's a high chance there will be more episodes to come.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nI compliment the technical part of the series. I also really enjoyed their choices for the opening and ending songs, which are catchy and simple romantic songs and sung by the voice actress for the main female character, which I will put to my anime OST collection.\\n\\n\r\nOpening - \"Orchestra of Love\" - Ayako Yoshitani\\n\r\nEnding - \"Afterschool Promise\" - Ayako Yoshitani\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAyako Yoshitani (Urabe Mikoto) made the series because her impressive voice match so perfectly with the Urabe who is portrayed as mysterious, awkward, and unpredictable. If I recall correctly, this series might be Yoshitani's first role, anyways, she is a very talented voice actress and I hope to follow her career roles. The rest was nothing to complain about because the story and other characters are made to be straightforward.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI picked this series because it was a recommendation from Seto no Hanayome, another excellent series. All I can say is that I can't wait for season two, which means I'm got sold to the product along with all that ecchi moments and fan service.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe series is definitely for young male group. It's probably more perverse and less known than other series that similar to this type of genre of a normal school boy having his life changed after meeting someone that is abnormal. So, if you're into that type of genre, then you're probably going to get hooked on this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This show took me by surprise and im glad. \r\nCharacter development is this shows shining glory, you really grow to care for the 2 main characters and begin to relate to them. If you're like me and have been frustrated by harem animes and their oblivious male lead, this show will sits and listen to your frustration and offer you tea to make it all better.\r\nThere is a sense of maturity hidden in Nazo no, due to the numerous life lessons it provides to the viewer, its that friend who always givesthe best relationship and life advice with being an a*shole about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi of this show provides a nice break from DD melons constantly blocking and bombarding the screen, whilst the real life comedy is refreshing and relatable making you grin not in a pervy way like you'd expect but a feel good satisfying way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is an underdog in the comedy romance genre and gives provides just enough of everything to leave you content with the end and less drawn to generic harems",

I nearly threw up, I am literally being serious, i dropped my food and ran to the toilet gagging.\r\nAll i have to say is, what the hell is wrong with Japanese people, not once in the long years of being with my other half have i ever wanted to purposely suckher spit, its ******* rancid.... honestly, I know we need some originality in the romance sector of anime but for the love of god at least let it be something that does not make me want to vomit in the literal meaning of the word.",

            "content": "To start off I have not read the manga to this- may start. But from the first episode I almost stopped watching. If you hate drool or other bodily liquids then I wouldn't recommend this anime. It is...mysterious.\r\nStory gets a 7. It was good. It doesn't really bog you down with over the top fighting scenes or overly gush love scenes, but it has its balance. The story is boy meets girl- boy ingests girls drool- they're together. The story is just them developing their unique love- which is different and pretty refreshing from other anime story lines. Again this anime seems like it's settingyou up for a major story plot but take this anime for what it is-Comedy/School Romance. Nudity does have some parts to this.\\n\\n\r\nArt was difficult to say but if I had to round it, it would be a 7 for me. The backgrounds and characters were exceedingly amazing but taking it for what it is it was well drawn out. Certain scenes with the swapping of saliva gave the clear liquid a shine to it, and details in the characters when they most needed it to help emphasize their actions, mainly focusing on the lips, face, and the body. The dream scenes backgrounds were good, and the ending song's art was done in a different style- that was nice. The animation for when the characters ran was actually fun to watch, since it looks slightly awkward but it still fits, and you think- how is that humanly possible?\\n\\n\r\nSound also gets a 7 since the more exaggerated and unique sounds came from Mikoto's drool, her scissors actions,  and all the minor sounds that usually extend from Mikoto or Tsubaki's actions. The ending and opening sounds are really good, and cute. It does fit the story well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter also a straight 7. Thankfully they focused on a few set characters and developed them based on what the plot actually gave us from the get go. Of course it is slightly disappointing that not much back stories or more information about the main characters are given, but for this who really needs to know? They were all laughable but again the swapping of drool was a real turn off for me- just...no. But each character has his/her own personality and it's cute to see how the main two become so possessive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall My Enjoyment were both 6's and. Honestly it ranged from 6-7 depending on the episode. The drool thing was a set back and waiting for something \"major\" to happen within the story or to the two main characters was somewhat annoying but it was entertaining, smooth through out the entirety of the series, not as predictable as most would think, and has you leaving curious about certain things and may get you to read the manga- I guess it's just that Mysterious. ^.~",

The relationship between them could be explored so much more and it moved so slowly that I was sure there had to be a second season out there. I guess I will have to read the Manga to see if this was a bad adaptation, or is there really more to the story. \r\nIt frustrates me that they dont explain WHY she has this power? It is hinted maybe she is an Alien with her spaceship bookbag tag. I don't know what to make of it. \r\nDont get me wrongI do not completely hate it, I just wont be recommending it to people who are just starting to watch Anime. Definitely a niche title.",

It passes into a fantasy plot line where they share a drool relationship that allows people who taste her drool to 'bond' in a empathetic/telepathic sense.\r\nEssentially this is a fun show to watch.  It moves quickly and has such a unique premise that's kind of queer and bizarrely-humorously fascinating.  There's a bit of a learning curve to things, but not so much that you feel lost, more like curious as to how the next-thing is going toplay out.\\n\\n\r\nThere's definitely an ecchi component to things, but essentially it's just a light romantic comedy that explores young/first love via a different conduit than the typical stalker aspect.  \\n\\n\r\nI'd actually recommend this show!  It's quick fun and it has a satisfactory ending.  I hate shows that take you on a long scenic drive then push you over the cliff or leave you hanging for a ride that will never show.",

Perhaps, it's a guilty pleasure anime for me or maybe that's the mystery. Now about the drool. Yes! It's huge factor of the anime. Exchange, swap, just about any way you can think about using drool will be used. I say this because it's a make it or break it for some because this a romance anime after all.\r\nStory: 7\r\nAkira Tsubaki is our protagonist and is at the stage in high-school where he becomes more interested in girls. Having an odd dreamabout finally getting a girlfriend this year. A girl known as Mikoto Urabe transfers into his school that same day. Instantly, she's the center of attention, but becomes an odd-ball or that weird kid that no one wants to be associated with. Laughing out blue in the middle of school lesson and sleeping during lunch hour instead of choosing to chatting with her classmates. \\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, she oversleeps until sunset; Tsubaki having forgotten his bags in his class makes his way back to the class to find fast asleep Urabe, eventually tugging on her arm he wakes Urabe up. After that he catches a glimpse of Urabe face for the first time, since having so much hair conceal it. As she arises from her desk she, leaves a drool stain is left on the desk. \\n\\n\r\nAfter Urabe's depature, Tsubaki decides to pick up the drool with his fingertip and suck on it. This is start of something odd and the beginning of their relationship.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 9 | 8\\n\\n\r\nThe studio is known for only producing 'Hentai', but as far this anime goes is ecchi. It's art-style is very unique and consistent throughout the anime. Nice shading is wonderful. It looks and feel like an old school anime. The soundtrack ' A Magical Dream' ost is so wonderful catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe mysterious girlfriend known as Mikoto Urabe is a particular odd girl, has all the right intentions just like Akira Tsubaki. Always insisting in of carrying scissors in her panties. She has very unique approach to their relationship from others.\\n\\n\r\nAkira Tsubaki, is a very possessive guy that only wants Urube from himself, wanting to the common stuff that couple would actually do. It's fantastic seeing their relationship unfold right before someone's eye. You can't help but see these to grow and better themselves for one another.\\n\\n\r\nUeno Kouehi is Tsubaki befriend and his guide to being a boyfriend as well as bit of pervert. Ueno is dating Ayuko Oya which is only girl in school that actually tries to befriend Urabe.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a guilty pleasure anime, what more can I say. Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, but after are watching it I still enjoy this anime every bit. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts/Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nHaving seen the anime, I went out of my way to read the manga. It's really faithful adaption. However, not a complete one since it produced to gain more popularity for the manga. It's a great anime doesn't do anything different from other romance anime but it does have small addition that makes it so much different from other romances which is the make it or break it factor 'drool'",

I tend to avoid ecchi and romance but that one got me hooked somehow. \r\nStory - 8: The story is quite daring, I am sure a lot of people were disgusted at the 'drool fetish' shown in the first episode. A few episodes forward, the story has a bit more dept than I initially thought. It's all about teenagers experiencing love for the first time, there is quite a bit of room for character development, which I enjoy. A couple of minor things that bothered me so far: \r\n- The main characters not wonderingwhy sharing saliva leads to some very unnatural effects like getting each other's injuries and stuff. The emotional part is Ok, but the physical aspect could have been toned down a bit.\\n\r\n- Not enough care was given to the design of the male character, he is a bit boring in comparison to his GF.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7: Not really the best I have seen. The artwork is quite simple. It's still quite effective, no major complain about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8: The sound is quite good, I give 8 because the voice actress of the main character is awesome :).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8: I think I ll refer to the story section above as I think the story=the characters in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8: The pace is actually quite good for an anime without too much action involved. Looking forward for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8: Nothing I have seen before, which is quite refreshing, it is fairly well done also.\\n\\n",

            "content": "OK, first off, the 'drool' thing is a hook, and it certainly has tended to generate opinion, so it looks like it worked.  You can go all day regarding the merits of a boy tasting the drool of a girl versus 'swapping spit' in a kiss, but that's a topic I'll cover later (there's a hook right there to see if you read on...).  People watch NASCAR in part to see the spectacular crashes and near-misses, and what are replays on SportsCenter but a chance to see weird things that happened.\r\n'Nuf said.   Morbid fascination or not, I like this series.High school life, hormones and homework are a rich environment because it's where you first start encountering the whole 'gender' environment full tilt and all the thoughts and mis-steps that go along with it.  \\n\\n\r\nA hint about the whole drool thing... the drool gives the viewers a chance to experience that high school awkwardness again as we deal with our feelings about it.\\n\\n\r\nI think Urabe's voice is unique.  You can sense the control she must be exhibiting, since some of her ' portions' send Tsubaki into all types of roller coaster rides and vice versa.  I think my favorite character right now, though, is Oka.  She's cute, in a bookish way, but she can be herself because she's not an 'in-crowd' type of person.\\n\\n\r\n(Almost) Finally, let's get scientific and take this drool concept to it's \"logical\" end, separate from any anime or manga outcomes.  Tsubaki and Urabe will never be able to do more that a quick kiss if they do end up kissing.  Think about it.  Both have strong emotions, but so far things have been a one way street with 'portion control'.  On one level, a kiss will send each person's existing emotion level to the other, that in turn will generate a reaction to the other's emotion and THAT will be broadcast, and that response....and the next.  It is the oral equivalent of a chain reaction that would overwhelm them.  (and I know what you're thinking now...don't EVEN go there!!!)\\n\\n\r\nBack here on Earth, I don't know if I've spoiled myself for additional seasons, but I've just gone and read ahead in the manga and there is plenty of material there, including the opportunity to clear up a couple of things that have been talked about in the anime.",

            "content": "Yes, this show is very strange however there was something about it that makes you want to keep watching it, and not take your eyes off the screen. The story is pretty much about a somewhat perverted guy and his mysterious girlfriend. Throughout the show it made me think, are these two even together? because they didn't do hardly anything that normal couples do like the simple things, cuddling, kissing, or even holding hands. If you're one of those people who are begging for the first kiss to happen, then you're going to be disappointed. \r\nFirst of all we have, Urabe Mikoto. She first appearsas a rather normal, shy type of girl with a rather gothic type of style. In class, she happens to sit next to Tsubaki Akira. And one day, while in the middle of class, she just bursts out laughing for no reason what so ever. You find out what it is later on in the show but at that time, people just thought she was crazy and decided to keep their distance. She was never fazed by this, as you would expect of her character. She always seems like she's trying to hide her emotions as best as she can, which makes it a little sad in some ways. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Tsubaki Akira, he's just your average high school guy who is presented as a perverted character as well as his best friend. He lives with is older sister who has always been like a mother to him, they have a pretty close relationship. One day, Tsubaki notices that Urabe has left some drool on her classroom desk where she had been sleeping, and he just happened to TASTE IT. That's right. And that's pretty much how there relationship began to bloom. Once he and Urabe started dating, he was always thinking of her in lewd ways, even though that's in his mind and not telling Urabe...she knows exactly when he's thinking it. \\n\\n\r\nWe see other characters who are important to the show too. One being from his past and another being his friend's girlfriend (they have actually kissed at least) I really think this show deserves a second season, there a still questions that need answers, and a lot of great stuff happens in the manga, but it would be so much better in an anime. I would love to see Tsubaki's and Urabe's relationship grow.",

            "content": "Have you ever though about exchanging drool/saliva would be a great way make a bond of love between two high school student? I know what you guys are thinking at first... Like \"Ew, disgusting!\" or something like that... Also it's not like exchange drool while kissing... No, no! Characters bond is more different than that. \r\nNow you're thinking about what a... How?... Why?... Well let me tell you. \r\nEveryone in high school some point dreams about having a romantic relationship and this series male protagonist is no different. Male protagonist Akira Tsubaki is nothing special, quite much normal high school student if you ask me.But everything changes after new transfer student shows up. This girl's name is Mikoto Urabe and she turns to be a weirdo. She just sleep lunch breaks and isn't most nicest person to talk with. At one afternoon when school has ended Akira return back to his class room to get his bag. Right after he gets to class room, he noticed Urabe still sleeping on her desk. After waking up Urabe, Tsubaki see Urabe's drool on desk. What he is going to do about it? cleaning it off? Nope, he tasted it.\\n\\n\r\nIT TASTED SWEET!!!\\n\\n\r\nBut after that Tsubaki's body needed Urabe's drool almost everyday, without it he turned to be sick. Now you're really thinking what kind of deadly bacteria or disease this girl is holding on her drool. But no, Tsubaki's body needed Urabe's drool because he fell love for her and needed her drool because he was lovesick. Doesn't that solve everything. That is start of quite different and funny romance between these two.\\n\\n\r\nNazo no Kanojo X/ Mysterious Girlfriend X storyline isn't most amazing or mind blowing experience but I think it's great and absolutely funny to watch. It had this old school anime style and the music! I just love music in this series!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters have a great personalities and hobbies which makes few or more hilarious scenes. I love how well made Urabe is, but I can't say the same about Tsubaki... I don't know but he didn't got so much spotlight in show in my option. He isn't special but maybe that makes this couple a great. \\n\\n\r\nThere are few characters in show besides Urabe and Tsubaki. They also do great job. Voice acting in this show is great and their voices fit nicely to their roles. \\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed watching this show so much that I had watched it about 4-5 times now. I think it's very well made romance anime with awesome soundtrack which makes me think about my own miserable love life... Why I can't live in anime world TT_TT\\n\\n\r\nBut make sure to watch it if you are interested romance and comedy animes and also make sure to go see manga as well. It's also epic!",

            "content": "I love the animes with theoretical grounds. And by this, I mean not only referencing a real theory on real world, but the show itself might have a theoretical ground, a system inside. I enjoyed this show since it has the both.\r\nYou must watch the show with a knowledge of psychoanalysis background and a bit of Carl Jung's social unconscious. It has a mysterical ground of transfer unconscious state of emotions and thoughts through saliva. And these affecting the real physical world and neurological state is just depends of Carl Jung's metaphysical description of social unconscious.\r\n==============\r\nThe story is very good. It is actually a schoolanime where the story takes in, but the actions of that \"mysterious girl\" in the story (to achive transferring some emotions through his new boyfriend's mind) makes it curious and you were never be able to drop it to understand what exactly the flying fuck is going on there.\\n\\n\r\nArt is old-style, that ecchi animes of late of 90's and beginning of 2000's you'll remember. So at least I said \"Yay, I feel as before if I keep watching this show\" and made me feel utterly like that. A stunning old-style.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds, OSTs, oh god. Those were really amazing. Especially OSTs will make you inside the chamber of story and you will feel like the observer of whole things. That's just great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was good, but the development of our main boy would be better. I know it is a cult to have a sexually unexperienced boy in these kind of series, but it became too mainstream. However, this type of characters make the story develop, I accept. I am just complaining about mainstream and why authors never try the hard way just one single time.\\n\\n\r\nI really really enjoyed the series. You must watch it. Instead of being ecchi, it has really soft taste on it. You will not even realize it is an ecchi.",

            "content": "Nazo no Kanojo X is a very unique anime. Firstly, don't let the ecchi tag turn you away. While there may be some mature scenes and topics; this anime has a lot more to offer than big breasted bimbos and fan service galore. The story was a less than typical romance. Throughout the story the viewer could see  Tsubaki's and Urabe's love blossom. This can be attributed to their peculiar way of understanding each others feelings. Their love is tested through several trials and tribulations.  \r\n    Characterization was another high point. Throughout the show the protagonist grow and reveal moreinformation to the audience. The viewer gains much insight to the characters and how they feel or think. \\n\r\n    The worst part of the show to me was the animation. While it is not terrible by any means, it leaves a lot to be desired. I could never get over how the character's eyes were drawn. Most of the time they looked crossed-eyed. There was also a lack of detail in the scenery. I also think that the producers would have been better off ending at episode twelve, instead of thirteen. \\n\r\n   Overall, Nazo no Kanojo X is a delightful and enjoyable love story. While it does have some drama, it is rather slow paced. But, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants an out of the box romance. \\n",

            "content": "My Review of Nazo no Kanojo X\r\nStory\r\nNow, the story is very unique. The story revolves around a very unusual thing that I think is the best part of this Anime. Although some people mind find it disgusting and may be turned-off to this Anime, but I assure you that this is a good Anime. Anyway, the story is pretty good.\r\nArt/Animation\r\nThe Art and the Animation looks pretty old, like it was an Anime from 2002 - 2005 but even though the art look old, It still looks pretty good. Especially during the Dream sequences. One thing I don't like though is that everybody looks like everybody.I'm not even joking. Tsubaki's sister looks like his Middle School crush but with a different hairstyle. I do understand that it would be hard doing that but they could've atleast tried. But eh, It's pretty fine I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe OST for this Anime is Amazing! The Opening sequence and the Ending Sequence are superbly catchy. It's nice that the Voice Actress of the MC sang both the Opening and the Ending which is pretty cool. Her voice is really great. The Instrumental during the Dream Sequences is Also good. It really fits the setting of the Dream Sequence. Overall, the soundtrack is superbly good. I recommend you download it for osu or something.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nUrabe Mikoto is my favorite Female Character in Anime. Even though there's not much to be said about her, there's just something that I can't say that made me attracted to her. Her voice actress is great, Her Art style is awesome and her Personality is awesome and it fits the story.\\n\r\nTsubaki Akira is your Typical Romcom Male Character. Not much to be said about him. He's just creepy. But Urabe and Tsubaki are perfect to each other. Their Chemistry is really nice. Although I do have one problem, their character development is really slow. They could've made it at a faster phase since this is a short Anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really Enjoyed this Anime. This made it to my Top 5 Animes that I've watched. It's really different from most Romance Animes. Most Romance Animes would just go on Dates and do this and do that but that's not the case here which is really refreshing because I'm tired of the cliche Romance format.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime Overall. Best anime I've watched in a while. It's sad that it's a \"Read the Manga\" type of ending which I really don't mind. Hopefully there will be a season 2, although the chances of a new season is very slim due to the fact the the fan base is really small to the type of Anime. To conclude this review in 1 phrase, all I can say is \"Best Romance Anime Ever\"\\n\\n\r\nEdit: I was kinda biased making this review 2 years ago.",

            "content": "This anime has a premise that's bound to elicit \"only in Japan\" snickers -- our main characters bond through the exchange of drool.\r\nWhile that is about as unrealistic as can be, and there are other aspects of the anime that are extremely unusual for a romantic slice of life high school scenario, when it comes to the relationship between Tsubaki and Urabe, the main characters, it's refreshingly different from most high school romances, and probably closer to real teenage feelings than most.\r\nStory (6/10):  The premise is kind of ridiculous (though I wonder just how ridiculous it is in Japan where drool appears to havea special, favoured place in the erotic vocabulary), the story itself is not bad at all for its type -- we don't have a dumb harem here where the guy can't make up his mind, nor do we have endless episodes of \"will they, won't they get together\"; no, the girl is the aggressor, these two start dating right away, and while their progress is very slow, it's definitely progress, and I love the expectedness of Urabe whenever Tsubaki does something very much expected.  The show is marked as \"ecchi\", but while there is definitely a certain amount of fan service, it's actually well-embedded in the story, and doesn't consist of ye olde \"oops I fell and you saw my panties\" excuses, and girls grabbing each other's boobs. I usually avoid ecchi (I'm not interested in 2D girls teasing excitable male otaku without an actual sex life), but here it didn't bother me.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10): The show has a very nostalgic look, with an old-school art style that dates back to the 1990s.  I didn't like that style much then, and I don't like it now, but one's got to appreciate how well it evokes that period.  It does wonders with Urabe's expressions when the long bangs part.  The animation is ok; there's more background animation than usual.  There are some surreal dream sequences in 3D that look at the same time disjointed and interesting, and I've rewound and rewatched quite a bit because there's much to see; alas as the series progresses, those disappear.  Every bit of drool glistens and sparkles like treasure.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10): I love the voice of Urabe, and unfortunately, that's the only thing the voice actress has done.  Shame; it's a very distinctive voice, blessedly not cutesy high-pitched, and she does an outstanding job. The other voice talent is average.  The BGM is quirky, evoking a carnival at times, and on occasion being outright creepy, OP and ED are pleasant but forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):  Urabe is a new transfer student in Tsubaki's class, she's taciturn, antisocial and not shy about telling people off, her eyes are covered by her bangs, she sleeps every available moment, and she has spurts of astonishing honesty with Tsubaki.  She has loads of character, and is indeed mysterious -- there seems to be a supernatural element to her, but nothing ever becomes clear.  She has a bunch of UFO paraphernalia which could be hinting that she is an alien, but by the end I thought maybe it's just a metaphor for her being weird, alien among her peers.  She can also transmit feelings and even actual injuries through her drool, and can receive feelings through other people's drool, and probably that is a metaphor as well -- it's a PG-rated way to stand for X-rated fluid exchanges.  How did she acquire her amazing prowess with scissors?  Nobody knows.  Mysterious girlfriend, indeed (I presume the X stands for her scissors).\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki on the other hand is an open book:  he's the usual dense, naive, but naturally horny teenage boy without personality.  He can't say no to anyone, but on occasion Urabe gets him to actually be honest with her, and he shows some vestiges of a spine. He is exchangeable with every other clueless git teenage boy in every other romcom.\\n\\n\r\nOka is Tsubaki's friend Ueno's girlfriend, and she stakes an unusually strong interest in Urabe, managing to get her to stop sleeping and have lunch with her, getting in on the drool action, and egging Urabe on when it comes to sexual matters.  She's the only person who knows Urabe and Tsubaki are a couple (by the end there is only one other person).  I feel a vague dislike for Oka; probably because I like Urabe so much in part because she forges her own path, and Oka is trying to make her more \"normal\".  That's typical Japanese though; the force to conform is always strong.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):  I would have enjoyed this a lot more had it not been for the copious drool, which was just gross.  I don't find drool erotic to begin with, and the drool here was a much more viscous fluid, reminiscent of honey -- and if I could have convinced myself it was honey it would have been fine.  But the word \"drool\" in combination with the texture just looked slimy to me, and I found myself actually gagging at times, and had to look away.  I am deducting 2 points because it was just so damn frequent.\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 28 for 5 categories, rounding up to 6.",

            "content": "This anime is in its own league. It's almost trying to advertise itself beginning by a challenge : \"Will you be able to get past what we're showing you to get what we want to tell ?\"\r\nTechnically speaking, the saliva bits aren't all that gross. For the thing called a \"french kiss\" by some people is exactly that : a saliva exchange. Well, ok, granted ... we don't (usually) use our fingers as an intermediate device for the exchange (since the previously mentionned kiss is a more efficient and direct approach).\r\nBut still, don't sell yourself short. You can get used to it, you can getpast that. And there lies a somewhat strange and beautiful anime, with some very nice scenes... Some that can wreck your heart onto a wall very slowly (you were thinking full speed right ? think again), or others, soothing, calming episodes full of truths to be told.\\n\r\nIt's not perfect for sure. A perfect anime would have been able to reach this point without relying on the spit trick, but still the saliva exchange is in itself a good way to turn things over, asks questions, and for you to search for answers.\\n\r\nAs the story goes, it's quite simple and not that original. It's pratically the weakest point of the whole show (which makes it still a lot better than a lot of others romcom). Art and sound seems just fair enough, but considering the way it emphasizes certain things, some will found these quite good (and I'm pretty sure I can't prove them wrong). But in my opinion, one of the best aspect of this anime comes from the characters. Their behavior is somewhat estranged, yet close, to someone you know. And not all their actions are carefully explained to you. This will give you something to think about, and I've found myself pausing the anime numerous times wondering myself \"but why the hell is she/he acting this way ?!!\" \\n\r\nActually, this anime is all about YOU. I will not try to explain this, but I would share that : whether you give a damn about it or adversely decide to drop it immediately can already tell a lot about you, these two choices bearing an equal amount of interesting things about you ...",

            "content": "So the plot device, the exchanging of drool, is actually somewhat interesting of a mechanism. Although initially a moment of explorative perversion from a growing boy, it becomes something of a persistent medium for the characters to communicate their emotions when words fail them. The ability itself is really played down so it never becomes something overtly magical, it's never really explained how this happens and it's probably best this way as pinning it down would force the story away from a more non-fantasy based foundation. The consistent casual depiction of it makes it feel almost natural so it never really feels cognitively bothersome. Thecharacters confess that it's weird and strange, but it never really goes beyond this and is somehow just casually accepted rather than settled.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative is a quintessential boy meets girl story with a kink for a twist. It's cute because they're both first lovers and it's quite nostalgic in terms of how it reminds one of the anxieties involved with everything that comes with that. Particularly from the male perspective. There's nothing that really sets this story apart, kink not with standing, besides how well paced it is and consolidated the characters are. There's no real tropes involved here which is very refreshing, it's a classic, homely 'slice of life' that's just an overall pleasure to watch for the honest characters alone. There's no real \"ecchi\" beyond the drool, yes there are some panty shots, but they're not glorified; the service is in watching the main characters develop their relationship in real terms and not set piece tropes (like walking in on a girl naked, or the guy falling on the girl and accidentally groping a boob or two, etc).\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is quaint. There's not a huge focus on the stylisation for the eyes or hair which makes it feel a little older than the show actually is, but it's not too much of a turn off. In fact the animation is so well rounded, the animated faces more than make up for the lack of aesthetic we otherwise usually see these days.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing to write home about and at times the lack of background sound/music makes the show feel a little empty, but the voice acting is actually really good (sub) and incredibly natural. It actually feels like people having real conversations and not people reading off a script.\\n\\n\r\nI think the majority of the enjoyment here was nostalgia in respects to how it felt having ones first girlfriend in our school days, and also being a little bit weird and confused in our sexual expression. Along with how believable/relatable the characters were and acted. Besides the overt plot hole regarding how the girl, Urabe could possibly know Tsubaki was \"love sick\" as a result of the drool, despite having no experience in these things. The show runs pretty smoothly from start to finish and this should explain my high marks for something that would otherwise be a remarkably average show.",

I watched this anime at the same time as Midori no Hibi, and you are suppoused to know what happened next. Love overdose! Well, to be clear Nazo no Kanojo is not a simple ' romantic anime show'. Its soundtrack, characters, art and the story are something new to discover in this masterpiece of anime. Especially the soundtracks. I love the soundtracks so much. The director had to pay to much money for the soundtracks because of its originality. Theyare really well made!!!!!!!!!!!! Really really good made!!!!!\\n\r\nI think that the soundtrack is the vital point that make this anime 'shine' like a diamond in the trash. The soundtrack plus the story make this anime unforgettable.\\n\r\nI know that this anime is 'forgotten' but if you want to found something new or you want to discover new feelings that you never felt before, then i recommend you to watch this masterpiece. This anime can transport you in that world. You only have to see it in the night with a coffee or a tea. \\n\r\n100% RECOMMENDED!",

            "content": "No spoilers. \r\nWow! What a gem. It\u2019s too bad most potential viewers will casually overlook NnKx for its low MAL score,  ecchi tag, retro artwork or the saliva-swapping theme. I found it to be a charming and unique take on the clich\u00e9, slice of life high school romance story. \r\nFalse Cons.\r\nEcchi- This is not an ecchi anime\u2014no harem, no boob shot quota, no sloppily-introduced sexual situations. Urabe is a babe but that\u2019s hardly a reason to slap an ecchi tag onto NnKx.\r\nArt-The art is great. It\u2019s a little retro 1980\u2019s but it\u2019s still of great quality. I stopped even noticing it after episode 1.The character designs are pretty cool too, especially Urabe. They did a great job pulling off the \u201cpretty-ugly girl\u201d routine. She can look like an expressionless tangle of matted hair in one shot and super cute chick in the next just by parting her bangs.\\n\\n\r\nDrool: I need to devote a paragraph to this topic because the anime\u2019s short description is misleading, tacky and gross, and is bound to either turn viewers off to watching it or turn them on\u2026but for the wrong reason. There is no question that saliva transfer is an integral part of this anime and I think it\u2019s normal to raise one\u2019s eyebrows at that concept. I spent the first few episodes trying to decide if drool was meant to have some deeper, metaphorical meaning, or if I had accidentally stumbled into a niche-fetish anime. I\u2019m pleased to say that this anime surprised me. To my great relief, saliva sharing was portrayed as intimate rather than erotic, tender rather than vulgar, and actually quite dignified rather than disgusting. It was akin to blood in a vampire movie, and a creative way for two ordinarily unexpressive characters to maintain an intimate, supernatural bond.\\n\\n\r\n Pros: \\n\r\nThe Japanese voice actress for Urabe was amazing. Mature, reserved, sincere but not monotone. Just listen to a clip\u2026\\n\r\nUrabe\u2019s character was pretty interesting too. Stubborn, mature, eccentric, genuine, vulnerable, mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nReal Cons\\n\r\n-This anime was too short. It did a thorough job in establishing character growth but just stopped suddenly. It\u2019s still worth watching but just be aware that almost all of your questions will remain unanswered by the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really liked this anime and thought it was a sweet and unique little romance story. The main downside is that you\u2019ll have to go to the manga (which is ongoing) if you want to find out what happens next. I\u2019m always plus-minus with that.\\n",

Haunting theme that crescendos into a whimsical waltz aong with the opening and ending themes that are grounded more in the slice-of-life genre pleasing to the ears.\r\nNegatives:\r\n* Obviouswish-fulfilment where various fetishes are highlighted.\\n\r\n* Unequal social roles difficult to ignore. Only females are seen in sexually provocative positions, a perpetuation of prominent male attitudes in Japanese culture.\\n\r\n* Lacks character development.

            "content": "About the STORY\r\nThere\u2019s absolutely a whole different kind of storyline in the series. Ecchi, drama, romance; there\u2019s a new approach with these types of genres in the story. Toss aside holding hands, hugging, and kissing; Imagine romantic bond and communication of a couple by sharing their drools. Now, that\u2019s a different kind of romance alright. The very fact that the romance is so different makes the normal romantic moments worth the wait. It\u2019s what makes the series romance aspect still nicely done in its own way. Even the ecchi part is not your typical one. There\u2019s a different stimulation that you definitely rarely see inyour everyday ecchi series. It\u2019s not overly lewd or far-fetched with so much fanservices. It\u2019s just like a little tease but still justifiable.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nMajority of the characters can be considered as common but the main protagonist is definitely a different story! Have you seen a character that puts scissors on her panty, conveys her true feelings through sharing her drool, and vomits a huge amount of drool when happy? I bet you haven\u2019t! The title couldn\u2019t be perfect for her character. In fact, in every episode there\u2019s a new mystery about her. However, despite her weirdness it is surprising how strong her resolve and beliefs are which makes her still an effective and likeable female protagonist. The main characters are definitely not your ordinary couple. Like, instead of kissing before parting ways they would share drool! Still, the originality of their relationship makes them memorable and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nFor some reason, the animation is not particularly that amazing considering it\u2019s a new series. Well, I have a misconception that if its latest then it is given that the animation should be latest or amazing enough. The sounds sometimes would make you feel that the series is a horror one. It has a very creepy feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nIt is true that there are drools everywhere but the most interesting part is how the writer still able to make a nice storyline out of it. Imagine, \u201cdrool\u201d for a key plot of a story. Despite how it sounds, I still can\u2019t help but be in awe on how creative and original it is. The writer is able to make \u201csharing of drool\u201d still romantic on its own way. With all its differences and uniqueness from other series, it definitely spells \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d.\\n",

            "content": "This is a *SPOILER FREE REVIEW* This is the first review I have ever decided to write, so I know I may not be able to properly convey my experience to anyone who might check this anime out and skim through the reviews before making the decision to start this anime or not. However, I say go for it, because personally I thought it was a masterpiece and I will tell you why.\r\nLet's start with the Story:10/10\r\nThere is not really much to say about the story that the synopsis on this website hasn't already given you, so I will talk about the elements: This isan incredibly original romance genre anime. The main plot that revolved around Akira Tsubaki tasting the drool of a the new female transfer student Mikoto Urabe is absolutely fascinating and at first a little weird. But that is the beauty of the story in itself, it's almost like a symbolic act that represents how awkward your first relationship can be. I have seen some strange anime before, but the story is so strange that it makes you want to watch more and more as you follow a very well written story about two people who really don't know much about how to convey their feelings, and in the most creative original way find a way to reach each other on almost a supernatural level. \\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nWhy do I give the art a 10/10? For me, the hand drawn backgrounds was phenomenal, something I have not felt since watching Serial Experiments Lain for the first time. The beautiful sunset pieces in this anime were incredibly and really sets the mood. Also a quick little weird thing I noticed: The sun is progressively higher in the sky during the evening as the story progresses and the characters relationships develop, which I thought was such a nice fit to complement the story and the characters as well as the art. The characters were well drawn and their hair was exceptionally well detailed, and the fact that this anime was made in 2012, it gives us a surprisingly refreshing 1990's feel to it which was great. The art added to the mystery of the characters as well as the beautiful scenery. I was taken away by this kind of scenery to tell you the truth.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nIt's very hard for an anime to get a 10 in sound to tell you the truth. The OST for this anime is actually incredible. It is very light and heavy on the piano. The music definitely works well and matches with the mood of the characters and the situation. In a way I can say that the art kind of amplifies how good the music is too. In terms of the animation sounds, I'd say they were perfectly done and not dragged out or over-used in any way. The sound was crisp and very pleasant on the ears. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nThis is the sweetest element of Nazo no Kanojo X. Urabe and Tsubaki are both very likable characters from the start and even with this short 13 episodes series, you get quite a lot of character development out of them and even the supporting characters get some well deserved development, but not a lot where it overshadows the main characters. Tsubaki isn't a scared high school kid, but rather just as nervous and awkward as all of us were in High school. You will find enjoyment out of Tsubaki wondering about what it is to be in a relationship, and it's refreshing that as close as Urabe and Tsubaki are, they are opposites when it comes to relationships. Tsubaki wonders about what being in a relationship means and what should they do to be a normal couple. Tsuabki's goals reflect a more rational and normal relationship which differ's greatly from Urabe. Mikoto Urabe is a fairly shy but mysterious girl. Although she is proficient in sports such as running and swimming, she mostly keeps to her self and enjoys passing out on her desk most of the time without really desiring to have friends. Mikoto is freakishly accurate when it comes to cutting things with scissors which really adds to this mysterious way about her. However, the most mysterious thing about Urabe? Her perception of a relationship. Urabe wants everything that is not common about a relationship, she is spontaneous and not very good at voicing her emotions in the beginning, but she shines as a character that when she does voice her emotions, it sticks with you as the viewer and you find yourself waiting to see in what way she develops next. Tsuabki and Urabe as a couple are made for each other. In a strange way it seems like in the beginning they both have different ideas about what it is to be in a relationship, but as the story progresses, their relationship becomes one idea, rather than two. The characters are both crazy about each other and the show does a very good job at making a heartwarming story with a strange plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nI watched all 13 episodes in a single sitting, and I have not binged an anime in a while but this one got me. I was dying to see what happens in the next episode and even after the show was done, I watched it a second time because it was just that good to me. The show is more on the serious level but there are definitely more than a few laughs that I had while watching the show and they were placed very well to set the scene and the mood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10\\n\r\nI loved every second of this show.  I loved the art, the sound, the characters and the story. I highly recommend this show to people who want to try something different out and watch a very original romance piece. In my opinion, it is my favorite anime of all time. Do not let the plot mislead you, don't throw this show away after the first episode because it definitely gets better and I think you will be amazed at how much you wish there were more than 13 episodes after its all over. \\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for taking the time to read my first review. I apologize that it was fairly long, but I loved the show so much I thought I would throw in all the general ideas I could without spoiling anything. I want this show to be just as mysterious to you as Urabe is to Tsubaki",

            "content": "Name of anime: Mysterious Girlfriend X\r\nGenre: Romance, Comedy, Ecchi\r\nNumber of episodes: 13\r\nReview: Before you say anything else, I\u2019m gonna warn you guys. If you think that you are a hardcore anime lover and won\u2019t stop watching an anime until you finish it, THEN ONLY watch this anime. If you survive for the first three episodes, then this anime is sure to leave a big impact on your heart. The only problem is that\u2026.. It\u2019s gross. Yup, you heard it right, this anime\u2019s one scene is pretty gross, but surprisingly, after a few episodes, that scene becomes perfectly normal, interesting isn\u2019t it? The story focuses onTsubaki and a girl named Urabe. Urabe is a transfer student, who gets tagged as a weirdo on the very first day due to her unusual attitude of sleeping in the class and being a loner. One day, Tsubaki wakes Urabe up when everyone has already gone home and tells her to go too. When she went home, Tsubaki sucked (Be careful here) Urabe\u2019s drool which was left on the desk (Ewwwwwwww!) After that incident, somehow, his condition started deteorating. Lastly, Urabe said that he has became so attached to that drool that now if he doesn\u2019t tastes it, then his body will start becoming sick. From that day, Tsubaki started tasting her drool every day, and somehow, he becomes the boyfriend of Urabe. This anime is something special. I just can\u2019t understand that what is so special about it that it has left such a deep impact over me. So, you guys watch this anime, if you too feel the same connection then tell me why you liked it.\\n\\n\r\nWeakness: These weaknesses have made this anime weak to gain the first spot. But if a second season is created, then this anime is pretty sure to gain the first spot and overthrow Toradora from my list.\\n\r\n1) The drool exchange, even though is a pretty important part of the anime, is pretty gross. As a result, many anime viewers stop watching it thinking it to be one of those, Ewww, anime.\\n\r\n2) It was not clearified why they can sense each other\u2019s feeling just by tasting the drools. That\u2019s actually a big question.\\n\r\n3) Is the girl an alien? I dunno, but everytime I saw her behavior and that drool thing made me believe that she is an alien. What\u2019s more? She even has an UFO shaped key chain. I\u2019m pretty sure that she is. Well, we will see that if a new season is created.\\n\\n\r\nRating: With so many faults, without any kissing or hugging scene and having a big doubt of a second season, this anime was sure to be at the bottom of my list. But magically, it stands as the second best anime of my choice. I give it 8 out of 10. Still can\u2019t understand why.",

            "content": "Warning if you can't get past weird stuff like drool and people wanting to taste it then this show might not be for you. But for the uninitiated mysterious girlfriend x is about a girl named mikoto who moves to a new school who is quite mysterious and starts having a relationship with our young protagonist Akira, with a slight twist he likes to taste her drool and not through the kissing way through a finger in the mouth way.. I know kinda weird but stay with me.\r\nThe show has symbolic and metaphorical messaging all throughout this anime and it makes you wonder in thebeginning anyways if they are just swapping spit or if this is a meaning for making out and just flat out sex at times. Which i feel keeps you interested enough and isn't just an average slice of life romance show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very character driven and succeeds in some regards. Akira is our main character and he is honestly a generic main character which could be replaced with another generic male lead and the story would be the exact same now this isn't all bad because this show is about adolescents growing up and the weird spit swapping is telling us these kids don't really understand how relationships work like at all. And seeing akiras dreams which can somewhat be seen as wet dreams or him trying to get over his jealousy or guilt or heartache.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to mikoto the main girl love interest to mikoto who is very mysterious and makes you believe she has all the answers to relationships but she's just as clueless as akira. The first 3 episodes kind of make you feel like she could be a alien and maybe that's cause she had a little toy UFO or that she spits up 20 gallons of spit if she gets excited\u2026 like wtf. She's very shy and basically the way she conveys her emotions is through giving people her spit which in turn lets them feel what she is feeling at that time. Again it's very weird but on a level it works for this show all the way through and adds to her opening up towards the end of the show. And i just dont mean those pantie scissors. I felt as if there was another reason why she wasn't open with people but it was never really addressed. Her not opening up and the show show not wanting to move forward with their relationship at times makes the pacing kind of slow and hard to get through at times when in turn it also a somewhat episodic show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show really tries to focus just on the main 2 characters which in turn leads to a bad supporting cast. The best of the supporting cast is okay who is mikoto's best friend and helps her with her relationships and when i say help i really mean mess it up half time which in turn has her keeping the episodes more lively and interesting at times. Also through the metaphor of spit it's unclear if her and mikoto had lesbian experiences together or not. Akiras best friend is pretty generic and doesn't add much to the plot and the sister of akira also is just a generic sister.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic is really repetitive but isnt bad its just kind of generic and unforgettable and the art and animation are good but nothing special honestly. I also watched this show in English and the 2 main characters were done pretty well while the rest of the cast varies from annoying to ok to flat out garbage.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe score i would give this anime is a 6.5\\n\\n\\n\r\nthough most of the show is a generic romance What i think stands out is that you can look at the spit swapping as a straightforward kind of thing or you can look deeper and see what this show is trying to imply like mikoto and okas lesbian experiences or mikoto taking off her clothes and giving her \u201cspit\u201d to akira if you get what i mean. And this sometimes gets in the way of character development and just uses characters as a conduit to advance the themes of the show. But leads to a pretty good ending for the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for recommendations of shows like this then check out B gata H kei it has ecchi stuff and has a pretty funny plot about a girl who want to have sex a lot. And also Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! It has a mysterious girl with scissors and about adolescents growing up.",

            "content": "OBLIGATORY SPOILER WARNING\r\n-So before I say anything else I just want to point out the hook of this show. Drool. Yes, lots and lots of drool. Let's everybody eat each others drool and have dreams and nose bleeds and experience each others emotions through drool.\r\n-The hook of this show is quite strange which is why I kept watching it since I am typically not a big fan of slice of life animes and for the most part it did not disappoint. The idea of using drool to convey plot points and characters emotions may seem strange but it works well in the framework of theshow. If you wanted to you could even say it symbolizes being intimate with another human being, kissing, etc. If you are a person who simply hates drool well then you will probably end up grossed out by the end of the first episode since it is a constant theme.\\n\\n\r\n-I enjoyed the fact that we got to see the two main characters develop into more mature human beings throughout the show and I genuinely cared about the characters.  My main problem is that the show isn't long enough. I would have loved to have seen how the characters would have reacted to being intimate for the first time, going on more dates, graduating, etc. \\n\\n\r\n-The music does its part fine but there really aren't any memorable tunes from the show in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n-For whatever reason this show is classified as an ecchi....which I simply do not understand since while there is a beach bikini episode and drool eating the fan service is by no means any worse than 90% of most other popular animes these days and if you are turned off to the idea of watching it because it is classified as such I would suggest ignoring that label and giving it a chance anyway (it is by no means graphic).\\n\\n\r\n-Overall I feel like it is worth a watch if you are into watching a couple overcome real problems, particularly those experienced by high schoolers and adolescences when they first start dating. I know that I personally could relate to the characters in several of their situations based off of my own life and I feel like that makes a slice of life show far more enjoyable when you can actually relate to at least one of the characters.",

            "content": "I can actually say that when I started this series, I had pretty low expectations from it. It instantly blew me away.\r\nMind it, romance is something I'll watch regardless of good nor bad, but Mysterious Girlfriend X is different. It's unique in so many way. Tsubaki (Male MC) isn't a Gary Stu and actually has a really good personality that's interesting. Urabe (Female MC) isn't a JAne Doe and she might be the most unique character I've seen in quite some time. It's just smething kinda uncommon these days.\r\nOne of my favorite things was Character design. Urabe is one of my favorite designs for acharacter of all time. I love how she's portrayed and love the weird girl persoanlity to compliment how she looks. I also think most of the female designs in this anime were top tier as well. They all looked unique in there own way, and they all were pleasing to the eye. \\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, the series is weird to someone watching it first, but it gets so much more in depth and enjoyable after a few episodes, mainly because you understand why stuff happens in a sense. the bond between Tsubaki  and Urabe is between Drool. That's weird, but it's unique and done correctly. They're not making it disgusting or overdoing it. It's a fine balance of everything right.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly loved this anime to death. It's easily in my top 5 of all time. I'll probably re-watch it a bit after this review LOL. I'm kinda disheartened that there never was a season 2 though. There was a manga (which is what the anime is obviously based off of) that ran for like 10 years and ended in 2014, but I hear it was really a dissatisfactory ending, so I'm personally not going to read the manga because I'd like to keep the series in high esteem to myself. Sadly, if you want more Mysterious Girlfriend X, FanFiction might be the only thing you have. \\n\\n\r\nEither way, amazing anime. I give it a 10 honestly. This anime is almost one of a kind. Must watch if you love romance.",

As a couple of people that have written reviews have stated, this anime is about as real as they come aside from the drool, which I honestly didn't find disturbing. I actually enjoyed the abnormality. People If you want to see a real relationship please watch this. The only thing that threw me for a loop was the fact that they... well I suppose i cant really tell you. Guess you'll have to watch for yourselves.",

            "content": "This anime is fairly unique. It has its own twist, so a plus for an original story. But the Idea of the anime is sadly the weak part for me. The idea of the whole anime to me seems as if it is trying to show a Platonic relationship, a relationship, where sexual interaction do not occur, or another way of looking at it is a very very.............veryyyyy slow development of a relationship with romance and bondage at a more \"Personal\" level. I can agree with this anime at times and disagree, because do believe they did exaggerate the platonic sense of the relationship todemonstrate, but at that cost, it is killing the anime . Also not forgetting, the Man in this relationship is some what of an Average Joe, while the Female, is ill-logical to the bitter end, and it can get annoying at times.\\n\r\nBut also dont forget this is an interesting anime, i wana see it to the end definitely. But the only reason i wana keep going is just to see how it end up. Probable guna be a disappointment but, so i dont have high hopes for a good ending.\\n\r\n But *mini spoiler* in the first episode, the girl does say, she \"Heard\" a voice saying she will lose her virginity to that guy, so that being said, is the end....obvious? *Edit: Also at about episode 8 the \"Platonic\" relationship takes a turn into not so platonic so +1 to that.***\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end this anime, i would say, should Not be at the top of ur watch list, its a fair anime with its ups and downs, but if your looking for something completely off the beaten path, and dont mind getting a little WTF, then go ahead watch this anime.\\n\r\nAll ima say is, im guna need to go watch a good anime after this just to rid myself of its  bitter lack of how a True high school relationship is.......full of........sex, and also the lack of proper logic, a questionable philosophy.\\n\r\n And not to forget through out the anime (so far) the sense of \"\\n\r\nWTF, THIS IS SOME ALIEN, E.T SHIT, IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE, IS THIS A FUCKIN SCI-FI FLICK OR A FUCKIN  HIGH SCHOOL RELATIONSHIP GONE WRONG, ON HEROINE AND EXTACY???!?!?!?!?!?!\"\\n\r\n=]\\n\r\nP.S- Dont just watch the first episode of this anime, and call it shit, at least watch to episode 3, then judge it, cuz this anime has good pace the plot moves on.",
