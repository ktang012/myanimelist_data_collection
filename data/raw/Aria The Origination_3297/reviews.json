            "content": "The conclusion to the Aria series is an ever so subtle departure from the previous two, however there is a very good reason why this is the case. As many people have already stated, in order to fully appreciate Origination, one should really watch The Animation and The Natural first (and preferably in that order as well). What people don't really go into is why this should be the case with what is purely an episodic, slice-of-life series (I'll get to this in a bit though).\r\nThe story continues in much the same fashion as the first two series, dealing as it does with the dailylives of Akari, Aika and Alice and their efforts to become Prima Undines, however the biggest difference is that the characters are not only developed more in Origination, but developed well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main strengths of the Aria series as a whole is the effortless manner in which it tells its various stories, and Origination is the pinnacle of this. The plot in each episode is far more fluid than in the previous two series, and as the show progresses the story moves into a barely unnoticeable higher gear as the bittersweet climax approaches.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two things which make the story in Origination noticeably different from the first two series. The first, and most obvious difference, is the fact that Origination has a goal in mind, and unlike the previous two offerings, doesn't simply peter out towards the end but actually gains momentum. The second difference is surprisingly (and somewhat unfortunately), unrealised by many, however it is key to appreciating the franchise in its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated in my review of the second series, The Animation was simply an introduction to the characters and Neo Venezia, whilst The Natural was an introduction to the world of Aqua. This is important to know as many people misjudge the first two series and believe they have no real focus. In fact they do, and without that focus Origination would never have been as good as it is. If one keeps in mind that the whole point of The Animation is not to develop the characters, but simply to introduce them, then it makes things a little clearer as to why it was structured in such a way. The same goes for The Natural, as the focus there was to familiarise the viewer with the world of Aqua, and its wonders and oddities. The characters receive some measure of development in the second series, however this is not the main focus of the show, as it is essential for the viewer, when watching the final series, to have more than a passing familiarity with the characters and their environs.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Origination steps in. From the outset the assumption is that one is familiar with the characters, Neo Venezia, and the world of Aqua, and because of this Origination can proceed with the story proper without the need for introductions, supernatural events, exploration, etc. Everything up until that point was simply preparation, which at first may seem wasteful, but watching the first and second season is a pleasant experience so one could fairly state that the effort was justified to a degree.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Origination is much the same as the first two outings. There isn't any real change to the design of the characters, or to Neo Venezia and Aqua, although it should be pointed out that Origination has more in common with the first season in terms of art and backgrounds as it is mainly centred in Neo Venezia as well. The quality of animation remains superb, with no real noticeable flaws, whilst the level of detail in both the animation and the artwork is once again excellent.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest areas for the series as a whole is in the quality of its sound and music, and whilst the first two series were excellent in this department, Origination represents a step up. The subtlety and detail of some of the effects are truly phenomenal, and although the thematic music may be the same as the previous two series, the score actually feels fresh in Origination (more on this in a bit). The voice actors are, once more, excellent, however there is a very subtle difference with their portrayals in Origination in that the characters seem more self-assured than in either of the previous two series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are as adorable as ever, but once again there is a difference to them. The feeling of self assurance one receives from the voice actors is carried through with the actions of the characters themselves, and this is one of the ways in which they receive some of their phenomenal development. This doesn't simply apply to Akari, Aika and Alice either, but is also extended to Alicia, Akira, Athena, Akatsuki, Al, and even Grandma Akino.\\n\\n\r\nThe surprising thing about Origination's characters is that, in comparison to The Natural, they possess and air that is fresh and new. This feeling is also inherent in the score (as I mentioned earlier), in the settings, and in the voices too. There is a very simple reason for this though. Whilst it may (or may not), be true that the viewers are already familiar with the series before watching Origination, it is a certainty that everyone who has worked on it will know the characters, Neo Venezia and Aqua, pretty much inside out. This, together with the fact that Origination actually has a focus and a definite end, means that everything was already defined before the series even began. It is because of this that Origination is able to achieve its remarkable feat of plot and character development, something it could never have done had everything been told over the course of one season.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, Origination is something I would recommend to everyone, however it should be remembered that the first two series should be watched prior to this. The show is as relaxing as The Animation, whilst retaining the same adventurous quality of The Natural. The characters actually become more endearing as the show progresses, especially if one has watched seasons 1 and 2, and whilst the format may still be episodic, it doesn't suffer from the same ambiguity that affected the previous two series.\\n\\n\r\nOrigination is an excellent show that successfully retains the essence of the series whilst at the same time developing the characters and advancing the plot. Because of the definite focus of the show, things that may have seemed stale in The Natural have been given a new lease of life and, whilst this may not seem like a difficult thing to achieve, it is actually one of the hardest things to do in any medium.",

            "content": "All good things must end, as the saying goes.\r\nAll good things must end.\r\nMan, I hate that saying. I hate it for how true it is. Kozue Amano, why couldn't you keep it going? Did you run out of ideas? Was five and a half years enough? Did you already plan this out? Wait, what am I saying? Of course you planned it out. Month after month, you crafted chapter after chapter of this masterpiece.\r\nJyunichi Sato, thank you for taking this work and running with it. For three separate seasons, each one improving on the last, you dealt the manga justice. You even added a newcharacter that Kozue retconned into the story. And she was fabulous.\\n\\n\r\nI should probably stop the ranting and the gratitude-giving and get to the review. Although this is under Aria the Origination, this will be a review of all three seasons plus the OAV.\\n\\n\r\nAria is a bloody masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nYes, you heard me right. &quot;All 10's will make you untrustworthy and prejudiced, and people won't pay attention to your reviews anymore!&quot; Blah blah blah, whatever. I don't care if no one ever reads my reviews again. ARIA is that good. I savored each and every episode of the anime, along with each and every chapter of the manga. Whenever I watch ARIA, I have this stupid grin on my face. I can't help it.\\n\\n\r\nSo why is Aria that good?\\n\\n\r\nOne, the magic of the characters. You start off with Akari, the cheery protagonist, arriving on Aqua (used to be Mars) to fulfill her dream of becoming a master gondolier, an Undine. There, she meets her mentor, the perfect Alicia, who teachs Akari the ins and outs of the trade. Along the way, Akari befriends Aika, the heir to one of the biggest gondolier companies on the planet, Himeya. She also befriends Alice, the genius gondolier from Orange Planet. Aika also has a mentor, the ever-so-awesome Akira. Alice's mentor is the ever-so-clumsy Athena. Akari also meets Akatsuki, the apprentice Salamander who controls Aqua's climate, Albert, the Gnome who controls Aqua's gravity, and Woody, the Sylph who makes deliveries by aircraft. Akari also meets Akino, the mentor of Alicia, and Ai, a girl from Manhome (Earth). Yes, all of the characters have names that start with A with the exception of Woody, but there is never a time when you are confused between who's who. Character introductions and development are handled impeccably well.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, the complete lack of an overarching plot. Yep. Every episode is basically a one-shot, providing a glimpse at the utopian society of Neo-Venezia. Some episodes are character driven, while others are setting-driven. There are no antagonists, no final boss fight, and no conflicts. Therein lies the terms &quot;healing anime&quot; and &quot;slice-of-life,&quot; which both describe this show perfectly. Now, that does not mean that ARIA fails to invoke emotion. Some episodes will make you cry manly tears. Some episodes will make you laugh out loud. ARIA is a show that you can sit back and watch every night before you go to bed. It improves the quality of your sleep. I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nThree, the progression of the animation throughout seasons improves leaps and bounds. I'll admit that some scenes were full of QUALITY, but by Origination, there is none of that. Origination is even in widescreen, giving everything a more epic sense. I loved the water animation, the chibi faces, the epic gondolier rowing, everything.\\n\\n\r\nARIA has something for everyone. Lesbian tendencies? Oh yes. Epic boat rowing? Even more yes. Heartwarming just to the point of sappiness? Triple yes. And there are much, much more: a soothing soundtrack, amazing vocal insert songs, fabulous opening and endings. The sound production is just perfect. The openings are different for each episode too, allowing you to immerse yourself into each episode seamlessly.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot pinpoint a favorite episode, but I loved the 11th episode of the first season, when Akari waves to Aika and Alice from the bridge. I also loved the snowball episode, the four-leaf clover episode, and the well episode. My favorite character is Akira, by far. Her spunkiness and her awesome chibi-face won me over.\\n\\n\r\nBut alas, all good things do come to an end. As I sit and watch the final episode of Origination again, I cannot help but close my eyes and feel them tearing up. I'll miss each and every character immensely.\\n\\n\r\nGood work, Kozue Amano. Good job, Jyunichi Sato. I salute you for making me sleep better at night these last five and a half years.\\n\\n\r\nSit back and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nA.D. 2301 - The Voyage from Neo-Venezia.",

            "content": "This is my first review; and what better series to review than the glorious Aria the Origination. \r\nThis is what I've been looking for all along. This is the reason why I have been spending countless hours experiencing many different stories, encompassing so many different themes while simultaneously being sucked into an abundance of worlds. There is a saying that goes as such: \"A good life is a collection of happy moments\". This is exactly what this anime was to me. It taught me, along with many others, to appreciate life, and how incredible it truly is.\r\nThe third and final season of Aria didn't tryto impress its audience from the get-go. Instead it allowed the viewers to try and envision what the outcome might be, however obvious it was from early on in the franchise. I even found myself in the first couple of episodes of this season scratching my head, wondering why people were giving the show as much praise as it frequently gets; as the opening episodes were not as flashy as I expected them to be. I almost got the impression that I was re-watching the first season: Aria the Animation. I felt as if this season was a bit of a back-step; lowering itself in terms of storytelling from the brilliant Aria the Natural. Don't be afraid, however, if you find yourself feeling the same way after watching the first couple episodes. It is certainly not like that the whole through. I can assure you. Don't get me wrong, the first two or three episodes were still pretty good, just not as 'special' as I thought they would be. \\n\r\nOrigination focuses much more purely in being a undine in Aqua. Unlike Natural, which focuses more in the city of Neo Venezia, and all the supernatural beings which inhabit it, the final season shines its spotlight on the act of being a gondolier. We see more prospect in how our three young undines go by their day-to-day life, rowing their gondola, and their struggles and efforts to finally becoming a prima. Earlier on I mentioned that it is quite evident what will happen by the end of the series, and by that I meant that it will end with Akari, Alice, and Aika being prima undines. If this was to end otherwise, it would be unsatisfactory, and almost a dreadful 'read the manga' ending, that would ultimately be a massive spit in the face to the viewer. Heck there are even pictures of the show, which illustrate our three undines, without their signature gloves: this obviously meaning that they have become primas. Regardless, I assure you that the show ends almost perfectly, as it left a wide, almost creepy smile across my face, for the entirety of the final several episodes. Aria the origination was brilliantly directed, as we dive into the fantastical world that is Aqua, in all its glory.\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is as well truly extraordinary. There is a very correct balance between comical moments, and more heart-tugging moments, with each individual episode ending with Ai-chan's unbearably cute voice. Of course the setting is still on-point, as Neo Venezia is almost as if its an exact replica of Venice. Each building feels real, the sea and the chilling breeze when a character stares into the ocean, reaches the viewer, as I often felt chills down my spine. Thus the city is given life, just like how Akari explains almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have not once been left disappointed by the fluidity, background depth and detail, character designs and color palette, but instead I am left in awe by how brilliantly done they all are. The final season of Aria, as expected, does not disappoint. In matter of fact, it is even more spectacular. There were times that I felt as if I as watching a movie by the sheer magnificence of the show visually. One aspect of the art that really surprised my how by the use of 3D in this season. You can tell just how much effort was put into this anime! Another example of how much the animation/art quality improved in this season, was the detail of each character's faces, or more specifically their eyes. Any scene which took place on the Hope Hill (the green hill with all the wind turbines), looked almost godly. The only minor irritation I had with this aspect was that there were a few too many (albeit hilarious) chibi scenes. Although these helped tone down the show, I feel as if it would have been better without as many as there were. The reason why I included that comment in this section, is since such scenes tended to be more lackluster in animation (as one would expect). Overall, however, I am utterly pleased with this aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\n If you go ask anyone who has watched the entirety of Aria, what their favorite aspect of the show was, 9/10 times it would be the soundtrack.Why, do you ask? Well it was through this show that I found out that one could orgasm through longitudinal waves! (nerdy joke) But on a more serious note; the mixture between orchestra, piano, and violin was masterful, and each track was played at the perfect moment! If this aspect was not how it was, the ending result would be no where near as impactful as it is. This might be an obvious statement, but Aria the Origination heavily relied on its soundtrack to guide the tone of the show. And without guidance, you have a badly paced series. Something I should truly praise the show for is its seiyuu performances. Each and every seiyuu was perfect: especially Akari's voice actress: she reflected Akari's character flawlessly, as being a constantly happy and optimistic girl; a role which I believe to be exceedingly difficult to master. The ending song was one of the greatest things I have ever experienced: both visually, and sound-wise. It fat the tone of the show quintessentially! The opening was as well great, although not as memorable.There's not much I can say to bash this section, as the show did almost everything right, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nA problem that I tend to have with shows that have a very limited cast, is that there is not enough variety through their emotions, in order to truly satisfy my needs as a viewer. However, Aria is a show that turns this speculation upside down. Each and every character is fully developed, three-dimensional, and human. They are realistic, and although they are happy most of the times, there is more behind that smile than one would think. Akari Mizunashi is a great example of this. She is described as a quote on quote \"Eternal optimist\" or \"Miss expect of happiness\" and there is a valid reason for this. It is rare to see this character feeling down or depressed. At first I found this trope pretty unrealistic, but especially with Origination I was proven very wrong. She expresses so much emotion just by her intelligent analogies and 'speeches' about how important life is to those who respect their lives. She is very important to the story, as her character makes the entire city feel happy and content. She helps her friends when they feel down, and she even tries her utmost when she herself feels as if she cannot mirror her title. Alicia Florence is another fantastic character: she does not go about explaining her reasoning like any other human. Instead, she will go about her explanation in a very peculiar way. She might start rolling a snowball out of nowhere just to prove a point! I realise that this sounds silly, but I was utterly amused by how accurate those actions were to help explain her points. She, like Akari, is more often than not, always wearing a smile. This helps Akari keep her own smile, so that she could be able to illustrate her talent as an undine. \\n\r\nAlice Carroll is my personal favorite character ( plus my new waifu but that's besides the point). The reason why this is so, is since she is probably the most logical, intelligent, and talented undine out of all the cast, at such a young age. She is almost inspiring as a character: not only to those in the anime, but to the viewer him/herself. I particularly love how she has an O.C.D, as she has to, for example, kick a stone all the way home one day, or another she will have to walk backwards, or walk only in shadows. This makes her character more realistic, as it demonstrates her more childish side, since shes only 14. *Small Spoiler* She also has an impeccable singing voice which came to my surprise.\\n\r\nThe rest if the cast, which I could talk about for eternities, is all fully fledged out, and as i mentioned before, realistic. The only issue I had is that I wanted a bit more backstory for other characters, but that's only a small problem, which wouldn't really affect the show too much. An honorable mention is Grandma, who had a brilliant backstory, and was a fantastic addition to the cast, even though it was seldom that she appeared in the show. But I digress, since the characters were all pretty much perfect; even the secondary characters such as the Patissiere and Akatsuki.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there is any other slice of life series that could provide as much enjoyment as this one did. Almost every single episode left me teary-eyed. Episode 9 was one of the greatest episodes I have seen in a LONG time. It was surprising, beautiful and incredibly well animated. That is not to say that it was miles ahead of any other episode, as they were all important to the story, which ultimately lead to the magnificent and conclusive ending, which could not have satisfied me more than it did. All I can say is Bravo! What an accomplishment this show truly was.\\n\\n\r\n If only this series gained more mainstream recognition. It truly, truly deserves a wider audience,  even though it is not, of course, perfect. But then again, no show ever is. Sayonara Akari, Alice, Alicia, Aika, Athena, Akira, and Aria. It was a fantastic run.

            "content": "All things eventually have to come to an end, especially with series that have left a mark on many people. One series that has cemented itself as the king of accomplishing this for many is the Aria series. What many consider to be the series\u2019s magnum opus, Aria the Origination is the last chapter in the anime adaptation of the beloved manga. As you might figure out, it is just about as glamoured with gorgeous music, cheerful characters, and melodramatic optimism as one can handle. Despite all of the beautiful aspects of this show, and the series as a whole, there\u2019s still that one questionthat has always bugged me with each season: Why am I not smiling?\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start voicing my criticism on these issues, I\u2019d like to explain the positive aspects of Origination that leave it off from being just a \"decent\" show and try to describe it without trying to compare it to previous seasons. To put it into perspective, Origination is supposed to be the accumulation of everything that the series was building up to. As we see the characters grow from their past experiences, it is inevitable that they want to make it into a big emotional climax to end it all. To which I can concur it is a satisfying conclusion to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSince Origination is focused on the character development, this is where Origination truly shines that tries to develop them little by little. Because we have followed three of these girls and their elder undines for so long, their complex relationships have been built up for the inevitable climax that shows them growing into leaving their profession as full-time undines. Its slow pacing is why it works as lovely character development because there are no awkward transitions between episodes that feel problematic to the characters growth.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, you can\u2019t talk about a season of Aria without ever mentioning its musical composition. It is no secret that the series is known for its beautiful and memorable score and Origination does not fail on this aspect. Although I would consider this to be the weakest of the series, there is no reason to suggest that the instrumentation of the songs in Origination still keeps the spirit of the series going. The music involves a lot of Celtic guitar instrumentation that feels fitting with the setting and atmosphere. Vocals are exceptionally graceful and give an excellent introduction to the show as the opening guides us into a new kind of adventure with each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series progressed, the animation and art got better and better as their budget had increased by the time they started with Animation. Origination\u2019s celebrated blend of colors and misty backdrops gives the show a dreamy atmosphere with transparent white overtones of the environments and characters. Character designs are neatly colored with nice clean looks to their facial features and their expressions, especially when they are in chibi form whenever a comedic moment happens. It creates a decent flow of showing a new dimension to the show by not just being a somber slice of life, but also a comedy with zany edges to it. They are not what you would call hilarious or hysterical by any means, but they are funny tidbits that have a nice spark of humor to Origination.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what many might conceive as one of the best facets of Aria is the atmosphere. It is often praised for being very relaxing and brings feelings happy emotions to the audience from the artistic aspects to the character interactions that follow it. It cannot be denied that the features that inhabit it do not exist in some form, but for all intents and purposes, for me, that sort of ethereal atmosphere only does very little to make the series impacting. To put my criticisms into perspective, an atmosphere that wants to make the audience feel any emotion needs to have some semblance of a structure that makes it feel natural and effective. With the case of Aria, it feels as though it just wants to be a relaxing atmospheric show just for the sake of being one and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nAnother troubling aspect of the atmosphere that doesn\u2019t make for a worthwhile experience is the fact that it is always the same impending tone. It is true that there are some moments where we are given a slightly different shift in tone to a more somber, depressing one, but those are very few and far in-between. Because of this, the whole atmosphere feels extremely fake and alienating for someone like me who does not feel the need to take the atmosphere for granted. The atmosphere is entirely stagnant and makes Origination a rather dense slice of life show that seems to think that life is always this happy-go-lucky experience with halfhearted expectations of things getting better.\\n\\n\r\nIn conjunction with the atmosphere, the characters that inhabit Aria are not necessarily the most magnificent cast of characters that you might\u2019ve been told so. Now like I\u2019ve said before, all of their developments are great and make them standout. You can\u2019t make bland characters any better by just making them developed to excuse all the yawning. Besides their development, what other characteristics do they have that make them any more significant? Is it the fact that they continuously throw in monotonous catchphrases to try to make them not dull? The fact that they all have similar optimistic outlooks that hardly make them any more distinct from any other character? Or that they constantly throw in pointless poetic dialogue to somehow make them seem more insightful than what they are?\\n\\n\r\nI can appreciate some of the quirkiness that is thrown out here and there from the characters, but that is not enough to think of any of them as inspired characters. Once in a while, I can chuckle at the catchphrases, but it is quickly forgotten due to the uninspired way they implement it into the show. There are even some character side stories that don\u2019t go anywhere that can be construed as the show cutting some things off of the manga, like the awkwardly written romance between Aika and Albert. What it all comes down to is that none of the characters have anything to offer in terms of creativity or intrigue other than their development, which is two completely different things in character writing.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the negatives, I pointed out in this point of the series, Origination is not something that I would consider terrible or bad for that matter. It is decent for what it is, which I would say is a positive overall evaluation for the series as a whole. Origination is not the remarkable life-changing show that many like to make it up to be in my opinion, but it is not the polar opposite to that effect. There are plenty of qualities that can be looked upon with fresh eyes. All that is left to do is to pinpoint what stands out for them as an experience worth going through.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "Before watching Aria the Origination, you have to have watched the prequels - The Animation, The Natural and The OVA: Arietta - otherwise you will be doing yourself - but more importantly this series - a great disservice. Because Origination, being the grand finale of the franchise, demands that you as a viewer has formed bonds to the setting and characters of the Aria universe; if you haven't, you will automatically disarm the bomb of emotion that is this third and last season of Aria.\r\nAnd that would be so incredibly sad.\r\nOnce again we return to Aqua, the planet which prior to human terraforming went bythe name of Mars. Upon the surface of this ocean-clad planet, we find the city of Neo-Venezia, an almost perfect replica of the presently (Aria takes place in the 24th century) submerged Venice on Earth. In this old, yet new, city, the gondoliers are without exeptions female, are called Undines and work for one out of three companies: Aria, Himeya or Orange Planet. The Aria series revolve around the daily lives of the Undines Akari, Aika and Alice -- them practicing rowing the gondola, the people they meet, the places they visit, but most importanly their hopes and dreams, of which the wish to become a Prima Undine, the very elite amongst the Undine, is the ultimate goal.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot moved along at a leisurely pace during the first two seasons. They were more or less episodic series, and while the seasons changed from spring to winter and from winter to spring, the characters didn't develop that much and you couldn't really feel that the main story was actually moving forward. Don't get me wrong now -- I really liked both the Animation and the Natural -- but when juxtapositioned with the Origination, the lack of character development becomes quite evident.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily enough, the things the previous seasons lacked are abundant and overflowing in the Origination.\\n\\n\r\nThe absolutely most impressive thing story-wise is that nothing unpredictable happens. Despite this - or maybe thanks to this - the directors have polished the unfolding events to perfection. While the first few episodes aren't that exceptional (hence the 9 to the story), what comes afterwards makes up for that thousandfold. From episode 5 onwards, this is the single most emotional anime - or any production, for that matter - I've ever watched. I was almost constantly crying until I found it astounding that my tear glands could even produce any more liquid.\\n\\n\r\nYes, for almost three hours.\\n\\n\r\nApart from seeing the three main characters finally making their dreams come true, we also get to witness the birth of Aria company, a beautiful story in its own right. As if that wasn't enough, we are also provided with tear-jerking flashbacks to the times when the Undine trio first met their senpais/seniors. The \"Origination\" in the title is not there just for show.\\n\\n\r\nHAL Film Maker - and of course the manga's original creator - deserve enormous amounts of credit for making the setting trustworthy. I have yet to visit Venice myself (will change this fact next year), but judging from the footage I've seen, they've really paid attention to detail when creating Neo-Venezia -- buildings, islands, shops and traditions from Earth's Venice are all present, something that gives Aria its own, unique atmosphere. The use of colours is also skillfully handled, making the city and it's inhabitants - and of course the water - feel full of life. I was particularily impressed by how the animators made all the strong emotions show on the characters' faces so realistically... with such purity. Aria the Origination might not be an example of cutting-edge animation technology, but on the other hand -- it proves that an anime doesn't have to boast with tons of flashy effects to excel in this department. And it does look considerably better than it's predecessors.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, we have the mandatory slow, comforting opening song that may not be as great as the previous ones, but it's definitely anything but bad. The ending theme, Kin no Nami Sen no Nami, is a much more powerful ballad that fits perfectly with the ebullient emotions the characters - and most likely the viewer - go through during the episodes. Background music was not memorable for me (it almost never is), but I have a hard time imagining that it was anything but stellar during the crucial scenes, considering the impact they left on me. Sound effects were also deftly handled -- the gentle splash of an oar cutting through the water, the cries of the seagulls, the bustling sounds of a crowded marketplace. It was all great. Voice acting? Phenomenal. You can really feel that the voice actresses have captured the essence of their characters perfectly after sticking with them for 50+ episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, Aria's greatest strength has always been it's wonderful cast of characters and the interactions between them. We have the happy-go-lucky Akari, around whom miracles always seem to occur. She loves Aqua more than anyone else and always describes the beauty of nature and life with exquisite words. Words which are more often than not interrupted with the more down-to-earth Aika's trademark line, \"Embarrassing remarks are NOT allowed!\", which in turn is countered by a \"You're very nosy.\" from the youngest of the three, Alice. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the comedy moments admittedly are highly repetitive, I actually enjoyed them as well, knowing that I would miss them after finishing the series. Other than that, character interactions are simply beautiful. Over the course of the Aria series, the girls' friendship deepens considerably with all the happy and sad moments they go through together. They gradually realize that becoming a Prima Undine also means that their next to worryless days spent practicing together will come to and end -- that a full schedule means little time to spend with each other. Akari also has to come to terms with the fact that she alone will be shouldering the fate of the two-man Aria company, together with her future apprentice, and thereby say goodbye to the happy years spent with her beloved senior Alicia.\\n\\n\r\nBut life goes on and having less time to spend with the people you hold dear only makes you treasure and enjoy these precious moments even more.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on writing forever, but I have to stop sometime, right?\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination is undoubtedly the single most important anime I've ever watched. It made me cry rivers while smiling and actually provided me with a new outlook on life, neither of which any other man-made production ever has succeeded in doing. \\n\\n\r\nI tried my best, but it was fruitless; words aren't enough for me to describe how much I love this incredible series. You just have to watch it yourself (unless you're a heartless bastard, of course).\\n\\n\r\nMy only 10 I've ever given without hesitating will be awarded Aria the Origination.",

            "content": "The last voyage to Neo-Venezia? \r\nFor those who have followed Aria from the beginning, be it with the &ldquo;Aria&rdquo; manga or the anime series &ldquo;Aria The Animation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aria The Natural&rdquo;, this third season &ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo; will no doubt be the greatest of all. \r\nIf you haven't watched either &ldquo;Aria The Animation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aria The Natural&rdquo; you might still enjoy &ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo; but you will not be able to enjoy all the depths and events this season has to offer without knowing the character's pasts.\r\nAlthough the primary settings seems to be science fiction due to it's setting in the distant future on terraformedMars (now named &ldquo;Aqua&rdquo; as the terraforming project covered the planet's surface with water) it actually is a slice-of-life series with an uncanny knack to make you see simple things as miraculous events full of joy and hope. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire series focuses more on the daily lives of Akari and her friends and does not really contain a specific plot, save for their goal to become prima undines, professional gondoliers that guide tourists through Neo-Venezia, a recreation of earth's Venice. Although this season does see that plot come to a conclusion in which all the characters evolve, like flowers blooming under the soothing springtime sun. Everything comes full circle and while one may wipe away a tear at the end, the series immediately makes you smile again at the beginning of the new voyage it sets off on.\\n\\n\r\n&ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo; starts off with episodes much as the previous &ldquo;Aria&rdquo; seasons, more common daily events in which Akari, Aika and Alice find joy or unexpected small miracles, and one can be amazed at how Kozue Amano and the staff are able to bring such seemingly mundane events in such a way that they become heart-warming tales. If you had a bad day, an episode of Aria is guaranteed to cheer you up and give you renewed hope. \\n\\n\r\nThe latter half of the season sees all characters achieve their goals and even though their lives forever change the undines Akari, Aika, Alice, Alicia, Akira and Athena will forever treasure their time spent together, remaining close friends with a past they won't forget.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough to the fans it may be sad to see Aria go, the series closes off with a wonderful sentiment, that even though the days of happiness as you knew them are now gone and that voyage is over, you mustn't be sad as another voyage filled with miraculous days is about to begin. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation in &ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo; was terrific, in most episodes the animation was up to par with that of  the OVA, &ldquo;Aria the OVA ~Arietta~&rdquo;  and the character drawing style leaned closer to that of the OVA instead of the more rounded off shapes from &ldquo;Aria The Natural&rdquo;. It did look like the gondolas were drawn significantly bigger than in previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAll the undines looked divine, a lot of attention off course went into making the main characters look superb, and their hilarious chibi modes were present each episode. The backgrounds of Neo-Venezia are rendered as such that you're immediately drawn into their world, the rich palette of bright blue waterways, warm orange sunsets, make you feel as if you're on Aqua.\\n\\n\r\nChoro Club and Senoo again deliver a great soundtrack, with music that fits the scenery of Aqua, featuring soft piano melodies and calm ballads. A prime example of how a soundtrack can perfectly  match a series and accentuate the emotions presented on-screen.  The OP and ED songs too make a wonderful fit, the OP &ldquo;Spirale&rdquo; always accompanied by different scenes of Neo-Venezia.     \\n\\n\r\nI often experience that people either fall completely in love with &ldquo;Aria&rdquo; or totally do not appreciate the series. If you like the slice-of-life genre or want to see a unique series that soothes the soul, then I definitely recommend &ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo;.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe &ldquo;Aria&rdquo; would be: 'a breath of fresh air'.",

            "content": "*This is my first review\r\n*I will be writing this review on all 3 parts of Aria and will be summarized individually, the score overall is on the series in its entirety\r\nThis series was number of firsts for me, first true slice of life I have watched, first anime in which the focus was on a female protagonist through its entirety while also including introspective reflection, and the first piece of media that I truly appreciated for its episodic nature.\r\nBefore watching I had high expectations of what I thought Aria was going to be brought on by the high rating, glowing recommendations, and the relative obscurityof such a highly acclaimed series. All of these expectations were more than met, but that is not to say Aria is without its flaws. Aria in its entirely really is a masterpiece and its flaws may not be objectively true and dependent on the viewer, it is important to note this both while watching Aria and while reading this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation - To be expected, this season served to introduce you both to the endearing characters and the setting of Neo-Venezia as well as Aqua. This part happens to contain two of my favorite episodes of the Aria series as well as two of my least favorite(both of these for reasons similar to filler and boredom). Most of my criticism is left on the atmosphere that Aria the Animation seemingly fails to develop, the atmosphere feels almost sterile or stagnant as there seems to be little that happens out of the ordinary and very little mystery about the environment. The world itself seems a tad small and contained which ultimately brings about a \"boring\" feel to the first iteration.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also weaker than the next, which is to be expected as it is the most outdated but it is still brilliantly animated.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before the story is mostly introductory and little is revealed about what makes Aria so great until the latter half and maybe even until Aria the Natural. Nevertheless the first taste of things to come is experienced through the endearing and well-established characters going about their day to day life. As well the always entertainingly beautiful and relaxing storyline of Aria is prevalent but maybe not as dynamic or evident as in later iterations.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is really top notch, this may be the one area that might not have been improved on by later adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nReally what Aria the Animation fails to do is being as strong as its successors, which doesn't really take away from the experience on its own especially since the series is an episodic one. At the very least it serves as important step into understanding and enjoying Aria as a whole.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAria the Natural - The true embodiment of Aria's spirit in my opinion, all the things that make the series great are found here. The mysteries and fantasy of Neo-Venezia and Aqua being discovered and represented beautifully in all aspects is truly a pleasing experience to behold. I would also like to note that the slice of life component is most dutifully found here. This is by far the more relaxing of the three, and may I stress that I say relaxing not boring, the story here is surprisingly engaging even though that is something I have personally struggled with when watching episodic series is my inability to become invested episode to episode, I had no trouble doing so with Aria the Natural. This due in part to the stagnancy that I had mentioned earlier being shattered by the introduction of menace or negativity in a way that does not contradict the flow and feeling of the series overall. Because of this you come to appreciate the magnificent nature of each episode even more.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have previously mentioned, Aria the Natural improves(maybe even dramatically so)on everything that Aria the Animation brought to the table as well as representing the soul of the Aria series almost poetically.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination - While Aria the Natural represents the soul of Aria, Aria the Origination undoubtedly represents the heart. \"No embarassing remarks allowed!\" I know but let me explain, I would go so far as to say that Aria the Origination changes everything about the Aria series while also preserving it. That may be confusing but really it maintains everything that makes Aria great while introducing drama and conflict while progressing less episodically and more as a series. Also the emphasis is placed less on the setting of Neo-Venezia and more so on the characters and their development, this is done in a surprisingly superb fashion by introducing an entirely new aspect to Aria while still tailoring to its original greatness.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their stories are elegantly weaved together while staying respective to their individual development, development so surprisingly good that you would almost wonder when the characters changed so much. This thought however will probably never cross your mind since this is done so in a matter that is natural and stays true to characters you were originally introduced to. \\n\\n\r\nThe drama that comes with the conclusion of the series is magnificent and touching. By the end you will realize all the wonderful lessons you were inadvertently being taught throughout the series and this makes it that much more meaningful and timeless. Aria is truly an experience in which you will enjoy, be enlightened, and have your the boundaries of your imagination stretch, ideas that all pieces of media striving to become a masterpiece should fulfill.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is brilliant, there are some episodes that continue the flow, but may fail to truly captivate the viewer, nearly episode is at the very least entertaining\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much that can be said about the art, it is incredible and stunning and an easy selling point for the anime\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe OST suits the setting perfectly, and in Aria the Origination it suited the more touching and dramatic moments in their feelings of wonder, change, and simplicity\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nI would be hard pressed to choose a character in which I didn't like, as well as the character that I liked most. All of the characters are endearing and charming, and play their role radiantly in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe different elements of Aria, are all enjoyable, but more specifically the enjoyment lies in the slice of life component as it gives you the feeling of beauty and relaxation\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n",

            "content": "The third season of Aria, Aria the Origination is a stunning and satisfying conclusion to the Aria story. With 2 seasons and a few OVAs behind it, I would say Aria the Origination has perfected the slice of life formula, hence its very well deserved high scores. I did analyze this alot, but at the end concluded that a review of this series would only be effective if it came from the heart :)\r\nAs stated by pretty much every reviewer, to fully appreiate the masterpiece that is Aria The Origination you should first watch Aria the Animation, Aria the Natural and the other OVAs/Picture Dramas.When you start with Aria the Origination, you're already familiar with boh Neo-Venezia, its citizes, the cats and Akari and her circle of friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling is high art. It always starts with Akari writing to her friend, Ai-Chan about the weather, and what is happening today. It's like watching some old friends go about their lives. It feels good and familiar, then there's the realization/lesson/moral of that episode, and a conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nEverything is so well done that although I swore I wouldn't, somehow, sometime during each episode my emotions would get the better of me and then tears would fall from my eyes. Something would set it off, a line of dialogue, the scenery, the music with meaningful lyrics. Most of the time it's not even tears of sadness, but tears of gladness, or joy, or I'm crying because something is so beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nOK, I cried every single episode, with major crying on the last episode when I realized there would be no more Aria after this. Still, even though I want this wonderful anime to continue forever,  I am glad it ended perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone should watch Aria. At the least it's an entertaining slice of life anime. But it has a much deeper meaning and is able to speak directly to the watcher's heart an mind if the watcher is receptive. \\n\\n\r\nSo please, please, watch this wonderful anime! Watch it slowly, savor it, think and reflect on the messages embedded in the wonderful story. Aria has changed me. What I've learned:-\\n\\n\r\n* Stop and smell the roses\\n\r\n* You can find beauty in everyday things - I realized I never looked before but one stretch of woodland road on the way to work is spectacular when the sunlight is streaming through the leaves.\\n\r\n* Do not fall into despair! Be optimistic, look on the bright side, things will get better\\n\r\n* You have some control over your happiness\\n\r\n* Ask for help, but be willing to teach others. I wish I had a teacher like Alicia.\\n\r\n* You can do more than you think you can but you need to try AND believe in yourself\\n\r\n* It's the little things in life that matter\\n\r\n* Think of what is truly important to you. \\n\r\n* I had really good friends, I should have appreciated my time with them more\\n\r\n* Things come up, Life/people may change/leave. What's important is to cherish what you currently have and live in the now. In the end memories are all you keep.\\n\\n\r\nI will be re-watching the entire series whenever I feel down. But in the future I have resolved to stop just working, doing household chores and worrying about the future. Instead I'm going to slow down, tell my family I love and appreciate them being with me and spend more time making happy memories with them.",

            "content": "Aria is a calm, cheerful series that seeks to find simple meaning in ordinary things. However, what meaning is found is usually of a trite nature, such as the love of one\u2019s art being the most important thing in said art. Not only are such messages common and forgettable, but they even occasionally range close to the absurd. Several of the episodes don\u2019t even have applicable morals, and these merely depict the characters enjoying their everyday lives and appreciating simple pleasures. The series seems more preoccupied with wondering at the workings of a nonexistent city than anything else.\r\nWhat meaning is meant to be derived fromthese ventures is almost continuously explained and narrated by someone speaking in a choked up manner unworthy of the event at hand, drawing connections between ordinary happenings and grander themes that are so flimsy, the series would have been better served to demonstrate such a connection in silence than to exposit one with so little a foundation. At some point, if one cheesy and supposedly meaningful line is said after another, it begins to lose any meaning it might have had. What may have been effective in small doses is smothering in excess. In many episodes of Aria, an already longwinded piece of dialogue will seem to have exhausted itself, the accompanying music is petering to a halt, and a scene is drawing to a close, yet the speaker continues on until it becomes tempting to escape the laborious redundancy with the aid of the skip button.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the (incredibly trivial) dilemma and resolve of each episode usually varies, it\u2019s almost as if you could play all the episodes of Aria at once with little discord between them, so similar are they in tone and structure. The same pieces of music are played in almost every episode in similar places, and the events tend to be limited to the characters rowing about on gondolas and wondering at Neo-Venezia, eating homey meals and euphorically proclaiming their tastiness through mouthfuls, and quietly awaking in the morning or going to sleep at night. These scenes are punctuated by the annoying, wordless exclamations of a cat sidekick, who is doubtless intended to be cute but only serves as a possible cause for the viewer to get some exercise reaching to turn the volume down.\\n\\n\r\nWorse than this, the series far too quickly and awkwardly tries to establish a classic comic routine in which the main characters say a series of lines to each other in quick succession. It\u2019s not particularly comical to begin with, but as it is repeated incessantly throughout each episode, it becomes very irksome. In addition, Alicia has but one monotonous exclamation throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThe progression of the characters and relationships, such as it is, is also rather repetitive. There is very little difference in development between one episode in which two characters try to overcome a breach in their relationship and the next in which a similar issue with the same characters is addressed. It\u2019s almost as if these are the go-to episodes as an interlude between the next set of five or so episodes dealing with guest characters and individual themes. Whatever is learned in the previous episode of this nature seems to have been forgotten in the next. This is mainly relevant in the case of Alice, who never ceases to take her mentor, Athena, for granted, and Athena herself, who is even more childish than her student and can\u2019t seem to overcome her own insecurities enough to be open about her feelings with a child.\\n\\n\r\nVery few of the characters ever transcend their initial first impressions. There is nothing more to Alicia\u2019s character than an innate sweetness, and any change she seems to have undergone as a result of her pupil is never demonstrated in any actual happenings or actions throughout the series, but is rather expressed in some gushy and vague dialogue near the end along with a final development that has hitherto never been foreshadowed or referenced and seems to have been invented simply to give the series some kind of emotional punch so that the ending at least wouldn\u2019t be as bland as the rest of the series. Similarly, there is nothing more to Akari\u2019s character than her ability to find wonder in ordinary things, Alice is simply quiet and socially inept, and Akira is strict with her students but only out of kindness. Aika does undergo a bit more development as she struggles with her feelings of insignificance among friends who are more naturally skilled than she, and as she grows to appreciate her mentor\u2019s harsh attitude. Finally, minor characters have even less characterization than the main ones, appearing only long enough to fulfill a brief role now and then, though some do manage to bring a bit of life to the series with some humorous or touching moments.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is broken into three seasons, which most consider to grow progressively better. However, it is the first of these, Aria the Animation, that is the most effective in creating a sweet, quiet atmosphere and the themes that exist are a little bit closer to home. It does not try to seem grander than it is, but moves at a pace just slow enough to be relaxing and just quick enough to sidestep tediousness, choosing simpler analogies and slightly less longwinded explanations than the rest of the series. At thirteen episodes, it has not accomplished anything special in particular, but it has its touching moments.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Natural is double in length, and rather than exploring more content than Animation, its preachy speeches and moments of stillness are maddeningly twice as long as that of Animation. That said, Natural incorporates more fantasy elements, such as several encounters with the spiritual world of cats, and this manages to give a bit of life to the show, inappropriate though it seems in a series that has thus far mostly steered clear of something so bizarrely fantastical. The erratic placement of such episodes further accentuates the incongruity, and overall Natural has a very disjointed feel.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination returns to the more ordinary once again, but it has lost the freshness of Animation and now muddles about in sporadic drama, attempting to emulate character development with little to no buildup. Aria the Animation started in the middle of Akari\u2019s apprenticeship, and the series as a whole chose to focus on individual encounters rather than her continued effort to become an undine. It has no clear direction, which might be expected of such an episodic series, and so its attempt to deliver some sort of grand finale fails miserably, as with little to no plot there are no ends to be wrapped up and the conclusion has little to do with the start.",

            "content": "[DISCLAIMER] As I want to get all my points across, as well as bring this show the justice it deserves, the following review is a lengthily-detailed breakdown of every factor ranging from the story to the overall experience. You may look for other reviews to find a more concise criticism of the show.\r\nIntroduction\r\nWhen we usually talk about things we truly love, it becomes hard to explain why. Most people would not understand the appeal one would get from something\u2014this is especially hard when trying to relay why your favorite book is your favorite book, or why your favorite film is your favorite film.\r\nIn cases, theoften reasons for this are because one, we might sound too forceful and biased, and two, we feel that our recommendations are not doing our experiences with the said medium any justice. As such, it becomes difficult for a person to talk about his favorite without trying to sound illogical. This is hard for someone looking for a more grounded response.\\n\\n\r\nThis review may contain any form of bias, but I will try my best to address the criticisms one may find with this show, and offer my own insights with regards to it, and why it may be irrelevant to my own judgment. Ladies and gentlemen, I offer you a heartfelt review of my favorite anime, Aria the Origination.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever someone hears the name \"Aria\" thrown around in the anime community, it is often referred to by many as the \"healing anime\". Along with the likes of Mushi-shi and Kino's Journey, it is a type of show one would usually mention as an atmospheric series\u2014to say, a show that relies on its execution of audiovisual stimulations to produce an effect of serenity and immersion into the world it's trying to present. It may rely more on enveloping the viewers with its artistic presentation rather than plot progression.\\n\\n\r\nTrue enough to what people claim it is, Aria is a franchise that needs some patience getting into, which can lead to either one of two things: 1) You feel like you belong with the show, or you become attached to it, or 2) You get bored. Atmospheric anime, after all, take its 20-minute episode runtime to dive in with intentionally slow pacing, allowing the audience to let its philosophy or environment sink in. Of course, this would not pose true for others, who may have a different preference for how things should be presented.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, I can still say with courage that everyone should still watch Aria. Whatever one person may gain out of it, the series still provides lot of ground for one to get immersed or be appreciative of, whether it may be the story, its characters, its world, or its music.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\n\"Lots of things change with the flow of time.\"\\n\\n\r\nWith 13 episodes, Aria the Origination is the third and final season to the Aria franchise. Three aspiring girls\u2014Akari Mizunashi, Aika Granzchesta, and Alice Carroll strive forward to reach their dreams of being Prima Undines, the highest-ranking tour guides in the gondola services of Neo-Venezia, an exact replica of Earth's Venice situated in the planet of Aqua, or Mars as it was once called.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first episodes of the series are episodic and are self-contained tales\u2014again, attributing to its slow and atmospheric nature, Origination retains the mood and flow of its predecessors but handles it with rising intensity with each succeeding episodes. How Animation, the first season, and Natural, the second, were trying to attain that execution, often resulting in an assortment of hit-and-miss episodes, Origination does not. It finally finds its footing and rids of its usually subtle approach to a more well-handled presentation.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it does take a considerably inferior beginning, in which the first three episodes can fit in any prior season. Although, after those three episodes, Origination brings new situations and scenarios that provide a refreshing perspective both on the world and its characters. Certain characters get the time to interact with one another in ways unexpected, and it connotes how the cast has developed with time in their own little manners through other characters. It pays a large amount of thankfulness to its previous seasons, and significantly builds on what it began. What follows is a majestic conclusion that makes the story go hand-in-hand with the resolution of the Undines' individual stories.\\n\\n\r\nHow Origination works in contrast to the first two seasons is the way it is generally built out. From the beginning up until the end, it reveals a planned direction it's going to take, and as such intertwines these individual tales as essential to the show's overall picture. A major theme that can be recognized from the series is the concept of change\u2014and while it is natural that a story must eventually end, Origination takes the viewers into the eyes of its characters to emphasize how significant this impending change is. Gone will be the days that we see the girls bonding through practice, and the same also poses true for the Undines as they all step forward to face a new tomorrow. This is nothing short of compelling and remarkable, as the use of Aria's episodic strengths into a sequential structure amplifies its impact.\\n\\n\r\n\"But there are things that never change.\"\\n\\n\r\nAlong with its fresh take on Neo-Venezia, the show prepares to wrap up its story by presenting the final steps the beloved Undines need to face, both in the physical and the emotional sense, as well as expanding and solidifying the relationships they have with their mentors. Every supporting character also gets their fair share of screen time, with great stories surrounding Akatsuki and Al, along with reappearances of characters such as the mailman and Caffe Florian's owner.\\n\\n\r\nAika reveals a much more realistic side of her, portraying her doubts and fears as the trio's most work-oriented person. While noticeably her focus is relegated to a background character for most of the show, the episodes that do focus on her make up for its well-written setup. Like how Akari affects the people around her, Aika gets her development through her impact with other characters, most especially with Akira. Natural had already done its piece in fleshing out Aika, which may have reduced the necessity to explore her character even further. This series simply leads her into an epilogue as the heir to Himeya.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alice's large involvement this time around is monumental not only for the people around her but also for her maturity. Some of the best moments in Origination arguably belong to her, and it surmounts to a satisfying resolution with her initially antisocial demeanor. Bits revolving around Athena's character also show how the two are actually similar, and builds up to a very emotional climax that cements their relationship and solidifies Alice's overall development.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many things to be said about Akari's character, but the most subtle yet significant revelation about her is how she actually stands out as an Undine. Aria has always focused on Akari's adventures of the rustic and mystic Neo-Venezia, and thus veered away from depicting her skills as a gondolier. Origination brings her efforts into light, and proves how she is ready to take on the reins of being a Prima.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to point out about her is the further emphasis of her relationship with Alicia. As the final episode of Natural and the succeeding OVA Arietta sows the seeds through moments where they bond together, it is in Origination where this dynamic between them really blooms\u2014portraying through its scenes how both are influential to one another. Through this, Alicia unravels as a more humane character, as opposed to how the trio perceives her as an unreachable being of perfection.\\n\\n\r\nWith the whole theme of Origination revolving around change, Akari, as the audiences' eyes through Aqua, becomes the most affected person within the environment around her. Cheerful and always upbeat, her reaction to these life-changing events pose an internal conflict within her. While she always sees change within the world of Aqua, she has never had the experience to encounter it firsthand\u2014and the way she responds to it shows her strength, and a huge leap for her character to welcome the future that awaits her. In a sense, Origination serves as a journey to hone her as an Undine, one that truly symbolizes the loving and caring welcome of Aqua.\\n\\n\r\n\"Things that are precious because they change, and things that are precious because they don't change...both are precious.\\n\\n\r\n\"Don't you feel the same?\"\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nOrigination starts off with another beautiful and calming piece through Yui Makino's \"Spirale,\" setting the tone of this final chapter to the world of Aria. Where Aria the Animation's OP immerses you into the world and Aria the Natural encouraging you to join in its rustic beauty, Aria the Origination's opening song reaches out to you in a nostalgic way. Containing this balance of serene and upbeat elements, it plays in an oxymoronic manner of cheerful and melancholic, much like a prelude to a happy farewell. The ending song, \"Kin no Nami Sen no Nami\" by Akino Arai seems to go along with this theme as well, although with a feeling that is more on looking forward to the future\u2014again, a significant motif in Origination. Despite its departure from the usually calming song equal to that of its OP, it still finds a place to exist within Origination's somber themes, even though it may not fit entirely with Aria's atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is already undeniable that Aria has great music, it never stopped getting better, and Origination raises the bar with new piano pieces to go along with the original soundtrack. Where Origination stands out against its predecessors is in its well-handled approach to music, never exceeding its use of both instrumental and lyrical pieces. The inserts never seemed off, and everything suited each scene at a most impressive tone.\\n\\n\r\nTwo new important tracks cement Aria the Origination as a stroke of genius. Ryou Hirohashi's wonderfully haunting \"Lumis Eterne\" amplifies the climactic scene of Episode 9, evoking a cathartic feeling of tearful bliss and satisfaction. Poetic and symbolic of Alice's character progression throughout the series, this song, much like any other track in Aria's score, acquires its own personality. The other song, \"Yokogao,\" which played in the final episode of the show, is another piece sung by Yui Makino that perfectly captures the essence of Alicia and Akari's relationship, as well as their personal connection to the utopia that is Aqua. While being one of the few melancholic songs in Aria's music, it is still a sublime fit to the scene at hand and Aria's positive and emotional soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also safe to say that the voice actors do not falter in their side of the job as well, and their takes on the Undines in their most emotional moments are nothing but amazing. Chiwa Saito handles Aika's different emotions with good comedic awareness, along with standout scenes of her serious and melancholic demeanor. Ryou Hirohashi's \"dekkai\" performance-desu of Alice's childish nature is taken in a much more playful way, and her acting is one of the main reasons why Alice had dominated some of the episodes. Erino Hazuki once again lends her voice to the ever-wonderful Akari, and a lot of her contributions to the character from the \"Hahi\"s to the \"Ehh\"s make her as the only fitting person for Akari's role.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the main trio, the Three Great Water Fairies Alicia, Akira, and Athena are also reprised by Sayaka Ohara, Junko Minagawa, and Tomoko Kawakami, respectively. While already generally praised for their roles, moments in Origination where these characters are set up in dramatic scenes with their juniors further emphasize their great performances.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\\n\r\nWith the transfer from 4:3 to 16:9 beginning from Arietta, the world of Aqua has become wider and immersive than ever. Hal Film Maker continues to work its wonders with stellar and faithful backgrounds mirroring that of real-life Venice. The background department shines with their striking, hand-painted scenery that encapsulates the nearly-ethereal beauty of Aqua, rivaling that of Kozue Amano's original illustrations. Of course, with the series mainly being set in Neo-Venezia\u2014with the exception of an episode that takes place in Neo-Burano Island, set pieces are often used consistently and with less diversity from Natural. It's not to say that they slacked on it, though, as the depiction of the places are not only accurate but also highly detailed improvements to Animation and Natural's already captivating backdrops.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the major boost in Aqua's scenery, it is also fairly evident how the studio keeps a keen eye for the characters, with small but noticeable changes to their designs. Along with that, Origination feels livelier than other installments, having more motion with its frames and very, very elaborate facial animations in the show's critical moments. The comedic expressions remain a staple of the show, and still carry the bulk of Aria's funniest instances.\\n\\n\r\nThis element is not perfect, however, as a 2008 series would somewhat opt to add in CGI to save budget costs. For the most part, the CG in Aria is beautiful and does not really hinder immersion, but there were moments in Origination that it goes beyond using CG water and appears in other elements. Granted, they only appear for two noticeable scenes throughout the show, but these parts were very jarring and could very well be a valid criticism to its animation. Nonetheless, this does not summarize the entirety of the animation, as Origination continues the synchronous blend it has with the soundtrack, initiating a visual and audial experience unlike any.\\n\\n\r\nCriticisms\\n\\n\r\nWrapping up a series is difficult. While Aria ends in quite possibly the best conclusion possible\u2014and quite frankly, one of the best in anime, there are a lot of things to be pointed at that could have made it a bit more fulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter balancing, for example, was noticeably more unbalanced in Origination compared to the first two seasons. While the first season focuses mostly on Akari\u2014as it should, since it's an introduction, the second season diversifies the tales to give the other characters significant depth that they didn't have. It handles every character equally, with the inclusion of the side characters that added more color to the daily adventures in Aqua. Origination tries to shift this focus onto the main trio only, but even in this department it is considerably affected. As aforementioned, Aika does not get as much screen time as she deserves, and while episodes about her are some of the best Aria has to offer, it pales in comparison to the amount of treatment she got in Natural. More importantly, Aika is not the only one to suffer this issue, but to the show's actual protagonist as well. While the last episodes do bring Akari back into the spotlight, the middle part of the show is obviously oriented at Alice, as if the show itself is hinting what is to come for her. It is still a good buildup, and is not necessarily a bad part of the show, as she is underplayed for most of the first two seasons. However, it does betray the point of Origination being a final chapter for all three of them, and it could possibly hamper enjoyment for people expecting a well-rotated character storyline like Natural.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important aspect not addressed by Origination was Cait Sith and the mystical side of Aqua. Natural was all about exploring Aqua and building up its characters at the same time, with the introduction of its spirit guardian. It seemed to emphasize that we will see more of Cait Sith's involvement in the story, although it did not turn out to be the case. Origination completely drifted from its magical elements in sacrifice for a character-oriented story which aimed to bring an ending to them rather than to the world.\\n\\n\r\nIt could also be said that Origination's subtle but important tone shift to put the cast in situations that are much more emotionally testing than its previous iterations. In service of a plot-driven series, after all, is the necessity for conflict to arise. Yet, to bring up a counterpoint, the drama that stirs from Origination can be felt only if you have found the attachment to the characters. When looked at superficially, the conflicts that are brought up in Origination can barely qualify as drama\u2014and even though the themes may still be somewhat deviant from what the first two seasons offered, they still run under the overall concept of optimism and hopefulness.\\n\\n\r\nWith only 13 episodes to end the story, it's honestly surprising that Origination manages to hold out and fill in every aspect it could accomplish in Aria's quite vast world. Not only that, but it ties every loose end about the characters in a very satisfying manner that one can easily overlook its flaws, and indulge in Origination's well-toned balance of drama and the same-old Aria viewers had come to know and love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion\\n\\n\r\nOrigination is one of the rare examples of shows that manages to trump expectations from its prequels. What I believed to be Aria's peak in Arietta immediately got dispelled by how Origination mastered its presentation. Other than that, there are few series that get to end on a high note, and this entry to the story of Aqua and its Undines manages to bring its characters into a full circle, despite its hardly noticeable hiccups.\\n\\n\r\nAria has always been atmospheric, and it pretty much takes the cake as one of the best that handles atmosphere overall, but Origination is the cherry on top, being a conclusion to its well-rounded cast of lovable people. It allows us to appreciate more of the mundane, while also revealing the bigger picture of life.\\n\\n\r\nSome would say that Aria is as saccharine as it can get with its themes, though I would beg to differ. While the franchise certainly is a defining example of things never going wrong, Origination, as it is aptly named, brings us to the beginning of all this happiness\u2014happiness, that you may think is merely blind optimism, but one actually rooted in reality.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an enjoyable show\u2014cathartic and introspective. When approaching this, one may need to put aside everything within their to-do list, and the time to be alone when watching it. It might seem like a bother, but investing yourself into it is one of the best payoffs one could ever have. Emotionally charged yet void of melancholy, Aria the Origination can easily bring anyone to tears with its innocent and caressive approach.\\n\\n\r\nSeagulls fly into the sky as the fresh wind coming from the sea dances through your hair. The campanile tolls its bell, echoing throughout this city of stories. Neo-Venezia is a place filled with wonders and history, and one can easily get lost in the countless experiences you could have. Yet fear not, as someone is always there for you. People of different places and of different journeys, cross paths in this place of miracles.\\n\\n\r\nAqua may seem like an unattainable dream\u2014a place of mere escapism. However, as long as someone welcomes anything before them, whether good, whether bad, like how Akari welcomed Aqua, and how Aqua welcomed her back, there will always exist a Neo-Venezia deep within our hearts.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Aria is a masterpiece\u2014the quintessential slice-of-life show. Rife with characters and stories that are intertwined in this euphoric utopia, Origination brings all of these great moments together, and reaches out to us playfully. Definitively, it is a one-of-a-kind experience you could not afford to miss.",

            "content": "Aria the Origination is the marvelous conclusion of Akari, Alice, and Aika\u2019s journey as undines in training while retaining all of the charm and glorious pace of its predecessors.\r\nStory - 10\r\nOrigination masters the art of telling simplistic, straight forward stories while giving great insight into the characters and the setting.  What were problems in length, use of time, the annoying cats, and introduction of character in Natural and Animation, become the third installment\u2019s strengths.  Every episode in Origination showcases something undiscovered in the series\u2019 previous episodes, whether it be a new occupation, place or characters.  Each episode serves as piece of developmentfor one of the undines, and in the case of the single, even manages to give the viewer a better look at how they grew to become the women they are in flashbacks.  Most importantly, the story manages to make use of all the development, leaving no moment squandered for emotional resonance.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nAria:  The Origination is the reason why moving to widescreen is such a wonderful idea.  The show was already known for its use of panorama and sprawling set-up shots, but moving into widescreen with the added quality of detail in the art made this show stunning visually.  The art design is so original that the viewers instantly know what they are watching and where the action is set.  Character design has improved a little because of the change in proportion from standard to widescreen, so the super sugary edges are rounded off a little bit.  What I love most about the character design is the execution of everyone\u2019s super deformed counterparts.  They are quirky and a little childish, yet very expressive and kind of distill the quality of the character in one look.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThe music is just as wonderful in Origination as it has been in the Aria series.  Incorporation of the music is always appropriate and the quality of the music achieves much of the same notes that the tone and presentation of the show have always tried to create:  a calm, inviting sense of wonder in which something new can be found every time one listens.  Athena\u2019s songs are well done as always and Alice\u2019s song was performed very well considering the constraints of her character\u2019s abilities.  The voice actors really dig deep to properly portray the gamut of emotions their characters go through.  Nothing ever felt forced or contrived from their performances.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nThe characters in Origination take the front seat in care much more so than in the first seasons.  Because of the story, and the decided direction in creating closure for the series, Origination pulls no punches in characterization and development.  Characters once thought of as clumsy and aloof are actually perceptive and doting.  The harsher characters are softened by immaculately exploring their insecurities, and the almost woodenly perfect Alicia is given such a degree of well-executed characterization and development that the distance that Akira as the main character created for the viewer by placing her on a pedestal is slowly brought down making Alicia much more human than I had expected.  Perhaps the only disappointment with the characters is that there is little growth with Akira.  This is most likely because she is a girl so honest in her motives and accepting of all he faults and flaws that there just isn\u2019t much to be done besides rattle her confidence a few times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI loved it all.  Everything just absolutely worked in Aria the Origination.  This is definitely a show where the whole is vastly greater than the sum of its parts.  What I especially loved is that somehow the show gave me everything that I wanted so succinctly and so beautifully.  Also, for the first time in a show I think that I rooted for every character and didn\u2019t want any of them to fail.  This of course to me is a feat in and of itself, especially because I did not warm up to Akari at all until about halfway through this show.  I just embraced all of the characters for what they were and enjoyed watching the growth of everyone by the shows end.  For a brief moment, I wanted another series before I talked myself out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had to mark down other anime's score because they couldn't come even close to Aria.\r\nStory: 10\r\nEven though it doesn't really have a linear plot, each episode shows a great deal of character development, which is the best aspect of Aria. Focusing on the three juniors, we see how they live their daily life and training to become a Prima, interact with each other and other characters, and overcome their own struggles. \r\nAnimation: 10\r\nHAL Film Maker easily becomes one of my favorite animation studio. Excellent color choices, smooth animation, beautiful scenery.. what else could you ask for? Definitely looking forward for the DVD releases, sinceseason 1 has already available for pre-orders.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Simply outstanding. \\n\r\nOhara Sayaka's perfect and kind onee-san Alicia. Hazuki Erino who perfectly depicts Akari's innocent-ness. Chiwa Saito's adorable crybaby Aika. Hirohashi Ryou's lovely and extremely cute Alice. Minagawa Junko who shows Akira's toughness. Kawakami Tomoko's ultimate dojikko Athena. I can't imagine any other voice replacing any of them..\\n\r\nAnd honorable mention to Nishimura Chinami as Aria Shachou.\\n\r\nSongs:\\n\r\nI'm not too fond of Makino Yui at first, but her songs grew into me the more I listened to them.. and I have to say that the original soundtracks are magnificent. Great job, Choro Club ft Senoo.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAs I've stated before, Aria's strongest point is the character interaction and development. We learn more and more about them in each episode, slowly but sure we're emotionally attached to each one of them.. (which makes it really hard to part by the end of episode 13.. but a masterpiece should end to be one).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nBy this point, Aika would have shouted &quot;hazukashii serifu kinshi!&quot; countless times to me, but I just have to praise Aria more. ^^; It's too euphoric it's hard to describe 'the enjoyment' only by words.. It's heart-warming, soothing, and so peaceful it might as well end a war. I enjoyed every single second I spent in Neo-Venezia. Aria stays as the only anime that makes me weep out of happiness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\n..because it simply is that awesome.",

            "content": "This is the final season of Aria, and what a bittersweet one it is. I\u2019m so glad to have discovered this wonderful series, meeting characters and settings I won\u2019t ever forget.\r\nStory: Each episode we follow the various characters through their daily events in beautiful Neo-Venezia, and watch the three apprentice undines on their journeys to becoming professionals. When that moment inevitably arrives, it is definitely one of the most touching scenes I\u2019ve ever experienced. However, the ending events do feel rather fast-paced compared to the slow and dreamy atmosphere of most other episodes. Nonetheless, the ending is deeply satisfying, with a message that time bringschange to people and places, for better or worse. Though we will treasure memories dear to us, we must always progress towards tomorrow.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The overall animation quality is topnotch, and sees improvements over the second season. The art style is what truly stands out though. From calm moonlit nights to romantic sunsets, stunning Italian architecture to fantastic natural landscapes, Aria is a gorgeous animated painting that will sweep you away.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is mostly composed of acoustic guitar, piano, and female vocals. The music helps set the mood perfectly, from serene to upbeat. I felt that the vocal tracks were not as strong as in previous seasons, which set the standard really high, but that did not hinder my enjoyment of the music. Voice acting remains superb, bringing out the distinct personality of each character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: If you have fallen in love with the art and music of Aria, then you will most certainly fall in love with the characters! They are all uniquely wonderful, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that the lead females are very beautiful. Of special note is Akari, the pink-haired protagonist who narrates most of the story. Her romantic, optimistic outlook on life is extremely contagious, and will no doubt bring a smile to your face and warmth to your heart.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Given its slow and gentle pacing, Aria is not an anime to be rushed through. Rather, take the time to relax and really enjoy the series. Watch an episode before bedtime and you\u2019ll surely have sweet dreams, trust me on that! It has taken me over three months to watch the three seasons of Aria, and I have enjoyed it unlike any other anime, partly because Aria IS unlike any other anime!\\n\\n\r\nThe Aria series is truly a masterpiece. Never before have I fallen so in love with a fictional setting and its charming inhabitants. Through the eyes of Akari, I have come to gain even greater appreciation of the treasure that is life. Parting is such sweet sorrow. Though the journey ends here, in my memory it will remain. And what a journey it has been.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n-Ryan\\n",

            "content": "Aria the Origination has achieved something remarkable to which anyone who's familiar with the slice of live genre knows to be an extremely rare phenomenon; it manages to end satisfactory.    \r\nPerhaps more so than even this, it perfectly incapsulates the concept of change, which as anyone not still living in a womb will attest carries great trepidations as well as possibilities. Its said that real courage shines not when one demands change, but upon facing it and seeing all its uncertainty, are able to accept it, and Aria really managed to portray this perfectly along with other themes such as the follyof trying to ignore the future, when even in the most timeless of places, nothing ever stays the same for long, but before we get into all that, a quick summary of the show...\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination maintains the series' core premise, continuing to follow Akari as she and her close friends chase their dream of becoming Undines (Female Gondoliers) in the beautiful and mysterious city of Neo-Venezia, a brick for brick restoration of the ancient city of Venice now built on Mars (renamed Aqua due to the now abundance of water thanks to terraforming). By now the show is a seasoned veteran, with two series' behind its style has been seamlessly perfected till its like watching a master craftsman fusing experience and knowledge to create a work of art born out of every learned from mistake and good idea since built upon.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation was the past, focusing on the love all humans have for the past and its ostensible simplicity, Aria the Natural was the present focusing on the city and the lives of those living and dreaming in it, and so Aria the Origination is the future. It is as Winston Churchill famously said \"not the end or even the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning\", indeed the series is called Aria the Origination not Aria the conclusion, and perhaps this is the shows greatest strength, it matures rather than just stops. The characters move on to that mysterious infinite world where all our favourite characters live forever doing what we love, Sherlock Holmes and Watson discussing a case by the fireplace of 221b Baker street, Esteban and crew still trying to find the mysterious cities of gold, Ginko forever traveling helping people and Mushi, and Akari and friends forever at bliss in Neo-Venezia. Its a bittersweet feeling to have this series end but its such a perfect end that one cannot long hold a grudge against it, besides a perfect end is always better than a slow decline into awfulness (I'm looking at you Simpsons);  i can say little more about the story without giving too much away, and so I shan't\u2026    \\n\\n\r\nThe art has improved to such a standard that like a high tide it seems to lift everything else up with it, the city has never looked more magical or appealing with greater attention given to all the details that make a series come alive, everything from the washing lines that hang from every window or the food stalls and gardens make the city seem lived in and loved rather than as before where the city seemed more like a work of art than a home to thousands of people. \\n\r\nThe design and appearances of the characters while at first ostensibly no different on closer examination show a greater maturity and presence, particularly Alice who looks considerably older and mature, everything from the way she is drawn to her movements and especially how she speaks and acts around people seem to show a great deal of development and maturity in her character. Its a real sign of a classy series thats art can evolve in line with its characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they are by far the single most enhanced aspect of this series; Aria as a whole its said suffers from little character development, though I've argued before that is not strictly true as instead the show and its characters develop slowly and incrementally like real people do and that the show tends to focus on other things at times like the city or individual stories etc. But now there there is no room for any debate, the series delivers all that it promised made all the sweeter by the (debatable) delay. In fact it works so well I'm certain the series couldn't have worked any other way, the slow growth and change seen in our characters in the previous seasons meant than when the change comes, and boy does it come, the shock is real and almost scary, just like real change. After being so used to the characters always being in one place in time when they finally do move on it carries far more weight and pushes home the lesson about change, courage and the folly of trying to freeze the present or live in the past much more than a conventional series could have. Its not just the main characters either, everyone in the series is swept along by the current of change that soaked Neo-Venezia and this series; I must stress this is not some cheesy ending where in somehow by the end everybody has forever found their perfect place in life and are now simply trapped in a static state of perfection, theres plenty left to the imagination, but thats where it will stay since this is also where the source material leaves off, perhaps for the best since if these characters are to feel like real people then to effectively end their lives would shatter the realism.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude Aria the origination is the season that finally does it all right, standing on the shoulders of Animation and Natural it manages to breach the water line and breathe the sweet air of greatness, it shows as nonsense the age old argument that \"nothing happens\" in slice of life anime's and sets the bar for how to end a series of this type. Its sad it has to end as the world this series created is so rich and imaginative that their plenty left to work with and perhaps in the future we'll see a spin-off or some other type of story set here however I'm not holding my breath. Rarely does a series get inside your heart enough to make you care and imagine how things will be after it ends but thats the magic of Aria, it allows you to care; and care I did, if thats not enough of  a ringing endorsement in a world of soulless shows were it takes the death of every main character to elicit an audience emotion then I don't know what is...",

            "content": "\"Wonderful...\"\r\nMuch like the main protagonist, Mizunashi Akari, you will find yourself repeating this phrase as you continue discovering the wonderful world of Neo-Venezia and delving deeper into the relationships between the characters. This final season of Aria is a very heartfelt and satisfying ending to an overall unforgettable series.\r\nAs all the other reviews say, it is absolutely necessary that you watch the previous two seasons and the OVA: Aria the Animation, Aria the Natural, and Aria the OVA: Arietta. \r\nWhy? Watching Aria the Animation will familiarize you with the characters; watching Aria the Natural will familiarize you with the many beautiful and magical wonders ofNeo-Venezia; and Aria the OVA: Arietta will help you transition naturally into the final season on an emotional level.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's so \"wonderful...\" about Aria the Origination?\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, the Aria series takes on an episodic style of storytelling, so that each episode feels like its own, with its own heartwarming message. What Aria the Origination does differently than the previous two seasons is that it starts to connect all the dots together. All the seemingly random places of Neo-Venezia and all the seemingly random encounters, both social and magical, all come together to mold Mizunashi Akari into who she ultimately becomes by the end of the series. And it\u2019s not just Akari; the other main characters all go through some form of change\u2026 and how unexpectedly bittersweet some of these changes turn out to be. Every episode towards the end of this season starts to speak to you on a much deeper level and will definitely move some of you to tears (at least for me it did).\\n\\n\r\nWhat's so \"wonderful...\" about Aria in general?\\n\\n\r\n1) Neo-Venezia: The viewers are basically in the same position as Mizunashi Akari, in that both want to learn more about Neo-Venezia. The beauty of this is that the viewers get to experience Neo-Venezia vicariously through Akari, so that the viewers come to love Neo-Venezia as much as the protagonist does. If there is one important thing that this anime teaches me, it is the fact that even the most remote places can be turned into something beautiful. The protagonist\u2019s love for the city and all its hidden treasures is almost foolish, but also very endearing. \\n\\n\r\n2) Characters: Despite every character's name starting with an A (besides Woody), it is easy to distinguish all the characters. The viewers are constantly introduced to each of these characters and his or her demeanor, flaws, habits, and behaviors in several episodes, so as long as the viewers put in the time to watch the whole series, the viewers will start to connect with the characters on an emotional level. And no doubt, all the characters are relatable and lovable in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\n3) Messages: The first few episodes had me cringe a bit because of how corny the messages were. Sometimes, I even felt that they weren\u2019t delivered very well. However, some of these messages have stuck with me and have never left my mind since.\\n\\n\r\nSome off the top of my head are:\\n\r\n-Scolding may be one of the greatest gifts you can give to a loved one.\\n\r\n-Some of the things (or even people) that we take for granted may seem unnoticeable to us, but they are always supporting us secretly, in their own ways.\\n\r\n-Some people are born with natural talents, making it seemingly difficult to catch up to them. However, that gap means nothing as long as you do not lose heart and keep on persevering.\\n\r\n-Do not be afraid of making new encounters.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Soothing and delightful. The soft and pure vocals from the opening ease you into the episode as it plays in the background over the first few scenes. The ending is just as soothing, if anything a little more carefree and light. The overall soundtrack is perfect for a lazy day, a rainy day, or simply a calm day where you want to drink some coffee or tea. All in all, the soundtrack succeeds in emphasizing the ambience, the scenery, and the mood of the anime. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fluid animation, especially with boat rowing and flowing of hair (a LOT of wind blowing scenes). All the characters are beautifully designed and animated as well, staying true to the manga. The scenery depicted is breathtaking and memorable, and I recommend checking out the manga too because the artwork in the manga is just as breathtaking. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Neo-Venezia, the Aria series itself has many hidden treasures to provide for viewers; some treasures that I may not have discovered yet. I can\u2019t wait until the next time I revisit this series to discover something else.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, after reading this review, some of you may watch the series, treasure it, and discover something that I never did. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

            "content": "The third and last intalment of ARIA where even all good things come to an end - and it was done in an excellent manner!\r\nI find ARIA to be a \"love it or hate it\" series.  It's pretty obvious I loved it while on the other hand, action-mecha fans would find this the ultimate bore.\r\nStory: 9\r\nUnlike the previous seasons, The Origination starts rolling towards the climax of the series and progression starts to occur.  While it is rather predictable that apprentices tend to get promoted, the way it was done was simply magnificent.  \r\nThis is one of the very few animes whichhas actually outdone the source manga with appropriately dramatic and moving presentation of key events and lessons.\\n\\n\r\nA mark get knocked off for an early-season hiccup and pacing issues which affected my experience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt is pretty obvious that The Origination had a nice, fat budget.  The characters are drawn well and are consistent.  Alice especially is exceptionally cute.  The scenery has an amazing level of detail and where it matters, is totally accurate to the real-life counterpart - having visited Venice just because of ARIA!  A wide range of colours and shades were used and the CGI of the water was also a step-up from what was already excellent in previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe clever use of angles, panning and differing drawing styles for specific moments served to totally enhance the story and created a far greater impact than the manga.\\n\\n\r\nA mark knocked off nonetheless for the animation, where &quot;framelagging&quot; in some scenes were rather obvious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nTurn up the speakers and you'll hear the excellent background sounds of Venice.  The sounds of the market, the gondola and the water are excellently inserted.  It is this extra touch that makes me give full marks.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Choro Club is outstanding like it was in the previous seasons and the way it was used was totally spot on.  Even when it was sub-par (an attempt at Esperanto showed a glaring Japanese accent), the way it was combined with the story and art still made it excellent and I was simply blown away.\\n\\n\r\nIt took time for me to get used to the OP/ED but I find the tunes fit very well.\\n\\n\r\nWith the soundtracks being so soothing and relaxing, I ended up using it for dubious purposes, such as during exam revision!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nARIA's cast have an exceptionally good relationship with each other - and this close bonding was by no means created in a smooth manner.  Each and every main character relationships have their own interesting stories which I found to be very interesting and they support each other in their own unique ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe relative maturity of the characters are built upon the foundations of the first 2 seasons and it is great to see them gradually becoming more mature and independent, while still maintaining their own unique personalities.\\n\\n\r\nA mark knocked off for a rather bland anime-original character, which is also the cause of the hiccup in the story at the start of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nARIA is totally uplifting and positive, and this is important especially when the real world is a rather negative place.  I totally enjoyed the postiviness, the jokes and the teasings exchanged between the characters.  It was also total eye-candy because of the excellent art and the music also added greatly.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, a mark knocked off because of that one episode, one particular character which simply killed my enjoyment for a week.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nNo series is perfect over an entire season but not many come as close to perfection as ARIA the Origination.  A superbly produced work and it is indeed a bit of a pity all good things come to an end!",

            "content": "This review covers the entire Aria series from Aria the Animation to the Natural to the Arietta OVA and then finally the Origination.\r\nStory: 10/10 Aria is about three girls striving to become Prima Undine's in Neo-Venezia (formally know as Mars). Prima Undine's are basically tour guides on small two to four person boats. The series goes on to show the extreme beauty of Neo-Venezia in each episode with beautiful art and elegant music. While our three main characters Akari, Aika and Alice train to become Prima with the help of their tutors, Alicia, Athena and Akira. Every episode has many moments that leaves you witha sense of warmth and happiness.  The series is incredibly relaxing and slow so if your a fan of fast paced shows, this may not be for you. But if your a fan of Slice-of-Life's slow paced shows, you will love this series. I often compare this series to Mushi-shi because they are both diamonds in the rough. You don't find a Anime series like this one often.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 I don\u2019t rate for art because it is not a deciding factor on how I watch Anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 The soundtracks for the entire series are golden. They are filled with slow ballads, acoustic guitar melody\u2019s and great orchestral themes. I have gotten all of these soundtracks from     Baka Bt and have not regretted it. Each track is beautiful and it makes you feel like you've stepped back into the beautiful Neo-Venezia. The same goes for the OP/ED's. I actually had most of the openings from the series and I didn\u2019t even know it. My favorite out of all the OP's is probably the opening for the Natural \u201cEuphoria\u201d by Yui Makino and my favorite ending is, of course, Aria the Animation's \u201cRainbow\u201d by Round Table Feat. Nino.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 At first I thought this series would have little character development because it focused more on the beauty of the world, but boy I was wrong. The characters have amazing development, there were many times when the character struggled and grew from different experiences. It was an amazing thing to watch. For example, Akia at the beginning was obsessed with Alicia and just wanted to be like her and then later on she grew to be herself and not a shadow of Alicia. It was a lot of fun to watch the characters laugh, cry, and have fun together. \\n\\n\r\nSeason One \"Aria the Animation\": The series had a great begining, it felt like as if it was gradually showing Neo-Venezia and the mysterious power that it holds. (13 Episodes)\\n\\n\r\nSeason Two: \"Aria the Natural\" This one series came in with alot of character development and a sence of mystery and wonder. This part of the series is where my comparison to Mushi-shi comes into play. (26 episodes)\\n\\n\r\nOVA ~Arietta~: This OVA was really special. It gave greater insight into the Aria Company. I was really blown away by this OVA. Its probably the highest rated OVA on my list. (1 episode)\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 \"Aria the Origination: The final season of Aria was just beautiful. It has superb character development and wrapped up the series. It ended so beautifully that it just left me in wonder. The we're alot of parts that I got teary eyed in. Characters achived thier dreams, some characters left and passed their torch onto the next generation. It was a beautiful masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: 15/10 This series was amazing. Again, I have never seen anything quite like it. The music, characters, environment and sound were all perfect. This is a series that I will watch over and over again and never get tired of. I constantly thought while I watched this series \u201cI want to see the world through Akari's eyes\u201d. Even now I still wish that, it would be so cool if Neo-Venezia was real, I would love to go there and live the rest of my life.",

            "content": "This is the third and final of my series of reviews for the ARIA animes. My perspective on these reviews are based on how I felt after finishing the show my first time.\r\nAll good things come to an end, how sad and true this is. ARIA the ORIGINATION is the third and final season of the series adapted from Kozue Amano's ARIA manga series. And I must say, this season is just something else...its the end of the journey around Neo-Venezia and what an end this is.\r\nStory: It is impossible to understand what an amazing story the series has had unless you have finished watchingall the seasons, this season truly makes you appreciate the other seasons more. ARIA the ORIGINATION shows the conclusion of the journey for Akari and her friends in their goal to become full fledged undines. The beginning of the show retains the usual standard of storytelling and qualities that we can expect from the series. Presenting us once again with the daily lives of out undines and the events happening around them. But it is a bit past the halfway mark of this season that ARIA shifts gears and presents us with pure greatness. After being with these great characters for 39 episodes + 1 OVA ,the final set of episodes for ARIA the ORIGINATION presents us with such emotionally powerful scenes time and time again it is almost impossible not to get emotional while watching them. There isn't enough words to describe how incredible the ending for this anime was delivered. This series is just magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Despite already being very pretty to look at, this final season looks even better, not only in terms of background graphics but there is also significant improvement in the character animations as well. It also helps that this season is presented in 16:9 resolution >_> Overall this is the best looking season hands down.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Although this season is IMO the weakest of the 3 in terms of soundtracks, it is still one of the best you can hear...the many different songs mixed with the great moments this anime delivers combine perfectly to deliver very powerful scenes. However this season is prob the best one of the 3 in terms of how well the voice actors played their parts. My hat goes off to all the seiyuus for doing such an amazing job (especially Hazuki Erino, marvelous).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is without a doubt where the anime shines the most. Over the course of series we are introduced and grouped with Akari and her friends Aika and Alice as they train to become professional undines. It is hard to not grow some kind of emotional attachment to these characters after two entire seasons of watching them train and have fun together. We are shown how the characters mature and grow up in order to adapt to the inevitable changes that happens in life. It is using this emotional attachment that ORIGINATION manages to reach into our heart by showing us the end of their journeys and the beginning of new ones to come in spectacular fashion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Words cannot describe how incredible this experience was, looking back at when I first started watching season 1 and now, it still feels weird that I have finished this series. You are left with a feeling of satisfaction yet at the same time you dont want it to end. Such is the greatness that I experienced watching this anime and this is the first time I have ever given a full set of 10s for an anime without hesitation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: ARIA the ORIGINATION is without a doubt one of the few masterpieces out there. It is a beautiful anime in every sense and even if my scores make me look like some kind of fanboy I don't care because this anime and this series as a whole IS THAT GOOD! To those out there who are looking for a relaxing anime that can make you smile at the end of each episode, it can make you laugh and cry as well...look no further, this anime will be a godsend for you.",

            "content": "Aria the origination is the third season of the Aria series.  It hasn't changed much, it is pretty much the same as the previous seasons.  It is best to watch the first season Aria the Animation and the second season Aria the Natural before you start on this, because you will miss out on a lot of character development, yes thats right character development not plot because there isn't any plot just daily life of the main characters. \r\n~STORY~\r\nAria is set in a fictional city which is based off Venice, Italy.  The story follows Arika who is a Undine trainee who isaiming to become a Prima.  A Undine is someone who rows a gondola as their occupation, taking clients around the city of Neo Venezia, pretty much a tour guide that guides you on a gondola.  A Prima is a top class Undine who is their company's best Undine and are very famous.  Arika, along with her good friends Aika and Alice, are trainees under the 3 current Primas Alicia, Akira, and Athena.\\n\\n\r\n ~ART~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty much the same as the previous seasons.  The thing i like most is how they use so much color thats easy on the eyes and enjoyable to look at.  You can tell the creators put in a lot of effort to make the city of Neo Venezia come to life and immerse the viewers into it's daily events which i think they accomplished very well.  I especially enjoy how the creators use chibi-like faces to express the mood of the characters, even though it gets repetitive, i still don't get tired of it.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\\n\r\nThe music is sooooooo relaxing, most of the BGM has a happy melody.  Sometimes you won't even notice the BGM because it is so subtle and soft sounding, but it fits right into the mood and setting that makes it enjoyable and not annoying to hear.  The opening theme is a very good example of how the music sounds like throughout the series.  The ending theme is pleasant in its own way also, but i still skip it to watch the next episode &gt;_&lt;\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER~\\n\\n\r\nIn this season you will definitely notice the differences in what the episodes are about compared the previous seasons.  There are a lot more character developments going on.  It expresses the bonds the characters share with each other and shows how they are important to them.  And it finally shows more traits and personality growth with some of the characters which the previous seasons didn't show much of, for example Athena my fav! ^_^\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season as i have the previous seasons, after 2 seasons I am still watching it. So yea enjoyed it very much. \\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are tired of the shounen or drama type of anime, this kind of slice of life is will be a relaxing change.  I warn you though, if you are the type that loves plot driven animes with drama and lots of fight scenes, STEP AWAY FROM THIS ANIME.\\n",

            "content": "This is the first time I've written a review right after finishing an anime, simply because it was so wonderful, so magnificent, that it overwhelmed me with emotion. Called Aria, I'd been taking my time enjoying it, rather than burning through the episodes, which I could have done. Trust me when I say this is the first time I've given perfect tens and Aria is worth every point.\r\nAt the final minute of a perfect end to the series, I was overcome with both glee and sadness. Even now, as I think about how this series is actually over and I won't have anymore episodes towatch, it saddens me, because that's how good it was. It's inspired me to become an even better writer so that perhaps one day I can write something that will make people as sad - just because they love it that much.\\n\\n\r\nAria is about three young girls who are training to become gondoliers - gondola riders. They live in a city called Neo-Venizia, which is a future Venice. And the show is generally a slice-of-life tale of these girls growing into their own and becoming Primas, which are full-fledged gondoliers. Full of amazing music, charm, and heart-tugging little stories that could give you happy dreams the rest of your life, Aria is unique in its broad imagination and detail. The world of Neo-Venizia puts you at ease and then fills you with wonder, much like a ride on a gondola itself. \\n\\n\r\nAkari, the main character, and her senior, Alicia, run Aria Company. Every day, Akari learns more and more about this wondrous city as she and her two new friends, Aika and Alice, practice together. They meet fascinating characters and discover secret places tucked away, all while learning about themselves and the ones they look up to. And surrounding these times are breathtaking landscapes and scenes drawn by the finest of animators.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after three seasons, when the first part of Akari's story comes to a close, the author somehow turns the story full-circle in a masterful job of penmanship that ranks in the upper echelon of magnificent writing. Not only does it make your heart pound with overwhelming feeling and love, but it gives you hope for the new generation - a new story waiting on the horizon.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who loves a fantastic story that could end all ails with one cute &quot;Ehhhh?&quot; from Akari, I would recommend Aria. I guarantee you will be changed forever, even before Alicia can say, &quot;Ada ada!&quot;",

            "content": "The conclusion to the Aria series is an ever so subtle departure from the previous two, however there is a very good reason why this is the case. As many people have already stated, in order to fully appreciate Origination, one should really watch The Animation and The Natural first (and preferably in that order as well). What people don't really go into is why this should be the case with what is purely an episodic, slice-of-life series (I'll get to this in a bit though).\r\nThe story continues in much the same fashion as the first two series, dealing as it does with the dailylives of Akari, Aika and Alice and their efforts to become Prima Undines, however the biggest difference is that the characters are not only developed more in Origination, but developed well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main strengths of the Aria series as a whole is the effortless manner in which it tells its various stories, and Origination is the pinnacle of this. The plot in each episode is far more fluid than in the previous two series, and as the show progresses the story moves into a barely unnoticeable higher gear as the bittersweet climax approaches.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two things which make the story in Origination noticeably different from the first two series. The first, and most obvious difference, is the fact that Origination has a goal in mind, and unlike the previous two offerings, doesn't simply peter out towards the end but actually gains momentum. The second difference is surprisingly (and somewhat unfortunately), unrealised by many, however it is key to appreciating the franchise in its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated in my review of the second series, The Animation was simply an introduction to the characters and Neo Venezia, whilst The Natural was an introduction to the world of Aqua. This is important to know as many people misjudge the first two series and believe they have no real focus. In fact they do, and without that focus Origination would never have been as good as it is. If one keeps in mind that the whole point of The Animation is not to develop the characters, but simply to introduce them, then it makes things a little clearer as to why it was structured in such a way. The same goes for The Natural, as the focus there was to familiarise the viewer with the world of Aqua, and its wonders and oddities. The characters receive some measure of development in the second series, however this is not the main focus of the show, as it is essential for the viewer, when watching the final series, to have more than a passing familiarity with the characters and their environs.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Origination steps in. From the outset the assumption is that one is familiar with the characters, Neo Venezia, and the world of Aqua, and because of this Origination can proceed with the story proper without the need for introductions, supernatural events, exploration, etc. Everything up until that point was simply preparation, which at first may seem wasteful, but watching the first and second season is a pleasant experience so one could fairly state that the effort was justified to a degree.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Origination is much the same as the first two outings. There isn't any real change to the design of the characters, or to Neo Venezia and Aqua, although it should be pointed out that Origination has more in common with the first season in terms of art and backgrounds as it is mainly centred in Neo Venezia as well. The quality of animation remains superb, with no real noticeable flaws, whilst the level of detail in both the animation and the artwork is once again excellent.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest areas for the series as a whole is in the quality of its sound and music, and whilst the first two series were excellent in this department, Origination represents a step up. The subtlety and detail of some of the effects are truly phenomenal, and although the thematic music may be the same as the previous two series, the score actually feels fresh in Origination (more on this in a bit). The voice actors are, once more, excellent, however there is a very subtle difference with their portrayals in Origination in that the characters seem more self-assured than in either of the previous two series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are as adorable as ever, but once again there is a difference to them. The feeling of self assurance one receives from the voice actors is carried through with the actions of the characters themselves, and this is one of the ways in which they receive some of their phenomenal development. This doesn't simply apply to Akari, Aika and Alice either, but is also extended to Alicia, Akira, Athena, Akatsuki, Al, and even Grandma Akino.\\n\\n\r\nThe surprising thing about Origination's characters is that, in comparison to The Natural, they possess and air that is fresh and new. This feeling is also inherent in the score (as I mentioned earlier), in the settings, and in the voices too. There is a very simple reason for this though. Whilst it may (or may not), be true that the viewers are already familiar with the series before watching Origination, it is a certainty that everyone who has worked on it will know the characters, Neo Venezia and Aqua, pretty much inside out. This, together with the fact that Origination actually has a focus and a definite end, means that everything was already defined before the series even began. It is because of this that Origination is able to achieve its remarkable feat of plot and character development, something it could never have done had everything been told over the course of one season.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, Origination is something I would recommend to everyone, however it should be remembered that the first two series should be watched prior to this. The show is as relaxing as The Animation, whilst retaining the same adventurous quality of The Natural. The characters actually become more endearing as the show progresses, especially if one has watched seasons 1 and 2, and whilst the format may still be episodic, it doesn't suffer from the same ambiguity that affected the previous two series.\\n\\n\r\nOrigination is an excellent show that successfully retains the essence of the series whilst at the same time developing the characters and advancing the plot. Because of the definite focus of the show, things that may have seemed stale in The Natural have been given a new lease of life and, whilst this may not seem like a difficult thing to achieve, it is actually one of the hardest things to do in any medium.",

            "content": "All good things must end, as the saying goes.\r\nAll good things must end.\r\nMan, I hate that saying. I hate it for how true it is. Kozue Amano, why couldn't you keep it going? Did you run out of ideas? Was five and a half years enough? Did you already plan this out? Wait, what am I saying? Of course you planned it out. Month after month, you crafted chapter after chapter of this masterpiece.\r\nJyunichi Sato, thank you for taking this work and running with it. For three separate seasons, each one improving on the last, you dealt the manga justice. You even added a newcharacter that Kozue retconned into the story. And she was fabulous.\\n\\n\r\nI should probably stop the ranting and the gratitude-giving and get to the review. Although this is under Aria the Origination, this will be a review of all three seasons plus the OAV.\\n\\n\r\nAria is a bloody masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nYes, you heard me right. &quot;All 10's will make you untrustworthy and prejudiced, and people won't pay attention to your reviews anymore!&quot; Blah blah blah, whatever. I don't care if no one ever reads my reviews again. ARIA is that good. I savored each and every episode of the anime, along with each and every chapter of the manga. Whenever I watch ARIA, I have this stupid grin on my face. I can't help it.\\n\\n\r\nSo why is Aria that good?\\n\\n\r\nOne, the magic of the characters. You start off with Akari, the cheery protagonist, arriving on Aqua (used to be Mars) to fulfill her dream of becoming a master gondolier, an Undine. There, she meets her mentor, the perfect Alicia, who teachs Akari the ins and outs of the trade. Along the way, Akari befriends Aika, the heir to one of the biggest gondolier companies on the planet, Himeya. She also befriends Alice, the genius gondolier from Orange Planet. Aika also has a mentor, the ever-so-awesome Akira. Alice's mentor is the ever-so-clumsy Athena. Akari also meets Akatsuki, the apprentice Salamander who controls Aqua's climate, Albert, the Gnome who controls Aqua's gravity, and Woody, the Sylph who makes deliveries by aircraft. Akari also meets Akino, the mentor of Alicia, and Ai, a girl from Manhome (Earth). Yes, all of the characters have names that start with A with the exception of Woody, but there is never a time when you are confused between who's who. Character introductions and development are handled impeccably well.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, the complete lack of an overarching plot. Yep. Every episode is basically a one-shot, providing a glimpse at the utopian society of Neo-Venezia. Some episodes are character driven, while others are setting-driven. There are no antagonists, no final boss fight, and no conflicts. Therein lies the terms &quot;healing anime&quot; and &quot;slice-of-life,&quot; which both describe this show perfectly. Now, that does not mean that ARIA fails to invoke emotion. Some episodes will make you cry manly tears. Some episodes will make you laugh out loud. ARIA is a show that you can sit back and watch every night before you go to bed. It improves the quality of your sleep. I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nThree, the progression of the animation throughout seasons improves leaps and bounds. I'll admit that some scenes were full of QUALITY, but by Origination, there is none of that. Origination is even in widescreen, giving everything a more epic sense. I loved the water animation, the chibi faces, the epic gondolier rowing, everything.\\n\\n\r\nARIA has something for everyone. Lesbian tendencies? Oh yes. Epic boat rowing? Even more yes. Heartwarming just to the point of sappiness? Triple yes. And there are much, much more: a soothing soundtrack, amazing vocal insert songs, fabulous opening and endings. The sound production is just perfect. The openings are different for each episode too, allowing you to immerse yourself into each episode seamlessly.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot pinpoint a favorite episode, but I loved the 11th episode of the first season, when Akari waves to Aika and Alice from the bridge. I also loved the snowball episode, the four-leaf clover episode, and the well episode. My favorite character is Akira, by far. Her spunkiness and her awesome chibi-face won me over.\\n\\n\r\nBut alas, all good things do come to an end. As I sit and watch the final episode of Origination again, I cannot help but close my eyes and feel them tearing up. I'll miss each and every character immensely.\\n\\n\r\nGood work, Kozue Amano. Good job, Jyunichi Sato. I salute you for making me sleep better at night these last five and a half years.\\n\\n\r\nSit back and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nA.D. 2301 - The Voyage from Neo-Venezia.",

            "content": "This is my first review; and what better series to review than the glorious Aria the Origination. \r\nThis is what I've been looking for all along. This is the reason why I have been spending countless hours experiencing many different stories, encompassing so many different themes while simultaneously being sucked into an abundance of worlds. There is a saying that goes as such: \"A good life is a collection of happy moments\". This is exactly what this anime was to me. It taught me, along with many others, to appreciate life, and how incredible it truly is.\r\nThe third and final season of Aria didn't tryto impress its audience from the get-go. Instead it allowed the viewers to try and envision what the outcome might be, however obvious it was from early on in the franchise. I even found myself in the first couple of episodes of this season scratching my head, wondering why people were giving the show as much praise as it frequently gets; as the opening episodes were not as flashy as I expected them to be. I almost got the impression that I was re-watching the first season: Aria the Animation. I felt as if this season was a bit of a back-step; lowering itself in terms of storytelling from the brilliant Aria the Natural. Don't be afraid, however, if you find yourself feeling the same way after watching the first couple episodes. It is certainly not like that the whole through. I can assure you. Don't get me wrong, the first two or three episodes were still pretty good, just not as 'special' as I thought they would be. \\n\r\nOrigination focuses much more purely in being a undine in Aqua. Unlike Natural, which focuses more in the city of Neo Venezia, and all the supernatural beings which inhabit it, the final season shines its spotlight on the act of being a gondolier. We see more prospect in how our three young undines go by their day-to-day life, rowing their gondola, and their struggles and efforts to finally becoming a prima. Earlier on I mentioned that it is quite evident what will happen by the end of the series, and by that I meant that it will end with Akari, Alice, and Aika being prima undines. If this was to end otherwise, it would be unsatisfactory, and almost a dreadful 'read the manga' ending, that would ultimately be a massive spit in the face to the viewer. Heck there are even pictures of the show, which illustrate our three undines, without their signature gloves: this obviously meaning that they have become primas. Regardless, I assure you that the show ends almost perfectly, as it left a wide, almost creepy smile across my face, for the entirety of the final several episodes. Aria the origination was brilliantly directed, as we dive into the fantastical world that is Aqua, in all its glory.\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is as well truly extraordinary. There is a very correct balance between comical moments, and more heart-tugging moments, with each individual episode ending with Ai-chan's unbearably cute voice. Of course the setting is still on-point, as Neo Venezia is almost as if its an exact replica of Venice. Each building feels real, the sea and the chilling breeze when a character stares into the ocean, reaches the viewer, as I often felt chills down my spine. Thus the city is given life, just like how Akari explains almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have not once been left disappointed by the fluidity, background depth and detail, character designs and color palette, but instead I am left in awe by how brilliantly done they all are. The final season of Aria, as expected, does not disappoint. In matter of fact, it is even more spectacular. There were times that I felt as if I as watching a movie by the sheer magnificence of the show visually. One aspect of the art that really surprised my how by the use of 3D in this season. You can tell just how much effort was put into this anime! Another example of how much the animation/art quality improved in this season, was the detail of each character's faces, or more specifically their eyes. Any scene which took place on the Hope Hill (the green hill with all the wind turbines), looked almost godly. The only minor irritation I had with this aspect was that there were a few too many (albeit hilarious) chibi scenes. Although these helped tone down the show, I feel as if it would have been better without as many as there were. The reason why I included that comment in this section, is since such scenes tended to be more lackluster in animation (as one would expect). Overall, however, I am utterly pleased with this aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\n If you go ask anyone who has watched the entirety of Aria, what their favorite aspect of the show was, 9/10 times it would be the soundtrack.Why, do you ask? Well it was through this show that I found out that one could orgasm through longitudinal waves! (nerdy joke) But on a more serious note; the mixture between orchestra, piano, and violin was masterful, and each track was played at the perfect moment! If this aspect was not how it was, the ending result would be no where near as impactful as it is. This might be an obvious statement, but Aria the Origination heavily relied on its soundtrack to guide the tone of the show. And without guidance, you have a badly paced series. Something I should truly praise the show for is its seiyuu performances. Each and every seiyuu was perfect: especially Akari's voice actress: she reflected Akari's character flawlessly, as being a constantly happy and optimistic girl; a role which I believe to be exceedingly difficult to master. The ending song was one of the greatest things I have ever experienced: both visually, and sound-wise. It fat the tone of the show quintessentially! The opening was as well great, although not as memorable.There's not much I can say to bash this section, as the show did almost everything right, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nA problem that I tend to have with shows that have a very limited cast, is that there is not enough variety through their emotions, in order to truly satisfy my needs as a viewer. However, Aria is a show that turns this speculation upside down. Each and every character is fully developed, three-dimensional, and human. They are realistic, and although they are happy most of the times, there is more behind that smile than one would think. Akari Mizunashi is a great example of this. She is described as a quote on quote \"Eternal optimist\" or \"Miss expect of happiness\" and there is a valid reason for this. It is rare to see this character feeling down or depressed. At first I found this trope pretty unrealistic, but especially with Origination I was proven very wrong. She expresses so much emotion just by her intelligent analogies and 'speeches' about how important life is to those who respect their lives. She is very important to the story, as her character makes the entire city feel happy and content. She helps her friends when they feel down, and she even tries her utmost when she herself feels as if she cannot mirror her title. Alicia Florence is another fantastic character: she does not go about explaining her reasoning like any other human. Instead, she will go about her explanation in a very peculiar way. She might start rolling a snowball out of nowhere just to prove a point! I realise that this sounds silly, but I was utterly amused by how accurate those actions were to help explain her points. She, like Akari, is more often than not, always wearing a smile. This helps Akari keep her own smile, so that she could be able to illustrate her talent as an undine. \\n\r\nAlice Carroll is my personal favorite character ( plus my new waifu but that's besides the point). The reason why this is so, is since she is probably the most logical, intelligent, and talented undine out of all the cast, at such a young age. She is almost inspiring as a character: not only to those in the anime, but to the viewer him/herself. I particularly love how she has an O.C.D, as she has to, for example, kick a stone all the way home one day, or another she will have to walk backwards, or walk only in shadows. This makes her character more realistic, as it demonstrates her more childish side, since shes only 14. *Small Spoiler* She also has an impeccable singing voice which came to my surprise.\\n\r\nThe rest if the cast, which I could talk about for eternities, is all fully fledged out, and as i mentioned before, realistic. The only issue I had is that I wanted a bit more backstory for other characters, but that's only a small problem, which wouldn't really affect the show too much. An honorable mention is Grandma, who had a brilliant backstory, and was a fantastic addition to the cast, even though it was seldom that she appeared in the show. But I digress, since the characters were all pretty much perfect; even the secondary characters such as the Patissiere and Akatsuki.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there is any other slice of life series that could provide as much enjoyment as this one did. Almost every single episode left me teary-eyed. Episode 9 was one of the greatest episodes I have seen in a LONG time. It was surprising, beautiful and incredibly well animated. That is not to say that it was miles ahead of any other episode, as they were all important to the story, which ultimately lead to the magnificent and conclusive ending, which could not have satisfied me more than it did. All I can say is Bravo! What an accomplishment this show truly was.\\n\\n\r\n If only this series gained more mainstream recognition. It truly, truly deserves a wider audience,  even though it is not, of course, perfect. But then again, no show ever is. Sayonara Akari, Alice, Alicia, Aika, Athena, Akira, and Aria. It was a fantastic run.

            "content": "All things eventually have to come to an end, especially with series that have left a mark on many people. One series that has cemented itself as the king of accomplishing this for many is the Aria series. What many consider to be the series\u2019s magnum opus, Aria the Origination is the last chapter in the anime adaptation of the beloved manga. As you might figure out, it is just about as glamoured with gorgeous music, cheerful characters, and melodramatic optimism as one can handle. Despite all of the beautiful aspects of this show, and the series as a whole, there\u2019s still that one questionthat has always bugged me with each season: Why am I not smiling?\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start voicing my criticism on these issues, I\u2019d like to explain the positive aspects of Origination that leave it off from being just a \"decent\" show and try to describe it without trying to compare it to previous seasons. To put it into perspective, Origination is supposed to be the accumulation of everything that the series was building up to. As we see the characters grow from their past experiences, it is inevitable that they want to make it into a big emotional climax to end it all. To which I can concur it is a satisfying conclusion to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSince Origination is focused on the character development, this is where Origination truly shines that tries to develop them little by little. Because we have followed three of these girls and their elder undines for so long, their complex relationships have been built up for the inevitable climax that shows them growing into leaving their profession as full-time undines. Its slow pacing is why it works as lovely character development because there are no awkward transitions between episodes that feel problematic to the characters growth.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, you can\u2019t talk about a season of Aria without ever mentioning its musical composition. It is no secret that the series is known for its beautiful and memorable score and Origination does not fail on this aspect. Although I would consider this to be the weakest of the series, there is no reason to suggest that the instrumentation of the songs in Origination still keeps the spirit of the series going. The music involves a lot of Celtic guitar instrumentation that feels fitting with the setting and atmosphere. Vocals are exceptionally graceful and give an excellent introduction to the show as the opening guides us into a new kind of adventure with each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series progressed, the animation and art got better and better as their budget had increased by the time they started with Animation. Origination\u2019s celebrated blend of colors and misty backdrops gives the show a dreamy atmosphere with transparent white overtones of the environments and characters. Character designs are neatly colored with nice clean looks to their facial features and their expressions, especially when they are in chibi form whenever a comedic moment happens. It creates a decent flow of showing a new dimension to the show by not just being a somber slice of life, but also a comedy with zany edges to it. They are not what you would call hilarious or hysterical by any means, but they are funny tidbits that have a nice spark of humor to Origination.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what many might conceive as one of the best facets of Aria is the atmosphere. It is often praised for being very relaxing and brings feelings happy emotions to the audience from the artistic aspects to the character interactions that follow it. It cannot be denied that the features that inhabit it do not exist in some form, but for all intents and purposes, for me, that sort of ethereal atmosphere only does very little to make the series impacting. To put my criticisms into perspective, an atmosphere that wants to make the audience feel any emotion needs to have some semblance of a structure that makes it feel natural and effective. With the case of Aria, it feels as though it just wants to be a relaxing atmospheric show just for the sake of being one and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nAnother troubling aspect of the atmosphere that doesn\u2019t make for a worthwhile experience is the fact that it is always the same impending tone. It is true that there are some moments where we are given a slightly different shift in tone to a more somber, depressing one, but those are very few and far in-between. Because of this, the whole atmosphere feels extremely fake and alienating for someone like me who does not feel the need to take the atmosphere for granted. The atmosphere is entirely stagnant and makes Origination a rather dense slice of life show that seems to think that life is always this happy-go-lucky experience with halfhearted expectations of things getting better.\\n\\n\r\nIn conjunction with the atmosphere, the characters that inhabit Aria are not necessarily the most magnificent cast of characters that you might\u2019ve been told so. Now like I\u2019ve said before, all of their developments are great and make them standout. You can\u2019t make bland characters any better by just making them developed to excuse all the yawning. Besides their development, what other characteristics do they have that make them any more significant? Is it the fact that they continuously throw in monotonous catchphrases to try to make them not dull? The fact that they all have similar optimistic outlooks that hardly make them any more distinct from any other character? Or that they constantly throw in pointless poetic dialogue to somehow make them seem more insightful than what they are?\\n\\n\r\nI can appreciate some of the quirkiness that is thrown out here and there from the characters, but that is not enough to think of any of them as inspired characters. Once in a while, I can chuckle at the catchphrases, but it is quickly forgotten due to the uninspired way they implement it into the show. There are even some character side stories that don\u2019t go anywhere that can be construed as the show cutting some things off of the manga, like the awkwardly written romance between Aika and Albert. What it all comes down to is that none of the characters have anything to offer in terms of creativity or intrigue other than their development, which is two completely different things in character writing.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the negatives, I pointed out in this point of the series, Origination is not something that I would consider terrible or bad for that matter. It is decent for what it is, which I would say is a positive overall evaluation for the series as a whole. Origination is not the remarkable life-changing show that many like to make it up to be in my opinion, but it is not the polar opposite to that effect. There are plenty of qualities that can be looked upon with fresh eyes. All that is left to do is to pinpoint what stands out for them as an experience worth going through.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-\\n",

            "content": "Before watching Aria the Origination, you have to have watched the prequels - The Animation, The Natural and The OVA: Arietta - otherwise you will be doing yourself - but more importantly this series - a great disservice. Because Origination, being the grand finale of the franchise, demands that you as a viewer has formed bonds to the setting and characters of the Aria universe; if you haven't, you will automatically disarm the bomb of emotion that is this third and last season of Aria.\r\nAnd that would be so incredibly sad.\r\nOnce again we return to Aqua, the planet which prior to human terraforming went bythe name of Mars. Upon the surface of this ocean-clad planet, we find the city of Neo-Venezia, an almost perfect replica of the presently (Aria takes place in the 24th century) submerged Venice on Earth. In this old, yet new, city, the gondoliers are without exeptions female, are called Undines and work for one out of three companies: Aria, Himeya or Orange Planet. The Aria series revolve around the daily lives of the Undines Akari, Aika and Alice -- them practicing rowing the gondola, the people they meet, the places they visit, but most importanly their hopes and dreams, of which the wish to become a Prima Undine, the very elite amongst the Undine, is the ultimate goal.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot moved along at a leisurely pace during the first two seasons. They were more or less episodic series, and while the seasons changed from spring to winter and from winter to spring, the characters didn't develop that much and you couldn't really feel that the main story was actually moving forward. Don't get me wrong now -- I really liked both the Animation and the Natural -- but when juxtapositioned with the Origination, the lack of character development becomes quite evident.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily enough, the things the previous seasons lacked are abundant and overflowing in the Origination.\\n\\n\r\nThe absolutely most impressive thing story-wise is that nothing unpredictable happens. Despite this - or maybe thanks to this - the directors have polished the unfolding events to perfection. While the first few episodes aren't that exceptional (hence the 9 to the story), what comes afterwards makes up for that thousandfold. From episode 5 onwards, this is the single most emotional anime - or any production, for that matter - I've ever watched. I was almost constantly crying until I found it astounding that my tear glands could even produce any more liquid.\\n\\n\r\nYes, for almost three hours.\\n\\n\r\nApart from seeing the three main characters finally making their dreams come true, we also get to witness the birth of Aria company, a beautiful story in its own right. As if that wasn't enough, we are also provided with tear-jerking flashbacks to the times when the Undine trio first met their senpais/seniors. The \"Origination\" in the title is not there just for show.\\n\\n\r\nHAL Film Maker - and of course the manga's original creator - deserve enormous amounts of credit for making the setting trustworthy. I have yet to visit Venice myself (will change this fact next year), but judging from the footage I've seen, they've really paid attention to detail when creating Neo-Venezia -- buildings, islands, shops and traditions from Earth's Venice are all present, something that gives Aria its own, unique atmosphere. The use of colours is also skillfully handled, making the city and it's inhabitants - and of course the water - feel full of life. I was particularily impressed by how the animators made all the strong emotions show on the characters' faces so realistically... with such purity. Aria the Origination might not be an example of cutting-edge animation technology, but on the other hand -- it proves that an anime doesn't have to boast with tons of flashy effects to excel in this department. And it does look considerably better than it's predecessors.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, we have the mandatory slow, comforting opening song that may not be as great as the previous ones, but it's definitely anything but bad. The ending theme, Kin no Nami Sen no Nami, is a much more powerful ballad that fits perfectly with the ebullient emotions the characters - and most likely the viewer - go through during the episodes. Background music was not memorable for me (it almost never is), but I have a hard time imagining that it was anything but stellar during the crucial scenes, considering the impact they left on me. Sound effects were also deftly handled -- the gentle splash of an oar cutting through the water, the cries of the seagulls, the bustling sounds of a crowded marketplace. It was all great. Voice acting? Phenomenal. You can really feel that the voice actresses have captured the essence of their characters perfectly after sticking with them for 50+ episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, Aria's greatest strength has always been it's wonderful cast of characters and the interactions between them. We have the happy-go-lucky Akari, around whom miracles always seem to occur. She loves Aqua more than anyone else and always describes the beauty of nature and life with exquisite words. Words which are more often than not interrupted with the more down-to-earth Aika's trademark line, \"Embarrassing remarks are NOT allowed!\", which in turn is countered by a \"You're very nosy.\" from the youngest of the three, Alice. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the comedy moments admittedly are highly repetitive, I actually enjoyed them as well, knowing that I would miss them after finishing the series. Other than that, character interactions are simply beautiful. Over the course of the Aria series, the girls' friendship deepens considerably with all the happy and sad moments they go through together. They gradually realize that becoming a Prima Undine also means that their next to worryless days spent practicing together will come to and end -- that a full schedule means little time to spend with each other. Akari also has to come to terms with the fact that she alone will be shouldering the fate of the two-man Aria company, together with her future apprentice, and thereby say goodbye to the happy years spent with her beloved senior Alicia.\\n\\n\r\nBut life goes on and having less time to spend with the people you hold dear only makes you treasure and enjoy these precious moments even more.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on writing forever, but I have to stop sometime, right?\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination is undoubtedly the single most important anime I've ever watched. It made me cry rivers while smiling and actually provided me with a new outlook on life, neither of which any other man-made production ever has succeeded in doing. \\n\\n\r\nI tried my best, but it was fruitless; words aren't enough for me to describe how much I love this incredible series. You just have to watch it yourself (unless you're a heartless bastard, of course).\\n\\n\r\nMy only 10 I've ever given without hesitating will be awarded Aria the Origination.",

            "content": "The last voyage to Neo-Venezia? \r\nFor those who have followed Aria from the beginning, be it with the &ldquo;Aria&rdquo; manga or the anime series &ldquo;Aria The Animation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aria The Natural&rdquo;, this third season &ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo; will no doubt be the greatest of all. \r\nIf you haven't watched either &ldquo;Aria The Animation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aria The Natural&rdquo; you might still enjoy &ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo; but you will not be able to enjoy all the depths and events this season has to offer without knowing the character's pasts.\r\nAlthough the primary settings seems to be science fiction due to it's setting in the distant future on terraformedMars (now named &ldquo;Aqua&rdquo; as the terraforming project covered the planet's surface with water) it actually is a slice-of-life series with an uncanny knack to make you see simple things as miraculous events full of joy and hope. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire series focuses more on the daily lives of Akari and her friends and does not really contain a specific plot, save for their goal to become prima undines, professional gondoliers that guide tourists through Neo-Venezia, a recreation of earth's Venice. Although this season does see that plot come to a conclusion in which all the characters evolve, like flowers blooming under the soothing springtime sun. Everything comes full circle and while one may wipe away a tear at the end, the series immediately makes you smile again at the beginning of the new voyage it sets off on.\\n\\n\r\n&ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo; starts off with episodes much as the previous &ldquo;Aria&rdquo; seasons, more common daily events in which Akari, Aika and Alice find joy or unexpected small miracles, and one can be amazed at how Kozue Amano and the staff are able to bring such seemingly mundane events in such a way that they become heart-warming tales. If you had a bad day, an episode of Aria is guaranteed to cheer you up and give you renewed hope. \\n\\n\r\nThe latter half of the season sees all characters achieve their goals and even though their lives forever change the undines Akari, Aika, Alice, Alicia, Akira and Athena will forever treasure their time spent together, remaining close friends with a past they won't forget.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough to the fans it may be sad to see Aria go, the series closes off with a wonderful sentiment, that even though the days of happiness as you knew them are now gone and that voyage is over, you mustn't be sad as another voyage filled with miraculous days is about to begin. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation in &ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo; was terrific, in most episodes the animation was up to par with that of  the OVA, &ldquo;Aria the OVA ~Arietta~&rdquo;  and the character drawing style leaned closer to that of the OVA instead of the more rounded off shapes from &ldquo;Aria The Natural&rdquo;. It did look like the gondolas were drawn significantly bigger than in previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAll the undines looked divine, a lot of attention off course went into making the main characters look superb, and their hilarious chibi modes were present each episode. The backgrounds of Neo-Venezia are rendered as such that you're immediately drawn into their world, the rich palette of bright blue waterways, warm orange sunsets, make you feel as if you're on Aqua.\\n\\n\r\nChoro Club and Senoo again deliver a great soundtrack, with music that fits the scenery of Aqua, featuring soft piano melodies and calm ballads. A prime example of how a soundtrack can perfectly  match a series and accentuate the emotions presented on-screen.  The OP and ED songs too make a wonderful fit, the OP &ldquo;Spirale&rdquo; always accompanied by different scenes of Neo-Venezia.     \\n\\n\r\nI often experience that people either fall completely in love with &ldquo;Aria&rdquo; or totally do not appreciate the series. If you like the slice-of-life genre or want to see a unique series that soothes the soul, then I definitely recommend &ldquo;Aria The Origination&rdquo;.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe &ldquo;Aria&rdquo; would be: 'a breath of fresh air'.",

            "content": "*This is my first review\r\n*I will be writing this review on all 3 parts of Aria and will be summarized individually, the score overall is on the series in its entirety\r\nThis series was number of firsts for me, first true slice of life I have watched, first anime in which the focus was on a female protagonist through its entirety while also including introspective reflection, and the first piece of media that I truly appreciated for its episodic nature.\r\nBefore watching I had high expectations of what I thought Aria was going to be brought on by the high rating, glowing recommendations, and the relative obscurityof such a highly acclaimed series. All of these expectations were more than met, but that is not to say Aria is without its flaws. Aria in its entirely really is a masterpiece and its flaws may not be objectively true and dependent on the viewer, it is important to note this both while watching Aria and while reading this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation - To be expected, this season served to introduce you both to the endearing characters and the setting of Neo-Venezia as well as Aqua. This part happens to contain two of my favorite episodes of the Aria series as well as two of my least favorite(both of these for reasons similar to filler and boredom). Most of my criticism is left on the atmosphere that Aria the Animation seemingly fails to develop, the atmosphere feels almost sterile or stagnant as there seems to be little that happens out of the ordinary and very little mystery about the environment. The world itself seems a tad small and contained which ultimately brings about a \"boring\" feel to the first iteration.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also weaker than the next, which is to be expected as it is the most outdated but it is still brilliantly animated.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before the story is mostly introductory and little is revealed about what makes Aria so great until the latter half and maybe even until Aria the Natural. Nevertheless the first taste of things to come is experienced through the endearing and well-established characters going about their day to day life. As well the always entertainingly beautiful and relaxing storyline of Aria is prevalent but maybe not as dynamic or evident as in later iterations.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is really top notch, this may be the one area that might not have been improved on by later adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nReally what Aria the Animation fails to do is being as strong as its successors, which doesn't really take away from the experience on its own especially since the series is an episodic one. At the very least it serves as important step into understanding and enjoying Aria as a whole.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAria the Natural - The true embodiment of Aria's spirit in my opinion, all the things that make the series great are found here. The mysteries and fantasy of Neo-Venezia and Aqua being discovered and represented beautifully in all aspects is truly a pleasing experience to behold. I would also like to note that the slice of life component is most dutifully found here. This is by far the more relaxing of the three, and may I stress that I say relaxing not boring, the story here is surprisingly engaging even though that is something I have personally struggled with when watching episodic series is my inability to become invested episode to episode, I had no trouble doing so with Aria the Natural. This due in part to the stagnancy that I had mentioned earlier being shattered by the introduction of menace or negativity in a way that does not contradict the flow and feeling of the series overall. Because of this you come to appreciate the magnificent nature of each episode even more.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have previously mentioned, Aria the Natural improves(maybe even dramatically so)on everything that Aria the Animation brought to the table as well as representing the soul of the Aria series almost poetically.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination - While Aria the Natural represents the soul of Aria, Aria the Origination undoubtedly represents the heart. \"No embarassing remarks allowed!\" I know but let me explain, I would go so far as to say that Aria the Origination changes everything about the Aria series while also preserving it. That may be confusing but really it maintains everything that makes Aria great while introducing drama and conflict while progressing less episodically and more as a series. Also the emphasis is placed less on the setting of Neo-Venezia and more so on the characters and their development, this is done in a surprisingly superb fashion by introducing an entirely new aspect to Aria while still tailoring to its original greatness.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their stories are elegantly weaved together while staying respective to their individual development, development so surprisingly good that you would almost wonder when the characters changed so much. This thought however will probably never cross your mind since this is done so in a matter that is natural and stays true to characters you were originally introduced to. \\n\\n\r\nThe drama that comes with the conclusion of the series is magnificent and touching. By the end you will realize all the wonderful lessons you were inadvertently being taught throughout the series and this makes it that much more meaningful and timeless. Aria is truly an experience in which you will enjoy, be enlightened, and have your the boundaries of your imagination stretch, ideas that all pieces of media striving to become a masterpiece should fulfill.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is brilliant, there are some episodes that continue the flow, but may fail to truly captivate the viewer, nearly episode is at the very least entertaining\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much that can be said about the art, it is incredible and stunning and an easy selling point for the anime\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe OST suits the setting perfectly, and in Aria the Origination it suited the more touching and dramatic moments in their feelings of wonder, change, and simplicity\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nI would be hard pressed to choose a character in which I didn't like, as well as the character that I liked most. All of the characters are endearing and charming, and play their role radiantly in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe different elements of Aria, are all enjoyable, but more specifically the enjoyment lies in the slice of life component as it gives you the feeling of beauty and relaxation\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n",

            "content": "The third season of Aria, Aria the Origination is a stunning and satisfying conclusion to the Aria story. With 2 seasons and a few OVAs behind it, I would say Aria the Origination has perfected the slice of life formula, hence its very well deserved high scores. I did analyze this alot, but at the end concluded that a review of this series would only be effective if it came from the heart :)\r\nAs stated by pretty much every reviewer, to fully appreiate the masterpiece that is Aria The Origination you should first watch Aria the Animation, Aria the Natural and the other OVAs/Picture Dramas.When you start with Aria the Origination, you're already familiar with boh Neo-Venezia, its citizes, the cats and Akari and her circle of friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling is high art. It always starts with Akari writing to her friend, Ai-Chan about the weather, and what is happening today. It's like watching some old friends go about their lives. It feels good and familiar, then there's the realization/lesson/moral of that episode, and a conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nEverything is so well done that although I swore I wouldn't, somehow, sometime during each episode my emotions would get the better of me and then tears would fall from my eyes. Something would set it off, a line of dialogue, the scenery, the music with meaningful lyrics. Most of the time it's not even tears of sadness, but tears of gladness, or joy, or I'm crying because something is so beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nOK, I cried every single episode, with major crying on the last episode when I realized there would be no more Aria after this. Still, even though I want this wonderful anime to continue forever,  I am glad it ended perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone should watch Aria. At the least it's an entertaining slice of life anime. But it has a much deeper meaning and is able to speak directly to the watcher's heart an mind if the watcher is receptive. \\n\\n\r\nSo please, please, watch this wonderful anime! Watch it slowly, savor it, think and reflect on the messages embedded in the wonderful story. Aria has changed me. What I've learned:-\\n\\n\r\n* Stop and smell the roses\\n\r\n* You can find beauty in everyday things - I realized I never looked before but one stretch of woodland road on the way to work is spectacular when the sunlight is streaming through the leaves.\\n\r\n* Do not fall into despair! Be optimistic, look on the bright side, things will get better\\n\r\n* You have some control over your happiness\\n\r\n* Ask for help, but be willing to teach others. I wish I had a teacher like Alicia.\\n\r\n* You can do more than you think you can but you need to try AND believe in yourself\\n\r\n* It's the little things in life that matter\\n\r\n* Think of what is truly important to you. \\n\r\n* I had really good friends, I should have appreciated my time with them more\\n\r\n* Things come up, Life/people may change/leave. What's important is to cherish what you currently have and live in the now. In the end memories are all you keep.\\n\\n\r\nI will be re-watching the entire series whenever I feel down. But in the future I have resolved to stop just working, doing household chores and worrying about the future. Instead I'm going to slow down, tell my family I love and appreciate them being with me and spend more time making happy memories with them.",

            "content": "Aria is a calm, cheerful series that seeks to find simple meaning in ordinary things. However, what meaning is found is usually of a trite nature, such as the love of one\u2019s art being the most important thing in said art. Not only are such messages common and forgettable, but they even occasionally range close to the absurd. Several of the episodes don\u2019t even have applicable morals, and these merely depict the characters enjoying their everyday lives and appreciating simple pleasures. The series seems more preoccupied with wondering at the workings of a nonexistent city than anything else.\r\nWhat meaning is meant to be derived fromthese ventures is almost continuously explained and narrated by someone speaking in a choked up manner unworthy of the event at hand, drawing connections between ordinary happenings and grander themes that are so flimsy, the series would have been better served to demonstrate such a connection in silence than to exposit one with so little a foundation. At some point, if one cheesy and supposedly meaningful line is said after another, it begins to lose any meaning it might have had. What may have been effective in small doses is smothering in excess. In many episodes of Aria, an already longwinded piece of dialogue will seem to have exhausted itself, the accompanying music is petering to a halt, and a scene is drawing to a close, yet the speaker continues on until it becomes tempting to escape the laborious redundancy with the aid of the skip button.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the (incredibly trivial) dilemma and resolve of each episode usually varies, it\u2019s almost as if you could play all the episodes of Aria at once with little discord between them, so similar are they in tone and structure. The same pieces of music are played in almost every episode in similar places, and the events tend to be limited to the characters rowing about on gondolas and wondering at Neo-Venezia, eating homey meals and euphorically proclaiming their tastiness through mouthfuls, and quietly awaking in the morning or going to sleep at night. These scenes are punctuated by the annoying, wordless exclamations of a cat sidekick, who is doubtless intended to be cute but only serves as a possible cause for the viewer to get some exercise reaching to turn the volume down.\\n\\n\r\nWorse than this, the series far too quickly and awkwardly tries to establish a classic comic routine in which the main characters say a series of lines to each other in quick succession. It\u2019s not particularly comical to begin with, but as it is repeated incessantly throughout each episode, it becomes very irksome. In addition, Alicia has but one monotonous exclamation throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThe progression of the characters and relationships, such as it is, is also rather repetitive. There is very little difference in development between one episode in which two characters try to overcome a breach in their relationship and the next in which a similar issue with the same characters is addressed. It\u2019s almost as if these are the go-to episodes as an interlude between the next set of five or so episodes dealing with guest characters and individual themes. Whatever is learned in the previous episode of this nature seems to have been forgotten in the next. This is mainly relevant in the case of Alice, who never ceases to take her mentor, Athena, for granted, and Athena herself, who is even more childish than her student and can\u2019t seem to overcome her own insecurities enough to be open about her feelings with a child.\\n\\n\r\nVery few of the characters ever transcend their initial first impressions. There is nothing more to Alicia\u2019s character than an innate sweetness, and any change she seems to have undergone as a result of her pupil is never demonstrated in any actual happenings or actions throughout the series, but is rather expressed in some gushy and vague dialogue near the end along with a final development that has hitherto never been foreshadowed or referenced and seems to have been invented simply to give the series some kind of emotional punch so that the ending at least wouldn\u2019t be as bland as the rest of the series. Similarly, there is nothing more to Akari\u2019s character than her ability to find wonder in ordinary things, Alice is simply quiet and socially inept, and Akira is strict with her students but only out of kindness. Aika does undergo a bit more development as she struggles with her feelings of insignificance among friends who are more naturally skilled than she, and as she grows to appreciate her mentor\u2019s harsh attitude. Finally, minor characters have even less characterization than the main ones, appearing only long enough to fulfill a brief role now and then, though some do manage to bring a bit of life to the series with some humorous or touching moments.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is broken into three seasons, which most consider to grow progressively better. However, it is the first of these, Aria the Animation, that is the most effective in creating a sweet, quiet atmosphere and the themes that exist are a little bit closer to home. It does not try to seem grander than it is, but moves at a pace just slow enough to be relaxing and just quick enough to sidestep tediousness, choosing simpler analogies and slightly less longwinded explanations than the rest of the series. At thirteen episodes, it has not accomplished anything special in particular, but it has its touching moments.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Natural is double in length, and rather than exploring more content than Animation, its preachy speeches and moments of stillness are maddeningly twice as long as that of Animation. That said, Natural incorporates more fantasy elements, such as several encounters with the spiritual world of cats, and this manages to give a bit of life to the show, inappropriate though it seems in a series that has thus far mostly steered clear of something so bizarrely fantastical. The erratic placement of such episodes further accentuates the incongruity, and overall Natural has a very disjointed feel.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination returns to the more ordinary once again, but it has lost the freshness of Animation and now muddles about in sporadic drama, attempting to emulate character development with little to no buildup. Aria the Animation started in the middle of Akari\u2019s apprenticeship, and the series as a whole chose to focus on individual encounters rather than her continued effort to become an undine. It has no clear direction, which might be expected of such an episodic series, and so its attempt to deliver some sort of grand finale fails miserably, as with little to no plot there are no ends to be wrapped up and the conclusion has little to do with the start.",

            "content": "[DISCLAIMER] As I want to get all my points across, as well as bring this show the justice it deserves, the following review is a lengthily-detailed breakdown of every factor ranging from the story to the overall experience. You may look for other reviews to find a more concise criticism of the show.\r\nIntroduction\r\nWhen we usually talk about things we truly love, it becomes hard to explain why. Most people would not understand the appeal one would get from something\u2014this is especially hard when trying to relay why your favorite book is your favorite book, or why your favorite film is your favorite film.\r\nIn cases, theoften reasons for this are because one, we might sound too forceful and biased, and two, we feel that our recommendations are not doing our experiences with the said medium any justice. As such, it becomes difficult for a person to talk about his favorite without trying to sound illogical. This is hard for someone looking for a more grounded response.\\n\\n\r\nThis review may contain any form of bias, but I will try my best to address the criticisms one may find with this show, and offer my own insights with regards to it, and why it may be irrelevant to my own judgment. Ladies and gentlemen, I offer you a heartfelt review of my favorite anime, Aria the Origination.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever someone hears the name \"Aria\" thrown around in the anime community, it is often referred to by many as the \"healing anime\". Along with the likes of Mushi-shi and Kino's Journey, it is a type of show one would usually mention as an atmospheric series\u2014to say, a show that relies on its execution of audiovisual stimulations to produce an effect of serenity and immersion into the world it's trying to present. It may rely more on enveloping the viewers with its artistic presentation rather than plot progression.\\n\\n\r\nTrue enough to what people claim it is, Aria is a franchise that needs some patience getting into, which can lead to either one of two things: 1) You feel like you belong with the show, or you become attached to it, or 2) You get bored. Atmospheric anime, after all, take its 20-minute episode runtime to dive in with intentionally slow pacing, allowing the audience to let its philosophy or environment sink in. Of course, this would not pose true for others, who may have a different preference for how things should be presented.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, I can still say with courage that everyone should still watch Aria. Whatever one person may gain out of it, the series still provides lot of ground for one to get immersed or be appreciative of, whether it may be the story, its characters, its world, or its music.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\n\"Lots of things change with the flow of time.\"\\n\\n\r\nWith 13 episodes, Aria the Origination is the third and final season to the Aria franchise. Three aspiring girls\u2014Akari Mizunashi, Aika Granzchesta, and Alice Carroll strive forward to reach their dreams of being Prima Undines, the highest-ranking tour guides in the gondola services of Neo-Venezia, an exact replica of Earth's Venice situated in the planet of Aqua, or Mars as it was once called.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first episodes of the series are episodic and are self-contained tales\u2014again, attributing to its slow and atmospheric nature, Origination retains the mood and flow of its predecessors but handles it with rising intensity with each succeeding episodes. How Animation, the first season, and Natural, the second, were trying to attain that execution, often resulting in an assortment of hit-and-miss episodes, Origination does not. It finally finds its footing and rids of its usually subtle approach to a more well-handled presentation.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it does take a considerably inferior beginning, in which the first three episodes can fit in any prior season. Although, after those three episodes, Origination brings new situations and scenarios that provide a refreshing perspective both on the world and its characters. Certain characters get the time to interact with one another in ways unexpected, and it connotes how the cast has developed with time in their own little manners through other characters. It pays a large amount of thankfulness to its previous seasons, and significantly builds on what it began. What follows is a majestic conclusion that makes the story go hand-in-hand with the resolution of the Undines' individual stories.\\n\\n\r\nHow Origination works in contrast to the first two seasons is the way it is generally built out. From the beginning up until the end, it reveals a planned direction it's going to take, and as such intertwines these individual tales as essential to the show's overall picture. A major theme that can be recognized from the series is the concept of change\u2014and while it is natural that a story must eventually end, Origination takes the viewers into the eyes of its characters to emphasize how significant this impending change is. Gone will be the days that we see the girls bonding through practice, and the same also poses true for the Undines as they all step forward to face a new tomorrow. This is nothing short of compelling and remarkable, as the use of Aria's episodic strengths into a sequential structure amplifies its impact.\\n\\n\r\n\"But there are things that never change.\"\\n\\n\r\nAlong with its fresh take on Neo-Venezia, the show prepares to wrap up its story by presenting the final steps the beloved Undines need to face, both in the physical and the emotional sense, as well as expanding and solidifying the relationships they have with their mentors. Every supporting character also gets their fair share of screen time, with great stories surrounding Akatsuki and Al, along with reappearances of characters such as the mailman and Caffe Florian's owner.\\n\\n\r\nAika reveals a much more realistic side of her, portraying her doubts and fears as the trio's most work-oriented person. While noticeably her focus is relegated to a background character for most of the show, the episodes that do focus on her make up for its well-written setup. Like how Akari affects the people around her, Aika gets her development through her impact with other characters, most especially with Akira. Natural had already done its piece in fleshing out Aika, which may have reduced the necessity to explore her character even further. This series simply leads her into an epilogue as the heir to Himeya.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alice's large involvement this time around is monumental not only for the people around her but also for her maturity. Some of the best moments in Origination arguably belong to her, and it surmounts to a satisfying resolution with her initially antisocial demeanor. Bits revolving around Athena's character also show how the two are actually similar, and builds up to a very emotional climax that cements their relationship and solidifies Alice's overall development.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many things to be said about Akari's character, but the most subtle yet significant revelation about her is how she actually stands out as an Undine. Aria has always focused on Akari's adventures of the rustic and mystic Neo-Venezia, and thus veered away from depicting her skills as a gondolier. Origination brings her efforts into light, and proves how she is ready to take on the reins of being a Prima.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to point out about her is the further emphasis of her relationship with Alicia. As the final episode of Natural and the succeeding OVA Arietta sows the seeds through moments where they bond together, it is in Origination where this dynamic between them really blooms\u2014portraying through its scenes how both are influential to one another. Through this, Alicia unravels as a more humane character, as opposed to how the trio perceives her as an unreachable being of perfection.\\n\\n\r\nWith the whole theme of Origination revolving around change, Akari, as the audiences' eyes through Aqua, becomes the most affected person within the environment around her. Cheerful and always upbeat, her reaction to these life-changing events pose an internal conflict within her. While she always sees change within the world of Aqua, she has never had the experience to encounter it firsthand\u2014and the way she responds to it shows her strength, and a huge leap for her character to welcome the future that awaits her. In a sense, Origination serves as a journey to hone her as an Undine, one that truly symbolizes the loving and caring welcome of Aqua.\\n\\n\r\n\"Things that are precious because they change, and things that are precious because they don't change...both are precious.\\n\\n\r\n\"Don't you feel the same?\"\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nOrigination starts off with another beautiful and calming piece through Yui Makino's \"Spirale,\" setting the tone of this final chapter to the world of Aria. Where Aria the Animation's OP immerses you into the world and Aria the Natural encouraging you to join in its rustic beauty, Aria the Origination's opening song reaches out to you in a nostalgic way. Containing this balance of serene and upbeat elements, it plays in an oxymoronic manner of cheerful and melancholic, much like a prelude to a happy farewell. The ending song, \"Kin no Nami Sen no Nami\" by Akino Arai seems to go along with this theme as well, although with a feeling that is more on looking forward to the future\u2014again, a significant motif in Origination. Despite its departure from the usually calming song equal to that of its OP, it still finds a place to exist within Origination's somber themes, even though it may not fit entirely with Aria's atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is already undeniable that Aria has great music, it never stopped getting better, and Origination raises the bar with new piano pieces to go along with the original soundtrack. Where Origination stands out against its predecessors is in its well-handled approach to music, never exceeding its use of both instrumental and lyrical pieces. The inserts never seemed off, and everything suited each scene at a most impressive tone.\\n\\n\r\nTwo new important tracks cement Aria the Origination as a stroke of genius. Ryou Hirohashi's wonderfully haunting \"Lumis Eterne\" amplifies the climactic scene of Episode 9, evoking a cathartic feeling of tearful bliss and satisfaction. Poetic and symbolic of Alice's character progression throughout the series, this song, much like any other track in Aria's score, acquires its own personality. The other song, \"Yokogao,\" which played in the final episode of the show, is another piece sung by Yui Makino that perfectly captures the essence of Alicia and Akari's relationship, as well as their personal connection to the utopia that is Aqua. While being one of the few melancholic songs in Aria's music, it is still a sublime fit to the scene at hand and Aria's positive and emotional soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also safe to say that the voice actors do not falter in their side of the job as well, and their takes on the Undines in their most emotional moments are nothing but amazing. Chiwa Saito handles Aika's different emotions with good comedic awareness, along with standout scenes of her serious and melancholic demeanor. Ryou Hirohashi's \"dekkai\" performance-desu of Alice's childish nature is taken in a much more playful way, and her acting is one of the main reasons why Alice had dominated some of the episodes. Erino Hazuki once again lends her voice to the ever-wonderful Akari, and a lot of her contributions to the character from the \"Hahi\"s to the \"Ehh\"s make her as the only fitting person for Akari's role.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the main trio, the Three Great Water Fairies Alicia, Akira, and Athena are also reprised by Sayaka Ohara, Junko Minagawa, and Tomoko Kawakami, respectively. While already generally praised for their roles, moments in Origination where these characters are set up in dramatic scenes with their juniors further emphasize their great performances.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\\n\r\nWith the transfer from 4:3 to 16:9 beginning from Arietta, the world of Aqua has become wider and immersive than ever. Hal Film Maker continues to work its wonders with stellar and faithful backgrounds mirroring that of real-life Venice. The background department shines with their striking, hand-painted scenery that encapsulates the nearly-ethereal beauty of Aqua, rivaling that of Kozue Amano's original illustrations. Of course, with the series mainly being set in Neo-Venezia\u2014with the exception of an episode that takes place in Neo-Burano Island, set pieces are often used consistently and with less diversity from Natural. It's not to say that they slacked on it, though, as the depiction of the places are not only accurate but also highly detailed improvements to Animation and Natural's already captivating backdrops.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the major boost in Aqua's scenery, it is also fairly evident how the studio keeps a keen eye for the characters, with small but noticeable changes to their designs. Along with that, Origination feels livelier than other installments, having more motion with its frames and very, very elaborate facial animations in the show's critical moments. The comedic expressions remain a staple of the show, and still carry the bulk of Aria's funniest instances.\\n\\n\r\nThis element is not perfect, however, as a 2008 series would somewhat opt to add in CGI to save budget costs. For the most part, the CG in Aria is beautiful and does not really hinder immersion, but there were moments in Origination that it goes beyond using CG water and appears in other elements. Granted, they only appear for two noticeable scenes throughout the show, but these parts were very jarring and could very well be a valid criticism to its animation. Nonetheless, this does not summarize the entirety of the animation, as Origination continues the synchronous blend it has with the soundtrack, initiating a visual and audial experience unlike any.\\n\\n\r\nCriticisms\\n\\n\r\nWrapping up a series is difficult. While Aria ends in quite possibly the best conclusion possible\u2014and quite frankly, one of the best in anime, there are a lot of things to be pointed at that could have made it a bit more fulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter balancing, for example, was noticeably more unbalanced in Origination compared to the first two seasons. While the first season focuses mostly on Akari\u2014as it should, since it's an introduction, the second season diversifies the tales to give the other characters significant depth that they didn't have. It handles every character equally, with the inclusion of the side characters that added more color to the daily adventures in Aqua. Origination tries to shift this focus onto the main trio only, but even in this department it is considerably affected. As aforementioned, Aika does not get as much screen time as she deserves, and while episodes about her are some of the best Aria has to offer, it pales in comparison to the amount of treatment she got in Natural. More importantly, Aika is not the only one to suffer this issue, but to the show's actual protagonist as well. While the last episodes do bring Akari back into the spotlight, the middle part of the show is obviously oriented at Alice, as if the show itself is hinting what is to come for her. It is still a good buildup, and is not necessarily a bad part of the show, as she is underplayed for most of the first two seasons. However, it does betray the point of Origination being a final chapter for all three of them, and it could possibly hamper enjoyment for people expecting a well-rotated character storyline like Natural.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important aspect not addressed by Origination was Cait Sith and the mystical side of Aqua. Natural was all about exploring Aqua and building up its characters at the same time, with the introduction of its spirit guardian. It seemed to emphasize that we will see more of Cait Sith's involvement in the story, although it did not turn out to be the case. Origination completely drifted from its magical elements in sacrifice for a character-oriented story which aimed to bring an ending to them rather than to the world.\\n\\n\r\nIt could also be said that Origination's subtle but important tone shift to put the cast in situations that are much more emotionally testing than its previous iterations. In service of a plot-driven series, after all, is the necessity for conflict to arise. Yet, to bring up a counterpoint, the drama that stirs from Origination can be felt only if you have found the attachment to the characters. When looked at superficially, the conflicts that are brought up in Origination can barely qualify as drama\u2014and even though the themes may still be somewhat deviant from what the first two seasons offered, they still run under the overall concept of optimism and hopefulness.\\n\\n\r\nWith only 13 episodes to end the story, it's honestly surprising that Origination manages to hold out and fill in every aspect it could accomplish in Aria's quite vast world. Not only that, but it ties every loose end about the characters in a very satisfying manner that one can easily overlook its flaws, and indulge in Origination's well-toned balance of drama and the same-old Aria viewers had come to know and love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion\\n\\n\r\nOrigination is one of the rare examples of shows that manages to trump expectations from its prequels. What I believed to be Aria's peak in Arietta immediately got dispelled by how Origination mastered its presentation. Other than that, there are few series that get to end on a high note, and this entry to the story of Aqua and its Undines manages to bring its characters into a full circle, despite its hardly noticeable hiccups.\\n\\n\r\nAria has always been atmospheric, and it pretty much takes the cake as one of the best that handles atmosphere overall, but Origination is the cherry on top, being a conclusion to its well-rounded cast of lovable people. It allows us to appreciate more of the mundane, while also revealing the bigger picture of life.\\n\\n\r\nSome would say that Aria is as saccharine as it can get with its themes, though I would beg to differ. While the franchise certainly is a defining example of things never going wrong, Origination, as it is aptly named, brings us to the beginning of all this happiness\u2014happiness, that you may think is merely blind optimism, but one actually rooted in reality.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an enjoyable show\u2014cathartic and introspective. When approaching this, one may need to put aside everything within their to-do list, and the time to be alone when watching it. It might seem like a bother, but investing yourself into it is one of the best payoffs one could ever have. Emotionally charged yet void of melancholy, Aria the Origination can easily bring anyone to tears with its innocent and caressive approach.\\n\\n\r\nSeagulls fly into the sky as the fresh wind coming from the sea dances through your hair. The campanile tolls its bell, echoing throughout this city of stories. Neo-Venezia is a place filled with wonders and history, and one can easily get lost in the countless experiences you could have. Yet fear not, as someone is always there for you. People of different places and of different journeys, cross paths in this place of miracles.\\n\\n\r\nAqua may seem like an unattainable dream\u2014a place of mere escapism. However, as long as someone welcomes anything before them, whether good, whether bad, like how Akari welcomed Aqua, and how Aqua welcomed her back, there will always exist a Neo-Venezia deep within our hearts.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Aria is a masterpiece\u2014the quintessential slice-of-life show. Rife with characters and stories that are intertwined in this euphoric utopia, Origination brings all of these great moments together, and reaches out to us playfully. Definitively, it is a one-of-a-kind experience you could not afford to miss.",

            "content": "Aria the Origination is the marvelous conclusion of Akari, Alice, and Aika\u2019s journey as undines in training while retaining all of the charm and glorious pace of its predecessors.\r\nStory - 10\r\nOrigination masters the art of telling simplistic, straight forward stories while giving great insight into the characters and the setting.  What were problems in length, use of time, the annoying cats, and introduction of character in Natural and Animation, become the third installment\u2019s strengths.  Every episode in Origination showcases something undiscovered in the series\u2019 previous episodes, whether it be a new occupation, place or characters.  Each episode serves as piece of developmentfor one of the undines, and in the case of the single, even manages to give the viewer a better look at how they grew to become the women they are in flashbacks.  Most importantly, the story manages to make use of all the development, leaving no moment squandered for emotional resonance.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nAria:  The Origination is the reason why moving to widescreen is such a wonderful idea.  The show was already known for its use of panorama and sprawling set-up shots, but moving into widescreen with the added quality of detail in the art made this show stunning visually.  The art design is so original that the viewers instantly know what they are watching and where the action is set.  Character design has improved a little because of the change in proportion from standard to widescreen, so the super sugary edges are rounded off a little bit.  What I love most about the character design is the execution of everyone\u2019s super deformed counterparts.  They are quirky and a little childish, yet very expressive and kind of distill the quality of the character in one look.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThe music is just as wonderful in Origination as it has been in the Aria series.  Incorporation of the music is always appropriate and the quality of the music achieves much of the same notes that the tone and presentation of the show have always tried to create:  a calm, inviting sense of wonder in which something new can be found every time one listens.  Athena\u2019s songs are well done as always and Alice\u2019s song was performed very well considering the constraints of her character\u2019s abilities.  The voice actors really dig deep to properly portray the gamut of emotions their characters go through.  Nothing ever felt forced or contrived from their performances.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nThe characters in Origination take the front seat in care much more so than in the first seasons.  Because of the story, and the decided direction in creating closure for the series, Origination pulls no punches in characterization and development.  Characters once thought of as clumsy and aloof are actually perceptive and doting.  The harsher characters are softened by immaculately exploring their insecurities, and the almost woodenly perfect Alicia is given such a degree of well-executed characterization and development that the distance that Akira as the main character created for the viewer by placing her on a pedestal is slowly brought down making Alicia much more human than I had expected.  Perhaps the only disappointment with the characters is that there is little growth with Akira.  This is most likely because she is a girl so honest in her motives and accepting of all he faults and flaws that there just isn\u2019t much to be done besides rattle her confidence a few times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI loved it all.  Everything just absolutely worked in Aria the Origination.  This is definitely a show where the whole is vastly greater than the sum of its parts.  What I especially loved is that somehow the show gave me everything that I wanted so succinctly and so beautifully.  Also, for the first time in a show I think that I rooted for every character and didn\u2019t want any of them to fail.  This of course to me is a feat in and of itself, especially because I did not warm up to Akari at all until about halfway through this show.  I just embraced all of the characters for what they were and enjoyed watching the growth of everyone by the shows end.  For a brief moment, I wanted another series before I talked myself out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Focusing on the three juniors, we see how they live their daily life and training to become a Prima, interact with each other and other characters, and overcome their own struggles. \r\nAnimation: 10\r\nHAL Film Maker easily becomes one of my favorite animation studio. Excellent color choices, smooth animation, beautiful scenery.. what else could you ask for? Definitely looking forward for the DVD releases, sinceseason 1 has already available for pre-orders.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Simply outstanding. \\n\r\nOhara Sayaka's perfect and kind onee-san Alicia. Hazuki Erino who perfectly depicts Akari's innocent-ness. Chiwa Saito's adorable crybaby Aika. Hirohashi Ryou's lovely and extremely cute Alice. Minagawa Junko who shows Akira's toughness. Kawakami Tomoko's ultimate dojikko Athena. I can't imagine any other voice replacing any of them..\\n\r\nAnd honorable mention to Nishimura Chinami as Aria Shachou.\\n\r\nSongs:\\n\r\nI'm not too fond of Makino Yui at first, but her songs grew into me the more I listened to them.. and I have to say that the original soundtracks are magnificent. Great job, Choro Club ft Senoo.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAs I've stated before, Aria's strongest point is the character interaction and development. We learn more and more about them in each episode, slowly but sure we're emotionally attached to each one of them.. (which makes it really hard to part by the end of episode 13.. but a masterpiece should end to be one).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nBy this point, Aika would have shouted &quot;hazukashii serifu kinshi!&quot; countless times to me, but I just have to praise Aria more. ^^; It's too euphoric it's hard to describe 'the enjoyment' only by words.. It's heart-warming, soothing, and so peaceful it might as well end a war. I enjoyed every single second I spent in Neo-Venezia. Aria stays as the only anime that makes me weep out of happiness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\n..because it simply is that awesome.",

            "content": "This is the final season of Aria, and what a bittersweet one it is. I\u2019m so glad to have discovered this wonderful series, meeting characters and settings I won\u2019t ever forget.\r\nStory: Each episode we follow the various characters through their daily events in beautiful Neo-Venezia, and watch the three apprentice undines on their journeys to becoming professionals. When that moment inevitably arrives, it is definitely one of the most touching scenes I\u2019ve ever experienced. However, the ending events do feel rather fast-paced compared to the slow and dreamy atmosphere of most other episodes. Nonetheless, the ending is deeply satisfying, with a message that time bringschange to people and places, for better or worse. Though we will treasure memories dear to us, we must always progress towards tomorrow.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The overall animation quality is topnotch, and sees improvements over the second season. The art style is what truly stands out though. From calm moonlit nights to romantic sunsets, stunning Italian architecture to fantastic natural landscapes, Aria is a gorgeous animated painting that will sweep you away.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is mostly composed of acoustic guitar, piano, and female vocals. The music helps set the mood perfectly, from serene to upbeat. I felt that the vocal tracks were not as strong as in previous seasons, which set the standard really high, but that did not hinder my enjoyment of the music. Voice acting remains superb, bringing out the distinct personality of each character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: If you have fallen in love with the art and music of Aria, then you will most certainly fall in love with the characters! They are all uniquely wonderful, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that the lead females are very beautiful. Of special note is Akari, the pink-haired protagonist who narrates most of the story. Her romantic, optimistic outlook on life is extremely contagious, and will no doubt bring a smile to your face and warmth to your heart.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Given its slow and gentle pacing, Aria is not an anime to be rushed through. Rather, take the time to relax and really enjoy the series. Watch an episode before bedtime and you\u2019ll surely have sweet dreams, trust me on that! It has taken me over three months to watch the three seasons of Aria, and I have enjoyed it unlike any other anime, partly because Aria IS unlike any other anime!\\n\\n\r\nThe Aria series is truly a masterpiece. Never before have I fallen so in love with a fictional setting and its charming inhabitants. Through the eyes of Akari, I have come to gain even greater appreciation of the treasure that is life. Parting is such sweet sorrow. Though the journey ends here, in my memory it will remain. And what a journey it has been.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n-Ryan\\n",

            "content": "Aria the Origination has achieved something remarkable to which anyone who's familiar with the slice of live genre knows to be an extremely rare phenomenon; it manages to end satisfactory.    \r\nPerhaps more so than even this, it perfectly incapsulates the concept of change, which as anyone not still living in a womb will attest carries great trepidations as well as possibilities. Its said that real courage shines not when one demands change, but upon facing it and seeing all its uncertainty, are able to accept it, and Aria really managed to portray this perfectly along with other themes such as the follyof trying to ignore the future, when even in the most timeless of places, nothing ever stays the same for long, but before we get into all that, a quick summary of the show...\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination maintains the series' core premise, continuing to follow Akari as she and her close friends chase their dream of becoming Undines (Female Gondoliers) in the beautiful and mysterious city of Neo-Venezia, a brick for brick restoration of the ancient city of Venice now built on Mars (renamed Aqua due to the now abundance of water thanks to terraforming). By now the show is a seasoned veteran, with two series' behind its style has been seamlessly perfected till its like watching a master craftsman fusing experience and knowledge to create a work of art born out of every learned from mistake and good idea since built upon.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation was the past, focusing on the love all humans have for the past and its ostensible simplicity, Aria the Natural was the present focusing on the city and the lives of those living and dreaming in it, and so Aria the Origination is the future. It is as Winston Churchill famously said \"not the end or even the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning\", indeed the series is called Aria the Origination not Aria the conclusion, and perhaps this is the shows greatest strength, it matures rather than just stops. The characters move on to that mysterious infinite world where all our favourite characters live forever doing what we love, Sherlock Holmes and Watson discussing a case by the fireplace of 221b Baker street, Esteban and crew still trying to find the mysterious cities of gold, Ginko forever traveling helping people and Mushi, and Akari and friends forever at bliss in Neo-Venezia. Its a bittersweet feeling to have this series end but its such a perfect end that one cannot long hold a grudge against it, besides a perfect end is always better than a slow decline into awfulness (I'm looking at you Simpsons);  i can say little more about the story without giving too much away, and so I shan't\u2026    \\n\\n\r\nThe art has improved to such a standard that like a high tide it seems to lift everything else up with it, the city has never looked more magical or appealing with greater attention given to all the details that make a series come alive, everything from the washing lines that hang from every window or the food stalls and gardens make the city seem lived in and loved rather than as before where the city seemed more like a work of art than a home to thousands of people. \\n\r\nThe design and appearances of the characters while at first ostensibly no different on closer examination show a greater maturity and presence, particularly Alice who looks considerably older and mature, everything from the way she is drawn to her movements and especially how she speaks and acts around people seem to show a great deal of development and maturity in her character. Its a real sign of a classy series thats art can evolve in line with its characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they are by far the single most enhanced aspect of this series; Aria as a whole its said suffers from little character development, though I've argued before that is not strictly true as instead the show and its characters develop slowly and incrementally like real people do and that the show tends to focus on other things at times like the city or individual stories etc. But now there there is no room for any debate, the series delivers all that it promised made all the sweeter by the (debatable) delay. In fact it works so well I'm certain the series couldn't have worked any other way, the slow growth and change seen in our characters in the previous seasons meant than when the change comes, and boy does it come, the shock is real and almost scary, just like real change. After being so used to the characters always being in one place in time when they finally do move on it carries far more weight and pushes home the lesson about change, courage and the folly of trying to freeze the present or live in the past much more than a conventional series could have. Its not just the main characters either, everyone in the series is swept along by the current of change that soaked Neo-Venezia and this series; I must stress this is not some cheesy ending where in somehow by the end everybody has forever found their perfect place in life and are now simply trapped in a static state of perfection, theres plenty left to the imagination, but thats where it will stay since this is also where the source material leaves off, perhaps for the best since if these characters are to feel like real people then to effectively end their lives would shatter the realism.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude Aria the origination is the season that finally does it all right, standing on the shoulders of Animation and Natural it manages to breach the water line and breathe the sweet air of greatness, it shows as nonsense the age old argument that \"nothing happens\" in slice of life anime's and sets the bar for how to end a series of this type. Its sad it has to end as the world this series created is so rich and imaginative that their plenty left to work with and perhaps in the future we'll see a spin-off or some other type of story set here however I'm not holding my breath. Rarely does a series get inside your heart enough to make you care and imagine how things will be after it ends but thats the magic of Aria, it allows you to care; and care I did, if thats not enough of  a ringing endorsement in a world of soulless shows were it takes the death of every main character to elicit an audience emotion then I don't know what is...",

            "content": "\"Wonderful...\"\r\nMuch like the main protagonist, Mizunashi Akari, you will find yourself repeating this phrase as you continue discovering the wonderful world of Neo-Venezia and delving deeper into the relationships between the characters. This final season of Aria is a very heartfelt and satisfying ending to an overall unforgettable series.\r\nAs all the other reviews say, it is absolutely necessary that you watch the previous two seasons and the OVA: Aria the Animation, Aria the Natural, and Aria the OVA: Arietta. \r\nWhy? Watching Aria the Animation will familiarize you with the characters; watching Aria the Natural will familiarize you with the many beautiful and magical wonders ofNeo-Venezia; and Aria the OVA: Arietta will help you transition naturally into the final season on an emotional level.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's so \"wonderful...\" about Aria the Origination?\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, the Aria series takes on an episodic style of storytelling, so that each episode feels like its own, with its own heartwarming message. What Aria the Origination does differently than the previous two seasons is that it starts to connect all the dots together. All the seemingly random places of Neo-Venezia and all the seemingly random encounters, both social and magical, all come together to mold Mizunashi Akari into who she ultimately becomes by the end of the series. And it\u2019s not just Akari; the other main characters all go through some form of change\u2026 and how unexpectedly bittersweet some of these changes turn out to be. Every episode towards the end of this season starts to speak to you on a much deeper level and will definitely move some of you to tears (at least for me it did).\\n\\n\r\nWhat's so \"wonderful...\" about Aria in general?\\n\\n\r\n1) Neo-Venezia: The viewers are basically in the same position as Mizunashi Akari, in that both want to learn more about Neo-Venezia. The beauty of this is that the viewers get to experience Neo-Venezia vicariously through Akari, so that the viewers come to love Neo-Venezia as much as the protagonist does. If there is one important thing that this anime teaches me, it is the fact that even the most remote places can be turned into something beautiful. The protagonist\u2019s love for the city and all its hidden treasures is almost foolish, but also very endearing. \\n\\n\r\n2) Characters: Despite every character's name starting with an A (besides Woody), it is easy to distinguish all the characters. The viewers are constantly introduced to each of these characters and his or her demeanor, flaws, habits, and behaviors in several episodes, so as long as the viewers put in the time to watch the whole series, the viewers will start to connect with the characters on an emotional level. And no doubt, all the characters are relatable and lovable in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\n3) Messages: The first few episodes had me cringe a bit because of how corny the messages were. Sometimes, I even felt that they weren\u2019t delivered very well. However, some of these messages have stuck with me and have never left my mind since.\\n\\n\r\nSome off the top of my head are:\\n\r\n-Scolding may be one of the greatest gifts you can give to a loved one.\\n\r\n-Some of the things (or even people) that we take for granted may seem unnoticeable to us, but they are always supporting us secretly, in their own ways.\\n\r\n-Some people are born with natural talents, making it seemingly difficult to catch up to them. However, that gap means nothing as long as you do not lose heart and keep on persevering.\\n\r\n-Do not be afraid of making new encounters.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Soothing and delightful. The soft and pure vocals from the opening ease you into the episode as it plays in the background over the first few scenes. The ending is just as soothing, if anything a little more carefree and light. The overall soundtrack is perfect for a lazy day, a rainy day, or simply a calm day where you want to drink some coffee or tea. All in all, the soundtrack succeeds in emphasizing the ambience, the scenery, and the mood of the anime. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fluid animation, especially with boat rowing and flowing of hair (a LOT of wind blowing scenes). All the characters are beautifully designed and animated as well, staying true to the manga. The scenery depicted is breathtaking and memorable, and I recommend checking out the manga too because the artwork in the manga is just as breathtaking. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Neo-Venezia, the Aria series itself has many hidden treasures to provide for viewers; some treasures that I may not have discovered yet. I can\u2019t wait until the next time I revisit this series to discover something else.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, after reading this review, some of you may watch the series, treasure it, and discover something that I never did. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

            "content": "The third and last intalment of ARIA where even all good things come to an end - and it was done in an excellent manner!\r\nI find ARIA to be a \"love it or hate it\" series.  It's pretty obvious I loved it while on the other hand, action-mecha fans would find this the ultimate bore.\r\nStory: 9\r\nUnlike the previous seasons, The Origination starts rolling towards the climax of the series and progression starts to occur.  While it is rather predictable that apprentices tend to get promoted, the way it was done was simply magnificent.  \r\nThis is one of the very few animes whichhas actually outdone the source manga with appropriately dramatic and moving presentation of key events and lessons.\\n\\n\r\nA mark get knocked off for an early-season hiccup and pacing issues which affected my experience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt is pretty obvious that The Origination had a nice, fat budget.  The characters are drawn well and are consistent.  Alice especially is exceptionally cute.  The scenery has an amazing level of detail and where it matters, is totally accurate to the real-life counterpart - having visited Venice just because of ARIA!  A wide range of colours and shades were used and the CGI of the water was also a step-up from what was already excellent in previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe clever use of angles, panning and differing drawing styles for specific moments served to totally enhance the story and created a far greater impact than the manga.\\n\\n\r\nA mark knocked off nonetheless for the animation, where &quot;framelagging&quot; in some scenes were rather obvious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nTurn up the speakers and you'll hear the excellent background sounds of Venice.  The sounds of the market, the gondola and the water are excellently inserted.  It is this extra touch that makes me give full marks.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Choro Club is outstanding like it was in the previous seasons and the way it was used was totally spot on.  Even when it was sub-par (an attempt at Esperanto showed a glaring Japanese accent), the way it was combined with the story and art still made it excellent and I was simply blown away.\\n\\n\r\nIt took time for me to get used to the OP/ED but I find the tunes fit very well.\\n\\n\r\nWith the soundtracks being so soothing and relaxing, I ended up using it for dubious purposes, such as during exam revision!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nARIA's cast have an exceptionally good relationship with each other - and this close bonding was by no means created in a smooth manner.  Each and every main character relationships have their own interesting stories which I found to be very interesting and they support each other in their own unique ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe relative maturity of the characters are built upon the foundations of the first 2 seasons and it is great to see them gradually becoming more mature and independent, while still maintaining their own unique personalities.\\n\\n\r\nA mark knocked off for a rather bland anime-original character, which is also the cause of the hiccup in the story at the start of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nARIA is totally uplifting and positive, and this is important especially when the real world is a rather negative place.  I totally enjoyed the postiviness, the jokes and the teasings exchanged between the characters.  It was also total eye-candy because of the excellent art and the music also added greatly.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, a mark knocked off because of that one episode, one particular character which simply killed my enjoyment for a week.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nNo series is perfect over an entire season but not many come as close to perfection as ARIA the Origination.  A superbly produced work and it is indeed a bit of a pity all good things come to an end!",

            "content": "This review covers the entire Aria series from Aria the Animation to the Natural to the Arietta OVA and then finally the Origination.\r\nStory: 10/10 Aria is about three girls striving to become Prima Undine's in Neo-Venezia (formally know as Mars). Prima Undine's are basically tour guides on small two to four person boats. The series goes on to show the extreme beauty of Neo-Venezia in each episode with beautiful art and elegant music. While our three main characters Akari, Aika and Alice train to become Prima with the help of their tutors, Alicia, Athena and Akira. Every episode has many moments that leaves you witha sense of warmth and happiness.  The series is incredibly relaxing and slow so if your a fan of fast paced shows, this may not be for you. But if your a fan of Slice-of-Life's slow paced shows, you will love this series. I often compare this series to Mushi-shi because they are both diamonds in the rough. You don't find a Anime series like this one often.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 I don\u2019t rate for art because it is not a deciding factor on how I watch Anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 The soundtracks for the entire series are golden. They are filled with slow ballads, acoustic guitar melody\u2019s and great orchestral themes. I have gotten all of these soundtracks from     Baka Bt and have not regretted it. Each track is beautiful and it makes you feel like you've stepped back into the beautiful Neo-Venezia. The same goes for the OP/ED's. I actually had most of the openings from the series and I didn\u2019t even know it. My favorite out of all the OP's is probably the opening for the Natural \u201cEuphoria\u201d by Yui Makino and my favorite ending is, of course, Aria the Animation's \u201cRainbow\u201d by Round Table Feat. Nino.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 At first I thought this series would have little character development because it focused more on the beauty of the world, but boy I was wrong. The characters have amazing development, there were many times when the character struggled and grew from different experiences. It was an amazing thing to watch. For example, Akia at the beginning was obsessed with Alicia and just wanted to be like her and then later on she grew to be herself and not a shadow of Alicia. It was a lot of fun to watch the characters laugh, cry, and have fun together. \\n\\n\r\nSeason One \"Aria the Animation\": The series had a great begining, it felt like as if it was gradually showing Neo-Venezia and the mysterious power that it holds. (13 Episodes)\\n\\n\r\nSeason Two: \"Aria the Natural\" This one series came in with alot of character development and a sence of mystery and wonder. This part of the series is where my comparison to Mushi-shi comes into play. (26 episodes)\\n\\n\r\nOVA ~Arietta~: This OVA was really special. It gave greater insight into the Aria Company. I was really blown away by this OVA. Its probably the highest rated OVA on my list. (1 episode)\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 \"Aria the Origination: The final season of Aria was just beautiful. It has superb character development and wrapped up the series. It ended so beautifully that it just left me in wonder. The we're alot of parts that I got teary eyed in. Characters achived thier dreams, some characters left and passed their torch onto the next generation. It was a beautiful masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: 15/10 This series was amazing. Again, I have never seen anything quite like it. The music, characters, environment and sound were all perfect. This is a series that I will watch over and over again and never get tired of. I constantly thought while I watched this series \u201cI want to see the world through Akari's eyes\u201d. Even now I still wish that, it would be so cool if Neo-Venezia was real, I would love to go there and live the rest of my life.",

            "content": "This is the third and final of my series of reviews for the ARIA animes. My perspective on these reviews are based on how I felt after finishing the show my first time.\r\nAll good things come to an end, how sad and true this is. ARIA the ORIGINATION is the third and final season of the series adapted from Kozue Amano's ARIA manga series. And I must say, this season is just something else...its the end of the journey around Neo-Venezia and what an end this is.\r\nStory: It is impossible to understand what an amazing story the series has had unless you have finished watchingall the seasons, this season truly makes you appreciate the other seasons more. ARIA the ORIGINATION shows the conclusion of the journey for Akari and her friends in their goal to become full fledged undines. The beginning of the show retains the usual standard of storytelling and qualities that we can expect from the series. Presenting us once again with the daily lives of out undines and the events happening around them. But it is a bit past the halfway mark of this season that ARIA shifts gears and presents us with pure greatness. After being with these great characters for 39 episodes + 1 OVA ,the final set of episodes for ARIA the ORIGINATION presents us with such emotionally powerful scenes time and time again it is almost impossible not to get emotional while watching them. There isn't enough words to describe how incredible the ending for this anime was delivered. This series is just magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Despite already being very pretty to look at, this final season looks even better, not only in terms of background graphics but there is also significant improvement in the character animations as well. It also helps that this season is presented in 16:9 resolution >_> Overall this is the best looking season hands down.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Although this season is IMO the weakest of the 3 in terms of soundtracks, it is still one of the best you can hear...the many different songs mixed with the great moments this anime delivers combine perfectly to deliver very powerful scenes. However this season is prob the best one of the 3 in terms of how well the voice actors played their parts. My hat goes off to all the seiyuus for doing such an amazing job (especially Hazuki Erino, marvelous).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is without a doubt where the anime shines the most. Over the course of series we are introduced and grouped with Akari and her friends Aika and Alice as they train to become professional undines. It is hard to not grow some kind of emotional attachment to these characters after two entire seasons of watching them train and have fun together. We are shown how the characters mature and grow up in order to adapt to the inevitable changes that happens in life. It is using this emotional attachment that ORIGINATION manages to reach into our heart by showing us the end of their journeys and the beginning of new ones to come in spectacular fashion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Words cannot describe how incredible this experience was, looking back at when I first started watching season 1 and now, it still feels weird that I have finished this series. You are left with a feeling of satisfaction yet at the same time you dont want it to end. Such is the greatness that I experienced watching this anime and this is the first time I have ever given a full set of 10s for an anime without hesitation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: ARIA the ORIGINATION is without a doubt one of the few masterpieces out there. It is a beautiful anime in every sense and even if my scores make me look like some kind of fanboy I don't care because this anime and this series as a whole IS THAT GOOD! To those out there who are looking for a relaxing anime that can make you smile at the end of each episode, it can make you laugh and cry as well...look no further, this anime will be a godsend for you.",

            "content": "Aria the origination is the third season of the Aria series.  It hasn't changed much, it is pretty much the same as the previous seasons.  It is best to watch the first season Aria the Animation and the second season Aria the Natural before you start on this, because you will miss out on a lot of character development, yes thats right character development not plot because there isn't any plot just daily life of the main characters. \r\n~STORY~\r\nAria is set in a fictional city which is based off Venice, Italy.  The story follows Arika who is a Undine trainee who isaiming to become a Prima.  A Undine is someone who rows a gondola as their occupation, taking clients around the city of Neo Venezia, pretty much a tour guide that guides you on a gondola.  A Prima is a top class Undine who is their company's best Undine and are very famous.  Arika, along with her good friends Aika and Alice, are trainees under the 3 current Primas Alicia, Akira, and Athena.\\n\\n\r\n ~ART~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty much the same as the previous seasons.  The thing i like most is how they use so much color thats easy on the eyes and enjoyable to look at.  You can tell the creators put in a lot of effort to make the city of Neo Venezia come to life and immerse the viewers into it's daily events which i think they accomplished very well.  I especially enjoy how the creators use chibi-like faces to express the mood of the characters, even though it gets repetitive, i still don't get tired of it.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\\n\r\nThe music is sooooooo relaxing, most of the BGM has a happy melody.  Sometimes you won't even notice the BGM because it is so subtle and soft sounding, but it fits right into the mood and setting that makes it enjoyable and not annoying to hear.  The opening theme is a very good example of how the music sounds like throughout the series.  The ending theme is pleasant in its own way also, but i still skip it to watch the next episode &gt;_&lt;\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER~\\n\\n\r\nIn this season you will definitely notice the differences in what the episodes are about compared the previous seasons.  There are a lot more character developments going on.  It expresses the bonds the characters share with each other and shows how they are important to them.  And it finally shows more traits and personality growth with some of the characters which the previous seasons didn't show much of, for example Athena my fav! ^_^\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season as i have the previous seasons, after 2 seasons I am still watching it. So yea enjoyed it very much. \\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are tired of the shounen or drama type of anime, this kind of slice of life is will be a relaxing change.  I warn you though, if you are the type that loves plot driven animes with drama and lots of fight scenes, STEP AWAY FROM THIS ANIME.\\n",

            "content": "This is the first time I've written a review right after finishing an anime, simply because it was so wonderful, so magnificent, that it overwhelmed me with emotion. Called Aria, I'd been taking my time enjoying it, rather than burning through the episodes, which I could have done. Trust me when I say this is the first time I've given perfect tens and Aria is worth every point.\r\nAt the final minute of a perfect end to the series, I was overcome with both glee and sadness. Even now, as I think about how this series is actually over and I won't have anymore episodes towatch, it saddens me, because that's how good it was. It's inspired me to become an even better writer so that perhaps one day I can write something that will make people as sad - just because they love it that much.\\n\\n\r\nAria is about three young girls who are training to become gondoliers - gondola riders. They live in a city called Neo-Venizia, which is a future Venice. And the show is generally a slice-of-life tale of these girls growing into their own and becoming Primas, which are full-fledged gondoliers. Full of amazing music, charm, and heart-tugging little stories that could give you happy dreams the rest of your life, Aria is unique in its broad imagination and detail. The world of Neo-Venizia puts you at ease and then fills you with wonder, much like a ride on a gondola itself. \\n\\n\r\nAkari, the main character, and her senior, Alicia, run Aria Company. Every day, Akari learns more and more about this wondrous city as she and her two new friends, Aika and Alice, practice together. They meet fascinating characters and discover secret places tucked away, all while learning about themselves and the ones they look up to. And surrounding these times are breathtaking landscapes and scenes drawn by the finest of animators.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after three seasons, when the first part of Akari's story comes to a close, the author somehow turns the story full-circle in a masterful job of penmanship that ranks in the upper echelon of magnificent writing. Not only does it make your heart pound with overwhelming feeling and love, but it gives you hope for the new generation - a new story waiting on the horizon.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who loves a fantastic story that could end all ails with one cute &quot;Ehhhh?&quot; from Akari, I would recommend Aria. I guarantee you will be changed forever, even before Alicia can say, &quot;Ada ada!&quot;",

            "content": "Aria is a truly episodic Slice of Life anime. It has three seasons, Aria the Animation, Aria the Natural, Aria the Origination.\r\nAn aria in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work.\r\nHave you ever listened to Classical music ( Mozart, Beethoven etc.)?\r\nThe feeling of ARIA is as if listening to a beautiful melancholy foreign music first time. At first, you feel unfamiliar, you are uncertain whether to continue. Then you feel, there issomething in it that you can't just put it down. Aria the Animation is just like that. It has no definite plot, or story whatsoever and some truly irritating gags. It's just a narration of a plain day to day life, some random letters wriiten to a friend far away; some random letters describing the wonderful miracles the main character, Akari came across, along with her friends , Alice and Aika, on their way to become professional undines (Prima). And this letters also tell us about their seniors, the three great Water Fairies, Alice, Akira and Athena. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs the music progresses you feel ease, you start to feel accustomed to the foreign music. And then you start to notice the details, you start to feel it. You start to feel the world around you through the music. This is the feeling of watching Aria the Natura. Now the anime focuses on Neo Venezia; it revolves around the character more deeply, some supernatural encounters. It is as if you are becoming a part of the wonderland named Neo Venezia.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic goes on deeper and deeper, the more you feel enchanted by it, your senses consumed by it. The whole world seems new to you, the old familiar world has become something magnificent. By this time you have become familiar to the music, you know the music is ending. The music at it's end has become more expressive than ever before. You start to realize the meaning of the music. This is what Aria the Origination is. The characters are more deep, the encounters are no longer random, but they lead to something definite, some strong conclusion. You cannot help but feel a little sad but at the same time happy. Because the music is at it's peak. The whole new world, that has been reformed by the music, you can freely navigate your mind into it. You just cease to think at this point and let your mind take you to the dream world. The stories of Aria the Origination is more deeper, carry more meaning and you start to relate yourself to the world it created.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen at last the music ends, but it has left something in your heart you will never forget and you enjoy aftermath of the music, the dazedness, the melancholy feeling, a bit bittersweet. As you wanted it to go on forever. But everything has an ending. Then you wonder, if it goes on, what it would feel like. Aria the Origination is just like that. It is as if one chapter of the world has come to an end and a new chapter is beginning. You have not changed; the world has not changed either. Yet everything is new, everything is grand. You start to think what you had just watched and wish you could be in that world forever. But then you realize that this pensive feeling is a treasure, that you wanted to possess and yet it never came to you. But somehow it was always close to you. All your day to day life, all those petty insignificant encounters that you just ignored before, suddenly has become so precious to you. You can't help but smile, a deep satisfying smile. Yes you have just witnessed a Masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe setting evening sun and the flowing ripples on the water are just like a pure song of happiness. \\n\\n\r\nThe birds carry kindness in their wings, fly beyond the seas, and place love on the winds. \\n\\n\r\nIn the orange twilight sky, is a star of hope that will eternally shine, making my heart tremble. \\n\\n\r\nLumis eterne. \\n\\n\r\n- Alice Carroll",

            "content": "It is rare to see sequels that mantain, or even improve its high quality over the course of its duration, especially concerning the slice of life genre: such is the case of Aria: the Origination. It is the wonderful and satisfying conclusion of the Aria series, being one of the best, if not very best, anime oriented purely on slice of life. It is the result of the buildup of the two previous seasons, as without these it would be nearly impossible to fully appreciate its fantastic and bittersweet conclusion. \r\nThe story of Aria: the Origination is once again focused on the three main protagonists,Akira, Aika and Alice, their main goal being becoming excellent prima Undines, the highest rank of the profession. Audiences are presented as well with the soothing and lively town of Neo-Venezia. However, there is an actual change which makes it different from its prequels, and that is that it now has an actual goal in mind, in addition to better character development, enhancing the overall experience of the show. \\n\\n\r\nWhat may struck audiences at first is the fact that the first few episodes follow in nearly the same fashion as Aria: the Animation, which may cast some doubt in the validity of its popularity. This is however gently refuted as story progresses and builds up, viewers contemplating better woven episodes, in addition to observing an improved pacing as well as fluidity of its events. Not to mention that these are of great importance to the events to come, that will expose audiences to happiness and humor, in addition to tension and tear jerking moments filled with both sadness and joy.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to its cast of characters, these are much the same as the previous installments, being Akari, Aika and Alice its main focus. Thanks to the prequels, their relationships are intricate and believable, whilst experiencing further character development, in addition to its ultimate goal, becoming full-time undines. The peaceful and soothing atmosphere surrounding the city is conveyed through ita characters, which is normally is presented with a smile. However, viewers will soon come to realize that there is much more to it than just hapiness, being Akari and Alicia of Aria Company great examples. Through their respective personalities (both being the optimistic type) it greatly enhances the overall atmosphere of the city, with their intelligent analogies or actions to prove different points.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, not everyone is as optimistic as the they are; there is Aika, the hardworking and energetic girl truggling to keep up to the her friends, in which through her character the hardships are relaid to the viewer. Then there is Alice, the genius of the trio who is quite interesting, as she seems realistic through numerous actions she undertakes, be it kicking a stone to home, or just being very curious in general. What however came as surprise is the development of its supporting cast, albeit small, which enhanced the experience of the show greatly. Audiences get to know the Aria president and grandma better, in addition to exposing the foundation of Aria Company.\\n\\n\r\nIt will come to no surprise that the art style of the series remained the same, including the character designs. However, there is certain improvements made on the backgrounds, being in some cases very detailed with a brilliant use of colors, making it appear at first glance as a real picture. As for the animation, it remained well executed with suitable facial expressions when the situation required it.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the music score, its compositions remain to a similar style of the previous seasons, yet with improvements, correctly using different pieces depending on the situation. The voice actors performed their roles masterfully, correctly representing each different personality magnificently, as well as conveying the different emotions. Openings and endings remain with the beautiful vocals presented, suitable for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAria: the Origination was overall a fantastic and bittersweet conclusion to the Aria series with its wonderful characters and town of Neo Venezia, in addition to the animation and soundtrack used. I personally would consider this series the pinnacle of slice of life, especially when taking into account the simplicity of it - or complexity concerning its characters. Despite all the positive things I mentioned, I would also like to mention some issues audiences may come across in the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the extremely positive nature of the anime may seem a drawback for those who are in search of realism in the genre. This mainly concerns times when the story experiences tonal shifts to more dramatic ones, as these are too far apart from each other, thus feeling disjointed from the story. The characters themselves might be an issue as well, as these seem to be overly optimistic at first glance, hardships not being that great of an issue. Some of the catch phrases of the different characters may seem to some as annoying and monotonal as well. Other thing I might want to point out is the fact when watching the series distracted, it can become boring. I personally found these not to be an issue, as it set out what it meant to, and splendidly it did.\\n\\n\r\nViewers might find themselves asking if sitting through the numerous episodes of the series is worth their time, and I can wholeheartedly recommend any fan of slice of life to do so; after all, the Aria series is truly a heartwarming and relaxing tale which showcases how wonderful life can be.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nIt's always difficult saying goodbye. Whether it is watching that last season of a favorite anime or seeing off your sibling as he or she leaves for college, there's this certain feeling that one gets in the heart. One begins to wonder if everything is fine, if such a decision is correct, and if the future will be as bright and cheerful like it was before the goodbye was had. Nobody likes to say goodbye, but that's just a facet of life. But as my own Grandma says, one shouldn't say \"goodbye\" but rather \"see you soon.\" Becauseeven if one path ends, many new ones begin. Such is the case with Aria the Origination, a beautiful conclusion to a beautiful series.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nFor the final time, we enter the world of Aqua. And within, our gaze falls once more upon Akari, Aika, and Alice, who are still aspiring to be the Prima Undines they're destined to be.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, any talk of the Aria series needs to address the mood that it presents, since it not only does it head-and-shoulders above other anime but it also sets the overall tone of the series. Quite surprisingly, the show completely moves away from what it is \"known\" for, and that is a completely and wholly encompassing feeling of calm. Instead of a peaceful atmosphere, what Aria the Origination gives is analogous to a present. At first, it's surrounded by wrapping, ribbon, and boxes. But once opened, the gift inside brings an immense feeling of joy and elation. In other words, every episode of this season is veiled by sadness; what plays out is always a smidgen lower than neutral. But at just the right moments it -- like the OP aptly states -- spirals back, bringing the audience more happiness than it knows what to do with. This \"one step back, two steps forward\" approach works wonderfully, making the entire experience an emotional ride.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it should be. This isn't because it's the final season, but because what is shown is a culmination of everything that has taken place so far. After 45+ episodes, nearly every loose end is succinctly wrapped up, like the presents they were presented as being. We witness Aika and Al's love coalesce in a talk about attraction under a moonlit, nighttime sky; we experience Alice's legendary rank-skip from Pair to Prima; and we finally get to see Akari's ultimate dream become a reality. It isn't just an ending of the series that is hastily sewn together. There are still those tender moments of helping a vendor or visiting a previous Aria Company employee, all of which help to space out and smooth over the transition from one climactic moment to the next. But the whole package is a magnificent farewell that leaves the audience absolutely satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination, though, goes one step further. While it is a farewell, and as my introduction talks about, that doesn't mean it's the end. From the first episode, the foreshadowing was evident; the girls were going to become Primas, it was just a question of \"When?\" not \"If?\" That's what the first half of the season focused on, easing everyone into realizing that \"the time has come,\" and that the beginning of the end was at hand. The second half brought about those aforementioned high-points, while showing us a rather somber fact: everyone walks a separate path. Be it with family or friends, the same path cannot be walked forever. So \"see you soon\" is had, tears are shed, and sadness for a time follows. But the anime lets us know that even when that present is opened up, there's another one waiting on the horizon, bringing with it a brand new path to tread. And while it may not be exactly the same as before, those memories, those wonderful moments, will always be there, forevermore.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination sticks to its roots here, focusing on the backdrops, environments, and locales that the series is known for. More pillared buildings, more cramped canals, and more familiar sightings; it's a highlight of the show to see the nicely drawn art that composes Neo-Venezia. At the same time, Akari and the cast obtain much greater detail, especially so in their faces and their eyes. This is most likely due to the higher-than-normal amount of close-ups that are done in order to let the viewer immediately see a characters often smiling or crying expressions. And, of course, the funny-faces never leave, even leading up to the final scene.\\n\\n\r\nReiteration isn't favorable, but the character designs are as nice and relevant as they've always been. The girls' past-and-future Undine attire, their everyday garb, and the various townspeople all look the part once more.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters see improved detail, actual animation remains at or ever-so-slightly above-average. There is a lot more gondola riding this time around, as is slow-motion, over-lay segments, and other movements (running, kneeling, walking, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs the culmination of the story is had, so the characters find in their arcs and their respective developments.\\n\\n\r\nAlice had always been known to be the prodigy, the young girl whose talent and prowess of the gondola was unmatched. The first season got her out of her solitude, and the second matured her. Here, in the third, what Alice undergoes is self-realization. She discovers, with Alicia's helping hand, that some people do things differently, that not everyone learns and teaches the same. This for her, someone that has everything come extremely naturally, is an important lesson, because she's never had to endure harsh criticism or be beleaguered heavily. And upon learning to \"do what you love and love what you do\" at just the right moment, her transformation from Pair to Prima is complete, earning her the alias, \"Orange Princess.\"\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to Alice, Aika undergoes self-realization, partly without her knowing it. Her \"gondola\" block had always been self-esteem, but interestingly, that wasn't always the case. She learns from herself that hard-work and dedication truly do pay off, and that only you can make the best out of any given situation. She never had the skills of Alice or the personality of Akari, but being around them and Akira gave her the motivation to keep moving forward, no how good the people around her might be. Her newfound wisdom later helps her in a literal well of emotions, giving her romantic fulfillment alongside her \"Rosen Queen\" nickname.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the lovable Akari, she too continues the self-realization trend. As the focus and star of the series, she began as a young woman wanting to experience what Aqua had to offer, while aiming for that goal of Prima the entire time. And by the end, it's apparent just how much she's grown, not only as an Undine but as an adult, too. That is, she no longer is the one being helped; she is the one doing the helping. Simultaneously, she looks inward, finding that she was supported by her best friends, her mentors, and the people of Neo-Venezia ever since she first arrived at her new home. In a way (and getting sappy to honor her), Akari was a child, being mothered by Aqua and its inhabitants. She lived in the city, lived with the city, and eventually became the city, harboring all of its special, endearing, and heartfelt memories. In essence, Akari is the byproduct of every wonderful moment had throughout the whole of the Aria series, earning her the penultimate title, \"Aquamarine.\"\\n\\n\r\nAs with the two previous seasons, the show also manages to delve beyond the main girls and look toward their teachers: Alicia, Akira, and Athena. And what's given is quite intriguing; the Three Great Water Fairies are not so \"great\" after all. Of course, their abilities as Undines are still unquestionable, but they are no longer humanly infallible. Athena is deeply concerned with how people think of her, Akira isn't as confident as she lets on, and Alicia is slightly selfish in her actions. These developments don't take away from how kind and amazing they have been to their customers and to their respective apprentices. It simply \"brings them down\" to a more realistic level; that becoming a top-tier gondolier isn't so impossible after all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's what Aria the Origination leaves off with. Despite Akari, Aika, and Alice reaching the pinnacle of their craft, they really haven't. Akari gets distracted, Aika is still a crybaby, and Alice doesn't like being alone. Part of the journey they -- and the audience -- have had, through their own actions and their mentor's, is realizing that there is always room to grow. No matter what stage of life a person may be at, there are still experiences to be had, memories to be made, and new things to learn. One doesn't stop developing or learning at a specific point in time; rather, \"there is always room for improvement.\" A simple statement, but the series truly couldn't end on anything other than simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is of moderate pace, in comparison to much of what occurs throughout the story. Its low drums, ringing, and tame vocals actually create a track that isn't as powerful as it intends to be. On top of this, it doesn't \"feel\" like anything; it's not happy, sad, foreboding, creepy, or any other kind of emotion. It's just there.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED, on the other hand, fits nicely with the somewhat melancholic feeling of the show. The slow guitar duo and handful-of-notes piano is short, sweet, and to the point, getting across the notion that the season isn't all happiness and fun times to be had.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack this time around manages to hit \"all of the notes,\" as it were. The same memorable and nostalgic tracks permeate the show, but the lyric-heavy ones finally refrain from detracting from those incredible moments and instead elevate them one step further.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it goes without saying that the voice-acting remains well above-average. A special shout-out to Erino Hazuki as Akari for her \"Yay!\", Chiwa Saito as Aika for her \"Wha-?!\", and Ryou Hirohashi as Alice for her \"Mu-mu-mu!\"\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nEven with all the sadness around, the show still managed to make me laugh with its \"overused\" go-to's. The silly faces, President Maa attacking President Aria, and Akari and the gang's usual retorts and responses never ceased to make me smile. If anything, despite making it all the way through everything it threw my way, it was only getting funnier as time went on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in this season more than the others, I really wanted to know what was going to happen. Anticipating Akari's inevitable Prima exam, Al taking Aika's hand, and Alice acting frantically due to forced \"seclusion\" were instances that had me jumping from one episode to the next. I had to know where my favorite Undines ended up, and the ending that was given brought the closure necessary.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, while no outright crying was had, I was quite close on a few occasions. Specifically, Alice's Hope Hill graduation, Akari rounding the corner to see the Aria Company during her test, and Alicia and Akari parting ways caused many tears to well up in my eyes. I was even getting that lump-in-the-throat feeling while writing this, thinking about those various events unfolding again.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sequels, and sequels of sequels, Aria the Origination is one of the best. With a satisfying resolution to its story and characters, emotionally stirring moments, and a resounding soundtrack backing it all up, Akari, Aika, and Alice leave as Undines. But while they may leave on their own, separate adventures, I won't be forgetting the time I spent with them for a good while to come.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, a present-like mood, climactic moments, and new beginnings\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice art style, appropriate character designs, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Akari, Aika, and Alice reach their dreams, Alicia, Akira, and Athena are more human than let on, and everyone has room for improvement\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, great soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, laughing, engaging, and saddening, but wonderfully memorable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "\"The future always has a worried look on its face. So let's greet it with a smile, together.\" ~ Akari Mizunashi\r\nWhenever I begin to immerse myself in a piece of fiction, especially one of considerable length, there's always a nagging doubt in the back of my mind which only becomes more pronounced as I near its conclusion: will this be worth my time? Will there be a send-off that makes me feel that all the time spent in this world, with these characters, has been worthwhile?\r\nJudged on these terms, Aria is nothing less than a masterpiece. \r\nI'm reminded of the age-old journey vs. destination debate.Anytime a story has a weak conclusion or--as is the case in many slice of life series--a non-conclusion, we tell ourselves that it was all about the journey. It didn't matter how it ended, because the whole point was the daily scenarios and relationships that built up over the course of the series in the first place. Real life doesn't tend to be so kind as to provide neat little bows to rose-colored packages, after all, so we accept these bittersweet anticlimaxes and move on, our memories of that rapturous journey sullied only in the worst of cases. On the other hand, nobody is displeased with a satisfying destination, even if the path that leads there is fraught with potholes.  In the face of a breathtaking resolution, weaknesses become strengths; the moments we didn't like are forgotten, because the most recent memory, that of intense satisfaction, is what we'll take away from the experience and cherish.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, Aria is both the journey and the destination. This series presents a cast of lovable characters right away, lets them grow organically over the course of 50+ episodes, and sets them off toward new horizons with an ending that may reduce even the hardiest of men to tears. I'm not hardy in the least, so you can imagine what it did to me.\\n\\n\r\nLike most relationships that are lasting and worthwhile, Aria starts slow. It doesn't use cheap drama to gain the viewer's trust or stir unnecessary conflict just for the sake of it. It doesn't ask that we become enamored with its cast right away. Instead, it captures the heart by lulling it into a state of relaxation with its sublime aesthetic, offering glimpses of progression through tales that may seem cute or even trivial at first, but become something far more profound. By the end, the relaxation is gone, replaced gradually by bittersweet euphoria and an overwhelming resistance to say goodbye. All that's left to do when it's over is wonder how it happened. How did they create such a compelling story in a soothing, drama-free environment?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest pitfalls of episodic series is inconsistency. The more characters and situations we're introduced to, the more likely it is that we attain a preference for some and a disinterest in others. Aria avoids this trap both by developing its entire ensemble to the fullest and creating a world that feels unified and alive. On the first point, the way Aria handles its characters is flawless. Having only seen the first season, one could easily mistake the core cast as static or one-dimensional. Watching them slowly chip away and change one another over time is subtle but incredibly satisfying. No progress feels forced: for example, Akari and Aika help Alice come out of her shell, but she retains the childlike qualities that define her well past her transformation. In The Origination specifically, the relationship between each undine apprentice and her prima mentor becomes unbelievably rich and dynamic. Alicia's thoughtful gaze when watching Akari's growth communicates more than mere lines of dialogue ever could. The result is a collection of characters that feels less like a cast and more like real people with real desires and real problems.  \\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't stop there. Aqua, specifically the canals of Neo Venicia, becomes a character in its own right. Whether an episode pertains to Akari, Aika, Alice, or all of the above, Aqua's gentle guiding hand is always there in the form of the planet's breathtaking natural sights or a friendly but nameless acquaintance. Add in the enchanting background music, which takes the more emotional moments of the series to the next level, and we have a veritable utopia on our hands. That term \"utopia\" deserves a few words. In modern times, when the line between it and dystopia becomes blurrier every day and stories that highlight the worst in people are treated like gospel, Aria might seem quaint or downright anachronistic. But I believe that there's still value in stories like these. Aria is idealistic, and it knows it. There are traces of mental anguish and conflict all throughout its run, but they come from a place that believes joy and friendship will always vanquish in the end. Call it predictable, call it saccharine, but it has no less worth than a story where despair and hardship rule the day. It all comes down to execution, and in this regard, Aria surpasses 99% of the more \"realistic\" media out there.\\n\\n\r\nAria is idealism with purpose. It explores themes like the passage from one generation to the next, feelings of inadequacy and anxiety, and the competition that inevitably sprouts between even close friends when they have the same goal. And you can be sure that one character, usually Akari, will boil down every crisis into a beautiful sentiment that makes the tribulation instantly vanish. Such a seemingly simple format shouldn't work. It should be cheesy, repetitive, or any number of negative things, but it isn't. And that's the magic of Aria. \\n\\n\r\nIf The Animation and The Natural were the journey, Aria's final installment is the destination that made an already worthwhile story something truly special. Its glacial pace and drama-light story aren't for everyone, but if you're like me and Aria resonated with you on a personal level, The Origination's waning moments will prove to be a tidal wave of cathartic emotion the likes of which you'll never forget. Come prepared.",

            "content": "Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment and point out the fact that \"Origination\" is the last season of Aria, not the start. It frightens me that there are more total entries of \"Origination\" than \"Natural\" in people's lists. Even though Aria does not have a foundation story so skipping the first two seasons won't let you miss out on anything that would drastically impact the story, you don't get the full experience and development by doing so. I highly stress if you are planning to watch this to begin with \"Animation\", not \"Origination\", otherwise you'll be losing the special connection when theending comes.\\n\\n\r\n\"Origination\" is that season that just manages to stick to the original idea, but give more with it. Characters with more spotlight, new fresh music, and an ending with a bang. Though as our time at Neo-Venezia is ending, it's still there for everyone else to experience, and definitely something everyone should try. The episodes in \"Origination\" slowly build up more and more emotion as the series goes on, and eventually closes with an ending like no other. We're introduced to a past member, and how the company even came to be where it is now. The season will focus a lot more on what the past has brought to make up where we are now, and the moving forward of all the members to signify development.\\n\\n\r\nIt's note worthy that Aria has been sticking to its original story since the very first episode, so there isn't much of a change to describe in this aspect. \"Origination\", however, does offer much more back story to the characters giving them more meaning than ever before. This season does take the route of \"Animation\" rather than \"Natural\" of being more character based, and the opening episode shows it from the start. Since it's been a whole year without Aria since the ending of \"Natural\", the first episode is more of a reintroduction to the undines. From that point on we're watching the characters come to their peak of training, and them moving forward with their life. I'm not saying there isn't any scenery focusing episodes, but the episodes are mainly just acting as the character's final time with us.\\n\\n\r\nWhile experiencing the daily life of Neo-Venezia with Akari you'll see a lot more of the citizens around this season, even some unique jobs that we have yet to discover. One of the more notable ones is the traghetto gondola. It's another branch of a job that Undines can have, but this involves two rather than one to row the gondola. It requires more teamwork and balance all around, which in turn helps both of them to learn in a team environment, and also work on their gondola skills. Aside from this, we get a lot more views of the town square and more buildings that resemble some of our own Venice on Earth.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in \"Origination\" are generally the same, but each of them individually change over the course of our daily trips to Aqua. In \"Animation\" and \"Natural\" it would have seemed as if nothing was ever changing or occurring rather than the typical episodic adventures that were present, but knowledge and lessons taught to the characters from every place, every person, and every memory they obtained structure them to become who they are now. Don't worry about not having enough time to spend with any of them, every episode will focus on a different character, and even on the fairies. You won't need to fret about experiencing time with any of them, as they're given the same amount of time as one another. \\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \\n\r\n\"You alone are reason enough.\" - Akari Mizunashi\\n\\n\r\nAkari is the first character we were ever introduced to on our first trip to Neo-Venezia, and quite a bold character. She left Man-Home to become an Undine and her first mistake was learning to row backwards. She has come quite a long way on her training, and on her impact on the planet. Her purpose and spot in the story is like no other. She manages to help her friends get through tough times, and has qualities that are only unique to her. She's the expert of happiness, as one would say, and illuminates an aura around her like an effect only she can produce. While she may not be the most sharp and smartest of people, she definitely portrays change and development in character in a fashion that only she can produce.\\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \\n\r\n\"Things you don't have, you can just make.\" - Aika Granzchesta\\n\\n\r\nAika is a character that is flawed in many ways, but that's the best thing about her. Her personality and sense of what an Undine is, is heavily influenced by her adoration for Alicia. In \"Natural\", you learn that she is heavily striving to be something that isn't the real her, but after an event such as what she faced, she changed into someone new. Nothing about her changed to an extent of not being to even recognize her new self, but in way that she's more herself. Slowing down and looking at her own self rather than becoming a replica of someone she adores. Aika even influences her mentor in ways she wouldn't even imagine, her spot in Aria is much more than any other, and it wouldn't have been the same ride without her being there. \\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I am the best pupil of Siren, who is one of those fairies.\" - Alice Carroll\\n\\n\r\nAlice is one of the most realistic characters in this series without a doubt. Her attitude and personality is so much like a lot of people, and towards the end of the series she blossoms into a character like no other in this series. At the start of the series it was very apparent that she was very shy and cautious towards everyone except for her senpai Athena. Her skills gradually develop more and more as the series progresses and truly shows how much she improved in \"Origination\". Her confidence and ability to put herself out there dramatically improved, but for the better, and she still manages to retain her playful personality and sarcastic sense of humor. Alice is definitely the example of experience setting in and helping the character grow, while also having people there to help guide her in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \\n\r\n\"Because after all, I am an imperfect human being.\" - Alicia \"Snow White\" Florence\\n\\n\r\nAlicia has come a long way from the start of the anime. While it may not seem like she has even changed from the series, she's changed from how we perceive her. Rather than the typical kind and caring instructor, we're given more and more glimpses of her personality and thinking as the series goes on. There's even an episode in \"Origination\" focused on her teaching strategy, and thought process behind it. Seen as perfect and the ideal model on the outside, she is just as much human as the next person. It all plays into key for her method, while at the same time giving off the personality that calms the mood. In the past, we learn that Alicia is very much different from how she is now. Hinted in the OVA, we find out that she was hesitant in herself and her abilities, more or less similar to Akari. She goes past the typical senpai trope, and is actually given a story,  and an ending that will definitely make a memory that stick with you for a long time.\\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \\n\r\n\"I'll become a prodigy.\" - Akira \"Crimson Rose\" Ferrari\\n\\n\r\nAkira is shown to be the more prominent of the three fairies, but we don't really get a glimpse of her back story or true personality until \"Origination\", and it does a hell of a good job just showing what she went through. If you've noticed that Alicia is a genius in gondola rowing, as she was the first to become a prima of the three, and kept on the legacy that Grandma left with Aria. Then, that Athena is gifted in singing, what is Akira gifted in? There's an episode spent with a feeling of confusion going on in Aika's life, but Akira shares a story from her past that really gave her character more meaning than it ever could. Akira is the prime example of not having any \"special\" quality that is just naturally given to her, but more so hard work paying off. She was the last of the three to become an undine, and her dilemma was shown realistically. She's not there just to show face, but there to give support to the up and coming Himeya owner.\\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \\n\r\n\"Because I always make stupid mistakes, I always cause trouble for you, right Alice-chan? Because of what happened this morning, I thought you really hated me. It made me feel very insecure.\" - Athena \"Siren\" Glory\\n\\n\r\nThe last Fairy, and possibly the best, is Athena. Her character throughout the anime seemed more like a comedy relief to just add more to the seemingly easy going instructor Alice, and tyrant personality mentor Akira. Her character is explored as more time passes and we learn that overall, each and everyone of the fairies are just like any other person, same with Athena. She's insecure about the people who she treasures most, and the person she sees as family. Her influence onto Alice is very strong as you'll see their bond deepen as our journey comes to a close in Aqua and their story finishes off. No one person is perfect with every great quality given to them, and Athena's character just shows that up front. The message you take from her purpose in the story can be however you want to interpret it as, but she was definitely more than the clumsy character that is in a lot of anime today.\\n\\n\r\n\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f\u273f \\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime has always been the same, and there's nothing wrong with that at all. The same soundtracks seem to never get old and fit every scene possible. Even the new opening and ending are just as wonderful as the last. You'll notice that the ending this season isn't as mellow as the last, but it's more trying to show the change from the very start of the series to the point of where it is now. The insert songs in the episodes that they appear in are just as great as any of the opening and endings. They provide another level of emotion for the respective scene that they play in, and just all around makes the experience better. The animation itself is a lot more fluid and flows from scene to scene, a lot better than the \"Animation\" season, but still retains its calming art style. The colors are beautifully chosen to show the hidden beauty in the town, and the sky beautiful. Just the sunset combined with the architecture that makes a view that is awe inspiring without being there.\\n\\n\r\nAria has definitely been a ride of emotions for me. It quickly became one of the best slice of life for me due to its relaxing atmosphere and calm pace that anyone can enjoy by just watching one or two episodes per day. The closure for this was better than anything I could have asked for, and it retained its theme from the very start not straying away and becoming something else. Even as the pace fastens and characters change, they still are the same characters that we began to know and love. While our time with Aria is done, the legacy left behind will forever carry on in Undine history. Aria will always have a special place in my heart, so why not try it out for yourself too?\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nAlmost 10 years after the airing of Aria The Origination, I still could not find any other anime that comes closer to heart. Beyond a review, let me express my gratitude towards a series I would call the best, and my favorite anime.\r\nI started watching anime since 2009, it was a time where most of the legendary shows were out. Anime has always been my way of life to lose my mind, to find and appreciate creativity, and in recent years more of a place to learn Japanese. Outstanding shows give me inspiration, they fill me with awe. Slice of life showshave always been my favorite, because they resonate with my own nature. Aria is, Aria. It is something I can watch over and over again because it is exactly that particular element that satisfy me, the sweet spot. 8 years of being a fan of anime has taught me to see beyond the extravagance and art, because anime, like all other types of shows, is not meant to be lauded with praise, but to be duly appreciated by time commitment and passion. I will tell you why this is the show for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nWhat other show can one find young maidens standing on gondolas gliding through still waters on a distant planet as professional transporters? Animation is always modest, pretty thematic as it also carries your gaze away to a holiday destination. The colors are always self-sufficient, never any strain to the eyes. Oh, eyes, and their gazes, they are timeless and classic. Like still life painting, they relax your eyes while exhibiting emotion which could tell you as much emotion as real human eyes do. They tell so much, by not shedding tears, but by innocence and vibrancy. While there is an apparent step up when we go from season to season, simplicity on their part enables your own interpretation and further refinement through your own senses. No need for fluid motions, just strike the right pose and basic demeanor and let sound do the further elaboration. Exceptions would be the cat mascots, president Aria initially appears to me as some weird creature that does anything other than what cats do. I do not complain as their simple designs aid towards simplistic relief during scenes where rich emotions are in place. I could not say that the background and environment is stunning, and since I have only been to Japan and not Venice, I could not really tell how proper are they drawn and painted. I would say that the natural portrayal of Neo Venezia could pass a genuineness test all by itself should it be referenced from a true country. It appeared to me as a planet or country that is neither wealthy nor in poverty, but in an ideal financial and social state, perhaps large on the tourism side. Floating airships, and carefully positioned dual moons, cramped waterways, open air cafes, as well as downward facing views from the top of buildings are ways Aria displays its space and atmosphere. Truly a relaxing feeling for anyone living in cities. I would highlight that it is due to non-movement or little movement of characters it what makes Aria subtle, true to its genre, it is a bold move to convince viewers that saving costs is merely incidental letting pauses in animation do the real talking.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nRather than a simple perfect blanket label, I will tell you how sound in the series affects me. Hiyashi, meaning healing in Japanese, is the appropriate word that suits all occasions in Aria. Yoga for the soul, I would call it. While the sound may be more masterful in Origination, my preference lies in Natural. I am a person influenced more by emotions rather than art or sound. The magical part about Aria is that I cannot differentiate between those three elements. They always seem to move as one emotion, one which you could do no more than to let it slide, without praise or complaint. Ever thought of spacing out to daydream in an environment without prejudice? Perhaps it is the way pianos are played in the soundtrack, maybe it is my lack of sleep and introvert needs which made me imagine how the crisp and clear, solidly subtle background music which enables me peace of mind, carried to a land unknown. The musician that needs no applause. It is not sophistication, it is sublimation of senses. Quaint, as if teary moments are just beyond the wall behind speakers where the music sounded. Most of the music in Aria are no more than simple piano and chamber music or a combination of them. I believe this is what the series essentially monopolize. There is no room for more, the piano which bridges conversations, and violins which pan the scenery, not to mention the impeccable timing of their execution. I would say at this point, it is a sense of sincerity that I felt there, nothing more, nothing less. On the other hand, sometimes voice acting can be a little raw to taste. It is because they are in Japanese and not English? Nevertheless, they do not stand out, yet pleasant enough to glide through the scenes. Dialogues open a splendid dimension of depth of meaning, when said in Japanese. In lighter scenes, Aika\u2019s \u201cno embarrassing words allowed\u201d rings a sense nostalgia, towards a time where my worries were less; in more affectionate scenes, I find their timbre is almost ephemeral, to the point where I completely surrender my conscience to the occasion; in bittersweet, endearing moments, I find enlightenment seeped into melodious bubbles. The point is, there is no use separating music and voice because of how well they appeal to my palette. Cellos, yes, towards the end of Natural, where Ai chan makes a surprise appearance at the pier, time froze where I sat. The serenades of guitars imitate the sense of a hometown I never had. Ebullient sentimental waltzes that makes any corner of the city a romance in time. In Origination, when Aika and Al kun are inside a well, that silence, how stellar how so much was conveyed without the two saying much. And the best of all, the song called ARIA, in Animation, where the three main girls float on water in some ruins. They starkly remind me of precious time spent at sandy beaches back in the old days.  A heavenly feeling, while still retaining all senses of humanity, is how I would soundly rest the case.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nI always wanted to mention that most of the girls\u2019 names begin with the letter A. Perhaps that is where they get their A+ development. Akari serves as a self-sufficient narrator in her mails between Ai chan. For someone who comes from another planet, she doubles as a guide and our representative to explore the world of Aqua since day one. The reason behind such splendid character development in the third season is thanks to the buildup from the first season, and micro development over the episodes leads to their full development ever so unnoticed. Despite being a slice of life, I really felt the development of both generations of undines come at me with a surprise. Since it took me on and off three years to properly appreciate the series which I only watched during special occasions, at the same time the painful feeling of my own personal character development unbeknownst to me all the while. It felt like reading a meta-diary, the girls\u2019 personalities, although remained largely the same as they were from the start, show magnificent departures and improvement in both technical and social aspects of their lives. From our perspectives, it may appear that we are guests to the world of Aqua and that we spectate their livelihoods and wonders, but the show portrays their seemingly idealistically carefree days much the same as what goes on on our side of reality. They address challenges, sort out their own emotions, live through the pain and sorrow of many of the usual rituals of life. As with any long running show, the connections between main and side characters expand into a network, and this is remarkably captured in Akari\u2019s social circle. How supportive are they for one another, how differently they end up treating each other, are the visible harvest resultant of their interaction. And as a viewer, my benefit is to relate this mark of achievement to myself. It is not just friendship that is being considered here, it is fondness, especially towards inanimate objects like Akari\u2019s old gondola, and social settings like retiring seniors and a change in life circumstances like primahood. If only we can go to bed every night summarizing the day as strangely forgiving and mature as Akari, would our lives be Aria? In the supernatural occurrences that are in Natural, they personify unexplained life events that we seek to understand but never have the time nor the heart to explore further. In Animation, we are presented with quirky and marvelous parts of Aqua where the details are explained so vaguely that we have no choice but to turn our minds off and instead shift focus to savoring what we can out of the phenomena regardless of them being healthy or not. To the characters, they are reflections of us too, who continue to mind their days regardless of which. I will further elaborate this in the most interesting part of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nAll series of Aria get full score from me. Except for Avvenire to which I will watch in the future. This trilogy deserve equal attention due to the different aspect which they address. I wholly agree to the pattern set out by other reviewers here, and would like to offer my personal opinion on how it personally appeals to me.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation\\n\r\nAnother fascination I find in anime is how I appreciate intentional ambiguity in their general plot. Distinct from incomplete plot design, how a show hides something they are yearning to tell is a treasure I find in anime. Whether intentional or by accident, the seemingly wacky start to the first season sets of the bell of genuine mystery to me. This is like an entr\u00e9e, where they feed you samples of what is life on a gondola. As I said before, the homey feeling is the best force at play.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Natural\\n\r\nIn my honest view, this is the best season Aria has to offer. Not because they are confusing me like the first season, and not because how they properly end the story in the final season. How they unconsciously trigger emotional responses from me by how they animate life in a make believe Venice where the medium of conversation is Japanese steeped in Italian culture, how magic and all things weird comes altogether unexplained, is a signal to numb the explanation demanding part of your mind, and to instead be aware of your real surroundings, and to put your focus to what matters to you. These simple things hit me hard and I am ashamed of how I view life till this point, and still brings back the shame every time it hits me because I too, never change, so quickly. Really, the show makes you cry from the inside. How it does it, I do not suppose I need to know. I cannot find an element here which I cannot agree with, as the show actively reminds us of what it means to lead a life, naturally.\\n\\n\r\nAria the OVA: Arietta\\n\r\nIt means little Aria in Italian. But this is the crowning glory of the Aria series. I mean by the theme song. It is the point in time where Akari reaches the peak of her wonder and realize what will eventually come to her in her career in Aria Company. Yes, she perceives change, and changes that will hurt. The way they hold the private conversation between her and Alicia in a sunset clock tower marks the twilight of the series before the actual magic part comes in. This is my most sentimental moment with the series, directly after the events of Natural.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination\\n\r\nFor a long time, I find myself repeatedly watching the last few episodes before I decide to roll in the final two to a closure. This season is more delicately done that fine porcelain. Each episode ends up being a parable that vibrates some episode from the previous seasons. However, if one were to judge this season while adjusting the base to where Natural left off, it stands together with the previous two. This final season puts its resources heavily on the character development side, all the while keeping all other things as solid as a brick, amplifying the music part. It froze on exploring the world, or anything that is unnatural besides what matters to the characters. See the buildup? It is one spotlight to the other. True to my own life, pretty much the exact thing happens. Once we put down our books in school, we do not get academically smarter. And it does not seem that our stamina will continue to rise while we go off to work in an office day and night. Who really spends more time with their hobbies and friends after they decide to raise a happy family? Do many of us still find the strength to embark on new ventures once we retire? Life suddenly becomes more precious than gold, rarer than relationships, scarcer than time. It is what originates our consciousness, and what we bid farewell to in search of other interesting things. Suddenly, I felt at a complete loss.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nYou see, my enjoyment of Aria is no doubt derived and derived more. It is something that brings out another version of me, whom I subconsciously acknowledge to be a better version of me that I should begin to cherish more. But also, there is one truth in which the show highlights that can completely shatter one that is so vulnerable at heart. Nothing lasts forever. Yes, even my philosophy engraved within these pixels, or the digital records that contains Aria. Memories of its music will probably never linger on more than a couple of more decades. Ultimately, I find that this enjoyment is just plain realization of a profound value that I have long lost touch with, and that is the extent of what essentially Aria does to me. Anime wise, it is a pleasure. A privilege to which I owe it to my choice of watching the series. In the end, it is still my best anime to date, and no other shows can rival the recreation and satisfaction of watching this series. My favorite character of the series, Mizunashi Akari. She is purity in a world as dazzling as the stars. Oh, all OP and ED of the three seasons including the OVA are splendid. The best being the second ED of Natural. All OP deserve credit for their fading in to every episode as well as different animation for each. Sometimes the chibi moments can appear mood breaking, but this is made up by properly animated scenes that count. The music, I will listen for life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI have said all that I wanted to, and will leave further interpretation of the Aria series to another viewers that will certainly come to appreciate it in a different light. Accordingly, I warmly welcome any discussion relating to the one series I regard closest to heart. May your days be happy, and thank you for a wonderful time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom someone who wants to be known as Miku, but also has a secret motive in life.\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: This review covers the entire Aria franchise (except manga), including the TV series, OVA, side stories, etc. No spoilers. My opinions only.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"Wonderful\"\r\nThat is what I would say if I could describe Aria in one word.\r\nI first found out about this series while meandering through the Top Anime page on MAL here. \"Hmm, look at that. Aria? Ranked #14. Right by Mushishi and Death Note. 15k members. Guess I'll check it out.\" I'm so glad I did. \r\nI'm surprised at how little discussion there is for this series. Maybe it's like Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Hajime no Ippo wherein people who have completedthe series know that it's simply amazing and having nothing more to say. Well, I disagree with that ideology and think that there is much to say. I wish people would spread the word about this magnificent thing...\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, one of the best things about Aria is that every single episode contains two key elements: 1) PLOT PROGRESSION and 2) CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Honestly, this surprised me at first for how consistently good it was since it has been such a long time I've seen a series do that. It's one of the reasons why I put Aria on my profile as the second of my \"Favorite Anime\" series; right alongside Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing is that Aria keeps getting smoothly and consistently better as you keep watching. If I could use a metaphor: the first series (and the one you should start with), Aria the Animation is a cupcake with delicate frosting and a lovely lit candle in the center. It's such a treat. Aria the Natural is a birthday cake, maybe with some strawberries in the middle. It's a celebration. Aria the Origination is a full blown wedding cake. It's a momentous, life-changing event. I hope you feel the same way.\\n\\n\r\nFun fact: Aria is the highest-ranked G-rated series. That's right; you don't need blood, tits, and coarse language to make an awesome show.\\n\\n\r\n~Feedback is appreciated, blah blah blah... enough text already.",

            "content": "-Eternal Tranquility. The discovery of a new definition of happiness.\r\nThis is how I would best describe \"Aria the Origination\", an amazingly beautiful and extremely heartwarming show that I could not stop smiling at. The emotions and happiness that you will feel from inside of you while watching this are real and everlasting. Without further or due, here is my spoiler-free review. \r\n(Note: In order to have a fully-engrossing experience of this show, watching the first two seasons is very crucial.)\r\n(Note #2: This also my first review so please feel free to give me feedback on how I did and what you thought of it.)\r\nThe storyof \"Aria the Origination\" takes place after the events of the second season, \"Aria the Natural\", and continues to follow the life of Akari Mizunashi and her friends: Aika and Alice. Unlike the first two seasons, which served as a welcoming to Neo-Venezia and the adventures that Akari and and company undergo, Origination acts as more of a personal story about the goals that our heroines have been striving for throughout the show. Being that this is the last season of the series, the Origination delivers a conclusion that looks back on the previous seasons and allows us to reflect on how much our protagonists have changed ever since the very beginning. The story in Origination excellently captures the struggles and achievements that Akari and the others experience, making this a very believable and special viewing. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is noticeably different about \"Aria the Origination\" is its tone. In the previous two stories, the tone of the two seasons is expressed as being very happy and having a \"no-worries\" type of feeling. In the Origination, the tone, while still remaining relaxing and happy, actually becomes substantially more mature. This is because of the fact that the final season deals with the themes of reaching one's goals, and most importantly, \"change\". Because of these themes, the tone of the show becomes subtly dramatic, yet does great job at keeping the signature feeling of the series, which is a focus on relaxation and harmony. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a much bigger focus on character development that you will find within the final season. I loved the development that each and every character went through in this season. This is because of the fact that the entire cast of characters realized who they are and what type of person they have now been shaped into. Without spoiling anything, I will say that many revelations of the characters are revealed to the viewer, allowing us to have much more of a connection with the characters and an understanding as for why each character is so different from one another, and what each of their personal goals are. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the art and soundtrack, I immediately fell in love with both of them. The art of this season made feel as though I was seduced into the wonderful and tranquil world of Aqua or as if I was riding a gondola. I really loved how colorful and bright the art was for this time around, making the viewing experience very memorable and lively. And the soundtrack, oh man that soundtrack! I cannot express how many emotions I felt listening to the sublime and elevating music of this show. You will not be disappointed by how heavenly and peaceful the music is for this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Aria the Origination\" was one of the most satisfying conclusions to any anime that I have seen. After viewing the first two seasons of the Aria series, you will find that the Origination is something else entirely and is extremely special, while at the same time acting as more of the same, wonderful adventures of the protagonist, Akari, and her friends. Saying that I enjoyed this conclusion is really an understatement because of how much of a true gem this anime is. Those of you who have watched the first two seasons will undoubtedly find that \"Aria the Origination\" is the most fitting conclusion that this series could ever have. Farewell Neo-Venezia. It was a wonderful experience! \\n",

            "content": "My word...\r\nStraight off the trail of re-watching (for the third time) the classic Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood series; an anime with a brilliantly told story and perfect ending to boot, I was left in nothing short of a dilemma.\r\nI had hit the 'Anime Void' where I finish an anime so great that I needed a few days to let it soak in. \r\nDuring this time, a friend recommended to me that I watch a 'calming', 'relaxing' and 'masterfully crafted' slice-of-life anime that goes simply by the name 'ARIA'. \r\nWhat was so special about it? Why this heavily unacknowledged show out of all of the anime inits genre? Well, that's what I'm about to share with you guys; and as a personal apology for not writing any reviews in what feels like two years, I will be reviewing not only one season, but the entire story; comprised of three seasons (Animation, Natural and Origination respectively) as well as the Arietta OVA.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nRoughly 160 years from the present humans have emigrated and colonised the now entirely aquatic Mars (known simply as 'Aqua' in the series). Here, a small, tranquil town called Neo-Venezia - a 1:1 replica of Earth's 'Venice' - snugly embraces the daily lives of people who want to make the world a better place simply by playing their small part.\\n\r\nWithin Neo-Venezia are three Gondola companies; Orange Planet, Himeya, and the presumably smallest, newest company - Aria.\\n\r\nEach story is completely episodic, following the lives of Undines-in-training Akari Mizunashi, Alice Carroll and Aiko Granzchesta as they begin to understand what it takes to become a full-fledged Undine like their three mentors - whilst also learning just how beautiful the world around them is if they look at things in a different light.\\n\r\nWhilst episodic in nature, I feel that each occurrence in every episode stands to grow the characters that little bit more, and help you get attached to them piece by piece. We all know how annoying it is when a character feels shoe-horned in, or when something sad happens to a character that wasn't developed well enough. I'm delighted to announce that, that isn't the case for Aria. Every episode succeeded in it's job of healing me after a long day, making me relaxed and whatnot, whilst also VERY slowly immersing me deeper and deeper into the world they were trying to create.\\n\r\nEven though any semblance of an overarching story doesn't become apparent until the third season, the stand-alone stories (and occasionally, minor arcs of 2-4 episodes) are just as impactful as arcs that take 12-50 episodes to tell in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI believe there was a 3 year time period between the beginning and 'finale' of the show's run; and it certainly shows just how companies don't necessarily get it right but build on the positives and fix the negatives. \\n\r\nWith the first season airing in 2005, it had the similar art style to many shows coming out in that pre-07 era, and let me tell you, the early-mid 2000's wasn't a good time for character designs.\\n\r\nThe design isn't an issue to some, but for some reason the way Alice's eyes were drawn reminded me of the shaded, faux-realistic faces from Bible Black, and that is NOT a comparison I will ever want to make again *eats soap*.\\n\r\nAs time progressed though, it fixed itself, either they changed the character designs or improved the backgrounds to the point where I just stopped caring. The scenery is permanently tranquil, filled with thick yellows, shimmering blues and vibrant reds during Autumn, Spring and Summer, but solely capitalized on the simplicity of white during Winter. At no point was I ever not at peace looking at the visuals. I'm no animator, either, but I really like how they animated the water. In this anime, the water is something they flat-out needed to get right; a nice thin CG wave texture covering the foreground to add shimmer and glow to each scene.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThough not fluent in Japanese, I was impressed with how the VAs managed to keep a relaxing vibe even during the semi-dramatic scenes.\\n\r\nThe music, however, is what made this show what it is. A combination of Yui Makino's soft voice for most-if-not-all of the opening songs, partnered with the studio's thematic choice of European-inspired instruments and melodies served to really immerse you in this peaceful world.\\n\r\nIf one thing in the sound department deserves any kind of special praise, though, its Eri Kawai's composition of the song 'Barcarolle'. This song serves as the music sung by the character 'Athena Glory' - a character praised for her singing ability - so they needed to get it right, and they did. I'm not sure if it was sung by Kawai-san or Kawakami-san (Athena's VA), but either way, they did an outstanding job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is a section that I really could go on forever, but i'll try to keep it neat for you guys' sake. Each of the 9 main characters that are explored in the show - barring one - are given the perfect amount of screen time to develop their character. Now obviously the main focus goes to Akari, Aiko and Alice, as they are the characters who still need to develop in their journey to become a 'Prima' - essentially the top 'rank' most people can accomplish in the Gondola business. Though that's not to say that there isn't a rich cast of, I guess 'side' characters that this show has to offer. The mentors Alicia Florence, Akira E. Ferrari and Athena Glory are seen as the best of the best in the industry, critically acclaimed and universally dubbed as 'The Three Great Water Fairies', so naturally they also need to not only be shown to be special at what they do, but they also need to be shown as human. They need to be shown as characters that might have had a rough time growing up, or becoming a Prima. Akira's back story in particular is especially heart-wrenching but equally beautiful as we find out her emotional struggle to accept the fact she doesn't have Alicia's grace or Athena's iconic singing talent, and how much extra hard work she put in to still stand side-by-side with them.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Athena never gets much screen time until the third season, which is a shame, because I think that her clumsiness, as well as how she tutors Alice could have been explored in place of some one-off, less interesting episodes.\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, though, there ARE male characters in the show, but only two of note; Akatsuki, the self-proclaimed 'Protector' of Aqua, and Al, the love-interest of one of the Undines and a Gnome; the name given to people who work underground to make sure the gravity is stable (it never really goes into detail).\\n\r\nFinally there is the character 'Grandma', the founder of Aria Company and sweetest woman known to man - both in fiction and reality. She is seen as the pinnacle of what an Undine is, and respected by damn near everyone in the town; her story is delved into I believe in the third season, and it ties in nicely to the inevitable conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n10 out of 10, no qualms, no buts. It's the closest to perfect I think an anime can get. After finishing the first season, I was hooked, but I was never even considering it to come anywhere near my Top 10, never mind my Top 5. As soon as the second season finished, it was toe-to-toe with my then favourite anime of all time, Maison Ikkoku. And when I finally said goodbye to them at the end of the third season, tears fell, but it's place in my hear risen.\\n\r\nNever before have I been so attached to a fictional world, never have I actually not wanted a show to end, never have I cried at an anime. It was a first for me in a lot of departments.\\n\r\nAs cheesy as some of Akari's lines may be at times, it really is as beautiful as she says it is, it taught me a lot of morals, but if any moral was to be delivered to me harder than the others, it's the final one of the show; people may leave you, they may not come back, but as soon as your eyes open of a morning, the day needs to be welcomed with a warm smile.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had ANY problem with the show AT. ALL. it's the ending.\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, 99.9% of the ending was perfection, the last two tear-jerking episodes were as beautiful emotionally as they were visually and the song 'Yokogao' placed in JUST the right moment saw enough tears to fall from my eyes to replicate Neo-Venezia ten times over.\\n\r\nI just can't shrug off that 0.1% though. Without giving spoilers (and people who have already seen the show may know what I'm talking about) but towards the end, Alicia announces two things to Akari at the end of the episode. One of these things is adapted on and makes for a beautiful finale, but the other feels shoe-horned in to create more 'drama' I guess. There was no resolution, and to be honest, if it wasn't there at all it wouldn't have changed a thing, if it was explained I would be okay, but it wasn't, so I'm mad! (I'm not).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nJust watch it.\\n\r\nAria is a tough sell to almost any anime fan nowadays;\\n\r\n\"Hey you should watch Aria.\"\\n\r\n\"Well, what's it about?\"\\n\r\n\"Like... Boats n' stuff...\"\\n\r\n\"I'll pass.\"\\n\r\nIs normally the gist of how it goes, but if you can find the time to give this underappreciated masterpiece a chance, I'm positive that, even if you find it 'slow' or 'boring', it can at least make you feel better for the period of time you watch it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'd also like to give a special mention to Athena's VA, Tomoko Kawakami, you did a beautiful job and I wouldn't have chosen anyone else for the role. May you rest in peace.",

            "content": "All good things must come to an end.  it's an inevitable fact of life that no matter what happens, the world that we know must eventually change and morph into one that even we ourselves don't believe regardless of the fact that we're living it.  It is here where the final act of the main Aria series comes into play, giving us one last throwback to the gentle story of gondole.  (Yes, that is the plural word for gondola.)\r\nStory: Much like it previous two seasons, Aria the Animation and Aria the Natural, Aria the Origination puts us, the audience, back onto theworld of Aqua and into the city of Neo-Venezia where we once again meet Akari and the rest of her friends whose names also start with the letter A (with a few exceptions) and continue along with their daily lives to become Prima Undines.  \\n\\n\r\nEven with the basic setting and the style of storytelling staying relatively the same, Aria the Origination actually differs quite a lot with the previous two seasons of the series.  Putting aside Animation's casual day to day storytelling, as well as Natural's more \"mystical\" feel, Origination puts the series towards the idea of goals and achieving the original plot point of the series, which is for our title character, Akari, to achieve the status of Prima Undine, the highest status that an Undine could ever achieve.  With this, the season feels a lot different tone-wise as it did in previous iterations of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned before, the series puts a lot of emphasis on the girls' goals and the accomplishment of those goals.  The progress of the show feels a lot different because of this tone shift and as a result of this, gives the characters we see a little more of depth to their already relatively well-rounded attributes.  Alice, Akari, and Aika all progress through this season with additional traits to their personalities and development, as well as their respective senpais Athena, Alicia, and Akira who gain quite a few as well.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only issues I find with the story is the fact that the latter half of the series experiences some pacing problems.  The final accomplishments that the three main characters finally get don't feel as climactic as what I anticipated.  Putting my opinion aside, it just didn't look like it was all that grand.  Granted, this is coming from a series that in and of itself doesn't have many over the top moments, if any, but personally, I would've liked to see those moments where the girls finally get what they want be a little more...splendid, I guess is one way to put it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Origination as the third iteration of the main Aria series in animated format, ties up the series in a very, very, very nice manner.  There's honestly not much to say about the series textually because it is basically the same series as it's always been.  Is that a bad thing?  Of course not.  In fact, it's better because, since the show is so much more focused, the previous rule where I stated to only watch a few episodes at once for risk of getting bored, is shattered because of the way the story is told in this final cor of the series.  They connect a lot of what happened in the entirety of the Aria series together and really bring about a spectacular end to the series.  Because when one chapter of life ends, a new one always begins.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Same basic storyline (Deviating from the base story is a bad thing)\\n\r\n+ Further character development \\n\r\n+ Fantastic ending\\n\r\n-  Some pacing issues (yes, there is something wrong with the Aria series)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The cast for the Aria series hasn't really changed at all since the start of Animation, and all the way up to Origination, has seen at most a couple new characters to the series even though they're minor by comparison to the established few at the start.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as changes go from Natural to Origination, the show puts basically all of the other characters aside from our main three, Akari, Alice, and Aika in the backseat, with Akari taking the brunt of the screentime since she is the supposed main character of the entire series.  Because of the series giving these three the spotlight to shine in, these three girls are given more time to establish themselves and because Origination deals with the prospect of moving on to the next chapter of life, shows us the progressive change that these three deal with as the paths that the float down drift ever so slightly away from one another.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for new introductions to the series, Origination brings in different perspectives of life via different girls from other companies, as well as a few others like an old Aria company member.  Complimenting the theme of change and goals in life that Origination cements itself into, these new characters create several episodes where the show brings new perspectives of life progression, adding into the overall feel of the show and as a result, add to it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only real downside I can see of this cast is the disappearance or lack of screentime for certain characters.  Al, Woody, and Akatsuki, the three established male characters in the show, don't really get much screentime as they did before, essentially disappearing for most of the entire 13 episode run and only coming into the frame just a few times to remind you, \"Hey, we exist.\"  It's a bit of a shame considering the show is honestly not the same without them.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Focused development on main characters\\n\r\n+ Decent new introductions in cast\\n\r\n-  Old cast members sort of faded away\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for Aria is the same as it always has been, just with a bit of a more quality look to it.  Being made in the late 2000's, Origination doesn't possess the same kind of color or shine that the shows 2010 forward have, but because Aria has that simple charm to its animation, there really is nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the show is only heightened with the gradual age of the series, and from Animation, you can see some slight changes in its art style and quality that make it look nice.  The characters still look the same, the backgrounds are nice with wonderful detail, and the whole atmosphere of the series is just calm and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, just to drive the series home, Origination brings back the comical part of the series that I've dubbed \"second faces\".  Much like the other two seasons, every character in the show has a less detailed, more comedy-related facial expression that persists throughout the whole series.  It's a signature styling that the series has that to me, makes the show's comedy unique in that sense, since every character has their own unique facial expression and it really adds to the characters' personalities themselves.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Nice, simple artwork  (Iconic too, at this point.)\\n\r\n+  Second faces make their return!\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for Aria has always been a very calming and peaceful styling of music that reflects the peacefulness that the series exudes.  Like its predecessors, the OP of the series, \"Spirale\", is very similar to the other two openings of the series, \"Undine\" and \"Euphoria\", giving off a very nice and peaceful start to the series which immediately tells the viewer that you are in for a wonderful and peaceful ride.  \\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the ED, \"Kin no Nami Sen no Nami\", is a very different styling of music for the ending song of Aria.  It doesn't create the peaceful and gentle sounds of ripples in a pond like its predecessors \"Rainbow\" or \"Natsumachi\" make.  Instead, Origination goes for a more tidal wave kind of sound that to me, really doesn't fit.  It's not peaceful, but sounds more like yearning, and it doesn't feel like a good song for the Aria.  It's good, but to me, it's not a good fit for the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, all of the background tracks of the series make their return.  Memorizing their tunes isn't an easy feat, as they're nothing like the main songs of the series, but when you hear them, you'll know them.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good new tracks\\n\r\n+ Old tracks make their triumphant return\\n\r\n-  New ED doesn't...really fit with the series  (Doesn't feel like Aria IMO)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: When I first learned about the Aria series, all I heard about it were praises that it was one of the best slice of life animes, that it had a simple story that was so beautiful and elegant that it was one of the best experiences anyone who watches anime could experience.  And so, after watching every part of the main Aria series with Avverine on the way at the time of this review, I can safely say that those sings of praises for Aria were definitely well earned.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nThere is no reason why I say I didn't like this series.  (Ok, maybe 1 or 2, but I'll get to those later.)  Origination brought this wonderful series to an end, a conclusion that is admittedly one that I prayed for to never end.  It really tied up what we knew about the Aria series and brought everything to a gentle end. My favorite part was the fact that the show brought up a lot of things that the series did before, a lot of old plot points and characters in order to show us the journey that we were on, and how far we've come.  It really brought the idea that we should enjoy every little moment of life and showed how precious every second that we have really could be.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nIt ended.  To be fair, this is the only real complaint because any other issues can be ignored by the sheer beauty of this series.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nYES.  If you haven't watched the Aria series period, go and watch it now.  (Start with Animation, of course.)  If I haven't driven the point how great and revered this series is, then I'll say it again.  This is a series that everyone should watch.  It's peacefulness and calming nature is only one aspect of this show.  It presents us the progression of life and how we should treasure every moment we have, how important the people around us are, and that the future is always something filled with new experiences and journeys to embark upon.",

I am not a fan of Aria series. The recommendation came from a top list. Aria the Animation reviews are probably better.\r\nCats very ugly. Show is all about the slice of life without even comedy thrown in. There are more exciting types of work. Lots a cuteness though. Seems to be the main focus in fact. That and ppl being nice to each other.  And how awesome they are. Infactthe slice of life isn't the problem. Nice ppl being nice to each other, being cute, and talking about their cute soft sensitive feelings with all the challenge of walking up a small hill. that is all that ever happens in this show. Any challenge to them seems entirely un-serious. Their support of each other is the same redundant pointless stuff. The psychology of their feelings makes no sense to me.\\n\\n\r\nThey love their gondola. The main character is auto awesome. Are those supposed to be guys?",

Just this once i don't want to guess how the story would end. I let myself drown in the last piece of Aria puzzle of relax, and i was happy that i let myself drown.\r\nThe Origination is the third part of manga adaptation which titled Aria too, and the Origination is one of the most conclusive last piece i've ever seen in my life as an entertainment enthusiast. Another most conclusive part is Lord of the Rings:Return of the King.\\n\\n\r\nThe story develops more in the daily life of Mizunashi Akari reaching her dream becoming an Undine. \\n\r\nI suggest you who wanna watch Origination watch the Animation and Natural firstly, because Animation & Natural give a very strong story and emotional foundation to Origination.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation is not going to be questioned, superb as usual, as the sound is. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's more developed here is the characterization, you'll see more emotion in Origination, more past revealed, and that gives you a warm feeling that the world is filled with wonderful things. \\n\\n\r\nSeemed naive maybe, but i enjoy the conclusion of the series the most, it gives you a certain feeling of I-Don't-want-to-let-go with the series.\\n\r\nThis is my shortest review on Aria series, because i can't describe how great and heart-warming this series is, and definitely one of the best i've ever watched.",

            "content": "Please note that everything in this review is my own personal opinion and will contain as few spoilers as humanly possible.\r\nThis review will also cover all three seasons of Aria.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nImagine a scenario where there are two people sitting at a table together. One of them gets up and rummages through the freezer. He then finds a large container of vanilla ice cream. He takes said vanilla ice cream and gives it to his friend to eat. He then explains to his friend that this particular vanilla ice cream is one of the best, if not the best vanilla ice cream ever made. One of afew things will happen in this scenario. 1.) His friend will say \"Yeah, but it's still just vanilla ice cream\" and might eat a bite or two and he'll stop eating it. 2.) His friend will say \"Villa ice cream is great and all... but where's the chocolate chips? Where's the Smarties\" Where's anything besides the vanilla?\" His friend will probably eat his fill and then put it away. 3.) His friend does like vanilla ice cream but it\u2019s not his favorite kind to eat. He then tries the vanilla ice cream and is blown away by how much better it is than other vanilla ice cream he has had before. He will likely either eat until he is full and finish the rest later, or will finish the entire container right there. And lastly 4.) His friend likes vanilla ice cream so much he is basically jerking it to how much he likes eating vanilla ice cream while eating said vanilla ice cream.\\n\\n\r\nThe above scenario describes the entire Aria series quite well in my opinion. As you can see the friend started off at regular intervals of the \"do I like it or do I hate it\" line. In each point though he slowly started drifting towards one of the extremes. In points 1 and 2, he hated/disliked the ice cream. In points 3 and 4, he drifted towards liking it or even loving it. I've come to find out that this happens all too often with Aria.\\n\\n\r\nAria, by nature, is a very simple anime. A simple, calming, soothing, relaxing type of show. Not much happens to be quite honest. It's a straight slice of life anime with little comedy, and little romance; and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Aria, the series as a whole, is literally the closest thing you will EVER find a \"perfect\" anime. Let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory - This is a quote from the synopsis for Aria the Origination... \"In Neo Venezia, Akari, Aika, and Alice continue to work diligently toward the day they become full-fledged Prima Undine (a professional tour guide gondolier).\" That's it. That's pretty much sums up 50+ episodes of what you're getting yourself into. As I said earlier, the theme of this show would be to say is that is it calming and relaxing. A gentle ride so to say. What is calming and soothing? Slow rowing, gondolier tour guides... of VENICE. You don't get much more relaxing and easy going than that. \\n\\n\r\nArt - The art style is... fitting. It's not necessarily great, and it's not bad either. It\u2019s walking a nice line where it's on par with the other categories such as the characters, and the story, and the soundtrack. It doesn't distract you by being too good and you being able to say \"well, if only the 'X' could be as good as the animations\". Nor is it bad where you can pick at it and complain about how it takes away from the show. It's not bad, it's not good. It's just where it should be for this type of show. It fits.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Again, like I said earlier, it's fitting. I'm sure you can probably figure out the rest of this review out at this point but I\u2019ll keep going. What does this anime, Aria, need from its soundtrack? Calm and relaxing music... And boy does it deliver. The soundtrack fits the mood of each scene, and the anime as a whole, extremely well. I cannot think of a single track that was out of place that entire anime, nor can I think of a track that I just didn't like. They even went as far as to have seagull's noises in the background to emphasize the scenario they are in. The soundtrack was, simply put, flawless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - I'm going to start sounding redundant at this point, but yeah, the characters were quite fitting as well. I won't go into too much detail but the characters did their jobs. They had minimal character development, but honestly, they didn't need it. The thing I liked about Aria's characters, as opposed to many other shows characters, is that you don't think of Aria's characters as individuals, you think of them as a group, a bunch of friends having fun together, sharing memories, laughing, smiling together. THAT is why the characters fit the atmosphere of the show so well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - This show is wonderful. I true masterpiece in all its glory. The creator of this show really knew what he wanted. He knew exactly, right from the get-go what his over arcing idea and mood of this show was going to be. This entire show, from start to finish, was very clearly well thought-out, in every detail. From the animations, to the characters, all the way to the soundtrack, everything flowed together so very well and worked off of each other to make something beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nHowever; with all that being said, the show is very straight forward and a simple, like I said earlier. What the show does, it does amazingly well. However; that's why I said \"this particular vanilla ice cream is one of the best, if not the best vanilla ice cream ever made\". At the end of the day, it's just fucking vanilla ice cream. If you can appreciate this show for what it is, you'll love it. If you can honestly just sit back, and enjoy the ride, you'll love it. If you're looking for more, those extra sprinkles on top, those chocolate chips for extra flavor, you're going to be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are able to sit back and accept the show for what it is, you'll love it.",

            "content": "Maybe it was the build up. Maybe it was the characters. Maybe it was simply who I am. Aria the Origination seemed to pull my heart strings this way and that, making this so bittersweet. It's easy to fall in love with a character. But three characters and their mentors? And then saying good bye to all of them? It was a heart-wrenching moment. Aria the Origination takes the best of the best when it comes to plot development and character interaction all beneath a facade of gentle Neo-Venezia. I'm not going to do my standard \"here's a score and here's why I gave itthat.\" This review will be more why I loved it and why it deserves the perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching (naturally) Aria the Animation and Aria the Natural, I was in no way in high hopes for this last part of the series. Those two were just ok, slow-moving like the currents of the ocean, but rich with focusing on the character and how they slowly are growing up in the beautiful realm of Neo-Venezia. Interestingly, this series paced MUCH quicker, and continued to do so until the bittersweet end. Besides pacing, the story in general became fluid, picking up speed and continuing with its momentum. Akari, Aika, and little Junior (or you will soon found out, not so little anymore) each have their own little tales of growing up. The other two preceding prequels were more there to build up to Origination. Natural and Animation seemed to focus on Neo-Venezia as a whole and what goes on in this beautiful planet, while Origination zooms in on the characters and builds them up to its bittersweet climax.\\n\\n\r\nEach scene was rich with color and texture, I could almost picture Italy as it is today. The background music was bright and cheerful, full of spirit and wonder and happiness. The intro song was beautifully connected to each episode, and followed a character as they went through town or prepared for the day ahead. The scenery and environment was gorgeous; I don't think I ever saw a reused environment or backdrop once. If it was, it was drawn at a different angle at a different time of day. \\n\\n\r\nComparatively, to the other two series, the animation in my opinion stepped it up a notch. Now the environment has always been something I keep my eyes on, and the beautiful scenery captured the lighthearted mood perfectly. In fact, almost every place Akari and the gang visited in Natural and Animation seemed to come up again, or at least be hinted at. Their other friends, like Woody or Al or Akatuski, and their acquaintances like the guy who owns that old coffee shop, come up frequently, but in matters more serious.  It seemed everyone knew something big was coming. Pasts were dredged up, history was told, and stories flew. \\n\\n\r\nI especially loved each and every character. Akari was an airhead, but only when it seemed appropriate; her comments that Aika had dubbed \"too embarrassing,\" were actually insightful and used great literary rhetoric, but apparently no one noticed. She kept the fuel going beneath their three muskateer mindset, and she frequently seemed to be the center of not really attention, but of notice to others around her. Her likable nature and charisma hit off with the town, and she steals attention away from Aika, he gets jealous sometimes. I loved her character. Never have I had such a lighthearted character be useful to the plot so much; in other series like K-ON! or Lucky Star, the attachment was forced upon the watcher. Now, however, Akari's general likability was contagious, and soon I was spewing how great Neo-Venezia was to anyone who would care to listen. \\n\\n\r\nIf Akari was the sun, Aika was the moon. She seemed the opposite of Akari in almost every way, as in afraid to share her feelings (Akari just blurted them out whenever she had so much as a thought), boastful and proud, and argumentative and sneaky where Akari or Alice would be up front and personal. She seemed to fit the tsundere role....except she didn't. She wasn't the prime example of that at all. But she came closest, and yet I came to love her character, because she seemed to balance Akari and Alice so well. She was the rational mind of the group, leading talks or encouraging them on. She was the driving force of the trio, and continued throughout.\\n\\n\r\nAlice was the quiet girl, a year behind them, and talked in a certain way. Very formal, very unobtrusive, and yet when need be, the perfect critic. Her comments were (pretty obviously) thought out or had weight behind them; she wasted no words, so every spoken sentence was critical to understanding her character. She was the follower, but in some cases, the leader when it came to basic skill or singing, just like her mentor Athena. A child prodigy at the gondola, her skills become more salient as the series moves on, so much even the arrogant Aika takes notice.\\n\\n\r\nAlicia, Akira, and Athena are all the mentors of Akari, Aika and Alice, respectively. And each one was critical on the development of their juniors. Akari became lighthearted and happy from Alicia's lack of scolding. Aika became driven and determined to succeed from Akira's scolding and badgering. Alice became quiet, reserved, and thoughtful, and can sing, under Athena's not that wary guidance. But because of them, history was made; the Three Water Fairies patrolled the oceans of Neo-Venezia, bringing good cheer and happiness to the entire planet. \\n\\n\r\nWhy am I taking so long to describe the characters? That's because I've never had a cast of characters I liked so much. Every anime, not matter how good it is, seems to have someone I positively hate, whether it be because of personality or general traits. But here, I loved every characters. Every. Single. One. They all fit some sort of role, like a jigsaw puzzle, and fit together oh so perfectly it hurt to see them apart or to not catch a glimpse of them throughout the episodes. They drove the story, and by the end, I was tearing up....\\n\\n\r\nI could gush for hours. I really could. This was something I needed to say. I'm an action junkie; check my anime watched if you do not believe me. But this really hit me in the heart, just like Akira's confidence. Each character needed pages to describe their characteristics, but I could only give them a paragraph or a simple allusion. Everything was perfect; the artwork, the characters, the voice actors - everything could not have been possibly better. I recommend this heavily, even for those who don't like slice of life. But start with Aria the Animation. Let the waters of Neo-Venezia take you away on a beautiful journey....Oh sorry, Aika-Chan. Embarrassing remarks are prohibited!",

            "content": "We finally get the season that brings all of the Aria series together. And oh boy, what a pleasant ride it has been. The characterization for the main casts continues to be superb in many ways, with some great character development by the end of the Origination. It\u2019s probably all of the slow but steady fleshing out of the characters in the first two seasons of this series that contributed the most here. The Origination, because of the development in the first two seasons, could cut out all the excess (such as setting development, etc) and focus in on the characters much more. The Originationtakes all the buildup from the past two season, and pulls it all together in a wondrous conclusion. As you may have noticed, watching the Origination without watching the first two seasons will really have a huge impact on what you get out of the series. In other words, just don\u2019t do it.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittingly, the first half to this series isn\u2019t really any different from the first two seasons of the anime. I could honestly just call the first half of the Origination as the \u201csecond season, part two\u201d because of the inherent similarities.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s really the latter half of this season that really hits it home and brings everything together. The character development in the second half is the culmination of everything this series has come to represent, with the final moments we have with Akari, Alice, and Aika all the more endearing.  Yet, at the same time, these endearing moments are saddening because you realize that the series is finally drawing to a close. In the end, though, the closure this season brings to the characters is just plain satisfying, and you truly do get the feeling that \u201clife goes on\u201d in the world of Aqua. The setting of Aqua has always felt very alive and vibrant, but this series also goes further to emphasize how this wondrous world lives on, no matter who may be the ones living there.\\n\\n\r\nA great aspect to the character development here is that it isn\u2019t limited to just the main trio of heroines. Almost every single significant side character, from Alicia to Akatsuki, from Akira to Athena, from Al to Grandma Akino, gets some rather well done proper closure. For a thirteen episode series, getting proper closure for a somewhat large cast of characters is a bit surprising, but I\u2019m nevertheless glad it worked out so well.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t hurt that the production values have improved here. The music remains a great complement to this series, with it\u2019s rather vibrant, sometimes subtle, sometimes tainted in melancholy, musical pieces that adds a lot more feeling to the story. The animation really improved here as well, with quite a bit more detail added to the drawings and backdrops here. On a slightly unrelated side note, the added 16:9 widescreen aspect is a much welcomed change in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back, Aria as a franchise is a rather wonderful little slice of life series. Admittingly, the slow pacing is definitely not for everybody, but at the same time Aria is a great series to just sit down and relax to. I can easily see why people call Aria an \u201ciyashiki-kei\u201d (healing) anime. The atmospheric calmness to the setting, and the charms to the characters, all add together in a charming package that certainly took me by surprise. And finally, as a conclusion, I couldn\u2019t have asked for the franchise to be closed off in any other way.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nStory/setting: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8.7/10 (rounded up to a 9 on MAL)",

            "content": "Aria the Origination! When it comes to feel good anime, this is the climax! (If ya know what I mean)\r\nOh wait, I forgot. Embarassing remarks aren't allowed...\r\nAria the Origination is a prime example of how to conclude a slice of life series with a bang! When it comes to pure satisfaction in a conclusion, none can even hold a candle to the Aria series. Origination truly highlights why Aria is such a unique and serene slice of life series. Throughout the journey, you are exposed to the fantasy and sci-fi world of Aqua, aka Mars, and its city Neo Venezia, which is a carbon copyof Venice. The way Aria makes this journey truly breathtaking is how it takes such an unimaginably beautiful and fantasy world, yet still makes the journey extremely relatable and impactful.\\n\\n\r\nAs the main characters overcome hurdles and discover new things on their journey to become Prima Undines (professional boat tour guides), they encounter life lesson after life lesson, most of which you have probably experienced once or twice in your own life. Aria the Origination resolves the journey of our endearing undines by not only highlighting the lessons that they learned throughout their journey, but also by teaching them new and important ones for them to carry on in the future. The plot of Origination is much more focused than the two prequels, as it has a clear goal in mind, instead of the usual aimless slice of life experiences from before. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy yourself and smile like a dork as Akari, Aika, and Alice go through their final lessons, learning important lessons that will serve them well in the future, such as that feeling when the student surpasses the master. That point of view means everything. They experience the boundary between the normal and special. They learn about their senpais' philosophies about teaching, such as Alicia's philosophy about \"don't tell people what not to do, tell them what to do.\" They learn that even the best of undines can be insecure, and that everyone is an imperfect human being. They learn that you must love what you do before others can. And of course, enjoy the little things in life! Something that is smaller but closer appears larger than something that is large but far away.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Story resolved in an absolutely astounding way.\\n\r\n- Art quality went up, there were a lot of opportunities for beautiful scenes, and this show fulfilled that potential.\\n\r\n- The gorgeous soundtrack is back!\\n\r\n- Character development is through the roof!\\n\r\n- Even more serene and peaceful atmosphere.\\n\r\n- Beautifully taught themes and lessons.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Same as before, story is simple and requires no thought process.\\n\r\n- Jokes are repetitive, and this isn't a laugh out loud show. (It has it's moments!)\\n\r\n- Supernatural elements of the 1st and 2nd season aren't touched on.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nTruly an ending upon endings. Aria the Origination is one of the greatest increases in quality when it comes to story in a sequel. As mentioned in my other Aria reviews, Aria is one of the very few slice of life shows that you can actually see the improvement and development that the characters go through. Even if extremely subtly, you can tell that the characters change throughout the series. Whether it be through their skills in rowing, their people skills, or their overall mentality, they are always improving themselves and getting one step closer to their dreams. Aria the Origination highlights their improvements masterfully as it gives them the spotlight and resolution that the characters truly deserve.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nDefinitely a noticeable increase in quality from the rest of the series. Due to the plethora of beautiful moments within this season, even compared to the other seasons, Aria the Origination had a lot of opportunities for brilliant scenery and animation, and it took itself on its offer and executed these scenes amazingly. The art is just absolutely breathtaking, and it really synergized with all the beautiful moments within the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nStill sporting the godlike soundtrack of its prequels, Aria the Origination once again delivers in the sound department. The Aria series always has a knack of conveying the mood perfectly with its soundtrack, and this season is no exception. It gave me an overwhelming sensation of nostalgia and bittersweetness, which really fit the mood of this season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nOne of the best cast of characters gets some of the best closure and development, all within 13 episodes. After watching these characters grow right in front of your very own eyes throughout the course of the series, it's really hard not to love the characters. The characters all have their strong points and all have their weaknesses, and this show really highlights how they get over their weaknesses. They are all about the three aspects of human mentality: Knowledge, Emotion, and Willpower. Akari lacked the knowledge of a Prima Undine, as in the beginning of the show, she knew nothing about Nei Venezia and she didn't even know how to row a gondola properly. However, during Origination, you could tell that Akari really upped her game, as she knew the most low key of destinations, as well as having much improved gondola skills. Alice lacked emotion, as she was introduced as cold and non expressive in the beginning of the series. In Origination, you could tell that she was brimming with emotion and caring, even though she still retained her unique charm of a complete savage, who isn't afraid to roast others on a whim. Aika lacked willpower, as she believed that she was the only one without any special talents. However, during Origination, she overcame her insecurities and vowed to make up for her lack of talent with sheer hard work, and it payed off for her. \\n\\n\r\nThe three characters also made up for each others' weaknesses, causing them to develop as human beings due to the influence of each other. While Akari lacked knowledge, she was brimming with willpower, always making an effort to better herself. While Aika lacked willpower, she was extremely emotional, being easily influenced by her emotions and being the crybaby of the group. While Alice lacked emotions, she had a plethora of knowledge, being a prodigy of her company and being exceptionally skilled at rowing. And the cycle continues. No one was the better undine, they were all great yet faulty undines in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, the characters all retained their charms throughout the series, and never really changed that much. Akari is still dumb, Alice is still a savage, and Aika is still the punchline delivery girl. But, they definitely changed as human individuals, as they really improved their skills and got what they deserved.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, President Aria is still the best!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Pierced the heavens.\\n\r\nWhat a great way to conclude a brilliant ride. What appears to be a very slow pace and boring slice of life ended up being a journey full of discovery, emotion, and pure bliss. Aria, you surpass expectations. A lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nGreatest slice of life ever created? That isn't actually a stretch! For I believe that Aria is definitely one of the most beautiful and unique slice of life series ever made. It holds and incredible amount of rewatch value. Being as slow paced and serene as it is however, means that it definitely isn't for everyone. But for those that appreciate peacefulness, Aria is sure to satisfy!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Good things must come to an end to make room for the future.",

            "content": "I stumbled across The Origination some time ago while I was looking for a new SoL to watch. Seeing its obscurity despite its critical acclaim got me curious as to what this series was all about. Finding out about the prequels to watch before this final season really did put a damper on my excitement, and I wasn't particularly looking forward to going through the first few seasons in order to get to the 'good part'. I wasn't sure whether it'd be worth the effort. \r\nWelp, after finishing the Origination I can safely say that getting to the magnificent ending of the Origination wasn't justworth it, the journey to this point was absolutely brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, the Origination heavily relies on you having watched the previous seasons to properly connect with the characters. Watched as a standalone, many of the great moments will go right over your head, so I HEAVILY recommend that you go watch the previous seasons. By the time you get to the Origination you'll be begging for the series to not end :P \\n\\n\r\nBut to the meat of the review, what exactly makes Aria: The Origination so great? \\n\\n\r\nOrigination offers a markedly different approach to its episodes, as they are much more focused on the development of the characters rather than exploring the nooks and crannies of Neo Venezia. Back stories are explored, questions about motivations are answered and progress is made as the three girls approach their final destination. While I can't go into too much detail without spoilers, I will say that despite being only 13 episodes, and having a lot of development, none of it ever feels rushed. Much of the development begins and ends in a single episode, yet it feels very natural in the way that the story flows. After every episode you'll gain new insights into each character, but you never feel like it was just shoehorned in there to cop for some cheap emotional response.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story itself, the way the Origination handles the final stretch of the girls' journeys is nothing short of excellent. The hints in the earlier series about moving on, growing up and taking on the responsibility of a professional job all start to come together to tell a beautifully subtle coming of age story. With this in mind, it doesn't come as too much of a surprise that the Origination veers towards a more bittersweet ending, although more towards the sweeter side of things. The story truly does come full circle, and the closure given to all the characters is very satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art in the Origination is excellent as usual, with the added benefit of it finally being full screen. Characters are as crisply designed as ever and the backgrounds of Neo Venezia look just as good, if not better, than before.\\n\\n\r\nThe real highlight of the aesthetics in the Origination, however, has got to be the sound design. Very much on par with the previous seasons, the soundtrack never fails at delivering the ultimate immersion into Neo Venezia. The light guitar plucking, the beautiful singing and the various usage of string instruments really gives off a 'Venetian' vibe and the soothing melodies helps set the atmosphere well. The OPs and EDs are notable as well, with the ED being particularly appropriate (thematically speaking). A slow march, with a very upbeat, optimistic melody, the ED, I daresay, perfectly embodies the Origination, reflecting the girls' final stages of becoming professional Undines. \\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination is the Magnum Opus of the Aria series. Burdened with the expectations of satisfyingly sending off the three girls we have come to know and love, it not only rises to the occasion, but goes above and beyond, delivering an anime experience that I'm sure I will not be forgetting anytime soon. This is SoL, and anime in general, at its absolute finest.",

            "content": "\"Wow. Not another review with all perfect 10's\", maybe that is something everyone has in their mind now and start to wonder how bias all the reviewers are.\r\nI would not try to justify the scores. Simply because, there's no justification for opinions. You can reason on them, what makes it deserve such a number, but everything ultimately comes down to - subjectivity.\r\nFirst thing, Aria is an acquired taste (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_taste). It is not something that you _know_ it will be good by watching a few episodes or even an entire season. You don't ask yourself, whether you like it or not, because when you realize youare enjoying the show unconsciously, you have just become an Aria fan.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is written for Aria the Origination. However, it would be unimaginable to jump to Origination without finishing the first 2 seasons (Aria the Animation and Aria the Natural) so there'll be assumed knowledge on the characters of the show. I'll briefly talk about the score for each category and then move on to give a general opinion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 10\\n\r\nThis is probably the least subjective out of all sections. Aria the Origination, undoubtedly has the best animation quality out of all 3 seasons. Fluid animation frames (not that there are much fast changing frames in the first place), almost nonexistant in-between frame character distortion, amazing atmosphere and environment illustrations which draws you in so deep you might just think it has realized in reality in front of you, and of course the ever beautiful character expressions and gazes. What more could you ask, well there you go. 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nNot much to comment on the voices of the characters. Same seiyuu are voicing the same characters in last 2 seasons. But what gets \"Sound\" 10 is actually its music. Noone who would not notice the style of Aria's music and the focus of it after watching 2 seasons of the show. The opening and ending themes of Origination are slow (as usual) but sets up the right mood for the beginning and the ending of the show. Soothing, peaceful, sometimes a tad bit melancholic and sometimes with a little spice of playfulness describes most of the instrumental. Personally I am a fan of its instrumental, but what ultimately gets Aria, which subsumes Origination, a perfect 10 for its music is the perfect placement of music pieces at the right time, for the right scene, in the right atmosphere. Everyone who has watched Aria would know the show focuses on the appreciation of small things of life, and what brings the emotional burst, or sometimes epicness out of these scenes, is the beautiful music accompanying, be it instrumental or vocal. Okay, 10.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10\\n\r\nThis is probably the weirdest part for Aria, since it doesn't have much of a story to begin with. But then again, does the quantity of story content determine the quality of it? I can probably summarise the general main storyline of Aria in one line, but does that mean its story do not deserve a 10? Not a question I could answer, but the least I could do is to reason my score. The score isn't based on _what_ the storyline is, but on _how_ it journeys through the show. Little stories in each episode are episodic, as unrelated to each other as they might be perceived, these stories serve to build characters into the crew, which is basically Aria is all about. In the end, when you start looking forward to these unrelated little stories in each episode, you will then realize, how a anime, that almost has no main storyline, can score a 10 for its story. It's magic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\r\nCharacters, are basically what shapes Aria. Origination gets an advantage compare to its predecessors, because the characters are heavily built before and Origination simply expands and gives an ending on them. Keep in mind that there's strong correlation between liking the characters and liking Aria so if you do find the characters uninteresting, there's simply no reason to watch it. 10. End of story.\\n\\n\r\nValue 10\\n\r\nTo put it simply, it is something you watch it once (or maybe a few times) initially, and when you think back the time you were watching it, it feels good. There couldn't be any less value in treasuring the experience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment is so subjective it is not even funny. 10 because I enjoy the show a lot (no objections )\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI like Aria a lot, but once I were asked why, I paused and thought about it, and then realized I actually couldn't give a definite answer. But of course, that would make my review for Origination even bias, so I'll try to explain as clear as I can.\\n\\n\r\nAria is good probably because of the magical aura surrounding the characters (probably sounds bs), but really, in the end, it just boils down to appreciating the characters, appreciating small, insignificant events happening in life, and appreciating people around who might have been taken for granted. Origination takes a further step to put an end to all these, by giving a fitting finality to all the characters, and it has done nothing but a flawless job on it. Perfect execution which involves the perfect script, music, illustration and atmosphere, has made this possible and the inner feeling, emotion that it gives is simply... irreplacable. But all this is under the context that you like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Aria the Origination is a simple yet undescribably beautiful show, if one were able to appreciate it.",

            "content": "Verdict:\r\nBy episode 5 of ARIA the Natural, I thought that this series reached perfection. In the subsequent 36-episodes-plus-OVA, I was proven dead wrong as my standards for perfection in anime were continuously raised to ever-greater heights. ARIA is a titan of an artistic masterpiece, one of few works of art I can say changed me as a person.\r\nIn full:\r\nStory:\r\nARIA has a take on plot and narrative that seems very... Zen, in a sense. To compare to another of my favorites, Berserk: Berserk has a grand, central plot that each part contributes in an obvious way to. Each arc is very long, and serves to drivethe main conflict in some way. ARIA, one the other hand, is very-much in the moment. There is an endpoint/goal -- Akari, Alice, and Aika's coming-of-age and their promotions to Prima -- however, each story seems, at first glance, to be inconsequential and irrelevant. As you delve deeper in, however, you find that the characters are being shaped by the events around them, becoming products of their lives and their experiences. The creators took great effort into getting you to really care about the people you're watching, and to really relate to them in individual experiences they have. One of the most impressive story-telling feats I've ever seen was in episode 23 of the Natural, where the writers somehow got me to care so much about side characters who have barely 15 minutes of screen time that I cried at the conclusion. Just 7 episodes prior, I was moved by two episodes about decommissioning a gondola. ARIA has a masterful use of the mundane to craft a beautiful moment in time and a powerful message that stays with you. As for the ending, I can't say much without spoiling. I'll just say that even if you didn't enjoy the first 2 seasons, the Origination makes everything worthwhile, and even will make you enjoy the first 2 even more.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'm not an artsy guy, so not much will be written here. The art style is pretty usual for 2005-2008, though the backdrop and care gone into the design of the characters -- as well as the impressive consistency with real-life Venice -- makes it great in my opinion, even if it's not exactly unique. Amano-san's art in the Manga is superior.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nHoly shit. This soundtrack as absolutely immaculate. Give a listen to Nana Iro no Sora wo, from the OVA. The way the strings end the song is one of my favorite moments in music, period. Amefuribana is one of my favorite Jazz-fusion songs, and Lumis Eterne is fantastic. Choro Club's playing absolutely brings Neo-Venzia to life, and they never fail to capture completely the feeling of the scene. This may be an unpopular opinion, but ARIA's OST is my favorite ever, even beyond Cowboy Bebop, though only by a little. I never watch anime openings and endings, but ARIA and Bebop are the sole exceptions.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fantastic. It's obvious from each line that everyone involved in ARIA put every ounce of their passion into it. As overused as it is, I still smile when I hear Aika say \u300c\u6065\u305a\u304b\u3057\u3044\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u7981\u6b62\uff01\u300d. Interestingly, there was an Italian dub for the show. I wonder how good that is...\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn this show, character and story are interchangeable. I'll just say that I love each and every one of the characters, from Alicia right down to Mailman-san. I'm given every reason to care for them, and care for them I do. As for the other definition of \"character,\" this show is Earthbound-tier with personality. Its unique perspective and brilliant execution are a sight to behold.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEach moment in ARIA is a small little treasure, something you can come back to months or years later and still remember how you felt when you first saw it. Likewise, the series felt strangely nostalgic just a week after I completed it. Currently, it holds the record for the most times I cried in a series, as well as for the most reasons. The Origination, by the way, was a 6-hour tearjerker for me, and it was mostly happiness.\\n\\n\r\n(dude, that's a lot of text. Maybe I shouldn't spend midnight writing unpaid reviews.)",

            "content": "I do not love Aria.\r\nPerhaps that grabbed your attention, and you should understand that was not the only purpose of that statement; it is not a lie and it should certainly be reflected in the score I gave. So why the hell did I give it a 9 if I didn't love it?\r\nLet's talk positives.\r\nAria the Origination is something I can't help but regard as wonderful. Watching the first and second season, I will admit to often feeling impatient, disenchanted or generally uneasy about whether or not I really like Aria. The Origination, however, defeated me. The voice acting as good as (if not evenbetter than) it ever was, incredibly beautiful scenery and water that transcends that of its preceding seasons, the fresh and satisfying humour that always seems to make me smile now, a new level of character development that sees both apprentice and prima undine into a brighter future... Perhaps the main selling point for me, though, was the direction. Aria the Origination takes such a powerful and assured path towards a goal within its plot that the previous two seasons forfeited in favour of episodic-style storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say this season wasn't at all episodic, simply that it maintained this nature through such a way that every small episode was a large contributor in the path to, and outcome of, the story's ending. And oh dear, what an ending it is. I struggle to remember an anime that has effected me so emotionally in the past; Clannad ~Afterstory~ was obviously sad, but not only does Aria the Origination arguably do sad even better, it incurs an incredible response from every possible range of emotional input you could imagine. From laughing to crying, to blushing to sighing... Aria excels in every facet of the human psyche it attempts to tap into, and it does so in the most subtle and disarming way imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nSo why didn't I give it a 10? How could I not \"love\" it if I can rant so much about how great it is? Pretty much a single, seemingly baseless reason, which may not sound legitimate but is a genuinely pressing factor for me; I'm not a fanboy. I can acknowledge Aria's objective excellence in voice acting, art style, soundtrack and seamless storytelling, and I LIKE the characters, but even in the ending credits of the last episode I felt the same strange gnawing dissatisfaction that I felt throughout the entirety of this series. It would be strange to dislike Aria the Origination, but it wouldn't be strange not to love it. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of how well Aria makes it work, I'm not a diehard fan of inherently predictable plot for the sake of achieving perfection within that storytelling. The fact that I could tell you how an episode would end before it was halfway through oftentimes detracted from my view of Aria as \"perfect\", creating an occasionally methodical layout that had a less than stellar effect on me and ultimately pushed me to a point of disenchanted impatience in some of the earlier episodes. Something about Aria just didn't touch me the way that it did everyone else, and in that sense I feel almost cheated by my own senses in that I'm unable to so thoughtlessly enjoy Aria to the extent I would have liked; it was usually a constant effort to have myself watch an entire episode without staring off into space during dialogue or tutting whenever the plot took a similar approach to one it had take numerous times before in its previous seasons; sometimes, I had to maintain a rigid mind just to make sure I /cared/. \\n\\n\r\nConsider me one of the minority, one of those individuals coherent enough to make a decent analysis of Aria but still within the group of uncultured swine incapable of adoring it. I didn't /want/ to avoid loving Aria, it was just an inevitability for the mindset of both myself and a large demographic of individuals with similar tastes to myself. I almost feel like someone born without sweet taste buds.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't take this as a negative look on Aria as a whole, just understand that Aria simply wasn't designed for certain types of tastes; in fact, it was designed for a very select taste. It wasn't that I didn't enjoy Aria at all \u2014 some aspects of it I found quite endearing and its emotional impact was one that I'm not likely to forget any time soon \u2014 I just don't have the capacity to fanboy over it or state it as one of the greatest anime I've ever watched, as much as I'd like to. Consider it an 8.1-8.5~ from me considering most aspects of enjoyment and objective value, rounded up to a 9 thanks to how incredibly well-executed the A/V were, how likeable the characters were and how emotionally fulfilling the series turned out to be as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nConsider this review a statement that even if you disliked the first two seasons, even if you do not love Aria's story or setting or characters, Aria the Origination is a damned good watch, it's \"objective\" value in production and focus within the anime is through the roof, and it is definitely worth both the time it takes to watch itself and the time it takes to watch the two preceding seasons. In the end, Aria excels as not only an anime with incredible emotional value, but it excels beyond usual expectations within this field as an anime wherein you do not need an emotional attachment to the series itself in order to enjoy the show to its full potential (see: how this contrasts to the polarising opinions on Clannad: ~Afterstory~). \\n\\n\r\nAnd if I love anything about Aria in the end, THAT is what I love. Not its personal value towards my personal tastes, but its value as a work of art in regard to all possible viewers in the world and it's monumental achievements and execution within the medium of anime. Forgive my subpar humour: I love it because I don't have to love it to love it.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination was an experience for me. As I mentioned, I was unsure as to whether I really liked the first two seasons, but the Origination had overpowered me at the halfway mark, and I knew I would be singing its praises before I'd even finished it. I didn't have to have an inexplicable attachment to the series in order to enjoy this show greatly. There was a special experience to be had here, and the Origination's strengths in this experience can be seen not only in its incredible power and execution as a conclusion to the Aria story (which, by the way, it does amazingly and gives a whole new meaning to the idea of conclusions), but as a beautiful story in its own individual right and something that will likely remain with its viewer long after they've finished the ending credits. I know it'll remain with me.",

            "content": "\"Watching Aria is like becoming one with your inner bliss and flowing at the tempo of the show making it feel warm.\" - someone\r\n\"Embarassing remarks are forbidden!\" - u already know\r\nThis show serves to remind us of enjoying the little things, even to a cheesy and sentimental degree. Agreed that people today overlook the things that make them happy and take it for granted. Only until it's gone do you realize how much impact it had. Both the Origination predecessors take on the position of fleshing out the world and basically introducing the characters. Nothing really happens in either but are necessary to watch beforewatching Aria the Origination.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination develops the characters a great deal as compared to the predecessors. The thing that makes this season so great is because of it's switch in tone and orientation. Previously it served as a relaxing, slice of life that didn't tell much of a story, rather try to put the viewer into it's setting. Now that there is an ending in sight, the show finally starts moving it's plot and execution was strong. The first half of Origination follows a similar pattern to the predecessors, but are a little more focused on the three main undines, Akari in particular. However, the second half really ramps it up and takes it up a notch almost to a fault. It literally went 0 to 100 real quick. This is what makes the Origination stand out compared to the Natural and Animation (and its top 100). A bit lackluster when it comes to the cheesy things and doesn't really have an impact on viewers besides preaching to appreciate the small stuff. Origination leaves open knots within the story, like supernatural events, and some episodes were there just to be there. Still, the 2nd half of the show is what really stands out and it's storytelling is engaging and rewarding at the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters step it up a notch. The one thing about Origination that stood out from the get go was the realistic character interactions. Previously, as mentioned, the very cheesy and sentimental quotes are very heavy handed within the series. Characters didn't feel real, more like fantasy that would go with the script to emphasize the message of the series. With Origination, the drama is handled carefully coupled with distinct character personalities. This makes their interaction that more impactful, enough to drive the story and make it one worth telling. It appears some episodes exist just to be there and yes this is an episodic piece, but to introduce new side characters then gloss over them for the whole series doesn't seem right. Especially because some side characters do get screen and development time. Animation and Natural were used as the foundation for each character's personality and Origination capitalizes on each, making it more meaningful when they interact. The characters feel real and act like their respective archetype.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the animation style of Aria in general. It's the same throughout the series but the munchkin faces and glistening waterways are cool. It's kind of embarrassing, but the childlike animation really fits with the show and actually really fit each character. Colors are pretty cool, pretty eye candy for a 2005-2008 series. Akari's munchkin face and figure is really funny in particular. \\n\\n\r\nSound is awesome. The show knows what it is and therefore has the perfect score for it. Relaxing, vibrant, and above all calm. Not much suspense in the series so there's no heavy hitting violin stuff but the soundtrack was utilized perfectly in each scene in Origination. The Undine theme is one of my favorites and honestly, could've been used through the whole show without it dropping in quality. It fits the bill that much. Very solid soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nIt amazes me that on MAL, there are more user entries for Origination than Natural, which is Origination's predecessor. What makes Origination as good as it is certainly are the first two seasons. Their lackluster sentimentality makes the 3rd season stand out even more. The show is not for everyone, admittedly took me 3 weeks to finish the entire series just because it is very slow paced and binge watching it was impossible considering how unengaging it could be. For any new viewers, take your time with this one and give it a chance. Aria is a quality series within the slice of life genre and it may influence a different outlook of life.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: In the city of Neo-Venezia on the planet Aqua, once known as Mars before being terraformed, Mizunashi Akari (Hazuki, Erino) works as an Undine under the Aria Company \u2013 a professional gondolier who ferries the citizens of Neo-Venezia as well as tourists through the city\u2019s many waterways. Though only a fledgling Undine, Akari and her friends Aika (Saito, Chiwa) and Alice (Hirohashi, Ryou) have high aspirations of one day becoming as accomplished as their respective teachers, known as the Three Water Fairies of Neo-Venezia. Aria The Origination concludes the story of Akari and her friends astheir Undine training nears completion and they begin to consider what their respective futures may hold.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the cast of the show benefited tremendously from Aria The Natural, this season brings even more to the table in the form of additional characterization of the main trio as well as their mentors and a fleshing out of the cast as a whole, creating a more believable and immersive environment than previously present in the show. This time around, the passersby, the intermittently featured stranger, and the single-episode insert characters all have far more dialogue which helps move the cast away from feeling as self-involved as it did in the past and makes the Neo-Venezia feel more like a city. Similarly, Aria The Origination features other Undines outside of Akari\u2019s group and their mentors which, along with several other story-centric changes, makes the vocation of Undine feel more legitimized within the world and provides a greater context for what it means to become a Prima.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, in relation to the immersive changes featured in this season, there are more frequent changes in wardrobe \u2013 especially among the main cast. Seeing the characters in different attire than their work uniform made them feel more like actual people as opposed to visually static characters which, with the exception of Aika, almost all of them had felt like beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main three characters, their changes present in the previous season are further elaborated on but perhaps more importantly, due to the conclusive nature of the season, we get to see each of the characters develop to an extent not present in the prior installments of the show as they mature and progress in skill to the point where the show can conclude. One particular thing this season brings to the table in respect to the apprenticed Undines is their relationships with their mentors which has been a strong character feature throughout all of Aria however is executed even better during this season and is one of the two major \u2018payoffs\u2019 of the season alongside the development of the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nBy this point in the series I think it comes as no surprise that the art and animation of Aria is highly consistent and beautiful in its support of the show\u2019s themes and tone and Aria The Origination follows in suit in that it upholds the style and aesethtic established in the other installments while also improving upon a few things to make this season the most aesthetically pleasing of them all in my opinion. While they are infrequent, there are a handful of times an episode where the animation becomes a touch more detailed and more fluid which, while not adding anything thematically to the show, is certainly an added aesthetic bonus and makes the execution of certain scenes all the more better. Along side that addition, the close-ups and choke-shots this season looked highly detailed and conveyed the emotion of the moment phenomenally.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nBetween the way in which the show handles the characters and the general plot, Aria The Origination did feel like a departure from the previous seasons in a number of ways which in totality led me to believing that it was the strongest of the show\u2019s three seasons due to its differences and improvements. In the same way that showing other Undines and having the main characters interact with them created a better and more believable atmosphere, this season\u2019s attention to detail concerning gondoliering and the various skills required for the profession was incredibly helpful in establishing the vocation of Undine as a real job rather than something the main characters happened to be. The technical side of gondoliering is played up quite a bit in that there were shots of oar movements, how the boat maneuvered, and how the Undine affected those things. This was something I had been wanting from the show since the first season and its inclusion here was spectacular in that it set up the narrative infrastructure for much of what transpires during the season and brings the focus of the show back to the characters as Undines while the show continued to foster them as characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to take note of in terms of how Aria The Origination differs from the previous installments is that it lacks the supernatural (cat) element that was especially played up during Aria The Natural. Though I did not enjoy its presence myself I would agree that it went well with the tone and themes of the show and that there would be plenty of people that enjoyed it. That being said, it is not just that the supernatural element is lacking but rather that it is missing entirely \u2013 seemingly dismissed entirely as it remains uninvited throughout the length of the show. This was perhaps the only crude thing I can point to within the plot of the show as an episode of departure aimed at this aspect of the show would have felt more natural compared to dropping it entirely with no mention though at the same time I cannot point to any episode I would replace and this qualm is ultimately quite minor in the face of all of the positives featured in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strengths of the second season I felt was in how it introduced a more diverse set of themes in comparison to the pure, sugar-sweet wonderment of Aria The Animation and while there are more than enough positive observations in this season it continues the trend of its predecessor which I definitely feel was a great decision as the diversified themes worked wonders for the show\u2019s character development while presenting compelling episodes.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nIn much the same way that the previous seasons of Aria have set a strong precedent for the show\u2019s art and animation, they have established an outstanding use of of the show\u2019s soundtrack in order to bolster both individual scenes and the attitude of the show. Aria The Origination only improves upon these previous successes and the higher frequency of emotion-driven scenes gives some of the sentimental music even more room to shine while still providing plenty of room for the relaxed, thematic music to play out as it always has.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nAria was in numerous ways a show that only got better each season and Aria The Origination upheld that standard and finished the series in strong fashion and as the best of the three seasons in my opinion. Though certain elements of the show may not have been investigated to the length I would have liked, the amount of work done by this season alone in respect to what the show was lacking beforehand was quite considerable.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nI gave Aria The Origination an 8 because of how it improved upon the already extensive work done in the second season of the series. The increase in detail, the character-focus and approach, and the narrative structure of this season alongside all of the positive attributes it upheld from the previous installments were incredibly positive and were integral in the show\u2019s ultimate success. Though this season and the prior may have branched away from the premise of finding beauty in the mundane, I think what it ended up accomplishing and developing was more interesting and definitely the right direction for the show to have taken. Aria The Origination does well as the conclusive chapter of the series and its many payoffs make great use of what was established beforehand.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nTo those viewers who have reached this point in the series I think its quite safe to say that this final season does nothing but good for the show and at worst successfully promotes what made the previous seasons good. While I would not have recommended Aria The Animation for the purpose of its characters, they have come a long way since then and have become far more compelling and interesting to the point where I would not only recommend this season because of its characters but claim that they along with their development were probably the single strongest element of the show. For those looking for a marriage between the heart-warming and the lighthearted then Aria as it always has features those things in excess and I would highly recommend this show to those looking for a relaxed atmosphere with an episodic approach though this season actually progresses quite linearly.",

            "content": "How to describe ARIA: an anime where the plot doesnt matter and where the slice of life would replace and thoughts of anger into enjoyment.\r\nThis shall be a 3 part review of all 3 parts. Also some Spoilers.\r\nAria the animation-8\r\nIntroduced to the Main characters and major side characters. the plot thats touched upon very few times is Akari, Akia, and Alice trainging to become Undines. but its mostly them hanging out, having fun, some shenanigans and some tear-jerking moments that you will love.\r\nAria the natural-8\r\nWith a 24 episode season, the plot moves like the first season, the characters are given more depth, new challenges andsome mystery are added to keep it fresh. If they had become Primas before this one ended and Origination was showing how they adapted to their new roles, i wouldve liked that but it was not to be.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Origination-10\\n\\n\r\nLast season, everything comes together with a nice big bow on top. Seeing who made Prima first was defenintly surprising, but then how it ended made watching 52 episodes worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the segments.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 7/8. This anime,while set in the future, is still resonably believeable. being in the 24th century, one would think humanity could terraform a planet. Being set in a venice look a like, it gives you a feeling like you're actually in venice. I wasnt to into the idea of a plot actually being there but not being moved in any way, but the interactions between the characters made me not care about it. every episode is a self contained side story with a few episodes that deal with them training to become Primas.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 9. Character designs and backgrounds were pleasing to look at. the super-deformed parameters in my opinion were used just 2% to much;while they look very hiliarious, some scenes didnt need it. could not see any drops in quality all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9. BGM, OP and ED were very well done. BGM is noticable every episode and it mostly fits with every scene. no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10. This is where the anime shines. Each characters personality blends well with eachother. Sometimes you would think how are they friends, oppisites attract and this is a prime example of that. The way they develop from their initial state is wonderful. Alice becoming more open with her ideas and feelings. Aika curbing her assertive side(most times it doesnt work, but thats the funny part). And Akira becoming less of a pushover to Akira and becoming her own person. The major side characters (the current water fairies) are given great back stories to themselves but wont go into to much detail, theres to much to tell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9. this is an anime where anyone will love, regardless of age, gender, etc... Its a good light hearted anime that will fill your heart with joy every episode. Just wanted faster plot development, but thats just me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10. if there is a fault in this anime, its many good points overshadow it by a large margin. its no exageration to call this anime the best of when it was released. its just so sad to see it end. it has soooooo much more potential than what is showed. i shall always hope for a sequel, but never get one.",

            "content": "What makes an ideal life? That question has been wandering in my mind for a while. Is it one where i can get anything i want without being bothered by the limit of the wallet. Is it one where i can have lots of friends to party all days long and pay no heed to the \"daily chore\" and my parent's rant. Is it one where i am able to lead lots of people and have their respect. However, they all seem too \"perfect\" to me, i want something more genuine, something that can be achieved through simple method yet require a handful of effort.And Aria just gave me that answer: a life where i can enjoy little things and take adversaries as child's play.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to slice of life anime many people assume that the story is \"narrowed\", lacks \"depth\", badly paced, .etc. I'm not going to argue with that overstatement but Aria is not your mere slice of life show, while it's true that the pacing can be slow at some point but overall the narration and directing really make up for it, leaving the viewers in awe at the highlight moment of a particular episode. Influenced by the Venice's culture, the author did a splendid job on creating the post-modern setting of Venice, not without some sci-fi elements to make the series more \"imaginary\". The story isn't just about a groups of \"cute girls do cute things\" like many other slice of life series, but also is a journey to find the meaning and value of little things that we usually left out while heading out of home. Not to mention the anime itself has a goal, a final destination to conclude its story, and this 3rd season named Origination serves as the ending to the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a manga adaptation, and yes i read the manga before watching anime, it didn't fail to surprise me in the least as the producer managed to create a parallel universe of Aria, making the story more \"original\" as the title suggested but not without preserving the core value of Aria. The show is episodic so everything happened within 1 episode will be concluded neatly, leaving barely any confusion to the viewers. Moreover, if you're not distracted by the other captivating aspects of the show, you might be able to recognize some hidden message that the anime delivered in a very delicate manner. The narration is usually taken from a particular \"main\" character of an episode so you will find it very intriguing to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is really great, though i admit it can be slow at some point, but that doesn't make the show boring. On the contrary, it serves as one of the show's advantage and is, in my opinion, one of the most iconic feature when you think of Aria. The truth is, sometimes life can be pretty much like a \"fast-lane\" where we are constantly bothered by deadlines, family affairs, assignments, work, some random shocking scandal that affects your country, some random serious crime news that send shiver down your spine, .etc. But that doesn't mean you just let it that way, instead, you got to take it slow a bit once in a while and think back of what we have achieved, make motivated us to reach this far, and so on. Aria is exactly the same way, the show takes its slow pacing as an stepping stone to create a unique atmosphere, freezing time to deliver the \"feel\" to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things that Aria offers us the the meticulously crafted characters that all serve their part well without being \"left behind\". As mentioned above, the characters are on their own expedition to unravel the essence of the things surrounding them. Hal Film Maker succeeded in portraying the life of 3 young girls and their respective seniors in a futuristic, yet classic setting. Each has their own catch-phrase that never fail to impress me. The daily activities are well depicted in an elegant way i can pretty much relate to them. While there is one main character that take most of the screen time, the remaining \"main\" characters also got their fair show time and can even \"steal\" the narrating role of the aforementioned one, helping to widen the scale and the diversity of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i really like about the characters is probably their \"natural\" development, which doesn't feel forced at all. I meant when an episode reaches its climax, it all came so \"smooth\", very quick yet decisive, making a huge impact on me. Not to mention the interaction of one character to another which will most likely surprise the audience, like, \"didn't think that A would get along with B though they didn't talk much\" or sort of. My favorite character of the show is the arrogant and juvenile yet realistic Alice Carroll, not just because of her personalities but also thanks to my relation with her, not to mention she has the most exhilarating and distinct development of all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation/presentation, i find this the finest asset that the show possesses. The art style is very \"frugal\" yet fastidiously drawn, not without its uniqueness that never cease to amaze me. On top of that, the character design is also a plus for this one. Normally the only thing i care about this section is probably the character's face alone, nothing else. However, i must give the outfit design a medal for being so delicate and charming. It fits the characters and the setting perfectly, which creates a very nice impression whenever i get to see them roll out. The animation is seamlessly done, from facial gesture to the gondola movement and the background misc, .etc, it is as if everything has become one.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the design is really outstanding, there is something that is much more remarkable in this category, which is the sublime landscape that leaves me completely astounded whenever it emerges. It's not about how detail it is drawn, it's about the nostalgia it gives when it hits the right spot. Though the breathtaking background is the main \"weapon\" of the show, to me it only serves as a \"pillar\" to emphasize the main theme of the series, or to be more specific, of a particular episode. Not just the background art but the visual effects are scrupulously done which boosts up the mood at the turning point of a chapter.\\n\\n\r\nStill, it is all thanks to the awesome directing and execution skill that such exquisite views were flawlessly put together. There are some episode that run pretty slow at first and seem so mediocre, yet at the end of it i was hit by an indescribable force that make me feel like i'm already home (can't exactly explain how i feel at that moment). The camera angle also plays a major role on hooking the elements, it was well-timed with right set up to accentuate the main object of a particular scene. I really appreciate the producer' hard work for this one, every things are well planned in order to cater to the fan, which is really commendable.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, although sound is usually the one that falls behind, or should i say, the one that viewers overlook since they're too busy paying attention to the other content of the show, Aria doesn't abandon it. The OP and ED are so chill that they can not suit the show more. One alluring feature about the OP is that it doesn't have a \"fixed\" animation like many other anime, and in fact runs alongside with the show, saving me my precious 90 seconds and an extra little screentime of the show. What really noteworthy about the music is that they don't sound \"cheesy\" like many \"moe\" show use to attract customers, which instantly comes to my liking. Background music are played at the right moment, adding up to the atmosphere and combine with other traits of the show to make a huge impact on the audience. \\n\\n\r\nMoreover, like many other animes, Aria is not without its decent voice actors, the main \"soul\" of the characters and one of the many reason the anime industry prospers. Their voice really fits the character's personality and scenario, especially when it comes to the highlight and emotional part, which is really hard to achieve since you have to \"become\" the character themselves to be able to pull out such awesome performance. I'm not going to spoil, but it is very rare to see a character sing so magnificently in an anime that is not about music, i was really moved by her song in \"that\" episode. Kudos to the producer for going all out on this one.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Aria is like experiencing life itself, the life that i really want to strive for it. In fact, i've traveled to a place somewhat similar to Aria's setting, and might some day move there if i ever get a chance. The show itself is like a \"tour\" that i take for granted at first, but gradually, the more i watch, the more i'm attached to it and can't help but crave for more. This \"tour\" is an unforgettable ride, like a roller coaster that twists me in different shapes of mood and eventually bring me to a satisfying destination.\\n\\n\r\nThere are moments that make me laugh like when the characters acted so silly and naive. There are some very nostalgic moment that make me pause the show and think for a while before getting back to it. There are moments that make me feel very pleasant thanks to the their overwhelming childish, innocence yet sensible thought. There are moments that give me goosebump even though i can't really tell how did they manage to do so. There are moment that makes me smile inside myself due to the heart-warming scenery.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, watching Aria after a hard day from work/study is the best kind of stress-relief i can get without taking much effort, can't really explain why but it's just pure magic. At first, it might feel like nothing but soon i'd be engulfed in an endless stream of \"feel\" and enjoyment that make me forget all the irritating matters i had encountered earlier. I think it's safe to say the show really knows how to manipulate the viewers into its own realm, making me and many other fan wish that it never end, but unfortunately, nothing lasts forever.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Aria the Origination as specific and Aria franchise as a whole is very thematic series that realistically portrays the ideal life that we should have while maintaining its quality at top notch. Frankly, i learnt quite a lot from this show, and to enjoy little things is probably the best lesson that i got. On top of that, it also serves as a memento to me that life can be rough sometimes but don't forget to look on the positive side of it. Everything has to end and this is one of the most bittersweet farewell that i have to accept. So long Aria, and to those who has yet to seen this majestic piece of art, why not \"lay down your weapon\" for a bit and give Aria a try, who knows that you will also be fascinated by it. \\n\\n\r\nWorthless information: i don't really know why but there's a tag \"shounen\" on the Aria's information section, but don't let it trick you since that has nothing to do with the show.",

            "content": "Aria Series Review\r\nThis review will cover season one up to three of Aria. Since I marathon it, it would be proper to post a review that covers every season. It would be difficult to review this one because this series is more about mood and feelings. I&rsquo;m a person who finds it difficult to express what I feel into words so I hope you can bear with me. \r\nAria is set in Neo-Venezia, a city that resembles Venice. It is located in the planet of Aqua which is formerly known as Mars but during the 23rd century it was terra-formed and became a planet capableof supporting life.  Aqua became a planet engulfed by vast oceans stretching miles from one land to another so in Neo-Venezia, the main transportation is through the use of gondola. In that very city we follow the lives of apprentice undines (gondoliers) as they encounter different events and people. \\n\\n\r\nThe colors and hues throughout the series retained its pastel-like tone and it touches the anime&rsquo;s soft theme. The character design is also well done because it compliments their personality. What really overwhelms me was the very setting which is Neo-Venezia. The absolutely crisp details are breath taking and the architectural designs are really detailed.  If ever Neo-Venezia existed, I would love to live there because it has the most glorious architectural design, people there are nice and the undines are so hot so what more could you ask for? The animation is not really important in this kind of show but I was amazed because even if the animation was not that good in the first season, they made sure that Neo-Venezia will still look awesome. In the second season, the animation was a little better but in the final season the animation really kicked off. For a slice of life show, the animation in the third season is top notch. My only rant was the side shots of the characters in season two because that drawing looks kind of awkward but you&rsquo;ll forgive it mainly because it&rsquo;s just a minor quirk.\\n\\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s no real plot in this series, it&rsquo;s just all about the adventures, experiences and hardships of our undines.  Throughout the previous series, it&rsquo;s easy to believe one is watching a series of disconnected, episodic slice-of-life adventures, but in this series it becomes clear that everything in Aria connects to an overarching story about the lives of its characters. To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m not that fond of watching slice-of-life anime but after I&rsquo;ve watched this I was blown away by the disarming messages that could make you appreciate little things in life, try to be a nicer person and to always look on the positive side of life. This anime is like a medicine because before I first watched this I was very stressed about what I&rsquo;m doing with my life but when I watched this it, I felt better. This is the most influential series that I&rsquo;ve watched so it was able to reach my top 5 favorite anime show of all time. \\n\\n\r\nAll the opening of this series was sung by Yui Makino and her songs was able to compliment the calm pacing of the series. I&rsquo;m impressed, mainly because as the series progressing, all her songs just kept getting better and better. Even though the songs are slow it is really catchy and very calming. I even find myself humming her songs whenever I space out.  In the first two season of Aria, Round Table sung the ending song and it kind of sends a message &lsquo;see you next time&rsquo;. I also love their song because after watching the anime, I don&rsquo;t know it left me grinning and feeling light hearted. By the way in season two Round Table has sung two ending songs entitled &ldquo;Natsumachi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Smile Again&rdquo;. I also like those songs but I liked Rainbow better. There are also several insert songs and bgm and the scene where it was inserted are very fitting. An example of that was during the last episode of &lsquo;the origination&rsquo;, I think I cried 3 times in that episode because the bgm was very fitting especially in the scene where Akari thought that Alicia already left (that was a tear jerker scene). I would also like to add the insert song during the retirement ceremony was also fitting and that was also a tear jerker scene. I&rsquo;m trying so hard not to cry but in the end I cried. It&rsquo;s the first time I cried this much while watching an anime series because usually I could hold back my tears (that&rsquo;s my talent, keeping my emotions to myself). Unfortunately, the third ending song was not sung by Round Table instead Akino Arai sung the song Kin no Nami Sen no Nami. I don&rsquo;t hate that song it&rsquo;s just that I find it a bit inferior to other ED of this anime. Nevertheless, I still like it after listening to it a couple of times.  \\n\\n\r\nThis series has been awesome mainly because the characterization was superb. I was able to relate to the characters especially Aika. I think you could also relate to them because they are just like any human beings living their lives and having some flaws. It&rsquo;s very rare to find an anime that has good characterization that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve gotta praise Aria for being able to accomplish that. My favorite character would be Akari because she is very optimistic and she sees everything positively. I also admire her honesty because she could easily open up to others and due to her positive attitude she could attract other persons to her side. My second favorite would be Alice because at first she is afraid of opening up to others but because of Akari, she was able to become a bit more friendly. Even though she is a genius she has a cute side like doing some ridiculous challenges. Sigh, to tell you the truth I like all the characters of Aria but those two are my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors of the series really suited each of the characters. They did a good job but I noticed that most of the main voice actors of this series have only starred in few series. Even though they are not famous they were able to bring to life the characters with their skills. I like the voice actor of Alicia and her memorable &ldquo;ara, ara *giggle*&rdquo; and also Aika&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hazukashii serifu Kinshi!.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show because every episode was able to make me feel warm and fuzzy inside. It even made me appreciate little things in life and to have a optimistic world view. If I could compile each and every one of the quotes in this series I would because I was able to relate to it. At first I thought the lessons in this series are for kids but as you ponder about it, it is really directed at older audience. Who says anime is only entertainment? Anime could teach you lessons that you can&rsquo;t learn in real life and this series proved that. I think everyone could enjoy Aria for a price of opening their hearts. Most people doesn&rsquo;t like this kind of show but I tell you, even if you find some lines in this series cheesy, you&rsquo;ll be disarmed because of the show&rsquo;s honesty. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it to everyone because not all people like this kind of show, all I could say is if you feel stressed watch an episode or two and you&rsquo;ll feel light hearted. I think this type of series should not be marathoned because you&rsquo;ll end up sleeping because of its calming mood. How can I describe it? Arghhhh!!! Just watch it&hellip;..it&rsquo;s really difficult to convey it into words. Overall, I love Aria and I&rsquo;m sad that it ended already. Thank You Aria&hellip;..\\n",

            "content": "Aria the Origination witch is the second season of the Aria series is actually a bit different from the other one and in my opinion the best one along with the OVA: Arietta.\r\nThe reasons I thought it was nice was because, comparing it to the other seasons witch actually were mostly showing the Unidine girls practicing or doing things of slice of life (of the Undine of course) this one had a bit of drama.\r\nMost of it is shown at the end and it emphasizes more in Alicia\u00b4s and Akari\u00b4s relation than in the in the other seasons. Where it is shown that Akari andAlicia get along well, but the strong bond between them is not so obvious as in Aria the Origination. Apart from Akari and Alicia the bond between Alice and Athena becomes stronger too. And well, Aika\u00b4s and Akira\u00b4s relation didn\u00b4t change, because that happened in Aria the Natural (although it wasn\u00b4t something that could be clearly seen). But a secret of Akira is reveled. Also Akari, Aika and Alice look as well as allays, maybe I could say that Alice is more opened now and it is seen how much she values her friends.\\n\r\nTo conclude, I liked this anime season mostly because the bonds between the characters became stronger and of the drama it had.\\n",

            "content": "One of the things which make the ARIA series a rather unique one is that it is so plotless to the point where almost nothing that happens in the majority of the show is of any importance. This is what makes it incredibly hard to be liked by the average anime viewer (me included). A majority if the series proceeds with events such as meeting new people, riding gondolas, delivering letters, etc. and the biggest obstacle the series would face would be to save a cat from a tree.\r\nAnd, after succeeding at not sleeping at two whole seasons, the third season of ARIA i.e. ARIAThe Origination comes as a pleasant surprise to the average viewer. The scales are comparatively higher as compared to the previous seasons, it has an actual goal unlike the previous ones, and the story, though episodic in nature, moves forward after a while and it is this season that brings closure to the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is about the life of three female gondoliers in Venice...on Mars. Yes. Venice on Mars. The idea of placing the story in a setting such as this was a good idea as it excuses some of the things the show has. Such as, why are all gondoliers female?  Gondoliers are actually male and if you've been to Venice the only people you'll commonly see riding a gondola are male. Why are there only three gondola companies? How can a company work when there are only two people running it (later on, only one). Such questions keep arising throughout the series which are in contrast to the real Venice.  Besides that, to some extent, it somewhat excuses the complete utopian nature of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I mean it. The world of ARIA or 'Neo-Venezia' as it\u2019s called is a complete utopia for the first two seasons. Never will you find anyone talking very rudely or being too angry. There are never any crimes shown in the series-no theft, dacoity, vandalism, pick-pocketing, etc. Hell, you never even see a police force working! People are almost always smiling and you'll never see anyone arguing for long. \\n\\n\r\nAlso one never sees any competition between the three gondola companies and nobody seems to mind the fact that the best gondolier of a particular company is training and hanging out with girls from other companies. In reality, things would never work this way. Thus, in a way, this series ends up being pure escapism.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nFinding ARIA is 720p (outside Japan) is difficult and maybe even impossible and that is a real shame because ARIA is, in small terms, beautiful. The art, as said by many others makes the world of ARIA come to life. The backgrounds are incredibly detailed and the animation is incredibly smooth. As it is a show about gondoliers, there is a lot of water and it is animated beautifully. I had to make do with watching it at 480p and yet it was a real treat for my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to complain about in the sound section. The opening and ending themes used are of a very relaxing nature and the match the mood and theme of the show. There is no particular animated sequence for the intro and it is always different thereby reducing the probability of one skipping it. Only, I did not have a particular liking towards any of them. The OST\u2019s used contribute to the relaxing nature of the series and they are mostly cheerful with nothing too sad or grim. The voice acting in the series deserves praise as they manage to capture the personalities of the various characters without going too overboard. However, the transition to another mood (happy to sad, et cetera) usually feels a little forced. Other than this and some other minor issues, there are no major faults to talk about and there is nothing that prevents me from giving these two sections a near-perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY & CHARACTERS\\n\r\nUltimately, one watches ARIA for the characters and the interactions they have with one another. Frankly, expecting a plot for ARIA is rather absurd due to the near-complete lack of it. As mentioned earlier, the challenges in ARIA usually involve doing the things as difficult as saving a cat from a tree.  All these, however, contribute to the main message of the series \u2013 respecting the little things in life. Many a times, people tend to ignore these little things when at times, they can be the things that matter the most. It could be that extra hour of effort a student put in to secure the \u2018A\u2019 grade or it could be that one extra attempt made by an athlete after countless tries of failure. Ultimately, that one extra attempt or one extra hour proved vital to the success one has achieved. This is the constant theme of ARIA where all these little things shape the characters personalities and once they reach their destination, it is these little things on which they look back and reminisce.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as said before, Origination is a far better series as compared to the first two seasons due to the higher scales, character development and rather different story structure which is quite pleasant once one has gotten used to the first two seasons.  In all honesty, I found the first two seasons to be quite boring. They served nothing more than to introduce the characters and their various interactions with each other. Each story was frankly quite predictable and there was little to no conflict in them.  Origination changes all that. Each story has an air of unpredictability to it and while the ending is still quite positive, it is generally not what one expects it to be. Characters start having inner conflicts with themselves and the setting is not as utopian as before. As an example, there is a minor character who almost falls into despair, something which has never happened before in the series. Of course, it is all presented under a very positive light and the entire scene glimmers with rays of hope at the end. Also, the series offers various life lessons at the end of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, a thing one might find complaints about is the lack of realism within the series.  And yes, there is a lack of realism. I mean, this is a series where companies are started because of cats looking out into the horizon (I am not joking, this actually happens!) and where cats live beyond the age of forty. Of course, each such thing has some philosophical reasoning behind it but the whole thing feels just so dumb at parts! (And can someone please tell me how Maa is a cat and why almost everyone\u2019s name starts with \u2018A\u2019?)\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, the best things about the Aria series are its characters and frankly speaking, the creators do a pretty good job with them. Each character is colourized with their own distinctive personality, they each have certain gimmicks which they follow and it is quite enjoyable to watch them interact with each other. Said gimmicks can however become quite annoying after a point and it may not be uncommon for someone to cringe after hearing Alicia say \u201cAra Ara\u201d the millionth time. One thing I liked about them was that though they were predominantly female, they are never sexualized in any way and this is something which I find great in contrast to the far more popular anime that are out there. Another great thing which I found was that I was able to remember the names of the entire main cast, something which I am rarely able to do. The series draws parallels between the trio of teachers and students (you know, like Naruto-Sasuke\u2019s relationship being like Kakashi-Obito and like 10 others)-something which I found quite unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, they don\u2019t receive any major development until the third season as it mostly shows them fooling around.  In the third season though, the characters develop slowly but steadily and some of the character\u2019s personalities are explored in more depth. I would elaborate on it but I shall not for the sake of not spoiling anything. By the end of the series, you know that they are not the same people they were back in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe VERDICT\\n\r\nARIA The Origination has quite a lot going for it. It requires one to finish the first two seasons (and if you\u2019re like me, there\u2019s a high chance you\u2019ll find it tough). They payoff however, is quite good and though the ending is rather flawed, it does a good job at bringing closure to the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nArt:-10/10(Beautiful)\\n\r\nSound:-9/10(Fitting with the tone of the series)\\n\r\nStory:-4/10(Almost entirely plotless)\\n\r\nCharacters:-9/10(Well-developed)\\n\r\nOverall:-7/10(I don\u2019t take the average of the above)\\n\\n\r\nThe GOOD\\n\r\n(+)Very different air from the previous two, and from most series in general\\n\r\n(+)Beautiful art and animation\\n\r\n(+)Various life lessons\\n\r\n(+)Character growth and development\\n\\n\r\nThe BAD\\n\r\n(-)Lack of realism (And yes, I expected realism from this show)\\n\r\n(-)Character gimmicks can get annoying\\n\r\n(-)The first two seasons can be a pain to watch\\n\\n\r\nThank you so much for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated even if they're negative. And if I've offended any of you, please PM me and don't send any assassins to my house :).....(yeah, that sucked)",

            "content": "What an amazing way to conclude the series. I can't even express how satisfied I am with the finale, the final season of the Aria series. \r\nIt's true. This series is definitely one of its kind. Why? Because Aria speaks to the heart, not the mind. It's about all the small things in life, the most trivial things and what makes it and us so human, forget all about the complicated, negative, messed up things in life that most of us are in right now, and learn and be reminded actually how easy life is, as most people even forget how easy is it tosmile and be happy. Aria is, as I believe a medicine for the weakened soul. It's just like being teleported from your screen into the seat of a gondola, being a customer of one of the best undines (gondoliers) in Aria, brought on an adventure and journey to discover the magical world of Aria. Coupled with a few mysterious and bizarre stories from time to time (mostly in Natural), it's not even out of place, it just adds to the fact on what actually makes Aqua so mystical and beautiful. FYI if you haven't or never watched the previous 2 Aria seasons, Aria is episodic, which means that there is NO cliffhangers whatsoever and each episode has a different mini-story from the other, I'm not saying that they aren't chronologically connected, but it's to a minimal. And, I'm probably going to mention this just once, please, watch Animation and Natural before watching Origination. One may feel it might be unnecessary but I believe you'd may be missing out way too much if you just plunge yourself into Origination. Watching the first 2 seasons is 100% required in my opinion to achieve optimal enjoyment and satisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe Aria series's character development is OFF THE ROOF. I have never once seen an anime develop their characters so flawlessly, as I said in my previous review of Natural, all of it's characters are SO well done, and props to all of the seiyuus especially Alice, Akari, Aika, Alicia, Athena, Akira's that participated in this project. Such outstanding performance from each and every of them as you'd feel they've practically synced with their character in Aria. Nothing much else I can say character-wise, but it's definitely one of Aria's main winning points.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe BGM is also, PHENOMENAL. Every single piano piece, score, music, were right on par with the storytelling and mood of every scene. The music is so beautiful it's even hard for me to describe it. The placement of every piece was perfectly done. The opening of Origination is great, it delivers the same feeling as the previous seasons. As for the ED, I don't really LOVE it, but it could be better in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nAgain, nothing much I can say here, but as fans of the previous 2 seasons know, WE GET WIDESCREEN ARIA THIS TIME AROUND!!!!!! The second I watched Origination I can't help but notice the animations improvement, it's well deserved widescreen resolution. The detailing on the characters expressions are on point as well, similar to the previous 2 seasons. The background wise, also pretty much the same as the previous 2 seasons but as we all would know, Aqua is such a beautiful place, anyone in the right mind would definitely move there if given the chance, right? right?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI ENJOYED IT SO MUCH I EVEN CRIED\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nJust go watch it already if you are looking for something other than mature, dark, fast paced, action animes. Aria's characters will grow so much on you, you'll find yourself missing them so much right after the series ends (the withdrawal is so real). I mean, after 13+26+13 episodes worth of the main trio, you'll definitely find something to like about these 3 adorable girls right? Unless you have no heart that is.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Edit: DISCLAIMER - I was told \"Aria: The Origination\" was fun so I tried this one but apparently there are two seasons before this one that set context and stuff. So this is from the perspective of someone joining partway.\r\nSo, I came to this anime because it was reccomended via a number of different channels, including MAL. I had never heard of it before but I had some experiences with slice of life that worked out all right like Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star. \r\nThe best way to understand to Aria the Origination is it's.... welll..... pretty much exactly like Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star.Instead of the jokes and comedy Aria focuses more on a kind of lightly dramatic experience, the slice of life shown in Aria is one of a group of what the show calls \"Undines\" who are basically like gondoliers in Venice, which makes sense also when the town is called Neo-Venezia. \\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting thing about Aria to me were the characters, Alicia, Athena, Alice... it's all very Greco-Roman I take it. Each of the Undines has a different kind of temperament like you see in most anime, the strong one, the gentle one, the confident and slightly reckless one, the novice, etc, you kinda see that like... in a lot of anime, to be honest. \\n\\n\r\nOne other nice thing is it doesn't like over-tax itself you are just watching these characters and it's fun to just get to know them, but it's just pretty boring and modest at the same time. I guess it hurts to say that because it's so calm and gentle but it's just not as exciting as a lot of anime. In many ways, I think I prefer Lucky Star more because that one had some pretty funny moments and Azumanga had some interesting middle-drama flavor missing from Aria.. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing is though, Aria does have some charming elements, it makes Neo-Venezia into this kind of nice city about a few stories, but it just kind of felt overbearing and distressing at the same time which is really weird, ultimately, I just didn't like it that much. \\n\\n\r\nDid not dislike heavily, but wasn't a big anti-fan either.. so, a 6. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Aria the Origination is a seamless transition from the Aria the Natural, and is a bit more focused than the first two season due to the closeness of their dreams of becoming Prima Undines. While it is more focused plot wise than season 1 and 2, I never realized how far they had come until episode 9, and from there on it is episode after episode of emotional moments and satisfying victories. Aria the Natural really got into the psyche of a few of our main Undines in training, and the Origination expands upon this to great results showing their insecurities and worries when itcomes realizing their goals and moving forward with their new lives in great detail. There are a lot of relating and roughing themes brought up in Origination that really weren't all that touched upon in the first two seasons, the importance of watching the first two season before checking this out cannot be stressed enough. I loved the relationship the most between Alice and Athena though Akira and Aika's relationship/backstory was greatly improved in Origination. Alice slowly warming up to Athena and then breaking down and exposing her actual caring feelings for her was wonderful and it made episode 9 incredible. The animation has improved a bit from The Natural and is around the same level as the OVA that's acts as the transition between Natural and Origination. The music is as calming and relaxing as always but still I feel like the Animation had the best music of the series with its ending. While I wasn't in love with Origination as much as others it was still a fantastic conclusion to the Aria series and the best season of Aria by far. While boring to me at times I really miss the world of Neo-Venezia.",
