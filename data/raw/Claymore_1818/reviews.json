            "content": "Claymore is one of the most intelligent shonen anime that has come out in recent years. It has a pretty good, though rather classic plot of revenge. For a story synopsis go to animenfo.com. In any case, here\\'s my review up to eps 14.\r\nWe see that the main character, Clare, does grow throughout the series so far, which means in each episode something happens and she is changed by it, and through out the story arcs, she is either benefited by the events or suffers the consequences whether she wants or not. I can talk about this character as if she were a real lifeperson precisely because the balance of things that happen to her - I don\\'t mean that she gets exactly half good and half bad as she journeys, but I mean she has her good days; she has her awesome days; she has her awful days, and she has her almost dying days. She grows through it all. \\n\\n\r\nShe has suffered a ton in her life time, and as a woman, she\\'s seen a lot of dark side in men. Yet she\\'s still on the job, partially because she doesn\\'t want to quit. There are rules bounding her but we can assume that she can leave and go in hiding if she desired. But she doesn\\'t quit her job. Why is that? \\n\\n\r\nI think she has a sense that the rules of the game are to be followed, maybe not completely to the T, as sometimes she goes out and bend some of them, but not breaking them. There are priorities over organizational rules, after all, especially when it comes to saving a life and nurturing it. She learns that from her previous experience when she was in the position of being nurtured. However, at the same time, she nurtured the person who was supposedly the strong one (this happen when she was young and wasn\\'t a Claymore). Something within Clare made her a strong person even before she grew up to become a Claymore - she recognized pain and suffering similar to hers.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the things happened to her, she\\'s still going strong. She risks her life and being discovered (she\\'s currently hiding) when she sees her comrades desperately need help; even though she\\'s not quite powerful yet and her opponents-would-be are extremely powerful - a classic component of shonen anime. Here, I\\'ll go into the shonen stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore is a shonen show with its classic plots - revenge, skilling up/powering up, mentors who train, and someone that comes out and help during the most desperate-to-the-urgency-of-death situation (hopefully only one). The biggest and the most obvious twist here is that all the strong characters are women - all the roles that would\\'ve been filled by men in the classic shonen (Saint Seiya comes to mind) are filled by women in this case. What marks it apart from a lot of other shonen is the fact that it doesn\\'t drag on and on and give out mindless battles or tournaments. That means everyone that the main character has to fight has a good reason to be there, and some of them do indeed come back later, like many shonen shows, but not because they just do, or they have some simple reason like they just want to come back for another round, but these characters all have their reasons, some forced, some by choices, and some by both.\\n\\n\r\nWhat happens earlier definitely affects what happens later. Friends and enemies are made later because of earlier events and encounters (this anime would make a great RPG).\\n\\n\r\nBecause the plot doesn\\'t drag - the anime came out when the manga is already on vol. 13 or 14 (I can\\'t remember), which means they have a wealth of materials to work with, the arcs are well developed and I don\\'t see any unnecessary fillers (at least not yet, I can\\'t remember if this is slated to be a 26 eps series), each episode does something to move the story forward. That\\'s what a good storyteller should do. In addition to that, the important characters are distinctive and form deep impressions, the unimportant characters mark their short impression and then they\\'re forgotten and don\\'t take too much of the viewer\\'s attention for too long. All these are important to a good storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nThis show only suffers a little bit of cliches from shonen anime - one occurrence of ex deus machina. It also has other classic shonen characters like mentor that takes the disciple for training when the disciple has been badly defeated, sociopath characters, sidekicks, and a couple other smaller ones. But these traits get developed the right way, pile those with good character developments and an intriguing  overall plot with good small arcs and you\\'ve got an awesome storying that retells the classic revenge in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other elements such as Art, animation, sound - it\\'s production I.G. and  I\\'ll leave those for others to review, because...\\n\\n\r\nthis review is too freakin\\' long! I commend you for reading this far. Good job! =D\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I obviously like it. For the reason see above! =D\\n",

            "content": "Claymore is a Shounen, Action, Adventure anime in a Fantasy, Medieval setting. The story basically revolves around a specific Claymore \"Clare\" and her companion \"Raki\" as she goes from town to town, slaying monsters known as Yoma.\r\nFrom the beginning the story is very easy to follow. You have Claymores (strong female warriors) and it is the job of these Claymores to slay the Yoma. The story basically follows Clare as she travels to slay these Yoma, which get increasingly difficult to defeat as the story goes on. As a character Clare is developed so well that your opinion of her will change constantly throughout theseries. Knowing her past before she became a Claymore and her current self makes it hard to believe that those two are the same person. What's disappointing is that some of the other main characters are not as developed as Clare but at least they produced good enough results. Raki being the main supporting character is really the only annoying character and doesn't really bring much to the story. As the story goes on it changes completely from the original hunt and kill Yoma, onto a more interesting and compelling storyline with amazing battles.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight sequences are just amazing and what helps it is the superb animation quality, thanks to &quot;Madhouse&quot; (also producer of &quot;Death Note&quot;). A lot of detail is put into every aspect of animation, with amazing lighting effects, detailed backgrounds and realistic character models. It is great to see all this kept during the bloody fight sequences however I do feel some corners are cut which just loses some of its essence (e.g. when the arms move so fast it does the typical DBZ speed attacking effect).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic with a magnificent orchestral score mixed in with some wicked bass and rockin' tunes. It's perfect in setting the right atmosphere; drama or action, it does well in both however there are times, mostly during fights, that the music can get a little messy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this ends up becoming an interesting anime that actually brings something new to the saturated shounen anime market. It manages to stay true to the manga storyline throughout however the story ends up moving at a very fast pace but the benefit of this is that every episode counts and there isn't any screen time wasted by: pointless flashback, training episodes, prolong deaths, etc. It's a shame that the anime deviated from the manga slightly near the end, which is bad news to manga fans and it means there's less chance for it continuing.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "The Claymore manga was written by Yagi Norihiro from May of 2001 all the way until October 2014. Yes, it just finished. Roughly midway through the manga's run, in 2007, it got an anime adaptation from Madhouse. Now, I have not read a single chapter of the manga, so I'm not going to notice how faithfully they adapted the portion of the manga they adapted. The question is, does the anime manage to be interesting and coherent with what it does use?\r\nStory:\r\nIn the world of Claymore, monsters called \u201cYoma\u201d roam around the land disguising as ordinary humans and eating their guts. In order to combatthese beings an organization with no name creates warriors that are human-Yoma hybrids, the titular Claymores. Our narrative follows a particular Claymore named Clare as she travels the land, fighting Yoma and completing missions for the organization. You quickly learn that there's a particular Yoma she's chasing after to take revenge for the death of someone she loved. Unfortunately, the one she's chasing is a particularly powerful variety called an awakened being. So, how does the series manage the premise?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the problems. The biggest one is the ending. Now, let's be as fair as possible. There's no way they could go through the story of the entire manga, even if you only include the bits that had been released at that point. That being said, the part they do end on is kind of rushed and very much unsatisfying. A lot of the story is also pretty standard action fare. It isn't really bad, but it does nothing new either. Clare goes to a place, fights a thing, gets stronger, lather, rinse and repeat.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there are some good things about the story too. The episodes that deal with Clare's back story are quite brilliant. The series also does build up a world that has a lot of potential intrigue, although it isn't nearly taken full advantage of in the anime. The series is also good about introducing major plot points well in advance of the point in the story that they become really important.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMost of the major characters in Claymore are quite interesting. The Claymores are nicely varied and the best character moments in the series are among them. The biggest issue with them is that most of their basic back stories are all very samey, at least the ones you see. Dead family because of Yoma and then she became a Claymore. I suppose it does make sense given the sacrifices they have to make to become Claymores. Doesn't seem like the thing you'd get into if you had a loving and supportive family but it still gets a bit repetitive when the series wants you to feel sorry for a particular character because of her tragic past that happens to be virtually identical to the tragic pasts of all of these other characters. The antagonists do have some depth to them too, which is nice for an action oriented series. The secondary characters are largely under-developed, but most of them serve well enough for what they need to do.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all that let's get to the big problem the series suffers from in terms of characters, Raki. Just imagine the most obnoxious, useless sidekick character you can think of and you've probably got a character similar to Raki. He's a young boy who gets rescued by Clare and then starts following her around while contributing nothing of value to anything. As a narrative device, he serves two purposes. The first is to give the series an excuse to explain information about the organization. Which could have been done without him if they'd been clever with their dialogue. The other purpose he serves is to give Clare an anchor to her humanity. Although I would argue that they could have easily made her a stronger character by giving her a more introspective anchor, like her memories of Teresa or her own determination, and dispensed with the twit altogether. But instead we had to have this obnoxious brat with no good dialogue or moments. I don't know what ultimately happens to him in the manga, but I hope it involves death by fire.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of positives about the art. The action scenes are magnificent. The backgrounds are vivid and nicely detailed. They also do put effort into making the Claymores look different in spite of them all having the same outfits, hair and eye colours. There are two major problems with the art, though. The first is the way they do blood. This is one of those series where blood frequently spurts from wounds as though it's shooting out of a high pressure hose. Furthermore, the lighting in some scenes makes the Yomas' blood look like a neon purple hue. Which is practically guaranteed to drain the tension given how silly it looks when a liquid that strongly resembles grape kool-aid is spraying into the air. The second problem is the outfit that claymores wear. It's a tight, white bodysuit with a cape and the only armoured bits are around the shoulders, fingerless gloves and making up the skirt. Now, they can regenerate quite a bit of damage but it still makes no sense for them to leave quite literally all of their vitals exposed. Nor does it make sense for them to wear something that's going to ride up in the worst ways into battle.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey did get some really good actors. Kuwashima Houko, who also showed up in last week's review as Kita Michiru, voices Clare. Paku Romi, Mizuki Nana, Orikasa Ai, Takayama Minami and Inoue Kikuko all give great performances. The one weakness is Raki's actor, Takagi Motoki. That isn't to say he's a bad actor, I really haven't heard him in enough roles to make a good judgment, but he plays a character who spends the bulk of his dialogue either crying or being vaguely perky. As such, he doesn't get the chance to demonstrate any real range. The music is pretty standard stuff, except when it comes to tragic or intense scenes. The composition work in those is really good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere is a bit of les-yay in this series. Clare's attachment to Teresa comes across as a young girl's first crush. Jean and Clare get some subtext laden moments. Several of the other Claymores get scenes with each other that could be read as having romantic undertones as well. Particularly Helen and Deneve. That being said, the series ultimately does nothing with these relationships that's definitive, so it's ultimately left open to interpretation. So I'm going to give it a ho-yay factor of a 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nClaymore does have quite a bit that's good. A lot of the characters are well done, the premise is interesting, the acting is largely good and the action scenes are awesome. However, it also has a lot of issues. It ends at a bad point, Raki exists, there are questionable art decisions, Raki exists, it draws on quite a few cliches and Raki exists. In the end, the series is still decent enough for what it is but it's certainly not a classic or among the best. My final rating for it is a 6/10. If the premise sounds interesting or you're looking for something relatively quick with some good action, check it out, unless you don't want to deal with an annoying sidekick. Next week I'll look at another request, Welcome to the NHK.",

            "content": "When you first start watching the show you're greeted by a strange looking creature feasting on a dead human corpse. Unknowingly, a tall slender figure appears right behind him. He senses this new danger and turns to fight this opponent. But hidden behind this slender gorgeous figure is a sword just as tall as her. She unsheathes her massive weapon and a vicious fight ensues...\r\nThat is the backdrop of what you are going to be experiencing. Fortunately (or unfortunately), that should leave you wanting for more. This story is set in a fantasy land set in medieval times where creatures called Yoma hide withinhuman civilization. \\n\\n\r\nMany (but not all) of the normal humans fear the claymores because they are made of half of what they are afraid of: the Yoma. But they are a necessary evil since they are the only ones strong enough to combat these horrible beasts. Not many people know much about Claymores. Just as mysterious as they sound, you will know very little about the inner workings of their organization, except for a few important rules. This story surrounds one character only known as Clare and basically shows how one becomes a claymore. From human life, to selection, to training, to assignments, and then to tougher assignments... typical shonen anime right? They way they tell Claire's exploits is a pretty good idea. They pretty much \"Tarantino\". That is a great way to explain how this universe works, well I enjoy moves told in this fashion too (some folks won't). This shows how emotion plays an important role in the show how their human half creates many internal conflicts with themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThere's mainly one main character and like 40 supporting characters. Unlike most anime out there that keeps EVERY character alive, this one actually does the dirty deed of killing off characters, which I enjoy very much. Not the killing part but more of the reality of it. Friends live and die just as willingly as the enemies. And that is very refreshing in the sea of Naruto's and Bleach's. You'll actually get a good amount of face time with all the claymores they present to the viewers. You'll still remember who favorite ones are. This is one of the very few anime that I actually remember most of the characters' names. Not only does each one have a unique look and attitude, but they also have specific powers that separates them from them all. Half way through the anime, im sure you will find a handful of favorite blond warriors. My personal favorite is Clare.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't mention anything about the artwork without talking about the character design. I think this is one of the best character designs I've ever seen in an anime. Not just because it mostly consists of beautiful slender blond haired sexytime warriors but, in the variety of how different each warrior is from each other. From hair style to warrior insignias, to even the swords they carry all have subtle details that u can easily remember or recognize. Even their \"alter-ego's\" are unique to each warrior. And you cant have medieval fighting giant monsters without great backdrops and this show has those in spades. As many fight scenes there are in this show, the backdrops are just awesome. From abandoned towns, to forest fights at dusk, to even fights in dark dreary caves, they're all situated in different places. Sure they sound very typical but with as many variations in the villains they fight, they all feel very fresh when watching them. The background animations like the random civilians, breaking objects, sparks, and fire embers are all here. They don't look anything impressive but they do add wonders tot he fighting. Most notably the blood... and this anime shows them by the bucket load. It never stays away from violence and thats what makes this show great. Not many current anime shows this much gratuitous violence and its very refreshing after watching a few dozen slice of life school comedies.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything to complain about the show, it would have to be the sound effects. You can tell most of the stock sound effects were from other shows and movies. Most notably would be the Star Wars laser fire sound when a Claymore \"transforms.\" When I first heard it i was laughing so hard. On top of that other sound effects are just very normal like growling and sword clanging etc. The music is also a little on the weak side. They could have done better with some of the 'theme' songs like when clare 'gets angry' or when she 'learns a new skill' the songs appear pretty weak. But they do break out in some serious guitar riffs and rock instrumentals, which are pretty impressive compared to the other music in here. But the opening songs and closing songs are one of my favorite parts of this show. J Rock is really catchy and seems very fitting for this show throughout. Hell, I have it playing in my car as we speak!\\n\\n\r\nThe story was very interesting through the first 20 episodes. Representing a little shonen with Clare's development cycle. But the end sorta feels like they're selling the series a little short. At this ending i felt kind of cheated just like what i felt on the ending of Code Geass. If you want to watch a good story driven show this is a good one to watch, but be wary of Raki and the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOh by the way, please try to watch the entire show before you go and give it 10's or whatnot. The last 4-6 episodes will disappoint, I guarantee.",

She meets a normal human kid who isn't afraid of her, and they end up as traveling partners. At first, it starts as a standard \"good-guys-killing-monsters\" show, but it goes deeper. I've always felt that the organization for whom the Claymores are working isn't quite good, but let's just leave it at that.

Masanori Takumi did a good job on the OST, especially on some songs like Bishou no Teresa (Teresa's Theme), Ginme no Majo, Hateshinaki Tabiji and Fukaki Mori no Naka. The choice of the rhythms is guessed and coherent with the scenes. Other sounds instead are ostensible, for example the sounds heard during the battle: squeaking of blades, cuts, footsteps and blood that exits from wounds. Also the chosen of dubbers have been good, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nSplendid characterization of every character! Even if in the first moment nearly every character can seem cold and calculating (Claire for example in the first episode gives so much this feeling), when you learn to know them, to know their feelings and their past, will born an endured empathy, an example is the story of Teresa and Claire, or the Ofelia's one. Every personage has its fundamental characteristics that distinguish she from all the others Claymores (physically, every claymore is similar to the others, therefore is for their qualities you'll love every single character): there is who, like Jean, has one strongly will, who learns to love, like Teresa, who simply loves, as Raki, and who cannot more survive to the pain like Elena. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nEvery time that I am watching an episode, I always hope that it does not end that way and I hope that it continues not leaving things as they are, I want more and I'm disappointed to have to wait for one week in order to see the continuation. Every minute of the show very is calculated as in converses as in the amazing, never-boring scenes of action, where the spilling of blood is not fine to himself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThere aren't means ways, you love it or hate it. It's a great shonen, similiar to others but also a lot different. I love it, more the story goes ahead the more it becomes interesting... what else? Can't wait to see the showdown!",

            "content": "Claymore is a good choice for you if you enjoy admiring the world building of a series and are typically into fantasy action series. It becomes a terrible choice if you hate when a show doesn't really know what direction to go towards the end and doesn't manage to do anything meaningful. In addition to this, you might hate it when the main characters of the series of the series are way blander than pretty much everyone else in terms of personality.\r\nIf we are to exclude the fact that Claymore didn't know how to wrap things up, its story was for the most part solid.The world was presented well, with elements introduced gradually before they were immediately relevant to the current events of the story, this creating a better understanding for future scenarios without anything really ever feeling like a plot required asspull. For example, before the main focus of the series starts, which is the fight against awakened beings, the series has an episode about how Claymores will transform into demons once they use their powers too much and they will want to end their lives before losing their human conciousness. This introduces elements that are gonna be relevant in a future arc that explains the main character's motivations and goal, but also that are gonna be relevant way past this point. When the significant events happen, you don't think they don't make sense or are built in a way just to keep the action alive, because they are introduced well in advance. \\n\\n\r\nUntil this isn't the case anymore.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part Claymore faithfully adapts its manga and doesn't really stray from its source material. But, because it had to end and the manga still had more content to go through and create, it had no idea how to wrap things up and create an ending for the anime adaptation. So it basically adapted as much as it could, and then brought the most hyped up bitches together and made them fight. And then ended the series on a note where things were like \"Our fight will go on, it's not over, we still have to do shit\". Which is a cliffhanger. The final fight was very unsatisfying, featuring a lot of flashbacks to \"make us understand the characters perspective\" and not at all to fill for time. I mean we already should've known this information but we probably forgot the information because we're really really really stupid. And there's a lot of random powerups in the fight with senseless slashing and power level display, totally not done because \"we don't know how to write this fight\", but rather because people truly enjoy when characters just think about their lives and nonsensically are more powerful. When people see something done 1000 times done already the same way, they demand it 1001 times more, The final fight is pretty much a \"the plot demands this\" fight. It's exactly how it feels. It's exactly how it's written. it's exactly what it is. \\n\\n\r\nThis hurts Claymore a lot, because of the fact that it introduces elements way in advance that withhold relevance, only to end on a note that seems poorly pieced together, completely destroying I'd say what it was its strongest suit. The planning ahead the initial series did for itself to allow itself the moments it wanted, wasn't at all a factor here. Instead of that, it focuses on the weakest theme of the series, the thirst for revenge. I won't detail it, as to not give the nature of the ending away, outside of it being basically a cliffhanger, but it is something done rather frequently, done very hastily and poorly pieced together, and that for me was very unsatisfying because it brought nothing new, nor was it executed well. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Claymore made me contradict myself because while I think that they're well done, I also think that they're poorly done. Let me explain myself. The overall design of the Claymores, and the color palette of the series, (or rather the lack of a color palette) make the Claymores really hard to distinguish by character design, with them pretty much differing only in hairstyle. The fact that they're so similar is a downgrade because this makes it really easy to swap in your head their names, faces and personalities, which are differentiating traits. Keep some characters away from the story for too long, and you'll definitely get lost in the details. The point of the design being hard to differentiate is making the Claymores look expendable, because that's how their world treats them, and also recognizable from any other bystander. But a little more customization in the design, like at the very least let them keep their hair color and just make them distinguishable just by their eyes being silver and their suits, could've made them easier to distinguish from each other. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that is bad is that all the Claymores have THE SAME BACKSTORY. It is not an exaggeration, everyone's family got eaten by demons, then they became Claymores to avenge them by killing them. I mean I can understand this being the case for the majority of the Claymores, but can't be there at least one Claymore that picked up the job for any other reason? I can understand the reason always having to be selfless, because if Claymores are tempted by power, the more likely they are to become demons themselves, but maybe some girl just wants to join because they want to make the world a better place by removing the demon threat due to strong moral values or any other reason.\\n\\n\r\nThese were the reasons for which I think they're poorly done. The world requires for their design to be basically the same and the world's rules requires their background to be basically the same. But in a way that makes them well done because they're serving the purpose of the world fully. None of them (for the most part) seem like fantastic out of the ordinary circumstances with any special gift to them, because none of them are, and none of them should be. Some of them happen to be way more powerful than other Claymores, but that's it. That is not an irregularity in the world of the Claymores. On one hand I admire the fact that the series built a world and its characters to be as fitting as possible to their setting, but one hand I see the flaws it creates, making every character forgettable due to how similar to each other they are.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is dissapointing because the two main characters, Clare, who is a girl who's on a revenge quest against Yoma, just like everyone else, and that's her personality. And Raki, the annoying sidekick who's there to humanize Clare and cry because hey Claymores aren't that bad y'all racist. Clare is the brooding silent type who has nothing on her mind than revenge, which is a boring and predictable character type. Raki is a kid who just lost his family and just follows Clare around because he has nobody left, with his role pretty much being to fuck up Clare's battles and yell CREHRH from time to time. None of these characters are interesting. The most interesting arc of the series, is, ironic to everything I said, the backstory arc of Clare, where a different Claymore is the focus of the story. Who is a much more interesting protagonist than Clare and makes Clare that much worse, because not only does that backstory have the exact same purpose that the main characters have in the overarching story, but it's done that much better and with a character that is irregular to the world of Claymore.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as a result of such after that background story, the story doesn't really bring anything new, and pretty much develops the world for the action bits. The action of the series is mostly women slashing gigantic monsters displaying their powers and how they differentiate from one another. The way they differentiate themselves is interesting and how certain demons need a certain type of strategy to be combated is also interesting, but for the fights can seem dull since there isn't intrigue sometimes, since it's mostly the characters constantly using the powers they've established and slashing the shit out of an enemy until they die. You usually know how things are going to play out in terms of choreography, the more interesting part is how the characters decide to get there, and how they make use of the powers that differentiate them from the other Claymores in these situations.\\n\\n\r\nI think the action could've been enhanced visually if the series had brighter colors. I made a joke earlier in the review that the series lacks a color palette, because, it barely uses any warm colors, and mostly uses monotone cold colors, even on backgrounds that are colorful. Everyone is dressed in some very monotone looking pieces of cloth, Claymores are dressed in almost full grey-ish clothes and the monsters are mostly designed with dark colors. There isn't really any inbalance in the colors to catch your attention visually when something significant happens and everything always looks regular due to the show's overall tone. In terms of visual details, the series does not lack those, everything is well detailed, and the characters are drawn realistically which is a definite plus, but you need some way to draw attention to the spectacle of the series, the action, and look for a way to not make everything seem as monotone every single time. The soundtrack of the series didn't really help the tone for me, I didn't find it noteworthy and I mostly got annoyed of hearing the same song whenever a battle is about to commence.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I think Claymore had an excellent world with only one arc that actually tells an interesting story, both things I enjoyed a great deal. But it has a lot of shortcomings, with plenty of unfullfilling fights, some dull main characters and a story that doesn't know how to draw any sort of conclusion. It felt like a dragged out story of an arc that at heart had the same goal as the overarching story, backstory which already fullfilled the role of the main story. I think there are some things in Claymore that are genuinely worth seeing and on which it can be recommended on and be easily enjoyed, but also plenty of shortcomings that definitely ruins the potential it has built. If the premise of Claymore genuinely interests you, you could watch it, but please consider the problems I've had with the series and if they have the potential to ruin the series for you too.",

            "content": "Scoring Preconditions: While I rate all parts, the overall score takes in most consideration from story, character, and enjoyment. Art and sound are not factors in the overall, although they can slightly enhance or detract from enjoyment portion. I score from as unbiased a view as possible and I view it in a critical sense, not in a simple enjoyment sense. Thus I give at most a one point overall bonus for enjoyment. Story and characters matter most. I will state exceptions to this rule depending on the anime.\r\nSummary: Without going into to much detail, this anime had a lot of potential but wasted alot of time. It's definitely more than your average run of the mill anime and the idea is unique. But it hit a brick wall. I discuss this more in the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10): Now before I say anything else, I'm going to say that on the basic idea alone the story would have been worth a 9 or higher. The only reason this show fell to a 6 here is because the ending left a gaping plot hole. Of course this ending may resonate with those who enjoy a cliffhanger ending - although it wasn't so much a cliffhanger as they just ran out of ideas. Besides the ending, the story arcs were well done. The introduction of Claire and Raki is nothing special but the decision for the next arc to be a flashback was pretty good. And of course flash forward to the present. It isn't clever but it is well executed, of course besides the ending. The original idea is both unique and interesting. The half demon idea of course isn't unique, but a lot of the elements of this plot are. The Yoma Claymore struggle is good to watch. The dark mood really resonates well with the story and creates a nice path to the final battle with Priscilla. It is a good story and well worth watching until they hit the wall.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10): Frankly the art wasn't all that appealing to me. I think the blade and Yoma art appeal well, but the human characteristics were kinda hard to swallow. Of course this was my personal opinion and this changes by viewer. But I found a lot of people who share my viewpoint on this.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): Raison d'Etre was probably the most perfect fit an opening could have for an anime like this. Nightmare's lead has that really strange and creepy voice that matches the mood so well. This is another in my playlist. Other background noises  were acceptable. The opening really is the reason for the 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10): On their own, the characters aren't much to look at. We have the weakest (and later strongest) claymore and a weak little human boy who really doesn't do much except maintain Claire's humanity. But, what is really great is that we see growth in Claire. Power is one thing, but through the flashback arc we get to see the transition and explanation of how she became a claymore. It was interesting to see how Claire changed throughout the plot. Raki...I'm not sure how to classify other than wimp. While the parallel with young human Claire is clearly visible, Raki is pretty useless and he stays that way throughout the plot. \"Oh but he keeps her humanity. That's so brave.\" Ummm yeah thats great but this is a battle between badass claymores and Yoma. What can Raki do when he can't even use a sword properly. I think he is a necessary character for the plot, but that doesn't make him an enjoyable one. Other characters are support. Necessary but non-unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): I'm not sure how I should classify my enjoyment. I thoroughly enjoyed everything but my happy meter just dropped like a rock after I hit the brick wall ending. I wouldn't have a problem if there were a second season, but seeing as there is none to explain what happens next, I have to downgrade my enjoyment here. But the battles were enjoyable to watch. It's not as if the battles were unique in any way but watching Claire continue using her yoma powers to the limit was pretty badass. Also the Yoma artwork gets mention here. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10): I think that for many people this rating might seem slightly harsh, but I'm averse to giving this anime more than a 6. The story blew up at the ending and while Claire was valuable, Raki was a pain. Seeing as even my enjoyment here fell from the ending, I have one major complaint about this anime that would have entirely changed my score had it been fixed: GET SOME FRICKIN CLOSURE ON THE PLOT!!!",

            "content": "I'm a sucker for super violent animes with lots of demons and/or people getting chopped up (Vampire Hunter D, Ninja Scroll, etc.), so this is definitely up my alley. Still, it has quite a few things that bug me. \r\nSometimes the animation is very obviously digital (Mostly the camera movements, some of the backgrounds as well. We're not talking well-integrated CGI here, it's obviously a budget thing), and it falls into some of the shonen cliches when someone busts out some badass new super power (though, admittedly, a lot of those really ARE super badass). There are a couple dozen musical cues, so that getspretty repetitive by the end as well (plus it sounds like they picked a completely wrong cue a few times in there).\\n\r\nAnd Raki. Oh, Raki. Mostly the character development in this show is perfectly satisfactory, even when it goes into an extended flashback that's... Well, long. But Raki is friggin' annoying. He is consistently a total idiot and then cries about his dumb decisions later. I understand his role as Clare's emotional grounding, but still, what a whiny stupid jerk. A humble hint to my readers: If you, a mere human, find yourself in the company of a badass super-powered part-demon woman and you are determined to follow and help her in her quest, learn to play SUPPORT. Basically, learn some escape art, be bait when that's needed, and do reconnaissance or healing or whatever when you'd be in the way. And please don't cry when you try to pick up a sword and aren't able to protect the girl from beings of godly power. She's protecting YOU, idiot.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that said, the fight scenes are brutal and cool as hell, the super powers are very super powered, and the themes are fairly interesting, if nothing particularly new. In the end, the good qualities make me enjoy it more than the flaws annoy me.",

Lots of decapitations and blood and action. The protagonist Clare is a \"Claymore\" or a 1/2 demon 1/2 human demon hunter. If these claymore use too much of their demon power they themselves will be engulfed by their dark side never to return. \r\nThis anime began as a potential masterpiece, but my expectations were crushed half way. What had started as a unique storyline and an awsome character was Infected by stereotypical MAIN STREAM elements that nearly destroyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI already gave the Main Plot~ As already said its starts off great and goes downhill in the end. It also has an even pace in the beggining, a perfect blend of plot of battles~ But in the end plot is thrown out the window just for constant battling, Cliche plot twists and complete disregard for story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI was rather happy with the animation^.^\\n\r\nMostly darker earthy hues~ but it makes a good contrast with the Claymore shiny swords and armor. The character animation was ok till you find out 90% of them look the same, it becomes hard to tell alot of them apart towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending were good, especially the ending &quot;Danzai no Hana&quot; which is perhaps one of the best ending themes of 2007. It completely matched the feeling of the entire anime.\\n\r\nThe OST itself is rather good, but it didn't stick out very much when I watched it myself. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As already said, the series starts off with very good characterizations, but in the end throws out their development and makes most of them into stereotype roles that were completely without motive. Besides the protagonist there was hardly any attempt at character development to begin with and they messed that up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I can honestly say I did enjoy 3/5 of the series. It had me on the edge of my seat, engrossed in the action and plot twists. The ending 2/5 were a total let down and nearly destroyed the entire anime~ but perhaps someone less picky than me could enjoy it? If all you like is battles and fireworks you will enjoy this anime~ \\n\\n\r\nOverall~ I've said all that needs to be said~\\n\r\nThis anime is acceptable... but far from a 10/10...\\n\\n\\n\\n",

In a move of brilliance, a secret dark society of Men in Black decided that the best way to combat Youma is to cross-breed them with human warriors, creatively called Claymores for the weapons they wielded.\r\nTheir first attempt was to use men, butthe power rush--akin to an orgasm--made all of them seek their Youma power and transform into insanely powerful \"Awakened\" beings and actually made the problem worse since the awakened warriors were infinitely more powerful than the Youma. \\n\\n\r\nThe sheer stupidity of pursuing the Claymore program is never commented on in the anime, since clearly the Awakened ones are more of a menace than the Youma, as they wage war and organize, while the Youma are content to munch on a leg or two here.\\n\\n\r\nSo now all Claymores are women.

And that's really the show. It's like Dragonball or Bleach. Powering up and a seemingly weak protagonist suddenly becoming all-powerful, and the usual escalation to more and more powerful opponents untl it becomes absurd--which is what the ending was. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly turned my media player off and said: \"Are you shitting me?\"\\n\\n\r\nYes, it's that silly. And it takes itself seriously, that's the saddest part.",

            "content": "I found this anime to be among the most disappointed ones. It started very good, and followed the manga, which is very good, too. Then... it went horribly wrong.\r\nStory: As I mentioned, the story started very good. It was simple yet have some depth in it; love, hatred, revenge ... it had all. And slaying demons are never boring, in a good show. But all the potential in the world does not guarantee anything; from episode 20, the series branched off from the manga, and had one of the most disappointed ending ever. It made people feel incomplete. What is going to happen to them,who were the leader of the Claymores ...? The manga is still far from end, and making an anime based on a good yet to end was a bad idea. And the result? A disappointed storyline.\\n\r\nArt, and sound: not much to complain, they are good. Sweet animation; perfectly fit in the classic shonen hack n' slash action. It was just good. The music, awesome. 9 for both Art and Sound.\\n\r\nCharacters: amazing and unique characters. All the Claymores were unique; and I loved that. The only thing that held the character point from getting any higher was Raki. He was supposed to be a key main character, but he turned out to be a weak boy who always got into the middle of the battle and Claire had to get him out. And for a long time, he had nothing to do with everything happening in the show. Didin't he supposed to be cool and important? So lame!\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this series from the beginning till' it was 10 minutes before the final episode ended. As I mentioned, the ending left me an overwhelming disappointment. What's the point of such ending? I had the felling that the show had just started, even it was the last episode. Then I decided to burned this anime to DVD and locked it up forever, unless they made a sequel. Rewatch value: 0. Enjoyment before you hit the final: 10/10. Disappointment after you hit the stop button: 100/10. So, 5/10.\\n\r\nOverall: Claymore was supposed to be an extrememly good anime. But the story made a horrible turn at episode 20 and hit disaster at the last episode. I want a sequel or a remake! If it is a remeke, let just forget episode 20 and onward, and make it the way the manga is. 6/10",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nClaymore is a perfect example of an anime  that tries desperately hard to be dark, but completely and utterly fails. This show demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of what actually makes an anime mature.  The result is a series of boring, brainless, deus ex machina-filled, melodramatic fight scenes with a static plot and uninteresting/indistinguishable characters (with the exception of one). Tag on an ugly, almost monochromic animation style (in my opinion), an inconsistent soundtrack, and an unsatisfying ending, and you've got yourself a tremendously overrated anime.\r\nPlot: 3/10\r\nIn a world where demonic predators called Yoma exist only to kill and eat humans bydisguising themselves as other humans, a mysterious organization creates half-human, half-Yoma warriors known as the \"Silver Eyed Witches\", or more commonly, \"Claymores\". The story begins with a young boy named Raki who has lost everything in a Yoma attack. He meets Clare, a Claymore, who agrees to let him travel along-side her and experience her Yoma-slaying occupation.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with Claymore's plot is that it is based on nothing but classic shounen fighting/screaming and melodrama where whoever screams and grunts the loudest is the winner, but it THINKS that it is also about deep psychological themes and \"what makes us human\". The later aspects are completely butchered and the former aspects are exactly what they sound like.\\n\\n\r\nTo give an example: there is a great story arc in the beginning of the show about a Claymore named Teresa and a little girl named Clare. Clare has lost everything and has nowhere else to turn, so she starts following Teresa around. Teresa, who essentially feels no human emotions due to the fact that she is a Claymore, is indifferent to the girl at first, but they eventually grow to have a very touching relationship. This relationship is clearly supposed to parallel the relationship that Clare and Raki now have with each other; someone who thinks she has lost her humanity is proved wrong by a child who has lost everything and grows to see her as a motherly figure. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, Claymore was shaping up to be a very good anime. However, as soon as that arc ends, we get nothing that comes even remotely close to the character development and good themes that we just saw. The relationship between Rocky and Clare receives no further development and eventually decides to go in a, ummm, \"different\", direction than the one that preceded it. Let's just say the lines become very blurry when it comes to what Clare and Raki actually are to each other.\\n\\n\r\nButchering the potential of telling a touching story wouldn't have been as bad if the plot that they DID give us wasn't so generic and boring. In addition to the slow pacing, it's just the classic: \"Fight the monsters! Get revenge! Get stronger!\" kind of plot that really has nothing to offer that you haven't already seen.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show thinks it is being dark and mature by not being afraid to kill off pointless side characters, but it completely fails to make us care about those characters or what they are fighting for. They continuously hint at the Organization being secretly evil, but that never leads anywhere. The characters all have either shallow motivations (such as revenge) or no motivations at all and are just working as puppets of \"The Organization\". The fights are all predictable, the side characters add absolutely nothing (more on them later), and the ending is extremely unsatisfying. Everything that the show was building up to abruptly stops, an archetypical shounen moral is quickly crammed in our face, and then it just sort of\u2026 ends. There is certainly nothing special about Claymore's plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nTaste in art is subjective, but I really dislike the dark and boring color palate used in Claymore. It fails to set a good atmosphere, and the blood effects are terrible. The EXACT same effect is used over and over and over again and it doesn't even look good! It just looks like a bunch of red lines coming out of the wound! And don't get me started on the way, way overused trope of two people running past each other, swinging their swords at each other, there is a long pause, and THEN somebody starts bleeding! I'm pretty sure claymore uses that stereotype in every single episode. Once or twice is fine, but come on!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack sometimes works and sometimes does not. Average OP and ED. The voice acting is average. The sound effects were really below average though. I kid you not: they use the Star Wars gun sound effect in this anime, on multiple occasions! It feels so random and out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nBefore I talk about the personalities of the characters, let me just say one thing: Claymore might win the award for worst character design in anime history. News flash guys! You can only have so many characters with blonde hair, silver eyes, and the exact same outfit before it becomes impossible tell them apart! Good luck trying to remember the name of the characters in this anime, I mean seriously! I was happy whenever one of them died because that was one less to keep track of.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the characters in Claymore are certainly nothing special. Clare is the same as any other stereotypical shounen protagonist, except she is a girl. She is motivated almost solely by revenge and the only thing different about her is her relationship with Raki, but I already touched on how that was botched. As the protagonist, she is constantly busting out deus ex machina after deus ex machina to the point that it just becomes unbearable. \\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about Raki. He is a genuine character, clearly expressing his feelings at all times, but he is also very annoying, particularly towards the end. He starts out as someone who is easy to feel sympathy for; he has nothing left and the way he latches on to Clare is touching at first, but since that plot element receives no development, it just becomes stale and irritating. He ends up getting in the way more often then he helps anyone.\\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of one, the side characters are worthless. Occasionally one of them might receive 3 minutes of development, but the only purpose they serve is death fodder. I can't remember the names of more then 3 of them, and there were dozens.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I truly liked was Teresa. She is the only character who we really get to see go through a change; she goes from a cold emotionless tool who mindlessly kills for the sake of \"The Organization\" to a loving person who realizes that she is still human. If Teresa had gotten a LOT more screen time, I would have probably enjoyed Claymore.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nAs a relatively highly rated shounen, I must say that Claymore fails to live up to it's hype. It simply doesn't differentiate itself from the rest of the genre in any meaningful way (a female-dominated cast is unique but poorly written). The plot is static , uninteresting, and peaks after the first real storyarc, the animation is not appealing, and the characters are nothing special. If you are looking for a unique shounen, you won't find it here. If you are a fan of shounen in general though, I could see how you could enjoy it. Personally, it wasn't my cup of tea.",

            "content": "For me, Claymore has been an anime that has given so much mixed emotion over the past days that I have watched it. Emotions both surprisingly positive and unsurprisingly negative, to a point that I just had to write a review about it, both because of sheer enjoyment of how I experienced the show but mostly because of how much I was disappointed in its presentation.\r\nTo start off in the notion of why I enjoyed it, it was because not of its theme (humans< monsters< half-human half-monster< protagonist) but because somewhere down the line when I was watching the show, it gets interestingly good.Not to spoil the content for the readers but, there are certain times where the show hooks you pretty well because the series of events in the show actually was getting good.\\n\\n\r\nBut with that been said, let us go to the bad side of the case. I was mostly disappointed that it, most of the time, leaves the viewers wanting for more than what we came for. The story progression in Claymore is like a roller coaster to begin with, slows start, progressing high during the middle but when you reach the top of the roller coaster to see the climax of the story, so that you can enjoy the ending, it just stops. And that\u2019s the problem I have with the show. It\u2019s like a fisherman catching the interest of the little fish viewers, patiently waiting for us to bite the bait so he can reel us in for the epic kill, but disappointingly pulls up the fishing line before we even got a chance to take a bite.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to top it all off, it happens in every arc, up until the ending.\\n\r\nBut enough of that for now, let\u2019s talk about the character design and development. I\u2019m going to make a point that the character design in Claymore had a similar feel to it with being in a comic book or a particular show where every hero wears a motorcycle helmet for a mask. The good guys have same bland costume and body structure, but different voices and hair style (with the great exception of the protagonist and some supporting characters), while the bad guys, well, they were a bit too similar to begin with, but the design gets progressively good as the story goes on, but they do have this issue that they never seem to run out of, as the saying goes, \u2018this is not my final form\u2019, only to get hacked to chunky bits in the end because the story wants the good guys to always win. The personality of the different characters of the story was at least a giver of ways for the same looking characters to shine, so I\u2019m no longer going to point out the fact that there were at least certain elements of moe (personality speaking to be the very least).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in Claymore has been a 50-50 battle of whether or not it\u2019s good or bad because it did well to develop the main characters and the main supporting characters in the story (If you\u2019re wondering, yes, there is such a thing as main supporting character in this story), but it\u2019s a double-edged sword for the other characters because they tried to make every character that way, but ended up failing in that aspect, so the minor support characters ended up looking half-baked. And to top it all off, there was one point in the story, somewhere in the middle, where one of the main protagonist (Claire\u2019s pet human boy), who was supposedly a main character, suddenly became a main supporting character down the line. It was like, Claire, who was once just a main supporting character in the story, became progressively the main character in the end, and her pet human boy, who was once the main character of the story, became a cameo in the middle and made an unsatisfying appearance in the end. The fact that he was there just to drive the protagonist forward and no longer appeal to the viewers, was just irritating when he made his grand appearance in the end. I\u2019m no longer going to mention the other main support characters in the story because, it\u2019s either they were good enough to understand in such a short span of only one arc or that they were too minor to begin with, but the story seemed to revolve around them for some time anyway, so it would be wrong to call them just a supporting character [SPOILER WARNING] (given that most of the supporting characters in the story all end up dead anyway) [END OF SPOILER].\\n\\n\r\nAlso, just to let out a bit of frustration out of watching the show, [SPOILER WARNING] CLIFF-HANGGERS EVERYWHERE!!![END OF SPOILER]  I mean it\u2019s redonculous to a point that there\u2019s so much more things left unanswered. I mean not to spoil the show in any way but, there is still so much questions that is still hanging. I am no longer going to mention all of it for the fear I might spoil the show to the readers, but you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about when you\u2019re done with the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to fly back to another planet before I change into my final fantasy form and fight the most bad ass boss that\u2019ll probably have his own final form as well.

And great-looking Claymores... girls,who lost their destinies through sacrificing themselves for the mankind serving?

Claymore easily ripes illusions.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I`ll return to anime. It`s much spoken about Clare and Teresa already. I want only to say: don`t you think that everyone can find similiarities in his and Claymore`s lives? Each of us had tragedies, losses... same like they. Each of us found ourselves in filthy situations... same like they. But go on fighting - and you will go through them with honour. That is what Claymores teach us.\\n\r\nP.S.

Just to state beforehand, I am not going to stress on it being an adaptation and bringing in the manga to quote everything - I'll consider the anime as an anime, notas a 'meant to be a faithful adaptation to a certain manga.'\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Claymore is intriguing. Its start gives off the air of Blood+ or Muv-Luv in that it portrays an issue and gives its solution - defining the universe in terms of those monster/hunter/prey and similar characteristics while the rest of the elements like the time era and the culture remains as secondary. It is a fine approach, nothing wrong with it but it does give the initial vibe of the mainstream anime story progression (won't go into details there) and does not keep attention as did Another, Deadman Wonderland and Mirai Nikki (for me) in their first episodes. However I always say that animes should be given certain episodes to develop - I know many people who dislike Code Geass based only on first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when the person gives time to this anime, then the culture, the environment, the physics of the universe slowly start to unravel in more detail, and in a more relevant manner. An example is that the initial \"Queen's Blade\" vibe of all female fighters is slowly shattered and the person emerges from a world of simple monster vs hunter to a much complicated and gripping universe. I do wonder how the story line elements hinted yet left out of the anime were tackled in the manga but the slight graze of the side story isn't a negative, it eventually gives the story a multi-purpose and while the anime concludes on ONE of these 'purposes', the rest are a well thought way to keep the viewer motivated to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically the anime is a well developed story, complex and intruiging HOWEVER, the ending retracted back to typical anime-ish. Wish I could give a comparison but it would be near equal to a spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the very big positives in Claymore for me was the art. The art style was very impressive and enjoyable. Let's consider it a little more technically. The background was well managed, with detail where necessary and reflecting the over all ambiance of the time.  The color scheme was suitable and the art was fluid especially in many fighting sequences. If we consider character art, the females certainly were similar in most traits, however they had believable proportions... not only in terms of the bust size but thighs, arms and over all stature. Yes, similar but they were all fighters and I suppose they could have varied the height a little but otherwise the physique should be more or less the same. The lips and eyes were designed very well - I loved many characters in how appealing they looked not due to a hanging cleavage but due to a decent art style. The basic monster art was also impressive, the lesser monsters were more or less generic but they still didn't look... bad.\\n\\n\r\nI would say here that an all blonde congregation was not really the best idea.... especially since many gave the first impression of being 'elvish'... but ah well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound however was a... 30/70 for me. 70 in the negative. The sound tracks were certainly unique and some did have quite the appeal but they were executed at very awkward moments making one confused for a moment whether they are interpreting the overall atmosphere in the wrong way. So not really a fan of the music however I enjoyed the voice acting and the sound effects reflecting actions or movement.\\n\\n\r\nNow the character development was a roller coaster for me. Lets see... considering the main prominent characters... Clare, the protagonist, an emotionless warrior, brutal in her fights against the monsters but calm alongside, a balanced character with a clear vision that doesn't waver but needs to be reminded in between since there are slight 'additions' to her goals. There isn't much complex about her, she had a past that carved her present and if there are complexities to her personality that isn't shown in the present story. Her interaction with other characters is also justified and reasonable.\\n\\n\r\nRaki... the... pathetic side kick that has... okay lets tackle him a little properly. When you are alone and helpless and are dependent on someone that has far superior intelligence, exposure, endurance skills than you and is mentally a lot more stable, you are supposed to... what? Depend on them. You stick around, give them company, comfort yourself and them. We see another relationship in the anime comparable to what he and Clare have and THAT was BEAUTIFULLY executed. His wasn't. Why? Raki has to impose his sense of helplessness every other episode, he has to lecture Clare every other episode over what is right or wrong, has to butt into every single situation when he isn't required... I mean... just stop being an annoying pest! I disliked that character a lot and the story line plus a few other major characters kept me watching.\\n\\n\r\nTERESA, a secondary character that does have a huge impact on the story was well handled. The best handled character. You can understand her, see how she thinks and understand how it makes sense. Her interaction with other characters was very believable. I won't go into much details but she was easily my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nMiria and other characters too have a personality defined yet they are not so constricted to it that you find them completely 1-D. They have certain traits to them that keep them believable characters. Yes, there are certain characters you will be able to identify in other animes as well (like the typical fight crazed guy) but the over character development is good. Just ignore Raki and you'll like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow... if we were to sum it up to enjoyment... then it was a certainly enjoyable anime that had me waiting to know more - more than was shown in the anime but it kept me on the edge, it kept me guessing in places and the only part that did piss me off were it being incomplete and where they ended. The way the ended it didn't justify the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo a good anime over all with decent fighting sequences, a story with various elements and if you ignore the character Raki and just try to get over the ending than a VERY good watch!\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and Feed back is more than welcome!",

            "content": "Don't let the creepy designs and macabre setup fool you, despite its appearance Claymore is a shonen anime at its core, which means lots of weird powers and grand-scale fight scenes, speeches about honor and friendship, a conga line of weird villains, and a whole lot of swinging swords and screaming. I know that the word \"shonen\" makes some anime fans cringe on sight, but it is not automatically a bad thing. There are many shone titles that have stood out positively over the years, whether through captivating heroes and villains (Rurouni Kenshin, Yu Yu Hakusho), a polished and distinctive style (Soul Eater) or somesurprisingly mature themes thrown into the mix (Fullmetal Alchemist). While Claymore doesn't really excel in any of these categories, it is at least competent and often above-average in many of them, placing it a red and purple bloodstained cut above most shows of its ilk.\\n\\n\r\nThe name Madhouse usually promises at least above-average production values, and this is no exception. The backgrounds are expansive and nicely detailed, and Yagi's unusual, distinctive character designs are generally well-maintained throughout the many fighting scenes, not to mention some of the monster designs are just plain wicked. The action itself is half-and half. On one hand, this was definitely adapted from a manga, and during some of the less inspired battles you can practically see the seams from the panels being stitched together: speed lines, quick motions that look more like teleporting, all the shortcuts normally associated with shonen fighter series are here. Thankfully, the strong animation budget softens the blow considerably, with a fairly consistent level of detail, and when it's time to show off during a pivotal battle, the choreography and design work can get really impressive. In a nutshell, this show looks a lot like Naruto and Bleach, only a little more grizzled and much better.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore boasts a rich and diverse music score that mixes folksy strings and winds with modern electric noise, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to have any idea what to do with it. The music direction is so incredibly hit-and-miss that I honestly have to wonder what the show's creators were thinking for some of the choices they made. It will start too late and overstay its welcome, rarely playing loudly enough to make a noticeable impression and often completely failing to match the beat of whatever is happening on-screen. The end result is consistently either forgettable or distracting and only occasionally manages to hit the right beat. I half-suspect that they just went to a composer, asked for an appropriate soundtrack, and then put it on shuffle over the show and called it a day; if someone told me that was the case, I might actually believe it because some of the pieces would have been perfect if they weren't playing over the wrong scene. I should clarify, it's not that bad all the time, and sometimes it actually works really well, but it only takes a few slip-ups to sour the experience and there are more than enough to make this shortcoming noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-wise, this series is a bit atypical for shonen in that it lends itself to low, threatening intonations instead of the overwrought screaming you usually hear. The Japanese track is a lot of fun to listen to in this regard from start to finish. By contrast, the English dub starts off a little on the dull side, but after awhile the voice actors really grow into their roles so that by the end, both tracks are solid listens. I do have one bone to pick with the dub, and that is Todd Haberkorn's portrayal of Raki. Haberkorn is a very good actor, don't get me wrong, but his voice is a little too snide and snarky to play innocence convincingly, resulting in Raki sounding overly whiny at all the wrong moments, whereas Motoki Takagi was able to carry the character more naturally. On the plus side, Brina Palencia turns out a fantastic performance as Priscilla, able to capture all her childlike purity and twist it into something hideous. Priscilla is a more interesting character than Raki, so I'll take it.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside its shonen trappings for a moment, Claymore is not an entirely brainless story. This series is at its very best when it is portraying the most basic, carnal side of humanity: fear of the unknown. Humans don't know or understand the Claymores that protect them any better than the Yoma that hunt them, and they're understandably afraid to get close enough to find out. The Claymores do nothing to discourage this attitude toward them, they're cold and often intimidating toward their charges, and as we find out more about them it becomes clearer and clearer that even if they tried to be accepted among humans, what they are would make that more or less impossible. Priscilla's origin story (which also covers Clare's backstory) is a definite high point of the show, clearly showing just how dangerous being \"too human\" can be when you're constantly battling monsters both within and without. Unfortunately, said flashback takes place from episodes five to nine out of twenty-six, and it's generally not a good sign when a series reaches its high point so early on.\\n\\n\r\nNot that the rest of the show is in complete nowhere land, there are still some good bits here and there, but after unloading its guns far too early the show has to keep its audience entertained almost purely on action sequences, so it's a good thing the action is still fun to watch. This is how a shonen action title needs to be done: lots of cool heroes and scary villains with weird and memorable powers, a simple (rather stupid) plot, maybe a little conspiracy thrown in somewhere, and none of that waxing philosophical nonsense. Most of the characters can be boiled down to \"how they fight\" and \"why they fight\", but who cares as long as they're still entertaining? It's a little darker and bloodier than its classmates from the school of Jump, which lends it a distinct flavor and a bit more of an edge. The darker and more twisted this show gets, the more wicked the villains and the more intense the battles, the better. Seriously, forget the heroes, forget the ordinary rank-and-file Yoma, the major villains like Ophelia, Riful and of course Priscilla are the real reason to watch this show. That, and all the creative ways the show finds to cut its characters to tiny bits.\\n\\n\r\nThe low point of the show is undoubtedly Raki, and not just because of the voice acting. Make no mistake, he could have been a very important character to help Clare rediscover what it means to be human and given her the companionship she needed to let her past go, but for the most part his role borders on that of her pet (she even gets called out on this at one point). As the first human to ever view her as a person rather than a monster I get why he's so important to her, but throughout the series he constantly needs to be protected by Clare while offering very little in return. He tries to learn how to fight, but he's only human and never really gets a chance to be useful, and as far as good company goes his relationship with her is underdeveloped. If they spent more time talking to one another and had more of a natural chemistry things might be different, but most of their conversations are just generic fare along the lines of: \"I'll definitely protect you, you're really important to me, blah, blah, blah\", which is a shame. He's a tag-along character done wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the show remains consistently entertaining from start to... well, not quite to finish. Continuing to rub salt on the wounds, Claymore ends with a \"read the manga\" conclusion, and a pretty poor one at that. The final arc of the TV series concludes a little too easily while ignoring all the hanging plot threads you could've sworn were leading to something much bigger and signing off with a hokey declaration that \"the adventure continues\" (okay, they don't actually say that). The possibility of a second season covering subsequent events is looking a little slimmer with every passing year, so you'll have to read the manga if you want answers.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it is, Claymore offers a slightly atypical, fairly engaging take on the tired Shonen Jump formula. It doesn't really live up to its potential of being a dark and mature fantasy, but it's still fun to watch and as far as shonen goes that's really all that matters. It doesn't have much to offer anyone aside from the usual action fans, but if you want to see badass ladies fighting monsters with swords, give this the time of day and see if it sates your craving.",

            "content": "Welcome to my first review.\r\nA friend of mine recommended this anime to me, and I told him when the series ended that it was a nice catch. Claymore is one of the best anime's that I had seen this year. It's medieval theme and kick-ass female characters is what this anime is payed for. Claymore made a stand through the masses with it's compelling and brilliant story. \r\nThe story goes as the protagonist, Clare, fights for her humanity and seeks revenge to the Claymore named Priscilla who miserably ended the life of her most precious person, Teresa. As Clare struggles to fight and finds outthe reason of her existence, the whole story revolves on another person named Raki and as the two of them shared the same fate, they found themselves driven to the organization's darkest secrets. \\n\r\nThe story is indeed stunning and I congratulate Norihiro Yagi for making it possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is made by Madhouse, which is by far my most favorite animation company. They did well on the animation as expected from them. Even though the animation were sometimes &quot;off&quot;. The characters, background and the animation effects were good and the battle scenes are worth dying for. \\n\\n\r\nThe one who's responsible for this Anime's industrial-inspired music is Masunori Takumi, the BGM's were used very cleverly and the composition for each and every one of them was awesome, from the heavy guitar riffs and even to the Orchestral scores, it's very intelligent.   The Jrock band Nightmare performed Raison D'etre and I'd say that it fits the anime very well and so it is indeed true that the rumors i've heard about them being the band whos currently having a large fanbase all over in Japan, they're a band that is worth following for. As for the Ending theme which Kosaka Riyu made, her voice is powerful and the composition of her song Danzai no Hana is a true fit for the &quot;Medieval&quot; theme that Claymore has.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Claymore is indeed, Worth watching and I pity those who won't. :P Just kidding. Seriously it's worth a watch, and one proof to materialize that is I recommended this in my friends and none of them missed it and said that &quot;It was a nice ride&quot;.",

            "content": "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. \r\nI will begin with saying that this is particularly true for Claymore. On the second hand i must note that this was the first of all anime I ever watched - my boat to the new unexplored horizons that awaited me...so this review might tend to be emotional, irrational, illogical, subjective and biased :)   This is of course because it holds a special place for me among anime world.\r\nStory (7): Revenge, conspiracy, redemption, comradeship, existence and purpose are the key motives of this story. Story of finding something that keeps you going on,something worth fighting for and ultimately give your life, one thing that is truly your own. It can be said bluntly that it's about hunting demons with big swords and shady organizations with evil intents but I observe it from another perspective-trough motivation, exposed and subtle meaning. This kind of stories tend to be vessels for character growth so light shifts to characters as the most prominent and strongest aspect of the show. This is by no means bad thing as Claymore is first and foremost story about Claymores themselves - beautiful silver eyed witches.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9): There are truly many memorable characters from Claymore. Clare is our main character and the \"media\" which links other protagonist, the future and the past. As a monster/demon huntress which are by the common folk simply called Claymores, she is on a path of self exploration, of finding something she lost. She is of unbreakable spirit, and as the twirl of events unfolds, she dares to hope, to hope that there is more to existence than staining her sword with demon blood. Raki, young boy who lost his family to Yoma (demons) accompanies Claire on her travels. As time passes he eventually finds way to Claire's inner-self and the feelings she thought lost long time ago being always a cold huntress! Bond of love, trust and friendship is forged between them but events get them separated and both of them struggle to unify with each other once again. Other characters also contribute to this great anime: Teresa, Irene, Jean, Miria...their motivations lead the story onwards. Character interactions, their intervened relations, conceive emotionally moving and warm moments thus for me are surely highlight of Claymore.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): Madhouse - there is no need, I believe, to specially introduce this studio. Their work speaks for themselves (Black Lagoon, Death Note, Devil May Cry, Hellsing Ultimate...) and Claymore is of course no different. Madhouse style is clearly present and so is the quality. There could be some nitpicking about consistency but overall nothing short of great. Must note that I watched also blu-ray edition whose clarity of picture and sound is excellent and pure enjoyment that really gives due credit to beautiful artwork and animation of studio Madhouse, same time giving anime new dimension.\\n\\n\r\nMusic (10): Excellent and memorable. Soundtrack for Claymore is one of the best of all times combining strong dark bassy tunes and then some soothing guitar ones, beautiful bagpipes sounds, folkloric flute melodies...rarely you will find soundtrack of such caliber. I deeply enjoyed every moment of it. Powerful opening and ending songs (Raison d'etre by Nightmare and Guilty sky by Riyu Kosaka) just add up to this awesome piece, also making one of mine favorite openings of all time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment (9):\\n\r\nI'm quite sure that i didn't cover all of the aspects of Claymore and as such this review is to be faulty in that manner. I humbly tried to present my view on enjoyment this anime provided to me and reasons for doing so, therefore I believe this could also serve as my tribute to Claymore - the first anime I ever watched and than after quite some time decided to write a review. Now I'm glad that this was my first venture in the world of anime  because it sucked me in and presented me in best manner what that world has to offer: great artwork and style, beautiful strong music, emotional connection with characters, sense of immersion, tense and awesome battles...\\n\r\nAs the whole is greater then sum of its parts so is Claymore as a whole more then just its artwork, characters, music... combined they make Claymore shine! As for me, on my anime sky, Claymore will always, like the Sirius, shine brightest.    \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!",

            "content": "Claymore is one of the most intelligent shonen anime that has come out in recent years. It has a pretty good, though rather classic plot of revenge. For a story synopsis go to animenfo.com. In any case, here\\'s my review up to eps 14.\r\nWe see that the main character, Clare, does grow throughout the series so far, which means in each episode something happens and she is changed by it, and through out the story arcs, she is either benefited by the events or suffers the consequences whether she wants or not. I can talk about this character as if she were a real lifeperson precisely because the balance of things that happen to her - I don\\'t mean that she gets exactly half good and half bad as she journeys, but I mean she has her good days; she has her awesome days; she has her awful days, and she has her almost dying days. She grows through it all. \\n\\n\r\nShe has suffered a ton in her life time, and as a woman, she\\'s seen a lot of dark side in men. Yet she\\'s still on the job, partially because she doesn\\'t want to quit. There are rules bounding her but we can assume that she can leave and go in hiding if she desired. But she doesn\\'t quit her job. Why is that? \\n\\n\r\nI think she has a sense that the rules of the game are to be followed, maybe not completely to the T, as sometimes she goes out and bend some of them, but not breaking them. There are priorities over organizational rules, after all, especially when it comes to saving a life and nurturing it. She learns that from her previous experience when she was in the position of being nurtured. However, at the same time, she nurtured the person who was supposedly the strong one (this happen when she was young and wasn\\'t a Claymore). Something within Clare made her a strong person even before she grew up to become a Claymore - she recognized pain and suffering similar to hers.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the things happened to her, she\\'s still going strong. She risks her life and being discovered (she\\'s currently hiding) when she sees her comrades desperately need help; even though she\\'s not quite powerful yet and her opponents-would-be are extremely powerful - a classic component of shonen anime. Here, I\\'ll go into the shonen stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore is a shonen show with its classic plots - revenge, skilling up/powering up, mentors who train, and someone that comes out and help during the most desperate-to-the-urgency-of-death situation (hopefully only one). The biggest and the most obvious twist here is that all the strong characters are women - all the roles that would\\'ve been filled by men in the classic shonen (Saint Seiya comes to mind) are filled by women in this case. What marks it apart from a lot of other shonen is the fact that it doesn\\'t drag on and on and give out mindless battles or tournaments. That means everyone that the main character has to fight has a good reason to be there, and some of them do indeed come back later, like many shonen shows, but not because they just do, or they have some simple reason like they just want to come back for another round, but these characters all have their reasons, some forced, some by choices, and some by both.\\n\\n\r\nWhat happens earlier definitely affects what happens later. Friends and enemies are made later because of earlier events and encounters (this anime would make a great RPG).\\n\\n\r\nBecause the plot doesn\\'t drag - the anime came out when the manga is already on vol. 13 or 14 (I can\\'t remember), which means they have a wealth of materials to work with, the arcs are well developed and I don\\'t see any unnecessary fillers (at least not yet, I can\\'t remember if this is slated to be a 26 eps series), each episode does something to move the story forward. That\\'s what a good storyteller should do. In addition to that, the important characters are distinctive and form deep impressions, the unimportant characters mark their short impression and then they\\'re forgotten and don\\'t take too much of the viewer\\'s attention for too long. All these are important to a good storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nThis show only suffers a little bit of cliches from shonen anime - one occurrence of ex deus machina. It also has other classic shonen characters like mentor that takes the disciple for training when the disciple has been badly defeated, sociopath characters, sidekicks, and a couple other smaller ones. But these traits get developed the right way, pile those with good character developments and an intriguing  overall plot with good small arcs and you\\'ve got an awesome storying that retells the classic revenge in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other elements such as Art, animation, sound - it\\'s production I.G. and  I\\'ll leave those for others to review, because...\\n\\n\r\nthis review is too freakin\\' long! I commend you for reading this far. Good job! =D\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I obviously like it. For the reason see above! =D\\n",

            "content": "Claymore is a Shounen, Action, Adventure anime in a Fantasy, Medieval setting. The story basically revolves around a specific Claymore \"Clare\" and her companion \"Raki\" as she goes from town to town, slaying monsters known as Yoma.\r\nFrom the beginning the story is very easy to follow. You have Claymores (strong female warriors) and it is the job of these Claymores to slay the Yoma. The story basically follows Clare as she travels to slay these Yoma, which get increasingly difficult to defeat as the story goes on. As a character Clare is developed so well that your opinion of her will change constantly throughout theseries. Knowing her past before she became a Claymore and her current self makes it hard to believe that those two are the same person. What's disappointing is that some of the other main characters are not as developed as Clare but at least they produced good enough results. Raki being the main supporting character is really the only annoying character and doesn't really bring much to the story. As the story goes on it changes completely from the original hunt and kill Yoma, onto a more interesting and compelling storyline with amazing battles.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight sequences are just amazing and what helps it is the superb animation quality, thanks to &quot;Madhouse&quot; (also producer of &quot;Death Note&quot;). A lot of detail is put into every aspect of animation, with amazing lighting effects, detailed backgrounds and realistic character models. It is great to see all this kept during the bloody fight sequences however I do feel some corners are cut which just loses some of its essence (e.g. when the arms move so fast it does the typical DBZ speed attacking effect).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic with a magnificent orchestral score mixed in with some wicked bass and rockin' tunes. It's perfect in setting the right atmosphere; drama or action, it does well in both however there are times, mostly during fights, that the music can get a little messy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this ends up becoming an interesting anime that actually brings something new to the saturated shounen anime market. It manages to stay true to the manga storyline throughout however the story ends up moving at a very fast pace but the benefit of this is that every episode counts and there isn't any screen time wasted by: pointless flashback, training episodes, prolong deaths, etc. It's a shame that the anime deviated from the manga slightly near the end, which is bad news to manga fans and it means there's less chance for it continuing.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "The Claymore manga was written by Yagi Norihiro from May of 2001 all the way until October 2014. Yes, it just finished. Roughly midway through the manga's run, in 2007, it got an anime adaptation from Madhouse. Now, I have not read a single chapter of the manga, so I'm not going to notice how faithfully they adapted the portion of the manga they adapted. The question is, does the anime manage to be interesting and coherent with what it does use?\r\nStory:\r\nIn the world of Claymore, monsters called \u201cYoma\u201d roam around the land disguising as ordinary humans and eating their guts. In order to combatthese beings an organization with no name creates warriors that are human-Yoma hybrids, the titular Claymores. Our narrative follows a particular Claymore named Clare as she travels the land, fighting Yoma and completing missions for the organization. You quickly learn that there's a particular Yoma she's chasing after to take revenge for the death of someone she loved. Unfortunately, the one she's chasing is a particularly powerful variety called an awakened being. So, how does the series manage the premise?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the problems. The biggest one is the ending. Now, let's be as fair as possible. There's no way they could go through the story of the entire manga, even if you only include the bits that had been released at that point. That being said, the part they do end on is kind of rushed and very much unsatisfying. A lot of the story is also pretty standard action fare. It isn't really bad, but it does nothing new either. Clare goes to a place, fights a thing, gets stronger, lather, rinse and repeat.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there are some good things about the story too. The episodes that deal with Clare's back story are quite brilliant. The series also does build up a world that has a lot of potential intrigue, although it isn't nearly taken full advantage of in the anime. The series is also good about introducing major plot points well in advance of the point in the story that they become really important.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMost of the major characters in Claymore are quite interesting. The Claymores are nicely varied and the best character moments in the series are among them. The biggest issue with them is that most of their basic back stories are all very samey, at least the ones you see. Dead family because of Yoma and then she became a Claymore. I suppose it does make sense given the sacrifices they have to make to become Claymores. Doesn't seem like the thing you'd get into if you had a loving and supportive family but it still gets a bit repetitive when the series wants you to feel sorry for a particular character because of her tragic past that happens to be virtually identical to the tragic pasts of all of these other characters. The antagonists do have some depth to them too, which is nice for an action oriented series. The secondary characters are largely under-developed, but most of them serve well enough for what they need to do.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all that let's get to the big problem the series suffers from in terms of characters, Raki. Just imagine the most obnoxious, useless sidekick character you can think of and you've probably got a character similar to Raki. He's a young boy who gets rescued by Clare and then starts following her around while contributing nothing of value to anything. As a narrative device, he serves two purposes. The first is to give the series an excuse to explain information about the organization. Which could have been done without him if they'd been clever with their dialogue. The other purpose he serves is to give Clare an anchor to her humanity. Although I would argue that they could have easily made her a stronger character by giving her a more introspective anchor, like her memories of Teresa or her own determination, and dispensed with the twit altogether. But instead we had to have this obnoxious brat with no good dialogue or moments. I don't know what ultimately happens to him in the manga, but I hope it involves death by fire.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of positives about the art. The action scenes are magnificent. The backgrounds are vivid and nicely detailed. They also do put effort into making the Claymores look different in spite of them all having the same outfits, hair and eye colours. There are two major problems with the art, though. The first is the way they do blood. This is one of those series where blood frequently spurts from wounds as though it's shooting out of a high pressure hose. Furthermore, the lighting in some scenes makes the Yomas' blood look like a neon purple hue. Which is practically guaranteed to drain the tension given how silly it looks when a liquid that strongly resembles grape kool-aid is spraying into the air. The second problem is the outfit that claymores wear. It's a tight, white bodysuit with a cape and the only armoured bits are around the shoulders, fingerless gloves and making up the skirt. Now, they can regenerate quite a bit of damage but it still makes no sense for them to leave quite literally all of their vitals exposed. Nor does it make sense for them to wear something that's going to ride up in the worst ways into battle.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey did get some really good actors. Kuwashima Houko, who also showed up in last week's review as Kita Michiru, voices Clare. Paku Romi, Mizuki Nana, Orikasa Ai, Takayama Minami and Inoue Kikuko all give great performances. The one weakness is Raki's actor, Takagi Motoki. That isn't to say he's a bad actor, I really haven't heard him in enough roles to make a good judgment, but he plays a character who spends the bulk of his dialogue either crying or being vaguely perky. As such, he doesn't get the chance to demonstrate any real range. The music is pretty standard stuff, except when it comes to tragic or intense scenes. The composition work in those is really good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere is a bit of les-yay in this series. Clare's attachment to Teresa comes across as a young girl's first crush. Jean and Clare get some subtext laden moments. Several of the other Claymores get scenes with each other that could be read as having romantic undertones as well. Particularly Helen and Deneve. That being said, the series ultimately does nothing with these relationships that's definitive, so it's ultimately left open to interpretation. So I'm going to give it a ho-yay factor of a 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nClaymore does have quite a bit that's good. A lot of the characters are well done, the premise is interesting, the acting is largely good and the action scenes are awesome. However, it also has a lot of issues. It ends at a bad point, Raki exists, there are questionable art decisions, Raki exists, it draws on quite a few cliches and Raki exists. In the end, the series is still decent enough for what it is but it's certainly not a classic or among the best. My final rating for it is a 6/10. If the premise sounds interesting or you're looking for something relatively quick with some good action, check it out, unless you don't want to deal with an annoying sidekick. Next week I'll look at another request, Welcome to the NHK.",

            "content": "When you first start watching the show you're greeted by a strange looking creature feasting on a dead human corpse. Unknowingly, a tall slender figure appears right behind him. He senses this new danger and turns to fight this opponent. But hidden behind this slender gorgeous figure is a sword just as tall as her. She unsheathes her massive weapon and a vicious fight ensues...\r\nThat is the backdrop of what you are going to be experiencing. Fortunately (or unfortunately), that should leave you wanting for more. This story is set in a fantasy land set in medieval times where creatures called Yoma hide withinhuman civilization. \\n\\n\r\nMany (but not all) of the normal humans fear the claymores because they are made of half of what they are afraid of: the Yoma. But they are a necessary evil since they are the only ones strong enough to combat these horrible beasts. Not many people know much about Claymores. Just as mysterious as they sound, you will know very little about the inner workings of their organization, except for a few important rules. This story surrounds one character only known as Clare and basically shows how one becomes a claymore. From human life, to selection, to training, to assignments, and then to tougher assignments... typical shonen anime right? They way they tell Claire's exploits is a pretty good idea. They pretty much \"Tarantino\". That is a great way to explain how this universe works, well I enjoy moves told in this fashion too (some folks won't). This shows how emotion plays an important role in the show how their human half creates many internal conflicts with themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThere's mainly one main character and like 40 supporting characters. Unlike most anime out there that keeps EVERY character alive, this one actually does the dirty deed of killing off characters, which I enjoy very much. Not the killing part but more of the reality of it. Friends live and die just as willingly as the enemies. And that is very refreshing in the sea of Naruto's and Bleach's. You'll actually get a good amount of face time with all the claymores they present to the viewers. You'll still remember who favorite ones are. This is one of the very few anime that I actually remember most of the characters' names. Not only does each one have a unique look and attitude, but they also have specific powers that separates them from them all. Half way through the anime, im sure you will find a handful of favorite blond warriors. My personal favorite is Clare.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't mention anything about the artwork without talking about the character design. I think this is one of the best character designs I've ever seen in an anime. Not just because it mostly consists of beautiful slender blond haired sexytime warriors but, in the variety of how different each warrior is from each other. From hair style to warrior insignias, to even the swords they carry all have subtle details that u can easily remember or recognize. Even their \"alter-ego's\" are unique to each warrior. And you cant have medieval fighting giant monsters without great backdrops and this show has those in spades. As many fight scenes there are in this show, the backdrops are just awesome. From abandoned towns, to forest fights at dusk, to even fights in dark dreary caves, they're all situated in different places. Sure they sound very typical but with as many variations in the villains they fight, they all feel very fresh when watching them. The background animations like the random civilians, breaking objects, sparks, and fire embers are all here. They don't look anything impressive but they do add wonders tot he fighting. Most notably the blood... and this anime shows them by the bucket load. It never stays away from violence and thats what makes this show great. Not many current anime shows this much gratuitous violence and its very refreshing after watching a few dozen slice of life school comedies.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything to complain about the show, it would have to be the sound effects. You can tell most of the stock sound effects were from other shows and movies. Most notably would be the Star Wars laser fire sound when a Claymore \"transforms.\" When I first heard it i was laughing so hard. On top of that other sound effects are just very normal like growling and sword clanging etc. The music is also a little on the weak side. They could have done better with some of the 'theme' songs like when clare 'gets angry' or when she 'learns a new skill' the songs appear pretty weak. But they do break out in some serious guitar riffs and rock instrumentals, which are pretty impressive compared to the other music in here. But the opening songs and closing songs are one of my favorite parts of this show. J Rock is really catchy and seems very fitting for this show throughout. Hell, I have it playing in my car as we speak!\\n\\n\r\nThe story was very interesting through the first 20 episodes. Representing a little shonen with Clare's development cycle. But the end sorta feels like they're selling the series a little short. At this ending i felt kind of cheated just like what i felt on the ending of Code Geass. If you want to watch a good story driven show this is a good one to watch, but be wary of Raki and the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOh by the way, please try to watch the entire show before you go and give it 10's or whatnot. The last 4-6 episodes will disappoint, I guarantee.",

Yes, they save the people from monsters, but are regarded as ones themselves. Irony, huh?\r\nThe story follows one of these women. She meets a normal human kid who isn't afraid of her, and they end up as traveling partners. At first, it starts as a standard \"good-guys-killing-monsters\" show, but it goes deeper. I've always felt that the organization for whom the Claymores are working isn't quite good, but let's just leave it at that. The story, as I said, developsas time passes, and we get to know more characters, maybe a bit about their background, and it all culminates with a real neat final fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is simply... just.-... unique. I haven't seen anything like it, and I don't think I will. It gives me this really weird feeling, but that's good.

Kudos to that!\\n\\n\r\nFinal thing: This anime seems very unfinished. After watching it, I thought: &quot;Isn't there a season 2?&quot; Well, one has to come. The end was just too open.",

            "content": "Story: 9 \r\nThe plot is great, even if it follows the outline of a typical Shonen: a greater enemy to defeat as final objective. The storyline however is enough original and rich of inusual particulars, for example the presence only of women as main characters to part Raki and Isley, the control of the enormous power, the awakenings, and the Organization that is incumbent every minute.\r\nArt: 8\r\nThe design of the characters is enough anticonventional and inusual:  some physical features, like lips or the face seen of profile, well, not everybody will like how they're done. However they are enough pleasant to see, and thedesign in general terms, as of personages as of scenes and of movements is coherent with the type of anime: raw, dry and connoted in the colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nDoor-bells and other sounds similiar to old rhythm can often be felt as a mysterious prefeeling, thus resembles epic scenes. Battles sometimes also have a rock rhythm. Masanori Takumi did a good job on the OST, especially on some songs like Bishou no Teresa (Teresa's Theme), Ginme no Majo, Hateshinaki Tabiji and Fukaki Mori no Naka. The choice of the rhythms is guessed and coherent with the scenes. Other sounds instead are ostensible, for example the sounds heard during the battle: squeaking of blades, cuts, footsteps and blood that exits from wounds. Also the chosen of dubbers have been good, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nSplendid characterization of every character! Even if in the first moment nearly every character can seem cold and calculating (Claire for example in the first episode gives so much this feeling), when you learn to know them, to know their feelings and their past, will born an endured empathy, an example is the story of Teresa and Claire, or the Ofelia's one. Every personage has its fundamental characteristics that distinguish she from all the others Claymores (physically, every claymore is similar to the others, therefore is for their qualities you'll love every single character): there is who, like Jean, has one strongly will, who learns to love, like Teresa, who simply loves, as Raki, and who cannot more survive to the pain like Elena. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nEvery time that I am watching an episode, I always hope that it does not end that way and I hope that it continues not leaving things as they are, I want more and I'm disappointed to have to wait for one week in order to see the continuation. Every minute of the show very is calculated as in converses as in the amazing, never-boring scenes of action, where the spilling of blood is not fine to himself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThere aren't means ways, you love it or hate it. It's a great shonen, similiar to others but also a lot different. I love it, more the story goes ahead the more it becomes interesting... what else? Can't wait to see the showdown!",

            "content": "Claymore is a good choice for you if you enjoy admiring the world building of a series and are typically into fantasy action series. It becomes a terrible choice if you hate when a show doesn't really know what direction to go towards the end and doesn't manage to do anything meaningful. In addition to this, you might hate it when the main characters of the series of the series are way blander than pretty much everyone else in terms of personality.\r\nIf we are to exclude the fact that Claymore didn't know how to wrap things up, its story was for the most part solid.The world was presented well, with elements introduced gradually before they were immediately relevant to the current events of the story, this creating a better understanding for future scenarios without anything really ever feeling like a plot required asspull. For example, before the main focus of the series starts, which is the fight against awakened beings, the series has an episode about how Claymores will transform into demons once they use their powers too much and they will want to end their lives before losing their human conciousness. This introduces elements that are gonna be relevant in a future arc that explains the main character's motivations and goal, but also that are gonna be relevant way past this point. When the significant events happen, you don't think they don't make sense or are built in a way just to keep the action alive, because they are introduced well in advance. \\n\\n\r\nUntil this isn't the case anymore.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part Claymore faithfully adapts its manga and doesn't really stray from its source material. But, because it had to end and the manga still had more content to go through and create, it had no idea how to wrap things up and create an ending for the anime adaptation. So it basically adapted as much as it could, and then brought the most hyped up bitches together and made them fight. And then ended the series on a note where things were like \"Our fight will go on, it's not over, we still have to do shit\". Which is a cliffhanger. The final fight was very unsatisfying, featuring a lot of flashbacks to \"make us understand the characters perspective\" and not at all to fill for time. I mean we already should've known this information but we probably forgot the information because we're really really really stupid. And there's a lot of random powerups in the fight with senseless slashing and power level display, totally not done because \"we don't know how to write this fight\", but rather because people truly enjoy when characters just think about their lives and nonsensically are more powerful. When people see something done 1000 times done already the same way, they demand it 1001 times more, The final fight is pretty much a \"the plot demands this\" fight. It's exactly how it feels. It's exactly how it's written. it's exactly what it is. \\n\\n\r\nThis hurts Claymore a lot, because of the fact that it introduces elements way in advance that withhold relevance, only to end on a note that seems poorly pieced together, completely destroying I'd say what it was its strongest suit. The planning ahead the initial series did for itself to allow itself the moments it wanted, wasn't at all a factor here. Instead of that, it focuses on the weakest theme of the series, the thirst for revenge. I won't detail it, as to not give the nature of the ending away, outside of it being basically a cliffhanger, but it is something done rather frequently, done very hastily and poorly pieced together, and that for me was very unsatisfying because it brought nothing new, nor was it executed well. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Claymore made me contradict myself because while I think that they're well done, I also think that they're poorly done. Let me explain myself. The overall design of the Claymores, and the color palette of the series, (or rather the lack of a color palette) make the Claymores really hard to distinguish by character design, with them pretty much differing only in hairstyle. The fact that they're so similar is a downgrade because this makes it really easy to swap in your head their names, faces and personalities, which are differentiating traits. Keep some characters away from the story for too long, and you'll definitely get lost in the details. The point of the design being hard to differentiate is making the Claymores look expendable, because that's how their world treats them, and also recognizable from any other bystander. But a little more customization in the design, like at the very least let them keep their hair color and just make them distinguishable just by their eyes being silver and their suits, could've made them easier to distinguish from each other. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that is bad is that all the Claymores have THE SAME BACKSTORY. It is not an exaggeration, everyone's family got eaten by demons, then they became Claymores to avenge them by killing them. I mean I can understand this being the case for the majority of the Claymores, but can't be there at least one Claymore that picked up the job for any other reason? I can understand the reason always having to be selfless, because if Claymores are tempted by power, the more likely they are to become demons themselves, but maybe some girl just wants to join because they want to make the world a better place by removing the demon threat due to strong moral values or any other reason.\\n\\n\r\nThese were the reasons for which I think they're poorly done. The world requires for their design to be basically the same and the world's rules requires their background to be basically the same. But in a way that makes them well done because they're serving the purpose of the world fully. None of them (for the most part) seem like fantastic out of the ordinary circumstances with any special gift to them, because none of them are, and none of them should be. Some of them happen to be way more powerful than other Claymores, but that's it. That is not an irregularity in the world of the Claymores. On one hand I admire the fact that the series built a world and its characters to be as fitting as possible to their setting, but one hand I see the flaws it creates, making every character forgettable due to how similar to each other they are.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is dissapointing because the two main characters, Clare, who is a girl who's on a revenge quest against Yoma, just like everyone else, and that's her personality. And Raki, the annoying sidekick who's there to humanize Clare and cry because hey Claymores aren't that bad y'all racist. Clare is the brooding silent type who has nothing on her mind than revenge, which is a boring and predictable character type. Raki is a kid who just lost his family and just follows Clare around because he has nobody left, with his role pretty much being to fuck up Clare's battles and yell CREHRH from time to time. None of these characters are interesting. The most interesting arc of the series, is, ironic to everything I said, the backstory arc of Clare, where a different Claymore is the focus of the story. Who is a much more interesting protagonist than Clare and makes Clare that much worse, because not only does that backstory have the exact same purpose that the main characters have in the overarching story, but it's done that much better and with a character that is irregular to the world of Claymore.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as a result of such after that background story, the story doesn't really bring anything new, and pretty much develops the world for the action bits. The action of the series is mostly women slashing gigantic monsters displaying their powers and how they differentiate from one another. The way they differentiate themselves is interesting and how certain demons need a certain type of strategy to be combated is also interesting, but for the fights can seem dull since there isn't intrigue sometimes, since it's mostly the characters constantly using the powers they've established and slashing the shit out of an enemy until they die. You usually know how things are going to play out in terms of choreography, the more interesting part is how the characters decide to get there, and how they make use of the powers that differentiate them from the other Claymores in these situations.\\n\\n\r\nI think the action could've been enhanced visually if the series had brighter colors. I made a joke earlier in the review that the series lacks a color palette, because, it barely uses any warm colors, and mostly uses monotone cold colors, even on backgrounds that are colorful. Everyone is dressed in some very monotone looking pieces of cloth, Claymores are dressed in almost full grey-ish clothes and the monsters are mostly designed with dark colors. There isn't really any inbalance in the colors to catch your attention visually when something significant happens and everything always looks regular due to the show's overall tone. In terms of visual details, the series does not lack those, everything is well detailed, and the characters are drawn realistically which is a definite plus, but you need some way to draw attention to the spectacle of the series, the action, and look for a way to not make everything seem as monotone every single time. The soundtrack of the series didn't really help the tone for me, I didn't find it noteworthy and I mostly got annoyed of hearing the same song whenever a battle is about to commence.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I think Claymore had an excellent world with only one arc that actually tells an interesting story, both things I enjoyed a great deal. But it has a lot of shortcomings, with plenty of unfullfilling fights, some dull main characters and a story that doesn't know how to draw any sort of conclusion. It felt like a dragged out story of an arc that at heart had the same goal as the overarching story, backstory which already fullfilled the role of the main story. I think there are some things in Claymore that are genuinely worth seeing and on which it can be recommended on and be easily enjoyed, but also plenty of shortcomings that definitely ruins the potential it has built. If the premise of Claymore genuinely interests you, you could watch it, but please consider the problems I've had with the series and if they have the potential to ruin the series for you too.",

            "content": "Scoring Preconditions: While I rate all parts, the overall score takes in most consideration from story, character, and enjoyment. Art and sound are not factors in the overall, although they can slightly enhance or detract from enjoyment portion. I score from as unbiased a view as possible and I view it in a critical sense, not in a simple enjoyment sense. Thus I give at most a one point overall bonus for enjoyment. Story and characters matter most. I will state exceptions to this rule depending on the anime.\r\nSummary: Without going into to much detail, this anime had a lot of potential but wasted alot of time. It's definitely more than your average run of the mill anime and the idea is unique. But it hit a brick wall. I discuss this more in the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10): Now before I say anything else, I'm going to say that on the basic idea alone the story would have been worth a 9 or higher. The only reason this show fell to a 6 here is because the ending left a gaping plot hole. Of course this ending may resonate with those who enjoy a cliffhanger ending - although it wasn't so much a cliffhanger as they just ran out of ideas. Besides the ending, the story arcs were well done. The introduction of Claire and Raki is nothing special but the decision for the next arc to be a flashback was pretty good. And of course flash forward to the present. It isn't clever but it is well executed, of course besides the ending. The original idea is both unique and interesting. The half demon idea of course isn't unique, but a lot of the elements of this plot are. The Yoma Claymore struggle is good to watch. The dark mood really resonates well with the story and creates a nice path to the final battle with Priscilla. It is a good story and well worth watching until they hit the wall.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10): Frankly the art wasn't all that appealing to me. I think the blade and Yoma art appeal well, but the human characteristics were kinda hard to swallow. Of course this was my personal opinion and this changes by viewer. But I found a lot of people who share my viewpoint on this.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): Raison d'Etre was probably the most perfect fit an opening could have for an anime like this. Nightmare's lead has that really strange and creepy voice that matches the mood so well. This is another in my playlist. Other background noises  were acceptable. The opening really is the reason for the 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10): On their own, the characters aren't much to look at. We have the weakest (and later strongest) claymore and a weak little human boy who really doesn't do much except maintain Claire's humanity. But, what is really great is that we see growth in Claire. Power is one thing, but through the flashback arc we get to see the transition and explanation of how she became a claymore. It was interesting to see how Claire changed throughout the plot. Raki...I'm not sure how to classify other than wimp. While the parallel with young human Claire is clearly visible, Raki is pretty useless and he stays that way throughout the plot. \"Oh but he keeps her humanity. That's so brave.\" Ummm yeah thats great but this is a battle between badass claymores and Yoma. What can Raki do when he can't even use a sword properly. I think he is a necessary character for the plot, but that doesn't make him an enjoyable one. Other characters are support. Necessary but non-unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): I'm not sure how I should classify my enjoyment. I thoroughly enjoyed everything but my happy meter just dropped like a rock after I hit the brick wall ending. I wouldn't have a problem if there were a second season, but seeing as there is none to explain what happens next, I have to downgrade my enjoyment here. But the battles were enjoyable to watch. It's not as if the battles were unique in any way but watching Claire continue using her yoma powers to the limit was pretty badass. Also the Yoma artwork gets mention here. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10): I think that for many people this rating might seem slightly harsh, but I'm averse to giving this anime more than a 6. The story blew up at the ending and while Claire was valuable, Raki was a pain. Seeing as even my enjoyment here fell from the ending, I have one major complaint about this anime that would have entirely changed my score had it been fixed: GET SOME FRICKIN CLOSURE ON THE PLOT!!!",

            "content": "I'm a sucker for super violent animes with lots of demons and/or people getting chopped up (Vampire Hunter D, Ninja Scroll, etc.), so this is definitely up my alley. Still, it has quite a few things that bug me. \r\nSometimes the animation is very obviously digital (Mostly the camera movements, some of the backgrounds as well. We're not talking well-integrated CGI here, it's obviously a budget thing), and it falls into some of the shonen cliches when someone busts out some badass new super power (though, admittedly, a lot of those really ARE super badass). There are a couple dozen musical cues, so that getspretty repetitive by the end as well (plus it sounds like they picked a completely wrong cue a few times in there).\\n\r\nAnd Raki. Oh, Raki. Mostly the character development in this show is perfectly satisfactory, even when it goes into an extended flashback that's... Well, long. But Raki is friggin' annoying. He is consistently a total idiot and then cries about his dumb decisions later. I understand his role as Clare's emotional grounding, but still, what a whiny stupid jerk. A humble hint to my readers: If you, a mere human, find yourself in the company of a badass super-powered part-demon woman and you are determined to follow and help her in her quest, learn to play SUPPORT. Basically, learn some escape art, be bait when that's needed, and do reconnaissance or healing or whatever when you'd be in the way. And please don't cry when you try to pick up a sword and aren't able to protect the girl from beings of godly power. She's protecting YOU, idiot.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that said, the fight scenes are brutal and cool as hell, the super powers are very super powered, and the themes are fairly interesting, if nothing particularly new. In the end, the good qualities make me enjoy it more than the flaws annoy me.",

Lots of decapitations and blood and action. The protagonist Clare is a \"Claymore\" or a 1/2 demon 1/2 human demon hunter. If these claymore use too much of their demon power they themselves will be engulfed by their dark side never to return. \r\nThis anime began as a potential masterpiece, but my expectations were crushed half way. What had started as a unique storyline and an awsome character was Infected by stereotypical MAIN STREAM elements that nearly destroyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI already gave the Main Plot~ As already said its starts off great and goes downhill in the end. It also has an even pace in the beggining, a perfect blend of plot of battles~ But in the end plot is thrown out the window just for constant battling, Cliche plot twists and complete disregard for story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI was rather happy with the animation^.^\\n\r\nMostly darker earthy hues~ but it makes a good contrast with the Claymore shiny swords and armor. The character animation was ok till you find out 90% of them look the same, it becomes hard to tell alot of them apart towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending were good, especially the ending &quot;Danzai no Hana&quot; which is perhaps one of the best ending themes of 2007. It completely matched the feeling of the entire anime.\\n\r\nThe OST itself is rather good, but it didn't stick out very much when I watched it myself. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As already said, the series starts off with very good characterizations, but in the end throws out their development and makes most of them into stereotype roles that were completely without motive. Besides the protagonist there was hardly any attempt at character development to begin with and they messed that up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I can honestly say I did enjoy 3/5 of the series. It had me on the edge of my seat, engrossed in the action and plot twists. The ending 2/5 were a total let down and nearly destroyed the entire anime~ but perhaps someone less picky than me could enjoy it? If all you like is battles and fireworks you will enjoy this anime~ \\n\\n\r\nOverall~ I've said all that needs to be said~\\n\r\nThis anime is acceptable... but far from a 10/10...\\n\\n\\n\\n",

In a move of brilliance, a secret dark society of Men in Black decided that the best way to combat Youma is to cross-breed them with human warriors, creatively called Claymores for the weapons they wielded.\r\nTheir first attempt was to use men, butthe power rush--akin to an orgasm--made all of them seek their Youma power and transform into insanely powerful \"Awakened\" beings and actually made the problem worse since the awakened warriors were infinitely more powerful than the Youma. \\n\\n\r\nThe sheer stupidity of pursuing the Claymore program is never commented on in the anime, since clearly the Awakened ones are more of a menace than the Youma, as they wage war and organize, while the Youma are content to munch on a leg or two here.\\n\\n\r\nSo now all Claymores are women.

            "content": "I found this anime to be among the most disappointed ones. It started very good, and followed the manga, which is very good, too. Then... it went horribly wrong.\r\nStory: As I mentioned, the story started very good. It was simple yet have some depth in it; love, hatred, revenge ... it had all. And slaying demons are never boring, in a good show. But all the potential in the world does not guarantee anything; from episode 20, the series branched off from the manga, and had one of the most disappointed ending ever. It made people feel incomplete. What is going to happen to them,who were the leader of the Claymores ...? The manga is still far from end, and making an anime based on a good yet to end was a bad idea. And the result? A disappointed storyline.\\n\r\nArt, and sound: not much to complain, they are good. Sweet animation; perfectly fit in the classic shonen hack n' slash action. It was just good. The music, awesome. 9 for both Art and Sound.\\n\r\nCharacters: amazing and unique characters. All the Claymores were unique; and I loved that. The only thing that held the character point from getting any higher was Raki. He was supposed to be a key main character, but he turned out to be a weak boy who always got into the middle of the battle and Claire had to get him out. And for a long time, he had nothing to do with everything happening in the show. Didin't he supposed to be cool and important? So lame!\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this series from the beginning till' it was 10 minutes before the final episode ended. As I mentioned, the ending left me an overwhelming disappointment. What's the point of such ending? I had the felling that the show had just started, even it was the last episode. Then I decided to burned this anime to DVD and locked it up forever, unless they made a sequel. Rewatch value: 0. Enjoyment before you hit the final: 10/10. Disappointment after you hit the stop button: 100/10. So, 5/10.\\n\r\nOverall: Claymore was supposed to be an extrememly good anime. But the story made a horrible turn at episode 20 and hit disaster at the last episode. I want a sequel or a remake! If it is a remeke, let just forget episode 20 and onward, and make it the way the manga is. 6/10",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nClaymore is a perfect example of an anime  that tries desperately hard to be dark, but completely and utterly fails. This show demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of what actually makes an anime mature.  The result is a series of boring, brainless, deus ex machina-filled, melodramatic fight scenes with a static plot and uninteresting/indistinguishable characters (with the exception of one). Tag on an ugly, almost monochromic animation style (in my opinion), an inconsistent soundtrack, and an unsatisfying ending, and you've got yourself a tremendously overrated anime.\r\nPlot: 3/10\r\nIn a world where demonic predators called Yoma exist only to kill and eat humans bydisguising themselves as other humans, a mysterious organization creates half-human, half-Yoma warriors known as the \"Silver Eyed Witches\", or more commonly, \"Claymores\". The story begins with a young boy named Raki who has lost everything in a Yoma attack. He meets Clare, a Claymore, who agrees to let him travel along-side her and experience her Yoma-slaying occupation.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with Claymore's plot is that it is based on nothing but classic shounen fighting/screaming and melodrama where whoever screams and grunts the loudest is the winner, but it THINKS that it is also about deep psychological themes and \"what makes us human\". The later aspects are completely butchered and the former aspects are exactly what they sound like.\\n\\n\r\nTo give an example: there is a great story arc in the beginning of the show about a Claymore named Teresa and a little girl named Clare. Clare has lost everything and has nowhere else to turn, so she starts following Teresa around. Teresa, who essentially feels no human emotions due to the fact that she is a Claymore, is indifferent to the girl at first, but they eventually grow to have a very touching relationship. This relationship is clearly supposed to parallel the relationship that Clare and Raki now have with each other; someone who thinks she has lost her humanity is proved wrong by a child who has lost everything and grows to see her as a motherly figure. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, Claymore was shaping up to be a very good anime. However, as soon as that arc ends, we get nothing that comes even remotely close to the character development and good themes that we just saw. The relationship between Rocky and Clare receives no further development and eventually decides to go in a, ummm, \"different\", direction than the one that preceded it. Let's just say the lines become very blurry when it comes to what Clare and Raki actually are to each other.\\n\\n\r\nButchering the potential of telling a touching story wouldn't have been as bad if the plot that they DID give us wasn't so generic and boring. In addition to the slow pacing, it's just the classic: \"Fight the monsters! Get revenge! Get stronger!\" kind of plot that really has nothing to offer that you haven't already seen.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show thinks it is being dark and mature by not being afraid to kill off pointless side characters, but it completely fails to make us care about those characters or what they are fighting for. They continuously hint at the Organization being secretly evil, but that never leads anywhere. The characters all have either shallow motivations (such as revenge) or no motivations at all and are just working as puppets of \"The Organization\". The fights are all predictable, the side characters add absolutely nothing (more on them later), and the ending is extremely unsatisfying. Everything that the show was building up to abruptly stops, an archetypical shounen moral is quickly crammed in our face, and then it just sort of\u2026 ends. There is certainly nothing special about Claymore's plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nTaste in art is subjective, but I really dislike the dark and boring color palate used in Claymore. It fails to set a good atmosphere, and the blood effects are terrible. The EXACT same effect is used over and over and over again and it doesn't even look good! It just looks like a bunch of red lines coming out of the wound! And don't get me started on the way, way overused trope of two people running past each other, swinging their swords at each other, there is a long pause, and THEN somebody starts bleeding! I'm pretty sure claymore uses that stereotype in every single episode. Once or twice is fine, but come on!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack sometimes works and sometimes does not. Average OP and ED. The voice acting is average. The sound effects were really below average though. I kid you not: they use the Star Wars gun sound effect in this anime, on multiple occasions! It feels so random and out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nBefore I talk about the personalities of the characters, let me just say one thing: Claymore might win the award for worst character design in anime history. News flash guys! You can only have so many characters with blonde hair, silver eyes, and the exact same outfit before it becomes impossible tell them apart! Good luck trying to remember the name of the characters in this anime, I mean seriously! I was happy whenever one of them died because that was one less to keep track of.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the characters in Claymore are certainly nothing special. Clare is the same as any other stereotypical shounen protagonist, except she is a girl. She is motivated almost solely by revenge and the only thing different about her is her relationship with Raki, but I already touched on how that was botched. As the protagonist, she is constantly busting out deus ex machina after deus ex machina to the point that it just becomes unbearable. \\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about Raki. He is a genuine character, clearly expressing his feelings at all times, but he is also very annoying, particularly towards the end. He starts out as someone who is easy to feel sympathy for; he has nothing left and the way he latches on to Clare is touching at first, but since that plot element receives no development, it just becomes stale and irritating. He ends up getting in the way more often then he helps anyone.\\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of one, the side characters are worthless. Occasionally one of them might receive 3 minutes of development, but the only purpose they serve is death fodder. I can't remember the names of more then 3 of them, and there were dozens.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I truly liked was Teresa. She is the only character who we really get to see go through a change; she goes from a cold emotionless tool who mindlessly kills for the sake of \"The Organization\" to a loving person who realizes that she is still human. If Teresa had gotten a LOT more screen time, I would have probably enjoyed Claymore.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nAs a relatively highly rated shounen, I must say that Claymore fails to live up to it's hype. It simply doesn't differentiate itself from the rest of the genre in any meaningful way (a female-dominated cast is unique but poorly written). The plot is static , uninteresting, and peaks after the first real storyarc, the animation is not appealing, and the characters are nothing special. If you are looking for a unique shounen, you won't find it here. If you are a fan of shounen in general though, I could see how you could enjoy it. Personally, it wasn't my cup of tea.",

            "content": "For me, Claymore has been an anime that has given so much mixed emotion over the past days that I have watched it. Emotions both surprisingly positive and unsurprisingly negative, to a point that I just had to write a review about it, both because of sheer enjoyment of how I experienced the show but mostly because of how much I was disappointed in its presentation.\r\nTo start off in the notion of why I enjoyed it, it was because not of its theme (humans< monsters< half-human half-monster< protagonist) but because somewhere down the line when I was watching the show, it gets interestingly good.Not to spoil the content for the readers but, there are certain times where the show hooks you pretty well because the series of events in the show actually was getting good.\\n\\n\r\nBut with that been said, let us go to the bad side of the case. I was mostly disappointed that it, most of the time, leaves the viewers wanting for more than what we came for. The story progression in Claymore is like a roller coaster to begin with, slows start, progressing high during the middle but when you reach the top of the roller coaster to see the climax of the story, so that you can enjoy the ending, it just stops. And that\u2019s the problem I have with the show. It\u2019s like a fisherman catching the interest of the little fish viewers, patiently waiting for us to bite the bait so he can reel us in for the epic kill, but disappointingly pulls up the fishing line before we even got a chance to take a bite.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to top it all off, it happens in every arc, up until the ending.\\n\r\nBut enough of that for now, let\u2019s talk about the character design and development. I\u2019m going to make a point that the character design in Claymore had a similar feel to it with being in a comic book or a particular show where every hero wears a motorcycle helmet for a mask. The good guys have same bland costume and body structure, but different voices and hair style (with the great exception of the protagonist and some supporting characters), while the bad guys, well, they were a bit too similar to begin with, but the design gets progressively good as the story goes on, but they do have this issue that they never seem to run out of, as the saying goes, \u2018this is not my final form\u2019, only to get hacked to chunky bits in the end because the story wants the good guys to always win. The personality of the different characters of the story was at least a giver of ways for the same looking characters to shine, so I\u2019m no longer going to point out the fact that there were at least certain elements of moe (personality speaking to be the very least).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in Claymore has been a 50-50 battle of whether or not it\u2019s good or bad because it did well to develop the main characters and the main supporting characters in the story (If you\u2019re wondering, yes, there is such a thing as main supporting character in this story), but it\u2019s a double-edged sword for the other characters because they tried to make every character that way, but ended up failing in that aspect, so the minor support characters ended up looking half-baked. And to top it all off, there was one point in the story, somewhere in the middle, where one of the main protagonist (Claire\u2019s pet human boy), who was supposedly a main character, suddenly became a main supporting character down the line. It was like, Claire, who was once just a main supporting character in the story, became progressively the main character in the end, and her pet human boy, who was once the main character of the story, became a cameo in the middle and made an unsatisfying appearance in the end. The fact that he was there just to drive the protagonist forward and no longer appeal to the viewers, was just irritating when he made his grand appearance in the end. I\u2019m no longer going to mention the other main support characters in the story because, it\u2019s either they were good enough to understand in such a short span of only one arc or that they were too minor to begin with, but the story seemed to revolve around them for some time anyway, so it would be wrong to call them just a supporting character [SPOILER WARNING] (given that most of the supporting characters in the story all end up dead anyway) [END OF SPOILER].\\n\\n\r\nAlso, just to let out a bit of frustration out of watching the show, [SPOILER WARNING] CLIFF-HANGGERS EVERYWHERE!!![END OF SPOILER]  I mean it\u2019s redonculous to a point that there\u2019s so much more things left unanswered. I mean not to spoil the show in any way but, there is still so much questions that is still hanging. I am no longer going to mention all of it for the fear I might spoil the show to the readers, but you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about when you\u2019re done with the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to fly back to another planet before I change into my final fantasy form and fight the most bad ass boss that\u2019ll probably have his own final form as well.

I think, everebody. Just look into Claymore world... there are not too much differences between guts-hungered yoma and nomad hordes. And great-looking Claymores... girls,who lost their destinies through sacrificing themselves for the mankind serving? (Yes, I know that real knights were a bit off that, but... their romantic shapes sometimes remain in our mind) So come and live here... be a simple peasant and live in a fear to be eaten everyday. Claymore easily ripes illusions.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I`ll return to anime. It`s much spoken about Clare and Teresa already. I want only to say: don`t you think that everyone can find similiarities in his and Claymore`s lives? Each of us had tragedies, losses... same like they. Each of us found ourselves in filthy situations... same like they. But go on fighting - and you will go through them with honour. That is what Claymores teach us.\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "Claymore was definitely a good pick and a fine watch despite the much repeated and disappointing fact that the entire manga hasn't been adapted and considering that the manga just recently ended it just makes one wish that they would continue.\r\nNow to start off the review, the best way to describe this anime is... an amazing idea, a well executed anime but lacking in certain elements and those elements bugged me a lot. Just to state beforehand, I am not going to stress on it being an adaptation and bringing in the manga to quote everything - I'll consider the anime as an anime, notas a 'meant to be a faithful adaptation to a certain manga.'\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Claymore is intriguing. Its start gives off the air of Blood+ or Muv-Luv in that it portrays an issue and gives its solution - defining the universe in terms of those monster/hunter/prey and similar characteristics while the rest of the elements like the time era and the culture remains as secondary. It is a fine approach, nothing wrong with it but it does give the initial vibe of the mainstream anime story progression (won't go into details there) and does not keep attention as did Another, Deadman Wonderland and Mirai Nikki (for me) in their first episodes. However I always say that animes should be given certain episodes to develop - I know many people who dislike Code Geass based only on first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when the person gives time to this anime, then the culture, the environment, the physics of the universe slowly start to unravel in more detail, and in a more relevant manner. An example is that the initial \"Queen's Blade\" vibe of all female fighters is slowly shattered and the person emerges from a world of simple monster vs hunter to a much complicated and gripping universe. I do wonder how the story line elements hinted yet left out of the anime were tackled in the manga but the slight graze of the side story isn't a negative, it eventually gives the story a multi-purpose and while the anime concludes on ONE of these 'purposes', the rest are a well thought way to keep the viewer motivated to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically the anime is a well developed story, complex and intruiging HOWEVER, the ending retracted back to typical anime-ish. Wish I could give a comparison but it would be near equal to a spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the very big positives in Claymore for me was the art. The art style was very impressive and enjoyable. Let's consider it a little more technically. The background was well managed, with detail where necessary and reflecting the over all ambiance of the time.  The color scheme was suitable and the art was fluid especially in many fighting sequences. If we consider character art, the females certainly were similar in most traits, however they had believable proportions... not only in terms of the bust size but thighs, arms and over all stature. Yes, similar but they were all fighters and I suppose they could have varied the height a little but otherwise the physique should be more or less the same. The lips and eyes were designed very well - I loved many characters in how appealing they looked not due to a hanging cleavage but due to a decent art style. The basic monster art was also impressive, the lesser monsters were more or less generic but they still didn't look... bad.\\n\\n\r\nI would say here that an all blonde congregation was not really the best idea.... especially since many gave the first impression of being 'elvish'... but ah well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound however was a... 30/70 for me. 70 in the negative. The sound tracks were certainly unique and some did have quite the appeal but they were executed at very awkward moments making one confused for a moment whether they are interpreting the overall atmosphere in the wrong way. So not really a fan of the music however I enjoyed the voice acting and the sound effects reflecting actions or movement.\\n\\n\r\nNow the character development was a roller coaster for me. Lets see... considering the main prominent characters... Clare, the protagonist, an emotionless warrior, brutal in her fights against the monsters but calm alongside, a balanced character with a clear vision that doesn't waver but needs to be reminded in between since there are slight 'additions' to her goals. There isn't much complex about her, she had a past that carved her present and if there are complexities to her personality that isn't shown in the present story. Her interaction with other characters is also justified and reasonable.\\n\\n\r\nRaki... the... pathetic side kick that has... okay lets tackle him a little properly. When you are alone and helpless and are dependent on someone that has far superior intelligence, exposure, endurance skills than you and is mentally a lot more stable, you are supposed to... what? Depend on them. You stick around, give them company, comfort yourself and them. We see another relationship in the anime comparable to what he and Clare have and THAT was BEAUTIFULLY executed. His wasn't. Why? Raki has to impose his sense of helplessness every other episode, he has to lecture Clare every other episode over what is right or wrong, has to butt into every single situation when he isn't required... I mean... just stop being an annoying pest! I disliked that character a lot and the story line plus a few other major characters kept me watching.\\n\\n\r\nTERESA, a secondary character that does have a huge impact on the story was well handled. The best handled character. You can understand her, see how she thinks and understand how it makes sense. Her interaction with other characters was very believable. I won't go into much details but she was easily my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nMiria and other characters too have a personality defined yet they are not so constricted to it that you find them completely 1-D. They have certain traits to them that keep them believable characters. Yes, there are certain characters you will be able to identify in other animes as well (like the typical fight crazed guy) but the over character development is good. Just ignore Raki and you'll like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow... if we were to sum it up to enjoyment... then it was a certainly enjoyable anime that had me waiting to know more - more than was shown in the anime but it kept me on the edge, it kept me guessing in places and the only part that did piss me off were it being incomplete and where they ended. The way the ended it didn't justify the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo a good anime over all with decent fighting sequences, a story with various elements and if you ignore the character Raki and just try to get over the ending than a VERY good watch!\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and Feed back is more than welcome!",

            "content": "Don't let the creepy designs and macabre setup fool you, despite its appearance Claymore is a shonen anime at its core, which means lots of weird powers and grand-scale fight scenes, speeches about honor and friendship, a conga line of weird villains, and a whole lot of swinging swords and screaming. I know that the word \"shonen\" makes some anime fans cringe on sight, but it is not automatically a bad thing. There are many shone titles that have stood out positively over the years, whether through captivating heroes and villains (Rurouni Kenshin, Yu Yu Hakusho), a polished and distinctive style (Soul Eater) or somesurprisingly mature themes thrown into the mix (Fullmetal Alchemist). While Claymore doesn't really excel in any of these categories, it is at least competent and often above-average in many of them, placing it a red and purple bloodstained cut above most shows of its ilk.\\n\\n\r\nThe name Madhouse usually promises at least above-average production values, and this is no exception. The backgrounds are expansive and nicely detailed, and Yagi's unusual, distinctive character designs are generally well-maintained throughout the many fighting scenes, not to mention some of the monster designs are just plain wicked. The action itself is half-and half. On one hand, this was definitely adapted from a manga, and during some of the less inspired battles you can practically see the seams from the panels being stitched together: speed lines, quick motions that look more like teleporting, all the shortcuts normally associated with shonen fighter series are here. Thankfully, the strong animation budget softens the blow considerably, with a fairly consistent level of detail, and when it's time to show off during a pivotal battle, the choreography and design work can get really impressive. In a nutshell, this show looks a lot like Naruto and Bleach, only a little more grizzled and much better.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore boasts a rich and diverse music score that mixes folksy strings and winds with modern electric noise, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to have any idea what to do with it. The music direction is so incredibly hit-and-miss that I honestly have to wonder what the show's creators were thinking for some of the choices they made. It will start too late and overstay its welcome, rarely playing loudly enough to make a noticeable impression and often completely failing to match the beat of whatever is happening on-screen. The end result is consistently either forgettable or distracting and only occasionally manages to hit the right beat. I half-suspect that they just went to a composer, asked for an appropriate soundtrack, and then put it on shuffle over the show and called it a day; if someone told me that was the case, I might actually believe it because some of the pieces would have been perfect if they weren't playing over the wrong scene. I should clarify, it's not that bad all the time, and sometimes it actually works really well, but it only takes a few slip-ups to sour the experience and there are more than enough to make this shortcoming noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-wise, this series is a bit atypical for shonen in that it lends itself to low, threatening intonations instead of the overwrought screaming you usually hear. The Japanese track is a lot of fun to listen to in this regard from start to finish. By contrast, the English dub starts off a little on the dull side, but after awhile the voice actors really grow into their roles so that by the end, both tracks are solid listens. I do have one bone to pick with the dub, and that is Todd Haberkorn's portrayal of Raki. Haberkorn is a very good actor, don't get me wrong, but his voice is a little too snide and snarky to play innocence convincingly, resulting in Raki sounding overly whiny at all the wrong moments, whereas Motoki Takagi was able to carry the character more naturally. On the plus side, Brina Palencia turns out a fantastic performance as Priscilla, able to capture all her childlike purity and twist it into something hideous. Priscilla is a more interesting character than Raki, so I'll take it.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside its shonen trappings for a moment, Claymore is not an entirely brainless story. This series is at its very best when it is portraying the most basic, carnal side of humanity: fear of the unknown. Humans don't know or understand the Claymores that protect them any better than the Yoma that hunt them, and they're understandably afraid to get close enough to find out. The Claymores do nothing to discourage this attitude toward them, they're cold and often intimidating toward their charges, and as we find out more about them it becomes clearer and clearer that even if they tried to be accepted among humans, what they are would make that more or less impossible. Priscilla's origin story (which also covers Clare's backstory) is a definite high point of the show, clearly showing just how dangerous being \"too human\" can be when you're constantly battling monsters both within and without. Unfortunately, said flashback takes place from episodes five to nine out of twenty-six, and it's generally not a good sign when a series reaches its high point so early on.\\n\\n\r\nNot that the rest of the show is in complete nowhere land, there are still some good bits here and there, but after unloading its guns far too early the show has to keep its audience entertained almost purely on action sequences, so it's a good thing the action is still fun to watch. This is how a shonen action title needs to be done: lots of cool heroes and scary villains with weird and memorable powers, a simple (rather stupid) plot, maybe a little conspiracy thrown in somewhere, and none of that waxing philosophical nonsense. Most of the characters can be boiled down to \"how they fight\" and \"why they fight\", but who cares as long as they're still entertaining? It's a little darker and bloodier than its classmates from the school of Jump, which lends it a distinct flavor and a bit more of an edge. The darker and more twisted this show gets, the more wicked the villains and the more intense the battles, the better. Seriously, forget the heroes, forget the ordinary rank-and-file Yoma, the major villains like Ophelia, Riful and of course Priscilla are the real reason to watch this show. That, and all the creative ways the show finds to cut its characters to tiny bits.\\n\\n\r\nThe low point of the show is undoubtedly Raki, and not just because of the voice acting. Make no mistake, he could have been a very important character to help Clare rediscover what it means to be human and given her the companionship she needed to let her past go, but for the most part his role borders on that of her pet (she even gets called out on this at one point). As the first human to ever view her as a person rather than a monster I get why he's so important to her, but throughout the series he constantly needs to be protected by Clare while offering very little in return. He tries to learn how to fight, but he's only human and never really gets a chance to be useful, and as far as good company goes his relationship with her is underdeveloped. If they spent more time talking to one another and had more of a natural chemistry things might be different, but most of their conversations are just generic fare along the lines of: \"I'll definitely protect you, you're really important to me, blah, blah, blah\", which is a shame. He's a tag-along character done wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the show remains consistently entertaining from start to... well, not quite to finish. Continuing to rub salt on the wounds, Claymore ends with a \"read the manga\" conclusion, and a pretty poor one at that. The final arc of the TV series concludes a little too easily while ignoring all the hanging plot threads you could've sworn were leading to something much bigger and signing off with a hokey declaration that \"the adventure continues\" (okay, they don't actually say that). The possibility of a second season covering subsequent events is looking a little slimmer with every passing year, so you'll have to read the manga if you want answers.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it is, Claymore offers a slightly atypical, fairly engaging take on the tired Shonen Jump formula. It doesn't really live up to its potential of being a dark and mature fantasy, but it's still fun to watch and as far as shonen goes that's really all that matters. It doesn't have much to offer anyone aside from the usual action fans, but if you want to see badass ladies fighting monsters with swords, give this the time of day and see if it sates your craving.",

            "content": "Welcome to my first review.\r\nA friend of mine recommended this anime to me, and I told him when the series ended that it was a nice catch. Claymore is one of the best anime's that I had seen this year. It's medieval theme and kick-ass female characters is what this anime is payed for. Claymore made a stand through the masses with it's compelling and brilliant story. \r\nThe story goes as the protagonist, Clare, fights for her humanity and seeks revenge to the Claymore named Priscilla who miserably ended the life of her most precious person, Teresa. As Clare struggles to fight and finds outthe reason of her existence, the whole story revolves on another person named Raki and as the two of them shared the same fate, they found themselves driven to the organization's darkest secrets. \\n\r\nThe story is indeed stunning and I congratulate Norihiro Yagi for making it possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is made by Madhouse, which is by far my most favorite animation company. They did well on the animation as expected from them. Even though the animation were sometimes &quot;off&quot;. The characters, background and the animation effects were good and the battle scenes are worth dying for. \\n\\n\r\nThe one who's responsible for this Anime's industrial-inspired music is Masunori Takumi, the BGM's were used very cleverly and the composition for each and every one of them was awesome, from the heavy guitar riffs and even to the Orchestral scores, it's very intelligent.   The Jrock band Nightmare performed Raison D'etre and I'd say that it fits the anime very well and so it is indeed true that the rumors i've heard about them being the band whos currently having a large fanbase all over in Japan, they're a band that is worth following for. As for the Ending theme which Kosaka Riyu made, her voice is powerful and the composition of her song Danzai no Hana is a true fit for the &quot;Medieval&quot; theme that Claymore has.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Claymore is indeed, Worth watching and I pity those who won't. :P Just kidding. Seriously it's worth a watch, and one proof to materialize that is I recommended this in my friends and none of them missed it and said that &quot;It was a nice ride&quot;.",

            "content": "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. \r\nI will begin with saying that this is particularly true for Claymore. On the second hand i must note that this was the first of all anime I ever watched - my boat to the new unexplored horizons that awaited me...so this review might tend to be emotional, irrational, illogical, subjective and biased :)   This is of course because it holds a special place for me among anime world.\r\nStory (7): Revenge, conspiracy, redemption, comradeship, existence and purpose are the key motives of this story. Story of finding something that keeps you going on,something worth fighting for and ultimately give your life, one thing that is truly your own. It can be said bluntly that it's about hunting demons with big swords and shady organizations with evil intents but I observe it from another perspective-trough motivation, exposed and subtle meaning. This kind of stories tend to be vessels for character growth so light shifts to characters as the most prominent and strongest aspect of the show. This is by no means bad thing as Claymore is first and foremost story about Claymores themselves - beautiful silver eyed witches.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9): There are truly many memorable characters from Claymore. Clare is our main character and the \"media\" which links other protagonist, the future and the past. As a monster/demon huntress which are by the common folk simply called Claymores, she is on a path of self exploration, of finding something she lost. She is of unbreakable spirit, and as the twirl of events unfolds, she dares to hope, to hope that there is more to existence than staining her sword with demon blood. Raki, young boy who lost his family to Yoma (demons) accompanies Claire on her travels. As time passes he eventually finds way to Claire's inner-self and the feelings she thought lost long time ago being always a cold huntress! Bond of love, trust and friendship is forged between them but events get them separated and both of them struggle to unify with each other once again. Other characters also contribute to this great anime: Teresa, Irene, Jean, Miria...their motivations lead the story onwards. Character interactions, their intervened relations, conceive emotionally moving and warm moments thus for me are surely highlight of Claymore.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): Madhouse - there is no need, I believe, to specially introduce this studio. Their work speaks for themselves (Black Lagoon, Death Note, Devil May Cry, Hellsing Ultimate...) and Claymore is of course no different. Madhouse style is clearly present and so is the quality. There could be some nitpicking about consistency but overall nothing short of great. Must note that I watched also blu-ray edition whose clarity of picture and sound is excellent and pure enjoyment that really gives due credit to beautiful artwork and animation of studio Madhouse, same time giving anime new dimension.\\n\\n\r\nMusic (10): Excellent and memorable. Soundtrack for Claymore is one of the best of all times combining strong dark bassy tunes and then some soothing guitar ones, beautiful bagpipes sounds, folkloric flute melodies...rarely you will find soundtrack of such caliber. I deeply enjoyed every moment of it. Powerful opening and ending songs (Raison d'etre by Nightmare and Guilty sky by Riyu Kosaka) just add up to this awesome piece, also making one of mine favorite openings of all time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment (9):\\n\r\nI'm quite sure that i didn't cover all of the aspects of Claymore and as such this review is to be faulty in that manner. I humbly tried to present my view on enjoyment this anime provided to me and reasons for doing so, therefore I believe this could also serve as my tribute to Claymore - the first anime I ever watched and than after quite some time decided to write a review. Now I'm glad that this was my first venture in the world of anime  because it sucked me in and presented me in best manner what that world has to offer: great artwork and style, beautiful strong music, emotional connection with characters, sense of immersion, tense and awesome battles...\\n\r\nAs the whole is greater then sum of its parts so is Claymore as a whole more then just its artwork, characters, music... combined they make Claymore shine! As for me, on my anime sky, Claymore will always, like the Sirius, shine brightest.    \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!",

Lots of fights, action, blood, killing...and also peaceful moments.

            "content": "Dragonball Z with swords. This is how I've seen many people describe Claymore.\r\nBut the truth is, the only similarity between these two shows is that they are both action packed power-up series ( however, the power-up element in Claymore is absolutely nothing compared to DBZ ). \r\nIt would be much more accurate to compare Claymore with Berserk. In 1998, Berserk came to define the violent, graphic dark-fantasy genre in anime, and Claymore took its mantle for the first decade of the 21st century. Both share many similarities - from medieval-style settings, serious and dark tone to giant swords and plenty of uncensored gore. Indeed, withits huge count of severed limbs and fountains of blood gushing from the torsos being cut in half, Claymore seems determined not to let the spirit of ultra-violent action shows of the 90s die out in the sea of all the harem, moe and bishonen shows that seem to dominate the anime industry nowdays. Yes, there are other ultra-violent anime being released today, like Hellsing Ultimate, but the difference between Claymore and most of these shows is that Claymore is much more than just mindless violence. Claymore is good on many different levels. Actually, it's not just good, it's very good.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the greatest things about Claymore is that it took a pretty weak premise and turned it into a story that should serve as a benchmark for all the action-oriented series. When I first heard about Claymore, I wasn\u2019t very thrilled to say the least \u2013 an all-female cast of warriors fight monsters with giant swords. \u201cGreat, this is gonna be just a bunch of gory, mindless violence and A LOT of fan service. Kinda like Witchblade\u201d. However, all over the internet, reviews were almost universally positive and my hopes were somewhat raised. But I still only expected an action series that, while by no means stupid and too gratuitous, won\u2019t be particularly deep either. Quality entertainment, yes, but entertainment at its most basic level. Well, I am happy to inform you that I was very wrong. That is not to say that Claymore is some kind of masterpiece or without flaws \u2013 there are flaws, some of them only minor and some of them quite apparent ( which is why I rated it 8 instead of 9 or 10 ), but the positive aspects far outweigh the negatives.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it\u2019s officially classified as a shonen series, Claymore walks the fine line between the shonen and seinen categories, as do some other shows ( like the Death Note ). The ( traditional ) shonen elements present in it are actually the show\u2019s weakest points. There\u2019s plenty of prolonged and tiresome dialogue in the middle of otherwise intense fight scenes, and gravity is not merely defied, but often completely ignored, which is a shame as the choreography of the fight scenes, whether they are duels or group battles, is very good, are there are no boring or pointless battles, although there are some can feel somewhat drawn-out. Another element that draws the quality of the fights ( and thus the entire series) down a bit are the power-ups. Granted, they are much more subtle than in many other series, mostly feel natural and logical, and the sense of proportionality is kept in relation to the power of other Claymores and Yoma/Awakened Beings ( unlike the bullshit we often got from DBZ, which is best described by a joke from Team4Star\u2019s DBZ Abridged: \u201cPower levels are bullshit!!!\u201d ).\\n\r\nHowever, there are one or two places where the power up of a certain character feels far-fetched, to say the least. I won\u2019t name them because I want to avoid spoiling the series for newbies, but in order to back my claim with evidence, I\u2019ll just say that you\u2019ll find some examples in episode 14 and episode 25, during the climactic fight scene. Consequently, while most battles are well-written and a joy to watch, some of them do go over the top, but thankfully, such fights are few, they don\u2019t go that much over the top, and the battles are of reasonable length and don\u2019t suck the life out of the audience ( unlike the battles in other action shows, where climactic fights against the main antagonist can last up to five millennia ). All in all, while it does suffer from some rather typical problems, action in Claymore is very entertaining, mainly because every single fight has a point, and the main battles are crucial to both the plot, and, more importantly, character development. \\n\\n\r\nApart from great action scenes, another one of Claymore\u2019s strongest points are its visuals.\\n\r\nThe studio behind the series is Madhouse, and the name I believe speaks for itself. Their resume of beautifully animated features includes shows such as Death Note, Trigun, Paranoia Agent, Hellsing Ultimate, as well as some great movies like Satoshi Kon\u2019s Paprika. Needless to say, Claymore looks great, despite being a relatively low-profile franchise, which shows the studio\u2019s dedication to each of their shows, regardless of the original manga\u2019s popularity. Madhouse\u2019 trademark style is spot on for Claymore, creating a realistic, yet also a dark and depressing atmosphere of the story that is kept througth the series. Bleak and somewhat dull medieval fantasy setting serves as a perfect backdrop for the story of Claymores and their tragic existence and fate. \\n\r\nThe art is simply gorgeous; from generic towns and villages to mountain lakes, art is highly detailed and the colour palette is used superbly. The shots are never made too dark or monochromatic, which would make them dull and boring \u2013 the artists create a balance of grey, green, brown etc. and then spice it up with some red, purple or blue in just the right way. One example of smart use of colours is the hair of Claymores \u2013 in the manga, they are left uncoloured, white, and the reader can only assume that they all have the same shade of blond hair. In the anime, the artists gave each Claymore a slightly different hair colour, ranging from almost white ( Irene ) to warm yellow tone of Priscilla\u2019s hair. This, along with many variations in details of their uniforms, makes it easier for the viewer to differentiate between various Claymores that are introduced over the course of the story. Still, there are some occurrences, like the major battle in the last episodes where there are two dozen Claymores assembled in one place, where it can be quite difficult to tell which Claymore is which.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the style and the graphics are both top-notch, the same unfortunately cannot be said about the animation itself. That is not to say that the animation is bad, hell no! However, you cannot but notice that Madhouse was on a budget a bit. The show was released in April 2007, relatively shortly after the Death Note and the feature film Paprika, and at the same time as Hellsing Ultimate III, so you can guess that the studio decided to spend more money on the more popular and marketable titles. Thus, the producers of Claymore had to make-do with a limited amount of money, and thankfully, they utilised it to maximum effect. \\n\r\nThe cuts were made where they felt more natural, and when they needed to make it look good, they made it look good. To save the money for action scenes ( and there are a lot of them ), many dialogues and expositions were shot with the person talking not facing the camera, or by having the random people in the background either staying still or moving as little as possible. Many shortcuts were taken during the fights scenes too \u2013 seeing as the show is set in a medieval setting and the primary weapon used in combat are swords, and since many Claymores are capable of wielding their swords much, much faster than any human, flash-lines are often used for sword strokes, but this doesn\u2019t usually detract from the quality of the battles. Another major shortcut that was used very often, and this is not exclusive to Claymore, is animation of blood. Although there are many scenes in which it was animated pretty well and the flow of blood looked natural, for the largest part, and particularly when it came to chopping the monsters into pieces, the blood bursts out in your typical two-dimensional streams that NEVER SEEM TO STOP. Seriously, do the animators even know how much blood can a body hold?\\n\r\nBut, again, this is still a minor issue, seeing as this is just a TV series, and besides, the visuals as a whole are fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing\u2019s mark is less mixed than marks for the action or visuals, which are predominantly great, despite some flaws ( namely the animation shortcuts ). By \"mixed\" I don't mean that the writing is bad, and the issues I had with it are much more subjective than the objective issues of the previous categories. The show is perfectly paced, with the story\u2019s slow unfolding mitigated by the action scenes and dynamic character interaction. The show never gets boring, which can partially be attributed to the fact that, with only 26 episodes of running time, there are no filler episodes. The threat escalation keeps the viewer worried about the main characters, and the character development is completely intertwined with the plot \u2013 the main heroine, Clare, keeps the plot moving forward, and each new battle adds not only to her fighting abilities, but also reveals her personality. This works infinitely better than if the writers decided to develop the characters through \u201ctoken episodes\u201d, like so many other shows, with plenty of time on their hands, do. \\n\r\nAnother element in pacing adds greatly to the quality and enjoyment of the story, and it\u2019s yet another thing that separates Claymore from most action shonen series. Apart from the first two episodes, which serve as an introduction to the basics of the Claymore universe, the story is split into several arcs, 3-4 episodes long on average, which leaves much more space for action, character development and advancing the plot than if the episodes were all stand-alone, and this also prevents it from becoming a \u201cmonster of the week show\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve just praised the pacing, but the actual writing varies greatly. On one hand we have some ham-fisted exposition and unnatural/pointless talking in the middle of the battles, and on the other hand some of the best executed character development I have seen in anime. \\n\r\nThe fact that most of the exposition on the workings of the Claymore universe and the story behind it is spouted with no concern about how natural it would feel is a big let down, not only because the whole story is otherwise very mature, serious and \u201crealistic\u201d, but also because this exposition could have easily been handled much better, and the writer often displays great writing skills in other areas ( aforementioned pacing and character development ). Younger audiences won\u2019t mind this kind of exposition, but since Claymore is very mature and dark, and more of a seinen series than a shonen one, the older, more mature audience will most likely see this as a big minus. \\n\\n\r\nAfter this complaining about the exposition, I feel obliged to give Claymore\u2019s writer(s) credit for character development. Claymore features a relatively small cast of main characters, although there\u2019s a plethora of supporting and side characters, many of whom only appear in one arc. The story is completely centred around Clare, and all the other characters, while well-developed and interesting in their own right, serve to both reveal and shape Clare\u2019s personality, as she goes on in pursuit of her revenge.\\n\r\nI shall say a bit more about the characters themselves in a minute, but right now I want to say a few words about HOW they are developed. \\n\r\nPractically all shows rely on flashbacks in order to shed light on the certain character\u2019s motivation and reveal their back-story. Some shows utilize them well, using just the right amount and integrating them into story naturally, while others go into overkill, dragging the pacing down and revealing that the writer has no idea how to otherwise develop their characters. Claymore uses flashbacks in a smart and ( relatively ) original way. Many characters have tragic pasts that determine their course of actions in the present, and these pasts are presented in very short flash-backs, and I mean \u201cflash\u201d-backs, not \u201cthe-whole-episode-long-retelling-of-life-stories-backs\u201d. These are only a couple of shots or one short scene, merely flashes of memories, and they reveal just enough for the viewer to get an idea about what happened. Simply put - they provide ( a lot of ) information in as little time as possible. The one big exception is the \u201cTeresa Arc\u201d ( Episodes 5-8 ) that is essentially one big flashback, revealing Clare\u2019s past prior to becoming a Claymore, and is also crucial to understanding not only her motives, but also her relationship with Raki. Dedicating an entire arc to Clare\u2019s past, rather than a couple of flash-backs, does wonders for developing not only hers, but several different characters. It is one of the best arcs in the entire series. \\n\r\nHowever, the best example of character development is the \u201cOphelia Arc\u201d ( Episodes 12- 14 ). This arc is both a watershed and an important step forward for Clare, and while the \u201cTeresa Arc\u201d revealed her past and motivations, this arc shows much more of her personality than any other. And the interesting part is, over the course of three episodes, she only has about two dozen lines of dialogue and monologue. So how does the writer develop her character if she barely talks during that arc? Simply \u2013 by juxtaposing her to the characters of the two other Claymores she interacts with ( one of them is her opponent, and the other one an unexpected saviour and tutor ), and then highlighting the differences between Clare and each of these two Claymores. The writing reaches its best during these episodes, and along with the underlying message and theme, this is the show\u2019s highest artistic point. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and one last thing about the writing, more specifically, the dialogue. I\u2019ve already covered the exposition and the talking in the middle of the fight, so I\u2019ll add just one more thing, and it\u2019s also one of the show\u2019s main flaws. While it\u2019s a beautiful story, with lots of tragedy and very emotional at times, occasionally the show is too cheesy or sentimental for its own good, and the main character responsible for this is Raki. Which brings us to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore\u2019s greatest strength is its beautiful character-driven story. And it\u2019s actually a pretty small story. Unlike Berserk, where the actions of characters determine the future of kingdoms, or Lord of the Rings, where the fate of the entire world hangs in the balance, there\u2019s not that much at stake here. It isn\u2019t an epic struggle filled with huge battles, although there are many battles in it. It isn\u2019t a great quest or adventure, although there are quests and mysteries. Claymore is ultimately a human story more than anything else, and that sets it apart from most shonen series, and most anime series in general, really. It\u2019s a very personal story, the story of Clare and how she struggles between her wish to remain human and her thirst for revenge against the person who took everything from her. So the only thing at stake here is Clare\u2019s humanity, and I\u2019d argue that that\u2019s a far greater stake than the fate of Middle-earth.   \\n\\n\r\nClare is not exactly your typical action hero. For starters, she\u2019s a woman ( as are 90% of characters in this story ), meaning that, unlike other shonen shows like Naruto, Bleach and DBZ, the teenage male audience cannot identify themselves with her, or see her as a role model. She\u2019s also not exactly a cool unbeatable bad-ass like say, Selene from Underworld or Revy from Black Lagoon. That\u2019s yet ANOTHER great difference between Claymore and many other action shows \u2013 unlike Goku who is basically a god, and cannot possibly lose, Clare is actually the weakest of the Claymores. Of course, she has the potential to become the strongest of them all, but the path to obtaining the power to exact her revenge is a difficult and bloody one, and each step forward requires a bit of sacrifice ( at one point Clare even loses her dominant arm! ). She often gets beaten and injured, either by Yoma or some of her fellow warriors. The viewer comes to sympathise with her, you are concerned for her and don\u2019t want to see her become one of the monsters she\u2019s fighting against, which is a very realistic possibility, to say the least ( because the power the Claymores use to fight Yoma has its limits, and using too much of it can cause them to turn into complete monsters themselves ). She starts off as cold, distant and unemotional, which is completely understandable given the nature of Claymores and the Organization that controls them; Claymores are half-human and half-monsters, and as such are feared and detested by humans, who see them as a nothing more than necessary evil to fight Yoma, so you can imagine they don\u2019t have much of a social life or human contact. Claymores are lone wolves, merely fighting tools in the hands of the Organization that treats them as completely expendable and whose actions are pretty sinister and dodgy ( they have no qualms about disposing of insubordinate warriors or taking exorbitant fees for killing Yoma from civilians ). Thus, when Clare first meets Raki, she is very reluctant to even tell him her name, let alone allow him to accompany her on her journeys. As the series progresses, she starts to regain some of her lost humanity and emotions, which she lost over the course of many years of painful training and lonely missions, as she was fixated only on her revenge. A good example is when she and Raki set camp and throw an animal on a spit \u2013 as famished Raki digs into the meat like there\u2019s no tomorrow, Clare ( who can go on for days without food ) watches him with nostalgia, saying it\u2019s refreshing to see such a \u201chuman\u201d thing for a change.\\n\\n\r\nRaki, Clare\u2019s companion through most of the series, is often bashed by the fans, especially male fans, for being \u201cuseless\u201d, \u201cwhiny\u201d, \u201cannoying\u201d and so on. Most of this bashing is caused by a complete lack of perspective. Yes, I find him annoying at times too, but to complain that his character is useless and pointless is to completely misunderstand the whole story. Clare, a cold inhuman warrior who lives a solitary and dangerous existence, would never, ever take him with her if he weren\u2019t as helpless and naive as he is ( at the beginning of the series at least ), and if he didn\u2019t remind her of herself before she forfeited her humanity for the sake of vengeance. He gives her a new reason to live, and is essential to her latter decisions, decisions that old Clare would probably never make. I can\u2019t dwell much more on his character without going into the spoiler territory, so I\u2019ll just say that, despite somewhat gary-stuish morals and propensity for crying, he\u2019s a good character and is crucial to the story and Clare\u2019s character development.\\n\r\nOther characters I cannot discuss without spoilers, apart from Priscilla, the main villain. She is an Awakened Being ( a creature, much more powerful than Yoma, that is created if a Claymore uses too much of their power and thus transforms into a being with no remains of their old human self ) that is the main cause of Clare\u2019s tragic past and her decision to become a Claymore. She is, naturally, very powerful, so it takes the whole series before Clare can take her on in a final, climactic fight. And funnily, enough, she\u2019s not actually a \u201cproper\u201d villain. As an Awakened Being, she was formerly a Claymore, and has a tragic past just like Clare. Her awakening is a result of her unstable mind and lack of experience as a Claymore, rather than some inborn vice or evil intent, so she\u2019s not really an evil entity that you can, and should, despise. This is reinforced during the last half a dozen or so episodes during which we get to see more of her character and realise that her fate is a tragic outcome of many unfortunate events in her life, and not really a fault of her own. She is a great character and her condition is crucial to the show\u2019s outcome and message.\\n\r\nAll the other villains/monsters are pretty good too. While Yoma are very generic looking and ( relatively ) easily defeat-able, the Awakened Beings, and particularly the Creatures of the Abyss ( incredibly powerful Awakened Beings that were once #1 Claymores ) have great and very original designs and a wide range of personalities. Designs for these monsters range from insect-like beings to giant beasts and \u201ctentacle\u201d-monsters, all of them pretty unique and interesting. While the normal Awakened Beings are mostly just primitive monsters whose only motivations are search for human food or fighting the Claymores to survive, some particularly strong ones have distinct personalities and are in the service of the Abysmal Ones, who retain much more human characteristics than the other monsters, being quite sinister, scheming and sly individuals, with much more ambition than just hunting humans for food. Overall, even though Claymore is primarily focused on fighting the inner demons in order to maintain humanity, the monsters and villains are distinct and original, providing us with great, quality action and lots of blood.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s left to say...? I swear I\u2019m forgetting something important here... Oh, right, of course \u2013 the music. Sadly, as opposed to Claymore\u2019s above-average visuals, the soundtrack is quite underwhelming. It features a variety of styles, from bagpipes and large orchestral pieces to rock music and even some techno beats. There aren\u2019t really any noteworthy tracks that could stand alone and find themselves on your iPad playlist, since the soundtrack mostly has a supporting role. For the most part, the music complements the visuals well, and sets the mood for each scene, be it an emotional, intimate moment, or a major fight scene. However there are more than few occasions where the choice of music is... questionable, even if the theme that is used fits. It\u2019s just a shame that there aren\u2019t some kick-ass numbers like those character themes from Death Note.\\n\r\nThankfully, there is a special music CD, that is not a part of the official soundtrack, that makes up for this. Titled \u201cClaymore Intimate Persona\u201d, it features 10 character songs, performed by the characters\u2019 original Japanese voice actresses. While it\u2019s up to debate how well do the lyrics fit each character, the songs themselves are very good pieces of music in their own right, with styles ranging from metal to pop. I\u2019d warmly recommend them to all fans of Japanese music.\\n\r\nLike the original soundtrack, the opening for the anime is underwhelming. The song, \u201cRaison d\u2019etre\u201d by Nightmare ( same band that performed the 1st opening and ending for Death Note ) is solid, and fits the series, but the animation is average at best. While most anime TV series put a lot of effort and budget into their openings, which often results in animation that is much, much better than the actual show, the visuals of Claymore\u2019s opening are really nothing special. Not bad, but underwhelming compared to the overall high quality visuals in the series.\\n\r\nThe ending, on the other hand, is great. The musical piece \u201cDanzai no Hana\u201d, fits the series perfectly, making the dark and tragic atmosphere of the show almost tangible. The art is also gorgeous, atmospheric and brilliantly coloured. It\u2019s one of my favourite endings of all time actually.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice-acting, I really have to recommend the sub over dub version. Even though it\u2019s usually hard for me ( and everyone else who doesn\u2019t speak Japanese fluently ) to objectively evaluate the performance of the Japanese voice actors, the Claymore was an exception. The seiyu ARE the characters, their voices fit their respective characters\u2019 personalities perfectly, and they convey their feelings, moods and attitudes brilliantly. \\n\r\nThe English dub, on the other hand, is a mixed bag, and this is more due to the poor casting choices than the lack of talent. Some actors, like Christine Auten as Teresa and veteran Todd Haberkorn as Raki were chosen well ( although many complain that Todd only increased Raki\u2019s annoyingness ), but others, like Stephanie Young as Clare, were not. Clare is supposed to be 17-20 years old, and Young sounds not only much older, but if you compare her voice acting to that of Huoko Kuwashima, you\u2019ll see that \u201cJapanese\u201d Clare and \u201cEnglish\u201d Clare are two different people. Many English voice actors come off as radically different from their Japanese counterparts, and in a negative way. As I said, I recommend the subbed version, but feel free to watch them both and make your own judgment.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the end of the spoiler-free part of the review. In this next, and penultimate paragraph, I shall discuss one thing that divides the fans of this series \u2013 the ending. \\n\r\nThose of you who haven\u2019t seen the show, you should just skip it and go to the final summary in the last paragraph as this contains MAJOR SPOILERS. This discussion is meant for the Claymore fans who seek a second opinion on the ending of their beloved series, and you.can come back and read it after you\u2019ve watched the show.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nNow that it\u2019s just us fans, I\u2019ll make one thing ( two things actually ) perfectly clear from the start  \u2013 I loved the ending for the Claymore anime series and find the anime to be far superior to the manga, and the latter is BECAUSE of the ending. Allow me to explain.\\n\r\nMost of the people who hate the ending ( khm!... whining fan-boys... khm! ) present these arguments: \u201cIt deviated from the manga!\u201d, \u201cThe last episodes were filler!\u201d , \u201cClare should have killed Priscilla!\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s inconclusive!\u201d. First two arguments are just plain bulls*it, and the latter two I strongly disagree with. Why?\\n\r\nFirstly, the fact that the anime deviated from the original material means bugger all. Not only is there no obligation for the animators to remain faithful to the manga ( and they WERE faithful for the vast majority of the time ), but making the anime adaptation faithful to the letter does not equal better quality.\\n\r\nSecondly, \u201cfiller\u201d means that an episode is there just to prop up the running time and there is of no direct ( or even indirect ) consequence to the advancement of the plot, or even character development. Filler does not mean \u201coriginal material not found in the manga\u201d. There are NO filler episodes in Claymore.\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the third argument, Clare not killing Priscilla. And, you see, that\u2019s the whole point of the entire story.  Claymore is a story of revenge, but it is also a story about losing/regaining humanity, a story about human condition and a fight against the animal/monster inside. Over the course of the series, Clare, a person who lost everything and only had a thought of revenge to cling on, comes to realise that she can find other reasons to live apart from her vengeance. She meets Raki, in whom she sees her old self, and he reminds her of her relationship with Teresa. She meets Miria, Deneve and Helen. She befriends Jean after saving her life. The themes of camaraderie and friendship permeate the story, and once Clare finds a prospect of new life with Raki and her friends, her quest for revenge becomes... meaningless, in way, I can\u2019t exactly find the right word. Forfeiting her humanity and even life for the sake of revenge was fine when she was a lonely warrior, but once she\u2019s not that anymore, her revenge, something that will cost her her humanity, becomes hollow and even selfish. We don\u2019t want her to become a monster just so she can avenge Teresa because we\u2019ve come to love her and care for her and don\u2019t want her to let go of things and people she has gained for the sake of taking revenge on behalf of someone who not only cannot gain anything by this ( since she\u2019s dead ), but would never even wish for it. On the contrary, Teresa explicitly says she wishes for Clare to live a normal and fulfilling life as a human being, knowing fully what it means to live a tragic and lonely life of a Claymore. \\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not only about Clare. While the last two episodes were completely original material, there were other changes over the course of the last 6 or so episodes, which skewered the series towards its final resolution, and these changes completely debunk the claims by some fans that the last 2 episodes were \u201cplastered on\u201d. One of the changes was when Raki found out that Priscilla is an Awakened Being. Priscilla\u2019s entire character development over the course of these few episodes, as well as her behaviour during the final battle, is meant to show the viewer that, while a monster, she\u2019s not evil. Her condition is an extremely tragic one, and these few changes are supposed to get the viewer to understand her and realise that she is to be pitied, not hated. Raki serves as sort of a proxy for the audience here, and it\u2019s through the eyes of his character that we are to fully grasp the meaning ( or the lack thereof ) of the final battle between Clare and Priscilla. He gets to watch two people, who he has grown to love/like and sympathise with, turn into monsters trying to rip each other\u2019s guts out. Two persons, kindred spirits, turn into monsters ( although for different reasons ) and fight for...what? And the best part is, even Raki\u2019s pleas cannot turn Clare back. It takes guilt. Only after she kills Jean, her good friend, does Clare realise the pointlessness of her fight and how much could she lose if she doesn\u2019t let go of her revenge and revert back to human. Stricken with guilt, she stops and cries over the death of her friend, coming to appreciate that the people she has now are at least as important to her as is the person she lost, Teresa. As she leaves Jeane\u2019s grave with Raki, she also comes to realise that this is what Teresa actually wanted for her all along \u2013 not forsaking her life in pursuit of something that will ultimately cost her everything, but to lead a happy life that Teresa never could, but died to allow Clare to do so. This ending is just brilliant, filled with emotions and realisations, it is here that all of Clare\u2019s actions and relationships are finally given their true meaning and purpose. Without this final resolution, the story wouldn\u2019t hold that same depth and message. \\n\r\nYes, the ending doesn\u2019t resolve all the plot threads, actually most of them remain unresolved. Yes, the fates of other characters like Miria, Deneve and Helen remain unclear. It\u2019s an open ending, but also not an open ending. The main story \u2013 story of Clare and her revenge is finished, so in a sense, the story is over. You can complain about the story not being completely resolved, you can be personally unsatisfied with this ending, but you cannot call it bad or inconclusive, because it is most definitely not.\\n\r\nThere are several reasons why I think anime is better than the manga, and the absence of this resolution is the main one.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nWell, I\u2019ve never thought I\u2019ll ever write a longer review than the one on Ghost in the Shell, but it seems I underestimated myself. Sorry for dragging this for so long, but, like in GITS, I wanted to cover all of the story and give a proper insight into all individual aspects of it. So, time to sum it up.\\n\r\nClaymore has some flaws \u2013 ham-fisted exposition, ( a bit of ) animation shortcuts, underwhelming soundtrack, a few over-the-top action scenes and power-ups and occasional cheesiness. However, as I\u2019ve said before, the positives far outweigh the negatives \u2013 it\u2019s got great visuals, great story, great characters, entertaining action scenes and a lot of heart. It\u2019s a beautiful kind of story that is hard to come across these days, not only in anime but in Western cinematography as well. Even if the franchise gets forgotten in several years, Claymore will always remain here as a little gem of a story, waiting to be discovered by a wandering anime fan, searching for a deep and meaningful story in the world of series mostly devoid of these traits. \\n\r\nI whole-heartedly recommend Claymore to everyone, and give it a solid, well-deserved 8.1/10. \\n",

            "content": "Claymore is an action, fantasy, supernatural based anime which was released in the spring of 2007. The show itself was adapted from its manga, spanning 26 episodes- although it should be noted it does cut off from the manga near the end in order to fit the anime in. This show gets going straight from minute one and from there on it\u2019s almost impossible to stop. Almost.  \r\nThe premise upon which Claymore is built is actually a very absorbing one, the setting and plot doesn\u2019t seem clich\u00e9d and right from the first episode it is likely to have you hooked. The world in Claymoreis inhabited by both humans and monsters which are otherwise known as Yoma. They are beings who are always thirsting for human flesh and have a veracious appetite for guts. What makes these Yoma so special is the fact that they can change forms to look just like humans and thus they can reside in villages and towns, getting by undetected and pounce whenever the opportunity presents itself. Humans themselves are unable to fight back as the Yoma are simply too strong and so the humans often call for help in the form of claymores. Claymores are half-human, half-Yoma beings who are controlled by an \u201corganisation\u201d and have the power to slay most Yoma with relative ease. They are however not trusted and feared by the humans due to their Yoma connections despite the assistance they provide. \\n\r\nThe first episode introduces the two main protagonists in the show, Raki, a young boy who had lost his parents to Yoma and also Clare, a claymore who is sent to rid the Yoma in Raki\u2019s village. Through various events, Raki eventually tags on and travels with Clare on her journey- very much to Clare\u2019s disdain. Without getting into spoiler territory, I would like to point out that this is initially a very interesting relationship in terms of how the two quite different people start to bond. Raki slowly tries to win Clare over and eventually they start to build a bond over the length of the show which is key to many parts of the story. However, this isn\u2019t the only relationship and in fact there is an arc far better involving a relationship much fuller and richer than that of Raki and Clare. \\n\r\nThe show actually has a theme running throughout of brotherhood, togetherness and friendship. These themes are the backbone of so many arcs and sub-plots and the way in which the characters are united can seem to strike up a few emotions. It certainly promotes a very healthy and real sense of camaraderie which means you can really connect and empathise with many of the characters. They use this attraction to the characters to really play with your emotions, not always for the better, in this show you can feel frustrated, shocked, elated all at the same time for almost all of the characters throughout the show. Personally apart from two or three characters, I didn\u2019t find the characters to be amazingly deep and most were average. \\n\r\nThere are some deeper questions this show asks too however, which are interspersed frequently in every episode. The main one being- what is it to really be human? What is it within us that keeps us sane? When do we cross the line that turns us into a metaphorically speaking, monster- I\u2019m thinking murderers etc. here. These are just thoughts that will pop up from episode to episode and get you thinking- although the anime itself doesn\u2019t take it upon itself to really answer these questions.\\n\r\nAt this point I\u2019ll also mention the amount of guts and gore involved in this show. Basically, I don\u2019t there was a single period of ten minutes where I didn\u2019t see someone\u2019s limbs or head flying off. Every single episode is full of blood and gore, that isn\u2019t to say however that it is off putting, it\u2019s just extremely over the top. The amount of damage some of these people can take just has you thinking \u201coh c\u2019mon you\u2019ve got to be dead by now!\u201d So you are certainly covered if you are looking for a lot of over the top action!\\n\r\nNow, so far everything seems pretty good. Fairly gripping characters? Check. A storyline and setting that can really go somewhere? Check. Do we end up actually going anywhere? Not really. \\n\r\nThere were quite a few problems with this show, which personally I feel stopped it from really going on and becoming a really top rate show.  The biggest problem with this show was that it was simply too short, it needed to, HAD to be longer. It could really have benefitted from further episodes, not to keep the story going, but instead to expand on the situations within the initial 26 episodes. The show starts to run out of steam as the show goes and after an extremely strong start, fails to keep it up. As a result by the end of the show you feel as if there loads of details that have been missed out and that the whole thing is just too rushed. The strong premise of the show and the action means you will keep watching-while still enjoying the show- but at some point you will feel as if you have hit some kind of wall and that nothing is really progressing.\\n\r\nA further problem was that the show seems to lose the overall plot over the course of the show and fumbles its way through to the final few episodes. The sense of closure when you will finish the show is missing, you don\u2019t really feel as if the show has ended and you\u2019re left with a sort of \u201cwait what, that\u2019s it?\u201d feeling. After all the plots and storylines which are set up it can feel like a massive let down and that\u2019s where the flaw lies. \\n\r\nThe art style was quite good for an anime of the 2007 period and also complemented the style of show that Claymore depicts, although it did seem a little odd at times with the way some humans were portrayed. The Yoma themselves weren\u2019t all the same and were sufficiently different enough to keep you guessing. The music was simply superb, the actions scenes were complemented with the kind of music that really pumps you up and the tense moments really did give you a sense of unease. The OP was very good in my opinion, while the ED was average. \\n\r\nDespite the criticisms, Claymore is still a thoroughly enjoyable show which sadly falls short of its rather massive potential. However if you are looking for fast paced action with loads of over the top fighting and blood and gore, then this is your show. \\n\r\nFor recommendations for similar shows, I would certainly recommend attack on titan if you haven\u2019t already seen it since they are both similar in terms of action, although attack on titan in my opinion has a far more even paced and frankly better story line. \\n",

The story focuses on a certain Claymore, Clare, who's motivated to become stronger snd stronger in order to get her revenge.\r\nThe story is truly great but what I loved the most was how every single character was amazing in their own ways. My favourite one was Teresa and I'm dissappointed that she only appears in a few episodes although she had a great influence on Clare and other characters. Many characters die and with every death you become more and more addicted to the series because it gets to your feelings.\r\nLike I said first, Ienjoyed watching every episode beacuse the story is very captivating so you won't get bored even for one second.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to write any spoilers. All I want to say is that the ending is rather open, the story goes on so I really wish there would be season 2. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I rated this anime 10. I was more like 9.50 but I gave it a 10 because of the great characterisation of Clare, Raki, Teresa and other ones. If you haven't watched it yet, I really reccomend it to you.",

            "content": "Claymore is a Shounen Fantasy anime that revolves mostly around a female protagonist, Clare, and her ventures with her cook Raki. Clare is part of an organization that essentially controls half-man, half-monster beings called 'Claymores'. These Claymores go out and fight monsters called Yoma, who plague the world of  wherever it is that this anime take's place setting wise. It is a moderately well thought out battle anime with decent enough character development and a plot that makes you wish it was twice as long.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story, in the beginning, progresses very slowly. As denoted in the quick overview, the anime focuses on Clare, aClaymore who fights Yoma. I was actually quite bored with the show (for multiple reasons) until I reached episode 7, where things finally started to pick up. But until you reach that far, you're basically just following Clare and Raki with almost no real story background and watching Clare slay basic Yoma; Yoma that are so basic, you can tell they aren't major just by the way they are drawn. The boring monsters, coupled with the lack of story and lame characters in the beginning was a real turn-off for me for this anime. But believe me, it picks up. You eventually learn of Clare's reason for fighting, and that's where the story takes off. It is the classic story of revenge, and from there more interesting monsters get involved too. You learn that the world doesn't revolve around Clare, and there is a bigger picture involved here. For once, as well, we have a protagonist that isn't created to be the most powerful person in existence, which is a nice change of pace. But speaking of pace, that was a problem I had with this anime. The pacing in the beginning was really slow, and I feel it was a waste of a good amount of episodes. Then, out of no where, it picks up and gets very interesting. At the end though, it almost seems rushed and ends with more questions than answers. I feel entirely unresolved now that the anime is finished, and the anime didn't interest me enough to pursue the manga to find out the overall ending. I would almost say I was disappointed in how the story turned out, but the end was still sort of pleasing and I really did love the mini-arc with Teresa. However, it feels like it ended half-way from where it SHOULD have been. It should have been twice as long. Overall, a good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was different than I am used to. I'd describe it as Victorian art style meets Anime art style. We have the beautifully drawn Claymores, that all look like the could be dolls, and we have the not-so-well drawn humans. They aren't bad, but not as good as the Claymores. The Yoma in the beginning, as aforementioned, were boring and not drawn in a way that caught the eye. However, when the more interesting Yoma get involved, the artwork really displays how good it is! One thing I did notice was a lack of consistency, with eye placement on a face or lip detail and other things that relate to the face. Nothing major, but sometimes distracting if you're overly critical with the art of an anime (as I am). They also don't censor much, and this anime is a bit gory. Overall, the art is one of the more fine points of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere was nothing particularly good or bad about the sound, voice acting, or music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I was REALLY annoyed. I actually disliked Raki and Clare as characters, because they had such a lack of depth for the first 6 episodes. Raki was just an annoying cry baby; I haven't even met a girl who cries as much as he did. And Clare was just a plank with no personality at all. Then Teresa's story came up, and I fell for her character first. Then we learn more about Clare, and Raki toughens up and becomes more likable. Clare also manages to be less of a Kristen Stewert and gains some emotion, which is always good for the protagonist of an anime. The other secondary characters also are a very nice touch. The girls we see in the opening credits (Miria, Deneve, Helen, and Jean) are really nice additions and contrast each other well, giving a nice variety to the characters. As it probably seems, my favorite character in the whole mix was Teresa.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have mixed feelings about this anime. I liked the story, but it was slow and boring at times and left me wishing there was more (not in the good way, but in a 'this is rushed' way). I liked the artwork at times, but didn't at other times. The sound wasn't specially good or specially bad, and the characters were good but took a while to actually get to that point. I feel very stuck between a 7 and an 8. I'd give this anime a 7.4, but since there are no decimal ratings, I rounded overall to a 7. The anime was a decent watch, and considering how popular it is and the fact that it isn't long, it's worth watching. I wouldn't say it was one of my favorites, but if they were to make a second season I would totally watch it. Overall, a good anime.\\n\\n\r\n**************************************************************\\n\r\n********SIDE NOTE! IGNORE FOR POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS**********\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I felt like I could not go without saying for this review was something that might be perceived as a minor spoiler: character death. I feel like this anime is the 'Game of Thrones' of the anime world. Characters die off so casually and often in this show, to the point where I almost never wanted to get attached to a character. It was nice knowing that the suspense of a battle was warranted because they may not actually come out alive, but the characters die so casually that they don't get the epic deaths I wished they would get. In fact, all of the fighting is treated really casually: enemy deaths, limbs being cut off (which happens A LOT), and/or friendly character deaths. Overall: violence is gory in this anime, but treated casually.\\n\\n\r\n**********************END OF SIDE NOTE***********************",

            "content": "Claymore is one of the animes that you certainly would look a second time, just to enjoy the thrilling fights, yet while having an already seen concept.\r\nIt plays out in a medieval world where predators called ,,Yoma'' reign terror over humanity. They are able to hide in a human ,,shell'' and can pop up anytime to kill and eat a human when they see fit.\r\nHumanity though then showed the politely described ,,Go away'' -Finger to the Yoma by the creation of a sub-race. \r\nA secret organisation has brought women together and had let them consume Yoma flesh, or implanted yoma flesh into them. Theresult to that is that they gain the power to see Yoma even in their human shell, but in exchange -they have to stay emotionless. When those girls unleash their emotions, the yoma in them rises and thus takes over them. If they reach a certain limit then they are not able to revert to their human form.\\n\r\nI will come back to this part in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story brings us Raki, a young boy that that had lost his parents due to a yoma attack and thus was left only with his brother who tries to teach him swordsmanship. Raki is faced with a sudden yoma attack and even that the elder called the famous ,,Claymore'' to their aid. Claymore , is an unfortunately not explained nickname that the citizen gave the cursed women. Some say that they could see nothing behind those eyes , yet when they changed the colour - they were able to see Yoma.\\n\r\nA young woman with short hair then arrives at the city, she was the one called, but then the story does a rushed step where raki gets attacked by the yoma that hid himself as his brother while telling him bit by bit that he was the one that ate his brother back then. \\n\r\nNaturally this wont go unnoticed by the Claymores' Eye, and she saves the little boy Raki. Him having nothing left, he began to follow her and thus we finally hear her name, Claire.\\n\\n\r\nClaire is basically the same like Raki. The story begins to deconstruct her by showing a bit of affection and care for his welldoing while she protects and trains him too. Up to that point where she even gets saved through his will. Despite Claire being clarified well in the story. We unfortunately get little to no more information about Rakis Backstory during the whole series. The Plot goes then further to introduce the main villain, a demoness called ,,Priscilla'' which violently killed Claires guardian and her friends back then. You get a good feel from then on that she seeks only and only to avenge her killed friend.\\n\\n\r\nComing then to Art. If you are a fan of gore - you will be fine with this. The art is trying to be realistically and creative and when something should look like it hurts - it does look very very very painful. I was also amazed at the competitive fights and the different yoma designs, not to forget that its style its leaned towards older anime maybe bringing even a bit more comic-like features in it. The sound is more medieval oriented and thus also very fitting. Though while the Opening is very fitting, i feel like the battle themes hadnt had the power they should. Theme should make you pumped, should make you excited for the fight..yet it went a little lash, but thankfully the plot makes up for that so it wont get boring midway through.\\n\r\nCharacters, as already mentioned, were sometimes left out and not really well fleshed out, leaving you with scenes that hadnt much reasoning attached to them. Like, why did Teresa not kill Priscilla -it is clear that she would have been a threat, why did she hesitate at the moment of Priscilla being overtransformed and begging to be killed. I know that the new Priscilla might have been too fast for her, but \u00eet seemed like she gave time on purpose instead of ending it quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThough some flaws, i mostly had enjoyed Claymore - even looking it in English dub and japanese dub too. (though i ensure you that watching the original jp dub is much better) i issue it a solid : 7.5\\n\\n\r\nIf you have read it all up until here, know that im very grateful for that :) and i Hope that my review could have helped you making the choice to watch it or not.",

            "content": "Since Claymore is one of those anime that doesn't adapt the whole manga and has an anime original ending; I never really bothered to watch it. The premise looked cool, but I didn't want to be disapointed.  Now that I've finally finished it; here are my personal thoughts on it:\r\nClaymore's setting can be descriped as Dark Fantasy; it's very grim, there's virtually no comedy or fanservce; it's violent and a lot of people die. So first of all,what is this anime about: Claymores are half monster girls (not as sexy as it sounds) who defeat actual monsters (\"Yoma\") with their giant swords. But sincethere are part monsters themselfes, they might turn into \"awakend beings\" who are even more dangerous than normal monsters. The main characters are a young woman named Clare, who seeks revenge for a beloved person from her past and her sidekick Raki who doesn't really do anything, except whining. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the first thing that you'll notice, is that 95% of the characters are female. What, a fighting shounen with females who aren't weak? Exactly. I have to be honest here, if it wasn't for the strong women in Claymore; this show wouldn't have that much indentity. That's a pretty poor statement, but I still really apreciate the author's decision, since action anime with girls are still pretty rare. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't like the amout of character deaths though. Too many characters die 2-3 episodes after they're introtuced, which made it hard to like any of them (except for Clare). The fact that most characters look the same didn't really help (same clothing/armor and very simmilar hair and faces). \\n\\n\r\nThis show had an interesting artstyle and I really liked the atmosphere in Claymore, it felt really dark and edgy. The music was decent too and there are a few tracks that really stood out. Animations are good too, the action scenes usually look fluint.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was by the far the worst aspect of this anime. It wasn't satisfying at all and felt like there was so much left (which it was, since the anime only adapts 40% of the manga). But what this anime adapt was pretty good and for the most I felt very entertained. After you finished this show, you either want to quickly read the manga, because this anime made you a Claymore fan and you want to see the real ending or you're just disapointed and want to never touch Claymore ever again because of the ending(in my case it was the former ^^).\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a classic for me. As an person who loves action anime it delivers some good epic stuff.\r\nAction: 9/10. This anime is violent and gory and I'm totally fine with that. People get eaten, monsters get cut up, half humans and half monsters ( claymores) get cut up. People getting killed left, right and center. Its perfect from an action point of view. Tonnes of action throughout the series. Won't be disappointed by it either. There's fast paced action. Slow emotional paced action and intellectual action where characters outsmart there opponents or evaluate the battles in detail. It's absolutely wonderful.\r\nStory: 6/10. This storywas basic, effective and started of good. Without revealing too much its about revenge and a organization which deploys half human and half monster warriors ( claymores) to exterminate monsters. Relationships get built both between humans and claymores and the series just progresses from there. There's tonnes of emotion and hardship which will get you sucked in and focused on this. The story is great you'll love it. You'll hate the ending though. Many unanswered questions left. This is the type of anime which just didn't end. It needed a season 2 but never got it. I guess a part of that could be because it stopped following the manga at one point. The ending is catastrophic its bad and it ruins the whole series because the story was brilliant. Nevertheless if you like action and character development you should watch this series. Plenty of emotion and character and plot development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10. The action and massacres are worth watching. The story is very seducing. The ending is heartbreaking it hits me every time i watch it.",

            "content": "If you are interested in a dark anime, with a decent plot, a flood of blood, and for once fearless women without squeaky voices, then Claymore maybe for you. Spoiler free.\r\nPlot summary:\r\nBasically, demonic creatures 'Yoma' consume human innards. To oppose the 'Yoma', we have a group of women known as 'claymores', who are half human - half Yoma. These silver eyed Claymores exist solely to eliminate the Yoma. Due to their Yoma anatomy, the Claymores are detested by regular humans.\r\nPlot Analysis: 8\r\nThe plot, sure is capable of intriguing you. Raki, our main hero, sets out with Clare, a Claymore, after a Yoma attack. We seeClare encountering a variety of opponents, ranging from Yoma to Claymores. The battles aren't endlessly dragged, or the victor prevailing through 'laughable', illogical means. The main character has a sole purpose for her actions, and no arbitrary events are showcased. \\n\\n\r\nWould you selflessly serve the society, which despises you? That's the question which lights the Claymores mind. Overall, the plot was fairly decent, may seem a bit episodic in the beginning, but it all fits up. One thing that may dissuade people from watching Claymore is that, towards the end it diverges from the Manga, and forms its own ending. As to that, I believe it solely depends upon the viewer's taste. It may seem a bit incomplete, but I for one found it satisfactory enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are fairly decent, easily supplementing the anime's atmosphere. The soundtrack ranges from a beautifully executed melancholy orchestra to a more forceful thumping beat.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is magnificent. Set in a medieval period, the dark tone of the anime is beautifully animated. Its like reading a fantasy novel, coming across descriptions of crystal clear lakes or mountains. If you've read the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini, you'll be reminded of Alagaesia. The action scenes look realistic enough, and the sequence pacing is decent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis is where, I think the anime could have buckled up. No real character development really takes place. The characters who are pathetic remain pathetic(you'll know when you see), and you don't notice any visible changes in the characters. With that said, the main characters have relevant backstories, but barring that you don't see any further development. You also don't really get attached to any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI personally don't have serious issues with that. It depends upon your taste. Should the characters remain the same, after the initial backstory/past introduction? Or would you want to see a visible change in their outlook? Since Clare primarily has only one goal, its clear why her character remained steadfastly firm, but as I remarked, this depends upon viewer interpretation. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, despite all the inherent flaws, plot, etc, enjoyment is what really makes an anime for me. The above mentioned becomes irrelevant, if your time was well used. So yeah, for the most part I enjoyed Claymore. Occasionally, it may seem dragged or a tad bit repetitive, but watchable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nAction, Gore, dark medieval setting, intriguing plot. If you are into this genre, you may consider checking Claymore out. Not my favorite but still pretty unique, and satisfactory.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first that one will notice about Claymore is that it is a heavily thematic anime: women with swords and armor, humans versus monsters/demons and the internal battles of strong, sacrificial yet feared and misunderstood warriors. \r\nI'll begin with what I believe to be the aspects of Claymore that are both its best asset and weakness; this anime offers an awesome blend of beautifully crafted women that possesses awesome fighting qualities. \"Claymores\" is what they are called, and they represent a mysterious organization that fight demons or human devouring \"Youma.\" \r\nThe story is revealed by a certain \"Claymore\" named Clare and her meeting withan ill-fated boy, Raki. Their endeavors will reveal little by little the mysteries surrounding these female warriors or what people call &quot;silver eyed witches.&quot; Those women each have special abilities, personal conflicts and pasts- especially Clare, who has a certain resolve to achieve her goal: vengeance.\\n\\n\r\nThis backdrop offers us plenty of exciting and suspenseful action (with a certain degree of violence); Claymore offers one of the best. The interaction of those characters, and the clashes of their persona deserves praise, and also many criticisms:\\n\\n\r\nTo my dismay, the themes of Claymore are differently emphasized, emotion and desire are the ones that are prevalent in the story. The plot progresses with vengeance, hatred , curiosity, strength and of course, love. However, because Claymore's story is like a rope with many threads (its characters affecting the series overall), the story is weakened very much by few necessary significant, yet mediocre characters. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the presence of obviously evil, inhumane antagonists offers a one sided war. And if ever they have the reason or motivation for their actions, it is explained/emphasized in an unimpressive way-with many of the characters. Too many deaths of certain beloved people for dramatic effect already became cliches. The set of characters are is also limited to those who share the same fates or point of views, so the clashes of varieties of individuals are hardly seen.\\n\\n\r\nAlso note the overuse of lines such as &quot;I want to be with you no matter what!&quot; or &quot;She is a human, even though...&quot; which are based plainly on emotional reasons, yet they advance the story.\\n\\n\r\nYet  I can also say that Claymore is enjoyable and its art is worth to be appreciated. Its animation is very beautifully realistic and appropriate, setting a perfect mood for the series. The medieval inspired setting, is well designed and the characters can be individually identified though they share certain characteristics. The Claymores are certainly memorable and its hard not to love them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very dramatic and epic. The opening and ending music are  very well-suited to the themes. But in my opinion, they could have been better, for they failed to stir emotions at certain scenes; some music are also used inappropriately- like a heroic music at a haunting scene.\\n\\n\r\nThough I believe that Claymore wasted a lot of its potential (such as female psychology and the issue of humanity), I really had fun watching it. The suspense is awesome that you'll be glued in your seat or bed. \\n\\n",

This anime is truly great in its own way.\r\n-I believe this anime came from nothing and evolved into something much greater than expected.\r\n-I loved this anime from the characters to the story. Every character that was involved in this anime were really unique and made this anime really good and entertaining. The story was pretty cool too, it was something new to me that really peeked my interest I didn't know much about this anime before watching it all i knew was what the synopsis providedme. (which wasnt much) One of my favorite parts about this anime was the Arc with Teresa and Claire and how Claire met Teresa. This was remarkable and very memorable to me. It told a really really good story and explained the unexplainable about Claires life. Thats the reason why I rated the story a 9 was just based off of this arc.(yeah your probably thinking that its not an arc but whatever its the same thing to me haha)\\n\r\n-The best thing about this show and the ratings was the Enjoyment of this anime, i rated it a 10 because i never saw myself losing interest in this show. Every episode was filled with some sort of action even if the story was starting to get slow it still kept me wanting more. I ended up finishing this anime really really fast because it was that damn good.\\n\r\n-If you dont believe what i am saying to you then stop reading this and go try it for yourself. \\n\r\n-Hope this helped you in deciding to watch this or not have a great day!!",

However when I continued I noticed that the characters captured my interest. The pain they suffered, the trials they faced and the despairs they were thrown formed many different people. Depending on how they coped, processed and the amount of acceptance they were each capable of thrown into a clash of competition was a brilliant combination for me. The frail limits of a human mind when pressed to the ultimate created this fascinating anime.\r\nI admit that the story was typical as expected and I didn'tparticularly grow fond of the the way the characters were drawn but with the excellent casting of voice actors it became acceptable and after a while I hardly grew annoyed with the art in itself. The depth of characters lifted this anime from something average to my absolute favorite anime seen so far that is if a second season is to be expected otherwise I feel that the whole season was wasted but I give points to this anime while assuming that a second season is on its way.",

Watching it, you will think that the story will flow as any other common anime would, mixing together war, love, hatred and revenge resulting a mixed-up story, but that is not true at all. Claymore respects the primary goal throughout the story.\r\nThe environment is dark, obscure, giving it a more serious air but also a spooky and cold one.\r\nI really admire that despite the fact that the anime has got a lotof beautiful blonde girls appearing in it, Claymore respected its genres of adventure and action all the way, without any ecchi involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I did not really liked was the bitter taste that Claymore left me with. Even though the anime was really good, something was missing. At some point i realised that the story lacked some details and could have been wider and richer. That made it just a little bit unsatisfactory.  \\n\\n\r\nSome may learn something from the last episodes, maybe a life lesson, some may accept it, some may not agree with it, but that is for you to decide, I dont want to spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, Claymore is a \"must see\" and I strongly recommend it.",

But its not good for the young kids, becouse of the brutality of the fight scenes its not good for there young minds. Anyway its one of the greatest anime of 2007 even if well the ending of the series way rushed and I know I read about its manga and its rushed. Butfor the people that likes hack and slash anime with a bit of finding one's purpose in life well this anime is for you.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore the anime that has a bad ass, sword fighting and did I say that the Claymore's are hot and beautiful women that protect the world from from demon's called Yoma.

And the bottom line is I like this anime even if its rushed and so brutal and did I say that i don't like voilence against women man come on those women are beautiful than any anime I have seen and they get killed Oh man...... well that it.......

            "content": "I must be having some sort of bad luck, because I keep picking up high rated animes I end up disliking.\r\nThe anime is quite bad, I originally wanted to rate it as 5/10, but changed my mind to 4/10 after last few episodes.\r\nAt its core, it is a bad shounen/fighting anime, which is cleverly disguised as something good using art style. The story revolves around half-monster-half-human female warriors called \"Claymores\". In a plenty of scenes  you'll watch them being butchered, killed, stabbed, dismembered and tortured. The anime also features incredibly annoying needy clingy boy character whose job as far as I can tell isto arrive in the scene, cry, and ask something incredibly obvious or shout moral statement while crying. The high points of the anime is its art style - claymores look beautiful and some of the monster designs are quite interesting. Animation, however, is not that good, and there's a lot of panning/zooming involved. \"Panning/zooming\" means a scene is animated in 2 or 3 frames, and camera slowly pans along it. The anime also features a lot of \"time-saving\" techniques ocmmon for shounene anime, namely flashbacks. a LOT of flashbacks, in one episode the same flashback has been shown several times.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, details:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe premise and the idea about half-human-half-monster warriors is incredibly interesting/promising (and reminded me of Witcher, Dragon Age 's Gray Wardens, etc), but it is underutilized. Too much of the story revolves around this or that monster killing or torturing Claymores. I would say the story puts way too much attention on mutilation and torture instead of focusing on deeper aspects of character. The world by itself is not very convincing. The abilities of yoma(i.e. monsters) are not very well explained, it is unclear what they are, if they're some sort of creatures, or if it is magic, etc. During the course of the anime I had impression that the anime just invents new powers out of thin air, without any logic applied to them, and this applied to both yomas and claymores.  Another bad part of the show is Raki (clingy, whiny, crybaby boy), which apparently supposed to be important, but in reality is just useless/annoying. Basically, there was a great potential in the original idea, but the anime does not reach that potential. The story is prone to flashbacks. After 1st 4 episodes or so, you'll see a LOT of flashbacks of the same event being played over and over, again and again, at every opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is good, but animation is not. Claymores are quite pretty. Their style is interesting. Backgrounds are detailed.  However, the anime tries to avoid animations when possible, and pan looping sequences of 3 frames, zoom, and on occasion resorts to cheap techniques like \"movement is too fast to see\". Meaning two characters can stand near each other without moving, with camera shaking and only simple \"moving sword trail \" being animated (in 2 or 3 frames). This is supposed to demonstrate incredibly fast series of stabs, but it happens a lot, and closer to the end there are a LOT of scenes where something moves too fast to be drawn, or someone swings the blade too quickly for the blade to be visible, meaning a lot of fights turn into sequences of mostly static frames and sound effects. This is very, very disappointing, and made me think that the studio might've been on a fairly tight budget.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSurprisingly, music does not fit the anime well. There's no common theme or style in background music, and selection on background pieces seems to be quite common. The main \"Claymore\" theme that appears from time to time is quite interesting - it is an orchestral piece with powerful/fantasy/medieval feeling to it, however for some reason anime features Heavy Metal music and Techno-style composition that does not fit the anime at all. I like heavy metal and death metal, but the tune selected for this anime didn't really fit it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nRaki is a bane of this anime. Incredibly annoying, prone to crying over every occasion, cllingy, he can cause facepalm in almost any scene where it appears. He isn't that bad at the very beginning of the show, but later on, it turns into a real annoyance. Completley powerless, lacking strength of claymore, he stilll has some delusional ideas. He's not as bad as Yahiko from Rurouni Kenshin, in the sense that Raki at least has some common sense, but he's incredibly annoying,\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of claymores are not well portrayed, and that applies to Claire as well. Usually the anime will explain someone's motivation in a hurry, and then promptly butcher the person in question. The behavior of Claymores is not very convincing either, since they're waaay too interestedi n murdering each other at a drop of the hat every time they meet.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDidn't like it. I think I liked few episodes near beginning, but it gets worse closer to the end, focus on torture/dismemberment, lack of quality animation and Raki's whininess ultimately ruin the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe only good reason to check this anime is its art style. Animation is not good, but claymores and SOME monsters are designed in interesting manner. There are worse shows out there, of course, but either way this one was quite disappointing.",

            "content": "Holy hell. This turned out to be an intense watch. Claymore is the work of Norihiro Yagi, and about a third of the manga was adapted in to this 26-epsiode anime 2007 by Madhouse. I was recommended Claymore by my cousin about a year ago, but just now got down to actually watch it. Which I\u00b4m very glad I did. Personally, the show was a real hit, it literally hit me in the gut. I can see why Claymore may not suit everyone, but in the dark fantasy/action genre it\u00b4s a gem. Medieval setting, dark atmosphere, monsters fighting monsters, powerful organizations, conspiracy\u00b4s, experiments, warriors, andcomradeship. Claymore had it all. The art style is characteristic and clean, giving the story stunning visuals. I immediately started to read the manga after I finished it, and haven\u00b4t been let down yet. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did Claymore a home run to me? I tell you right now.\\n\\n\r\nThe story holds a strong quality overall, with an end purpose in mind. Many questions that I had was answered while watching, and the rest were answered later in the manga. The dark fantasy genre is predominant, with a fair amount of blood, gore, and violence, which I guess the show is kind of famous for. But the portrayal of comradeship, and sisterhood was the best I seen so far in any anime or manga. It\u00b4s just as much of a revenge saga, as it\u00b4s about companionship without the cheesy outbursts and declarations. No comedian relief for a second, this is on the emotional heavy side. The life is not easy for most in this world, especially not for the Claymores. Used as tools of the organization, and feared and hated by the people they save, they seldom find any comfort beyond their own kind, and rarely there either. Their futures are dark and likely will be violent and painful, or worse. They were easy to sympathizes with, and their different personalities felt dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nIn stories about battles and revenge, good villains are needed. You know the ones with more than one dimension to them, they too drives of certain purposes. And Claymore provides them. Introduced with some accompanying information about the background of the organisation and yomas, the real problems show themselves bit by bit. The story itself, is more or less divided in smaller arcs, all connecting together, building on the main plot, confronting yomas, or getting to know a certain key character. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the anime felt a bit off to me, and it turns out to be an anime original ending. That kind of ruin the relatively logical power differences the characters had, but from the end of the 25th episode that starts to make no sense. It was no logical explanation to how that power gap could have been closed that fast, and the show there breaks one of its most important rules. Which dropped the relatively consistent feeling. The manga have a different route, which made much more sense. That end battle just felt forced, and probably was.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse is the studio behind many famous anime, like Monster, Death Note, Parayste, One Punchman, Hunter x Hunter, Black Lagoon, Hellsing Ultimate, and Trigun to mention a few under their belt. So, to expect good animation quality for its time is justified. The characters, backgrounds, and all over feeling worked well together and they been fairly true to the manga\u00b4s art which holds absolute top quality. Madhouse caught the dark atmosphere, choregraphed nice action scenes, and pin pointed the colour palette. Dark and light colours are mixed together nicely, the yomas and Claymores eye colour shifts, the light setting was all top quality for its time. The details of the Claymores armour were just as detailed as the manga, as well as their face expression. No complains from me in that department.  \\n\\n\r\nThe best quality of Claymore besides the art, is its characters. To see Clare grow through out the watch was impressing, depressing, and kind of captivating. Claymore also contain one of the best supporting casts I seen. All has developed individual personalities, problems, pasts, and futures. Many has a significant part in the story, and no small amount of coolness. The dialogues they had were all interesting, either it was psychotic rambling, discussing yomas or conspiracy\u00b4s, or expression an opinion. They do sometimes tend to happen in the middle of a battle, but for this kind of storytelling, it works (at least for me). \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack worked really well with the all over atmosphere of Claymore, with respect to the situation. I actually chose to watch it dubbed on a whim and liked it a lot. A large and diverse cast, with well matched voice actors really pulled this off. Famous VA\u00b4s such as Colleen Clinkenbeard, Vic Mignogna, and Brina Palencia were part of the cast, and did their roles well as always. Have you watched your fair share of dubbed anime you will for sure recognize them.   \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize things up, the anime Claymore was great but fell just at the finishing line. I was fully invested in the characters, the story was interesting, and I have a soft spot for cool revenge sagas. Especially combined with a growth path for the characters, both physically and mentally. The cast gets rather large, but they manage to pull it of with some really good character portrayal. There is some romance as well, while not in the front seat, there is a touch, which I found a bit heart warming in all the blood, gore, and violent deaths. The bound between the Claymores run deep, both as allies and enemies. Only a fool would willingly go into a fight with one of Silver eyed witches. The much smoother end to the \u201cThe Battle of the North Arc\u201d, made the story much more coherent and follow the logic they established. I can truly recommend the anime Claymore as well as the manga, they take theme dark fantasy very seriously.  \\n",

            "content": "Claymore is an anime, much like Berserk, is about a swordsman trying to find purpose, and unlike Guts, Claire is simply not as great, but she plays her part well.\r\nThe story is about basically Claymores, who are half-human and half-kyoma, or demon, and they fight to destroy these demons, so that the humans can live in peace. Claire encounters this boy named Rocky, who is saved by Claire basically twice within the first episode, and after that, he clings to her non-stop... This is the story, not the characters. I will get to them in a second. The story basically was a mix of justClaire being a badass/having the best luck out of the entirety of the Claymores and defeats opponents at near impossible odds. I can't really tell myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art was pretty good, but it just looked rather wonky, especially with how the Claymores were drawn. Everything else looked great, the blood and gore, the humans, the demons, and even Rocky looked good, but the Claymores just looked so weird, it just didn't sit right with me.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound were pretty good, except the soundtrack wasn't that great. Some of the sounds made were well done, but many of the songs used were appropriately inappropriate. Basically, they tingled my spine in the wrong way and they didn't sit right with me.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, now I can talk about the characters. My word, the only decent character was Claire. All the other Claymores and Rocky were just simply horrible. Rocky was simply annoying as hell, and the other Claymores were just playing their part, but that was about it. Need I say more? If I did, then I could give you a long list of mostly Rocky being one of the worst characters I have seen in anime. Even the kid Characters in Berserk could hold their own and not be annoying. Rocky was one of those characters that was only useful to Claire at times, but that was about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Claymore was an enjoyable anime, but it fell WAY short on characters, and everything else was good overall. (6/10)",

            "content": "First of all, I'm not a huge fan of this genre of anime.  It troubles me when the entire series can be seen as a progression of power.  Much like in the Dragonball series, Z, GT and such, the villains can only get so powerful, and the main hero can only grow in strength so much.  Now, if all you want to see is some pretty cool sword combat, lots of blood and dismemberment, even bodies being cut to little tiny pieces, then you've come to the right place.  But don't come expecting some phenomenal story-line either.  Essentially, what youget is a typical tale of revenge - \"you took something from me, so I'm taking your life\" kind of response.  Now while this isn't such a bad thing, it depends entirely upon the presentation.  What makes Claymore a respectable entry into this genre is in the characters and the art.  Somehow, with over 47 different Claymores, each one has their own unique personality and appearance.  Each villain is also given a unique and interesting personality that makes each encounter fresh, exciting and tense.  The art, as well, is something unique to this anime.  I don't believe I've seen another series that has quite this level of animation.  It's hard to describe fully so that you can understand what I'm talking about.  But if you watch the first episode, you'll get a feel for what the rest of the anime will look like.\\n\r\nOne other issue I had, was a \"flashback\" that happened in a series of quite a few episodes in the middle.  There's no clear reason or indication that this is a flashback.  I sat there and wondered for the longest time \"What happened to Clare (the main character) and who's this Teresa lady?\"  It isn't until the end of the flashback session that you realize that is has been a flashback.  I feel that could have been done better, but, even then, the characters presented there (in just a few episodes) become likeable and enjoyable to watch.    \\n\\n\r\nBe prepared for a lot of action, a lot of tense \"what's going to happen next\" moments, and several incredulous \"over-the-top\" scenes with limb regeneration/reattachment and the likes.  \\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed the anime and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good, bloody action series.",

            "content": "Remember the time when Claymore sucked ? Neither do i ! This is easiest one of my favorite series of all time.\r\nIn a medieval world, there are monsters called Yoma, they love to eat human flesh and they often disguise themselfs with human form... it is not rare a yoma disguising as one of their eaten victims, eating their brain to gain their memories the disguise becomes even perfect.\r\nImagine the terror one would have to live in a world like this...constantly haunted by demons.\r\nBut don't panic ! There is hope and they are here to help us ! (or they are just following orders inexchange of money ? )\\n\\n\r\nYes ! Claymores ! It is the name given to a female warrior whose have made a pact of blood with the yoma, thus gaining some of their ability to regenerate their body (defensive type) or increase speed and attack power (offensive type). They can sense if a human is a disguised yoma or not. They are controlled by an organization which aims to protect humans from yomas.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, claymores are not the heroes for justice or human salvation in any form, most of them are dragged by their own sentiments of hatred/suffering/revenge.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a great action show, with consistent fights and terror. Why did i mention terror ? because unlike other action/fighting animes like dragon ball z where people often gets their ass beaten by big explosions and their body parts don't fall apart, in claymore a misjudged moves would rather result in a loss of an arm, a head or in a fatal wound. So the entire show you are immersed in this atmosfere, with terrific fights meaning the characters could die at any time and often severely wounded.\\n\\n\r\nAs the plot develops, you start to get the \"BIGNESS\" of their world, and you realize that the most powerfull enemies are light-years away from the claymores, leaving a feeling of impotence and weakness, increasing the tension and the terror they must face.\\n\\n\r\nBut most people criticize the end of the series, stating they didn't follow the manga and etc... but for me was more than perfect, as the internal conflits around the protagonist comes to a closure and raki, the most useless and pathetic (fighting?) character of the entire anime history, would not later become a baddass fighter as in the manga, preventing an inconsistent powerup which would drop the series rating.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore is a violent, terrific, full of terror, baddas action anime series of all time, it is only better than Berserk because they didn't animate the black swordsman/conviction arcs onward which Berserk's history starts to get similar.",

            "content": "This review may contain some mild spoilers so read at your own risk. Although this review is concerned with the anime, i will be referring to the manga as well. I have written a review of the complete series as well i.e the manga, so be sure to check that out as well.\r\nAlright, Claymore is a dark-fantasy anime with a lot of violence,bloodshed and gore. Although it is tagged as a shonen series, it has all the traits needed for a seinen anime.The anime has a lot of depth in the story, characters are well developed,fight scenes are well balanced and pacing of the storyis perfect.If you want to watch a show with a serious tone, with absolute zero comedy and no fan service  this one's for you.The one thing which i truly loved about claymore is that the characters are not over sexualised.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nThe story of claymore is fairly simple and direct which is not a bad thing as many anime falter by complicating the story.The story gets more intense in the manga after war in the northern arc but retains its general flow. The first four episodes are pretty decent nothing that impressive but quickly picks up after episode 5 when teresa is introduced. This anime instantly became my favorite after episode 5, so be sure to watch at least first 6 episodes before saying that this anime is trash. The only problem is with the last 3 episodes as they are non canon and are just plain garbage so you can avoid them.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nThe art style is beautiful, don't know why some people think it is ugly as it perfectly suits a dark anime.Considering that the manga had pretty decent art style for the first few volumes, madhouse did extremely well in adapting it.The only problem i had was with the character designs as the characters looked sometimes pale and less polished.Nonetheless it's not bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nAll the OST of claymore are simply epic. They all have that eerie feeling which perfectly blends with atmosphere of the anime. The opening is pretty good but the ending song is a masterpiece,seriously one of the best ED i have seen so far.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters of claymore are all well developed and all are very likable.The protagonist, Clare is a very compelling character and not to forget she is a total badass.Clare is generally cold by her outer appearance but in fact she is very caring which can be seen after she met raki. She has always been mentally broken ever since the death of someone important to her as she always held herself responsible for the outcome. Then there is Teresa who is by far the best character of the series and also my personal favorite.She is very cool minded and extremely powerful in fact she is the strongest claymore of all. Teresa is the soul of the story as it can be inferred from the manga where she plays key role in the ending of the series. Now  raki gets a lot of hate which i understand, but seriously some people drop this show just because how annoying raki is ,which is seriously lame. He is more like a bystander so you can ignore him.He is fully developed by the end of the manga but unfortunately in the anime he hardly gets any characterization.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nClaymore is very enjoyable for those who want to watch a serious show with action packed sequences and a great story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\nThe only thing which truly stopped claymore from becoming an amazing anime was the massive cliffhanger ending.The final 3 episodes clearly messed the show as there is almost no resolution to the main plot. The anime caught up to the manga and so we got an alternate ending which failed miserably and this series never recovered from that. I see everyone rating it 6 or 7 and find it to be unfair cause clearly the show is incomplete and for the time being ending was pretty average as at least Teresa's wish came true in the end. Why this show never got a sequel is beyond me but i still have faith it will adapt the manga completely one day.I highly recommend you watch this anime and then read the manga from the start as you would be able to know the complete story and it is definitely worth your time, cause the manga has an epic ending ;)\\n\\n",

            "content": "I don't know what to say, except for the fact that I can't believe that I didn't discover this anime earlier. This is not only a great anime, but its also got to be one of the darkest that I've ever seen. However; despite it being real dark, they actually kept it at the right balance with the light elements in it as well. \r\nThe story deals around a group of female warriors known as Claymore's who are half-breeds; half-human and half-yoma, a demonic like creature that can not only shape shift into humans but feast on human flesh. This was the first action adventureanime that I'd seen where all the warriors were pretty much all female. Well, actually they were all female. It's not that often you see something like that and it really worked here. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just great in both light and dark elements. The design of both; the Claymore's and Yoma are very well done. I feel that there could had been a little more color to the Claymore's maybe but this is about a group of half-breeds who carry the blood of a demon in them so yeah you can understand why they went the way they did. Even the designs of some of the awaken beings were very well done. The action was also fast passed and worked towards its advantage. I also liked that each Claymore had their own symbol to keep identify them. I found that very interesting that they had their own unique form of identity. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was just awesome, especially; the theme songs. The opening theme is good and does leave a great impact, but my god the ending theme though, I can't get it out of my head it's just that damn good it's called; Danzai No Hana and it really leaves a big impact on ya. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just thenomonal. You have Clair who the story mainly ventures around with and travels with a boy named Rocky after saving him from a Yoma, and as good as a character Clair is I have to admit that she is not my favorite character. No, despite her only being in like 4 episodes, my favorite character would have to be Teresea. It's another way of saying of not giving credit where credit is due because even though she wasn't in that many episodes she clearly developed very well and changed quickly. However; we also find out that there is a big plot twist in all of this to which I will not spoil though I'll admit that it caught me off guard. \\n\\n\r\nOverall; I really enjoyed this anime and am still ashamed that I didn't find it sooner. Truth be told, there's really only one thing that's holding it back and that's the fact that there is only 26 episodes and yet the manga is not only continuing to expand today but has like over 100+ chapters. So, I don't know for sure what happened but would have loved to have seen more. Despite though of it only being 26 chapters long, I like what we got. It's great, it's dark, and it has a ton of action to it.",

            "content": "The Claymore are an organisation of female half human half monster warriors that protect humans from monsters called Yoma. In the beginning we are shown a town where a monster had been killing people and they had to call for a Claymore. When she comes to town everyone is afraid of her but a boy named Raki who becomes the target of the monster, but is saved by the Claymore Clare. After she leaves he is exiled because of his exposure to the monster. Outside the city walls he almost dies but is saved by Clare, who at first wants him to leave but laterallows him to join her on her travels. And so their adventure together begins.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the story, while interesting it was not especially memorable as two weeks after finishing watching I already had trouble remembering the details. The first few episodes are extremely well done with great pacing and character development but then start the unreasonably long fights that can last for entire episodes and while decently animated and choreographed just start to drag. After watching the series I was interested how the manga was and I have to say that it was better in this aspect. Up until now I have been only complaining but I have to say that the story was otherwise really interesting and the ending was pretty well done considering the final few episodes are anime original but they do not allow for another season, at least one that follows the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are both really well fleshed out and explored in the show especially Clare who has two or three episodes dedicated only to her back story. The character development is also extremely well done and there is hardly an episode where nothing happens that would influence either Raki or Clare. The show has plenty of other characters and they are also interesting, the only problem being in the number of Claymore and their familiar appearances, because of that it is quite hard to know who is who. I had a few problems with the villains because we never get to know truly why they are doing what they are doing. Also the power levels of the characters are a bit inconsistent especially Clare.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and animation is decent but I personally did not like the art style. The monsters rarely seem terrifying and the people look boring. I find there is a lot o variance in the look of the Claymores which at times look beautiful but otherwise look just strange. The fight scenes are very well done but for the length of some of those and I especially like the delayed blood flow effects. Here I have to say that there is a lot of blood in this anime so if you have problems with that this might not be the anime for you. The sound is nothing special but it always complements the happening onscreen well enough. The opening and ending are both good enough to be worth a listen but after twenty or so episodes it gets a little annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Claymore is a decent anime worthy of a high 7 and it could have gotten an even higher score if not for the art and the exaggerated length of the fights. After you finish watching this I highly recommend the reading of the manga because there a lot of the lose ends are explained. You can start from the beginning or continue at around chapter 50. Anyways  I am new to reviewing and am always looking for feedback so fell free to leave a comment or check out my other reviews.",

I think this show might be sexist because they all look like butch lesbians who can activate their special period power. Its just not that good of a show and in all true you should really just watch Bleach because it has way better looking characters and story. Let me tell you something about this sickening show.\r\nThe Story is mostly just a bunch of monsters eating people and some people who are half monster who fight them. They try to make girls empowerment statement but it fails since the male monster is better. Iwas shocked but that is all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is absolutely bad like I said all characters look the same but action sequences are good. The monsters are really scary but most of the time it's just blood and angry girls which is kind is funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound is bad because they have the same music for everything and is very repeating. The sound effects are too.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are cool looking but they look the same. Nothing really happens to most of them and they dont do stuff much. Most just fight and do nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall is that you should just watch bleach and not give in to this femenisim.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Claymore is not a groundbreaking series. While it's great fun to watch, it does not feel like it's doing anything particularly new. The story is fairly standard, but does the job, excluding the inconclusive and, frankly, disappointing ending, the art style takes some getting used to (before I got used to it, I found that faces looked very odd, but the backgrounds and the Claymores were always excellent), the characters are fairly shallow and, in Raki's case, very annoying in parts (he just won't stop whining and blubbing - even if you don't mind him at first, you'll see what I mean later on).\r\nDespite this,Claymore is well worth a watch. It is certainly one of the more compelling anime I have watched, and I got through it in three days (this pace of watching is very rare for me). It never drags, with the possible exception of the three epiosdes or so that flesh out Clare's backstory, and this only slightly drags because I always find flashback sequences a tad boring - this was about as good as they come, and it's nice to see a few episodes devoted to fleshing out the characters, instead of the usual token episode per character.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore's animation is variable. While it sometimes seems jerky (I found that after a few episodes I no longer noticed this), the fights feel very lovingly done, with nice animation. The series avoids excessive repetition of animations, and it happens a lot less than it normally does in anime of this type, especially the classic head-on view of multiple, identical, repeated swordstrokes and constant parrying. Not saying it doesn't happen, just it doesn't happen nearly as often as it does in other sword-heavy anime. Towards the end, the flashbacks of scenes from earlier episodes begins to grate.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese voice acting neither stood out for nor disappointed me. It does the job. Where Claymore's sound really excels is in its moments of rousing orchestral score. Had it had a bit more variation and slightly better voice acting, I would have given Claymore a 10 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my major gripes, before which I was considering giving Claymore a 9, was the ending. Not only was it inconclusive, but the final fight couldn't hold a candle to the penultimate one. It's hard to describe without spoiling anything, so suffice to say it felt rather formulaic and dull. The ending left me wondering whether there was a second series, of which there is currently no sign.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like this sort of series, you should definitely have a look at Claymore, as its faults do not stop it from being a highly enjoyable watch.",

            "content": "Claymore is a fantastic anime that's most definitely worth the watch if you're interested in a fairly good story with some really interesting characters and awesome action scenes, its an anime that in my opinion is very underrated and not talked about and i wish it had more exposure.\r\nThe story of Claymore is for the most part very good and very consistent well until the ending that is, but i wouldn't let that put you off as the anime is still worth the watch despite the ending seeming a bit anti climactic. The reason for the ending maybe seeming like a little bit of alet down is because the manga at the time hadn't advanced to a point where the anime could adapt the story and so an ending effectively had to be made up and put together without the manga. The basic introduction to the plot is that there are evil creatures called yoma roaming and stalking humans as pray and when a village or town becomes pray to a yoma they call the Claymore organization to eradicate the problem, That's a very basic outline to the plot it does get more depth with both the characters and plot.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the action in Claymore, its probably one of the strongest factors in the anime. The unique draw to the combat scenes in Claymore is the fact that while in combat you cannot exceed your power limit, these Claymore warriors are essentially half yoma half human. If they were to exceed their power limit they themselves would become a yoma and completely transform. this adds a very interesting twist and layer of depth to the action scenes in Claymore allowing for each combat scenario to have much more tension with the Claymore warriors having to effectively hold back on using their maximum strength or risk becoming a yoma themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Claymore are also very good it introduces a fair amount of characters and all of them are fairly unique with their own strengths and weaknesses, Claire and Raki are the two main protagonists and while i really enjoy Claire's character Raki kinda does get on my nerves a bit and that seems to be a common complaint with a lot of people who have watched Claymore. But there are more than enough awesome characters like Teresa for example that make up for that.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all i think Claymore is a fantastic anime that is most definitely worth your time, with fantastic action scenes, awesome characters and a decent story its really a must see if you're a fan of this genre of anime.",

            "content": "Set in a medieval environment, Claymore takes an interesting take on the girls with guns genre swapping the guns with a broadsword (or Claymore). \r\nStarting off, the first few episodes set the foundations of who the Claymore are, and how they are tasked to battle the the Yoma (demons that have crossed into this world whom have a taste for human flesh - guts especially!). Although a tad boring but a necessary set up, the series really doesnt become addictive until episode 4 when we see the backstory of the lead character Clare and the entrance of fan fave Teresa (I love her!).\r\nAlthough action heavy,as the series progresses the question of &quot;what does it mean to be human&quot; does come into play, as does the concept of fighting for people who fear/dislike you. Clare is a likeable lead, with striking beauty and you can feel the emotions she goes through. Which was a difficult feat to represent given that the Claymore are emotionless killers. Some of the higher level Yoma have interesting designs and you can sense the fear in the characters when they are in battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are just as fascinating to watch if not more due to their differing personalities, and if this is show doesnt inspire the ladies for a new hairstyle i dont know what will! ;) This was in my opinion one of the series' strengths, the development and focus on the supporting characters. The sense of camaraderie between the Claymore is apparent and their actions are worth your attention. Also it is refreshing to see the Claymore as intelligent, tough, skilled female warriors without the ecchi factor thrown in which would've made the series a joke. The last 6 episodes do have an epic feeling to them which makes you want to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is not perfect however. Some of action sequences become generic and slightly boring. I also felt that the fights couldve been a bit more &quot;cooler&quot; for a better choice of words. There is also a tendancy that in a middle of a battle, a long speech or story is given that does ruin the pace, and couldve been handled better - i think this is where the manga is superior and somehow works better when reading. The supporting character of Raki is so annoying and nearly ruined the whole series for me. He is important in Clares development however, but did he really have to be such a whiny, annoying t*t??!! The conclusion to the series was a bit of a let down and didnt make much sense, however the ride getting there was worth the investment, if anything a good introduction to the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and closing themes will grow on you, and the soundtrack - although the guitar riffs sound okay, i think this series wouldve been suited to a more natural orchestral sound track given the lush environments and medieval settings. The rock just didnt seem right, but nothing too distracting to the overall enjoyment, and that what this series is, entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nAn overall 8/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The world of Claymore is a harsh and brutal one, and that's exactly what got me hooked on the series in the first place.\r\nThe story should appeal to every fan of Witcher series (and, in general, all series that involve hunting monsters) - a lonely, well-trained and mutated warrior travels around the world, fighting demonic Yoma. It gets even more interesting when we get to know more about protagonist's past and how it influences her current actions. What's more, the nature of Claymore's power forces her to constantly limit herself and not let the monster inside take over. The border between a huntress and herprey is very thin, and she has to stay vigilant all the time in order not to cross it.\\n\r\nThe plot and Claire's inner fight kept me thrilled for the first half of the series, but then it started being monotonous. The same can be said about the characters; captivating at first, but quickly boring due to lack of development. Unfortunately, somewhere around the middle of the series the plot stops advancing and Claymore becomes a marathon of power-ups and endless fighting.\\n\\n\r\n'What would you expect from shounen anime?' you may ask. I'm completely fine with fight scenes, but only if they are well animated and exciting. At first, I really liked how brutal and gross the battles were, but once the characters got more powerful, the fights turned into ridiculous (yet boring) fiesta of cut off limbs and streams of blood. The animators failed to show rapid attacks and movement in a proper way - continuous slashes often look hilarious when it's only character's hands that move, making her look like a human blender.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I really loved the fact that every victory comes at a price and requires cooperation. Death in battle is common and atrocious - in Claymore, one doesn't die in a beautiful way, but rather is shredded to pieces. What I also liked are the unique powers of each Claymore. They are quite original and you can easily see that mastering them takes a lot of effort and pushes the warrior to her limits.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I found the most exciting is the setting itself. The Claymore universe is covered in shroud of mystery - we know nothing about the Organization, the history of this world, the nature of Yoma etc. It is a cruel world, where people live in remote villages surrounded by dark forests, deadly deserts and frigid snowplains, under constant menace of Yoma, beings of pure evil, depraved to the core. The surroundings give you unsettling, horrifying vibes, and thanks to all that, Claymore may sometimes even resemble a horror story. Think of the atmosphere in Dark Souls games and you'll get the general feeling of Claymore universe.\\n\r\nAnother huge advantage is the audiovisual side of the anime. It mainly makes use of shades of grey and white, strongly contrasting with bloody red and pitch-black (Sin City instantly comes to mind), creating gloom, mysterious and somewhat melancholic mood. The music is unconventional, but subtle and nicely complements the art.\\n\\n\r\nI had mixed feelings and really hard time rating Claymore. It's biggest problem is that it doesn't live up to expectations that it creates in the first half of the series and the viewer can quickly get bored during the second. However, in spite of all the cons I've listed above, I really enjoyed watching it, even though I'm not really shounen type. If you're into dark, gothic fantasy spiced up with some gore and you don't mind mediocre characters - you should definitely give it a try. And if you liked any of the Dark Souls games, it's a must-see.",

            "content": "Story: 10\r\nClaymore seems to be something new for me. The reason is because It's not like the other Shounen animes, but the plot Itself is so unusual, and It's so unique and so well-made it's unlikely any anime like this or even close will be remade. \r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art/design in the anime seems kinda unusual for the first time, honestly It seemed ugly in the first two episodes. Watching the 3rd episode, I got used to It, and in the middle of It I really liked It. The characters are detailed, and It's the same about the environment. With one word again: \"unique\".\r\nSound: 9\r\nI don'thave a lot of ideas about It, but I liked the opening and the ending song, and the battle's fighting sound also fit everything. The character's voices were also well chosen, the only thing I found annoying is Raki's voice, but I got used to this one too after a few episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters behaviour was awesome at every situation. Rolling from the past back to the present told you almost everything that you had to know about them. You will love all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI guess I don't have to tell that I loved watching this, It didn't take me a day to finish this. I just couldn't stop with this. Seeing that this was released in 2007, I'm still interested in a second season since the manga finished in 2014. I just  would love to see that. (Guess I can read the manga for now) \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIf you watch this you won't regret It. You will just love It. It's a great anime, and as I said above It's similar in the base of the usual \"Shounen\" animes, but It's more than those, because It's more unique.",

            "content": "===============STORY: 9===============\r\nClaymore is a very well thought out story that is presented in an effective way. Although the plot has exceptional moments, what makes Claymore so compelling is its dark setting and masterful use of reveals and plot twists. \r\nTaking place during a medieval era, the world of Claymore is full of mystery, horror, and evil. Its this strange setting that keeps viewers watching, even after establishing the basic Claymore vs Yoma premise. Viewers want to know more about this world: What are Yoma? How are Claymores created? What is on Claymores' bodies that is so disgusting? What is the Organization? Its questions like thesethat stem from the setting of the story and entice viewers to continue watching. \\n\r\nThe use of reveals (discovery of a previously unknown key element of plot or setting) and plot twists are what makes Claymore's story so addicting. Because Claymore is a dark and mysterious world, it provides many opportunities for secrets to be revealed and the unexpected to occur. Furthermore, none of these reveals or twists feel forced; all of the story's many surprises flowed within the narrative and made sense within Claymore's fictional world.\\n\r\nThe plot, for the most part, is in typical shounen fashion. Claymores are sent to hunt monsters called Yoma. The main character, Clare, has an ultimate villain that she must destroy. She trains to get enough power to accomplish her task, and etcetera. However, Claymore contains many seinen aspects as well. There is a lot of blood and gore. The series is not afraid to kill off main characters, some in shocking fashion, and severed limbs are common. Furthermore the series contains hints of rape, abuse, and discrimination.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, during the later half of Claymore, the story slightly regressed back to its shounen nature. While it was still very entertaining, the story focused more on the battles rather than the mysterious world itself. Another issue is the lack of a concrete ending. Because the anime was produced faster than manga, its ending defers greatly from the manga and is very open-ended. Nonetheless, the story is excellent and easily the best aspect of Claymore.\\n\\n\r\n===========ART/ANIMATION: 9===========\\n\r\nFor a series made in 2007, Claymore's animation is top class. The fighting scenes are usually fluid and rarely is motion jagged. During battles, capes and hair can be seen fluttering to emphasize motion. Furthermore the variety and creativity in the fighting styles of each claymore is well animated. From Miria's phantom step, Irene's flash sword, Ophelia's rippling sword, to Galatea's yoki control, each power is smooth and looks amazing. \\n\r\nThe art is excellent, not because everything looks pretty and beautiful, but because often characters look strange and flawed. This style actually fits perfectly with the dark and mysterious atmosphere of the story. Finally, I would like to add that Claymores have the sickest eyes I have ever seen in anime. During close-ups you can even see the silver or gold fibres in these eyes.\\n\\n\r\n===============SOUND: 8===============\\n\r\nClaymore doesn't boast a very diverse musical repertoire, often relying on mysterious instrumentals throughout the series. However, although the music is limited, Claymore has an amazing OP and ED that truly reflected the medieval and dark mood of Claymore.\\n\\n\r\n==============CHARACTER: 7==============\\n\r\nThe characters are the weakest aspect of Claymore. For a show featuring a cast of femme fatales you would expect a lot of the characters to be deep and well developed. Well most aren't. Unfortunately there is very little character development apart from Clare and if a character does get some development it is miniscule. This is especially disappointing considering each character is unique and interesting, yet we never learn enough about their pasts, their goals, how they became claymores, and other aspects of their lives like family and friends. Another issue is that the characters are very \"robotic\" as they seem to live for the sole purpose of killing yoma and they do not interact with others unless its related to their jobs. As a result most Claymores are cold, calm, and show no form of emotion other than anger, surprise, or pain. This makes it extremely difficult for viewers to relate to these characters. For example, although Clare gets a fair share of development, its extremely hard to relate to her as she seems almost robotic in emotion. I dont recall ever seeing her smile. Nonetheless, what I do enjoy about the characters is their uniqueness. Each Claymore is unique in appearance and ability, and this is the sole factor that makes the characters interesting. This sense of uniqueness is emphasized by the symbols that each warrior is assigned. \\n\r\nFinally, I should mention that if you absolutely cannot stand useless and idiotic characters then avoid watching Claymore. Raki is the most frustrating character in anime I have ever seen. \\n\\n\r\n==============ENJOYMENT: 10==============\\n\r\nBeing more of a story driven person, I found this series to be extremely enjoyable. Once I picked up Claymore I just could not stop watching (I finished the series in 2 days). Not only were the fight scenes really enjoyable, but I also found myself so engrossed in the mysterious universe of Claymore. I watched to learn more about this intriguing world and its characters. The skillful use of reveals and plot twists kept me at the edge of my seat and always wondering what was going to happen next. I was addicted. \\n\\n\r\n===============OVERALL: 9===============\\n\r\nThe series had the potential to be a 10. It really did. However, the lack of character development outside of Clare was very disappointing, especially since there was so much potential for development. Nonetheless, Claymore, presents a very intriguing and addicting world that will definitely leave viewers thirsty for answers. The action is sick, the blood is plenty, and when you have a cast of femme fatales whats not to like? \\n\r\nOverall, if you are an action fan, or if you value a story-driven plot that uses reveals and plot twists to keep you at the edge of your seat then watch Claymore. Fans of Attack on Titan should end up liking Claymore as both series have extremely similar stories and both series rely on the same plot devices to move the story forward. \\n\r\nFinally if you do end up liking the anime and want more closure I highly recommend you read the manga. More of the anime's mysteries will be explained.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback is welcome.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Potential Spoilers:\r\nAfter finishing Stein;s Gate, Berserk, and Fate/Zero, I thought that it was time to begin watching Claymore. It did not disappoint compared to the other three series. I'm a fan of Berserk, as well as Shingeki No Kyojin, so watching a show similar to their types of style and genre was a good appetite. \r\nThe story starts with a boy who lost his family from demonic predators called Yoma, as they feast on humans and are able to blend in with humans with their type of appearance manipulation. To face against such demons, an organization created a hybrid of female humans and Yoma warriorsknown as the Claymore, which brings us to our main protagonist, Clare. Claymores are detested by society for the fact that they still hold Yoma flesh in their veins, and as Raki, the young boy, realizes that Clare shows similar qualities with himself, they bond. Now, Clare's determined to protect Raki, as well as holding a strong ambition to defeat the main antagonist that terrorized the days of her youth. \\n\\n\r\nNow, this is a special story. I cannot compare this to SnK as it was made afterwards, and Berserk is kind of different in regards to its plot as well. So in terms of story in the shounen/18+ mix, Claymore excels.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art, the character designs are kind of repetitive as almost every Claymore have silver/blonde/white tinted hair, silver eyes, etc. The thing is though, that is their character. My rating of art, however, comes from the design of the Awakened Beings and the Yoma themselves. The kaiju have unique designs, symbolic, or religious. The aesthetic deigns almost remind me of Berserk as well, pardon me for comparing the two so much but both are fantastic fantasy series. However, to argue against my rating for the art, the animation is sometimes lackluster as characters lack faces as the scenes zoom out, although it might also be the quality of the episodes (i'm not watching this in 720p). The demons actually look like demons though, and sometimes do appear quite frightening. Horns, spikes, wings, the demonic designs in Claymore are unique. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is mediocre from what i've heard so far. The soundtrack is nice and all but sometimes the voice acting suddenly downgrades in quality mid sentence, although again this might be from the source that I watched this from and might not be from the creators of the anime themselves. Although, I won't really put sound as something in the overall grade in the first place, so this doesn't weigh as much as the others, if not at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are kind of a weak point here, as a lot of the Claymores you see in the series die. Although, Clare, Raki, Priscilla, and Teresa are each the better characters of the series. Clare especially, as you see her suffer through the death of her comrades countlessly just like Guts from Berserk, or Eren from SnK to compare the suffering each characters have lost in their own respective series. Clare is one of the better female protagonists in all of Shounen/Seinen, viewers and readers might see why as they read or watch the source material. Raki has appeared annoying at first for me, but he's generally the voice of reason or the \"pussy\" character, but at the same time you'll see that in his own way he grows semi-interesting, but depends on the person. Personally I still dislike him. In terms of Teresa and Priscilla, I will not spoil them for the reader of this review so go watch/read this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy Claymore a lot. Did I enjoy it as much as Berserk, however? No. Berserk still remains the pinnacle quintessential king of Seinen/Fantasy in manga history, although Claymore is definitely an amazing follow-up. is it better than Shingeki No Kyojin? In my humble opinion, I view Claymore as the better series, yes. However, this doesn't mean that SnK isn't a good series, it just means that some artists/studios are doing a better job handling the fantasy elements of their own respective shows. Claymore is a series never to forget in terms of fantasy shows/anime, however there are existing flaws and cliches that appear often, especially the ending, but most series have their own bits and stuff as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Claymore is a 7.8/10 series, however due to MAL's system of only using whole numbers, I shall round it up to an 8/10 that it deserves, instead of a 7.",

            "content": "What can I say about Claymore that everybody doesn't know already? Well for me one of the best (if not the best) animes I've ever seen. So if you haven't watched it do it now and you'll know what you have been missing out.\r\nNow let's start with this question: Why is this anime so good? Well the answer lies in a perfect balance between Story-Art-Sound-Characters. Seriously I cannot find any weak points in this anime so all I will be doing is praising this one, or not?. The story is set in an old medieval theme and goes  on in a very detailed butnot happy world. It has the same old concept: demons vs. demon slayers, ups I forgot to mention that this demon slayers are also half Demons (or in one particulary case a quarter demon), so all of this put together gather a really good story, but again I\u00b4ve seen better. Actually the story doesn't have the feeling to be (like in almost all the animes in this genre) Good vs. Evil, the story is fluid and you don't feel it slow or fast: it just goes on at the pace it should and it has it's twists, but not to many to worry about, very straight forward really.\\n\\n\r\nNow concerning the art-animation aspect, I have to say  it's a bit tricky. At first it's a little hard to get used to this type of animation. It's different from other animations, but it inspires a old, mistic, antique and specially dark theme, this is very important for an anime. Once you see it for a while you get used to it and deeply enjoy it. Other things to take notice of are the gore scenes: these are richly animated not letting anything out of it, definitely it contains one of the more satisfactory body-dismembering scenes I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nI think the sound is what I love more about this anime. The ending and opening themes, they are very good (Guilty Sky is in my list) almost perfect. The soundtracks are just my style, just mix a medieval theme for parcially calmed situations and a variety of extremely good rock-metal BGMs for the battle scenes and you have a perfect and amazing sound for every event that happens, that is what is all about, perfection.\\n\\n\r\nNow the other tricky part: Characters. Well I should have mentioned this in the art part but who cares, I will gladdly state it here: The females Claymores are all the same in looks. Yeah well a little bit of a change in the hairstyle and in the facial expressions but either way it feels really monotonous watching the same blonde looking characters fighting by or each other. But even so every single one has a special ability different from the other ones (at least the secondary and main characters do) and that added with each ones personality will make that, in time, one can differenciate one from another. Now the character development is as the story not fast not slow but beautifully done in a way that makes you have a more individual concept of each character.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end I truly enjoyed this anime. It was just right for me: Gory, bloody and full of action and supernatural occurences. So let me tell you this: I am writting this review in comparison with other animes I've seen, I hope this has been made clear so it doesn't bother you when you read the following statement: This anime is crap. A contradicction is it not? Well yeah is crap in comparison with the manga. Really if I compare this with the manga the story wouldn't get more than a 2 or 3 from me and the enjoyment issue it would be ranked at 1 and I would be still thinking I gave away too many points.  I watched the anime, I enjoyed it very much but then a friend told me that the manga was so much better so I started reading it until there was a moment I couldn't do it anymore and stopped. And my conclusion is this: Watch the anime first and then, if you must, read the manga, although I do not recomend it because you will hate the anime afterwards. Do not ever read the manga before watching this anime because when you get a little bit past half the episodes you will be dropping it, trust me...\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright guys, second review :D\r\nDespite the fact that i haven't seen many anime's Claymore is one of my favourite ones. It is also my favourite shounen type of anime.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThis anime's set-up and plot are fantastic, as well as its focus. It kinda feels like an adventure-travelling anime by the point you get to the half of it, so the space for character development is given to itself by default. \r\nThe anime has a quite serious feel to it, as it is almost completely focused on the development of our main character. \r\nThe sci-fi aspect on this anime is also well explained. The Claymore universeis easily understood due to this.\\n\r\nForget about comedy or harems, this anime is for a mature audience and if you find love or romance in it, it treats the topic in a pretty direct and open way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art style catches the medieval atmosphere in a pretty convincing fashion.\\n\r\nThe characters are well drawn, but they could have better expressions.\\n\r\nThe animation could have been better, specially in the battle scenes, which happen quite often. I know it might be a manga thing, but I'd like to see more detail of the fights instead of a representation of \"This character is moving her arm and oscilating her sword 90 cicles per second\". It feels rushed and they put little to no love in it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nOh my god, I loved the characters so much. They are pretty relatable (all things considered) and their development and progress is awesome. Specially our godly-powerful warriors, which give a strong message of discipline and humility: You always have to accept there's gonna be someone better than you at some point. Even our male \"lead\" learned that and decided to voluntarily become a better man and a person. \\n\r\nMake decisions, accept consequences and changes, and keep your ones by your side. It may sound clich\u00e9, but the way they execute this development in non-expressive mercenaries is priceless.\\n\r\nPay special attention to our main character's back story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI pretty much enjoyed all of this journey from begginning to end, and it constantly kept me saying \"WOW\" to myself. \\n\r\nHowever, the only problem I had with this, is the resolution of some things. There are many questions unanswered, and the fist that punches your face at the end, has writen on it: READ THE MANGA!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI deeply recommend this anime to anyone that loves shounen animes and wants a different experience when it comes to characters and progress.",

But after some time I had a change of heart, I come to realize it was just something I wasn't familiar with and this is exactly what the creator had in mind; a sort of Romanesque approach, it was nicely done. What won me over eere the plethora of action sequences that were produced with great detail. The gore in this particular anime had me mesmerized.. the amputation, decapitation, and the all around mutilation scenes were brilliantly done, I couldn't turn away from the screen for a second even if I wanted too. Thestoryline was bent on revenge from the jump, nothing too uncommon, it could've used a little tweaking in that department, needed more of an elaborate plot. If it were up to me the protagonist would have been Teresa and have the storyline revolve around her instead of Clair her protege,  it would have made for a better show since she was a bad ass and whatnot but her 15 minutes of fame were brief but sweet nonetheless. I would even say the flashback episodes of her story that was covered under 4 episodes were better than the entire anime itself but thats just.my opinion. One thing I didnt like was Clair's companinion, if you want to debate about who is the most useless character in an anime he would most likely be a nomineee. But all in all, this anime was nothing short of epic, the creatures and yoki powers were awesome!",

            "content": "Claymore is a kind of an enigma for writing a review. For many people I discovered it was mostly hit or miss. For me this show was a hit but the flaws are completely understandable. \r\nThe premise of the show centering on a woman named clair who is a claymore; a being that is half monster half human. She works for an organization bent on ridding the world of monsters for a price. \r\nI think the show had a few noticeable flaws like the main protagonist being Raki, a stray that Clair picked up on her travels, lacking development in his character. Additionally, all theclaymores that we are introduced too have a lack of distinction between them since the colors used in this show are few and the animators for whatever reason decided to make them all have grey-ish blond hair coupled with their already cold personalities. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show was extremely root-able and the backstories for all the characters were quite memorable to say the least. I was crying I was cheering and the ending (though leaving questions afterwards) made me feel mostly satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely entertaining if you can get past the fact that some claymores look a little robotic at some points. I give it the green light!\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\n In a world that is rife with deadly creatures called \"Yoma\", a young silver eyed woman, Clare, works on behalf of an organization that trains female warriors called Claymores, Half Human Half Yoma warriors with the ability to destroy these creatures to protect humans, while struggling to hold on to their own humanity.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is great, plenty of plot and plot twists, character development, background and good story in it, it also keeps on track and never loses it's thread and keeps really close to the original Manga storyline, though it isn't the most original plot line, the way it is done makesmore fresh and original than many others.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9//10\\n\r\nThe animation is great, Set in a medieval time most likely in European setting, the characters look good, the backgrounds were good, good detail and layout,  the fight animations were amazing very fluid motions, it didn't seem choppy or stiff as it can in other anime battle scenes. The character motions and movement seemed to flow very well in general.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nI liked the character's in this story, they were well done with good character art and development shown to grow a lot during the short season, change their attitudes towards others and develop friendships, We follow the main protagonist Clare and see her development most and her relationship towards her companion Raki a human boy. Varied looks and personality kept it fresh, the only major drawback, is the main cast is predominately seen in the main uniform all the way through, it can be a little boring, but considering the effect it has in the plot and story, i would overlook it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nthe sounds were great in the anime, excellent character voice's even the english dub wasn't so bad, general sound effects and battle sound effects, the music was pretty good too, and i liked the opening/ending themes in it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFor enjoyment i rate it at 10, the story was engaging and quite gripping and the fight scenes were a great watch, i could happily watch the season over again a couple of times, and not get bored of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall a great anime, definitely one for keeps, the animation, sound, characters, etc in this were great and well thought out, the story was gripping and it did the manga justice. My only major problem with this is the length of it, it's only 26 episodes , it's a bit of a shame and a waste of it's potential, if it was kept exactly (or really close enough) to the manga at the end, another season and at least an OAV or two could have been brought out of this, the last episode's ruined that though, completely diverged from the Manga and rounded off the anime so for that i couldn't give it a perfect 10 though i would have loved too, overall i rate it at 9.\\n\\n\r\nregardless of the end, it's definitely a great anime on it's own and certainly worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\ni recommend you read the manga as well, since it goes a lot deeper than the anime does.\\n",

Except for that is the anime a masterpiece. \r\nUsually the plot would be: a men dominating world, about the strong and the weak fighting against some monsters, with maybe 2-3 Exceptions.\r\n But this anime is different and unique within the idea of 47 female warriors who fight against nomas (monsters) who can look like humans. These women are very strong. But strengh also has their price. They are half nomas, so half monsters, and half female humans.......\r\nAdditionally the music, the characters, but also their dark describing over the world combines an outstandingset up for  a masterpiece-anime. \\n\r\nAs usual there is an unfortunatly but: The end is even if you dont have read the manga pretty strange, as are the connecting parts to it (how it came to it) \\n\r\nAlso, some emotional scenes feel weird or too much, as is the sudden growth of the Chlare's  (the main character) strengh.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all i would give it a 9,5.  , because i could watch some episodes everyday. \\n",

            "content": "I start spoiling after the \">\" jumps a few lines. I can't explain how bad this anime gets without spoiling.\r\nI would have given it a 9/10 at first. It was a very strong show that felt like The Witcher, Berserk and a bit of its own flavor, with extraordinary warriors and demons. The characters felt fresh and were likable and it was generally well-written. There's not really any goal set at first, Clare is a lone warrior that slay demons and the villagers pay a man from the organization she's working with. She meet a young man that makes her feel sorta human again. It'snot exactly a goal, but someone who lost her emotions and happiness to live is starting to get those back, her Raison d'etre (that's actually the name of the opening too!).\\n\\n\r\n A few episodes in, the anime switches to a an intriguing story about another Claymore named Teresa. Before you have the time to ask \"wait who's that and why should I care?\", you get to see some great episodes and a sad but touching story about Teresa's raison d'etre, before going back to Clare and Raki's journey. Unfortunately, your fun is almost over. It starts screwing up more and more around the time Clare and Raki split up. The show changes entirely. I do like how every Claymore has found their very own signature ability through enough fighting.\\n\\n\r\nExpect:\\n\r\n> power levels\\n\r\n> energy auras and people sensing power levels\\n\r\n> actually they aren't power levels, they are rank within the organization\\n\r\n> everyone take the power level seriously\\n\r\n> it is never explained how it is decided which one has which rank, it seems to be a loose estimation overall\\n\r\n> this continues even after it is established that rank doesn't necessarily equals power, swordsmanship, speed, abilities, etc.\\n\r\n> if your rank is too low, your colleagues will trash talk you because you're weak, even if the weakest Claymore is still a competent demon slayer\\n\r\n> awakenings were supposed to be the end for a Claymore and resisting it was serious business and was really hard to do but it suddenly gets really easy and make it lose its significance\\n\r\n> someone is about to awaken for multiple episodes but doesn't and even awakens more without awakening to get more power\\n\r\n> we don't fight youma anymore, we only fight awakened ones\\n\r\n> there are also creatures of the abyss, which are basically final bosses\\n\r\n> the organization stays mysterious until the end and we don't really learn anything about them, how they work, their goals and yes they are actually just called \"the organization\"\\n\r\n> it is never explained how you make a Claymore, they're part youma/demon, yes but... do they eat their flesh, is it hard, does it hurt, can they fail to become one, is there a training? You can also ingest the blood of another Claymore but it's very rarely done so how do the other Claymores became so?\\n\r\n> every battle lose any strategy or style to it, it turns everything into being super fast, super strong, super tough or whatever and it's really boring to watch because you can't follow what's going on and it doesn't make sense until one of them loses\\n\r\n> characters need more power and need to unleash more of their youma side and lose their humanity because they need power ups\\n\r\n> winning because of getting new power ups during fights\\n\r\n> characters get torn to pieces in an instant but other character gets some minor plot armor until the time is right for them to die so the scene can be sad or something, but lose its effectiveness because of the plot armor\\n\r\n> awakening is a point of no return where you truly become a monster but sure you can transform back to human and become innocent, which defeat the weight of awakening\\n\r\n> \"they were holding back?!\"\\n\r\n> \"I underestimated them!\"\\n\r\n> \"Impossible!\"\\n\r\n> \"Don't even try, they're much stronger than you\"\\n\r\n> \"I NEED MORE POWER!\"\\n\r\n> \"MORE POWER\"\\n\r\n> and more generic shonen dialogues\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n> villains don't die and run away so if the entire point was to focus on hardcore tryhard battles about power and killing... doesn't that make all those battles meaningless?\\n\r\n> oh right, we can just throw in \"violence is wrong, being human is nice\" at the end, everyone happy\\n\r\n> but everyone is planning to become stronger for more violence\\n\r\n> the organization is shady sure but now they're evil, who gives a f about fighting demons that kill humans? Let's fight the shady people that makes claymores to help humanity! Surely they are worse than demons that eat people right for fun right?\\n\r\n> you are half human half monsters and you must embrace being human become your monster side is bad, but creatures that are entirely monsters are good too I guess, they just eat people sometimes, nothing wrong with that\\n\r\n> wait but if the claymores rebel against the organization, what is the organization going to do, since their way of solving problems is sending claymores\\n\r\n> yeah great closure there, unless the organization has super powers that surpasses the claymores for some reason, unless there's some plot twist and they're actually awakened ones or something else entirely",

The story is great, character design is great, and it's just awesome. My only wish is that the last few episodes stayed true to the manga. It's apparent they rushed it to kill off the series, even if you haven't read the books. Other than that, it's just a badass show with badass chicks doing badass things. Raki can seem like a whiny bitch, (and he is), but he's actually a good character later!\r\nIf you like blood, andnice art, or even anime in general, try this.

            "content": "Okay Lion Tamers, it's time to begin again, with a new review; of Claymore.\r\nI saw an advertisement for this anime, and became intrigued. Finding it streaming, I caught a few episodes; and finally downloaded all of them for viewing the entire series.\r\nFirstly, I want to talk about some of the characters.\r\n1). Raki is a pain in the behind, with little plot value, and adds nothing to the story. A total wimp, who faces everything like a participant in a Beauty Contest \"... I want World Peace ...\". He will never understand that his world's game of life is rigged, and that Clare cannot escape fromthe rules of the game, if she never tries to alter the views of the game-masters.\\n\\n\r\n2). Clare is passable as a character, but is far too dependant on her past, to face the future.\\n\\n\r\n3). Muria is totally focussed on the future (and rightly so), but is never expanded upon in the story line properly.\\n\\n\r\nNext I want to talk about the music.\\n\r\nWhile some of the between scene music is passable, much of it is inappropriate or just plain lousy. The opening and closing music is downright terrible; so poor is it that I often found myself almost quiting the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the final critique (and here's where I'm completely innovative), the entire series anime and manga are a spectacularly better looking version of \"DragonBall Z\". Comments like \"... I Need More Power ...\" and \"... I'm Going To Kill You ...\" are everywhere, and are a dead-ringer for plot points for DragonBall-Z et al.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the review commentary.\\n\r\nThe worst part of this show, should have  been the basic direction of the story. The \"Organization\" (for those who have seen this show) should have been the main focus. They're crooks, manipulative, and outright corrupt. If I had to make a judgement, I'd have to say that the entire story wrongly misses that the Organization formed the Yoma (evil monsters) so that they could also produce the solution Claymores (the saviors) in order to financially (and politically) fleece the general public. If that is true, and I think it is, then the authors of the Manga and the anime, have created a felonious assault on the viewer's belief system; because they have left all of us, with nothing but never-ending combat; while promising something more, grander and better. Never to be delivered.\\n\\n\r\nThis story will never get any better. While Claymore is dark, moody, and atmospheric (which I like); it might as well have been written in the the comic style of a TV sitcom for all its story line strength.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't like writing negative reviews, but it is necessary in this case. Claymore is a huge disappointment. I give it a five (5); only because the artwork and character development is fairly good. The story is never going to fulfill its promise.",

Let me first say that, Claymore's plot doesn't bear anything too innovative: An Organization with halfhuman, half monster women are hired to get rid of monsters called Yoma who feasts on humans' entrails. These women are given the name Claymores - pretty much named after the greatswords they lug around. Each of them have their own respective emblems and ranks which signify how much experience they have exterminating Yoma. What's Clare's rank in the Organization? I'm not telling! However, if you know the video game Hitman, then you may had already guessed it. Each of the Claymores inherits one or more superhuman abilities giving them feats such as regeneration and/or lightning-fast movement capabilities. Lastly, talking about designs, Yoma don't have the most unique monster designs I've seen, as a matter of fact most of them closely resemble ghouls if not, gargoyles. \\n\\n\r\nI recall reading one chapter of Claymore in a Shounen Jump Magazine, back in 2006? I don't remember the exact details. As I began watching, I only started with the first couple of episodes. My initial thoughts? It's not too bad. Granting, I believe that I wasn't going to enjoy the show very much. Then slowly, I began watching even more, up to 7 or 8 episodes a day. It was definitely getting more better. Before I knew it, I already reached the finale. Claymore clearly went above my expectations - it's pretty solid. About halfway in the series, the pacing accelerates thus the overall storyline becomes even more engaging. Claymore's premise doesn't bring anything far too unique to the table, yet it's the execution, pacing and storytelling which is very nicely done. 26 episodes for a shounen seems more than enough, but there are times where I don't mind having more. I felt a little bit disappointed with the ending though. It doesn't feel entirely \"accomplished\".\\n\\n\r\nDismemberment is very common in Claymore. Obviously, the main attraction of typical shounen anime is its action. From my personal view, Claymore doesn't provide the best action entertainment out there, and to be frank, I found even more spectacular and intense action scenes coming from passable anime such as Eiyuu Densetsu - Sora no Kiseki: an anime OVA with poor introduction and storytelling but makes up for its excellent action scenes. In summary, Claymore's action: it does the job, but not close to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nClare is a solid female protagonist; her past holds several nice twists and is pretty interesting stuff. She also shows good development throughout the anime. While many Claymores are introduced later in the series, but Clare and Teresa are the two most interesting ones. Speaking of Teresa, her actions practically reminded me of Accelerator from Toaru Majutsu no Index; Protecting your helpless loli. Why the fuck not? She's my second best character in Claymore. Lastly, there's Raki, the male protagonist; a character whom I didn't particularly hate or liked. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visual/animation, Claymore's visuals may take a little time to adapt to, especially for people who have grown accustomed to watching colorful, bright anime. However, I didn't find it repulsive whatsoever. The animation quality is still satisfying, even during this year, 2014. Clearly, it isn't on par with today's anime visuals but fits the dark and moody ambience of the anime. Characters' faces(especially Claymores) have a doll-like semblance and can look semi-creepy at first, but doesn't look too bad.\\n\\n\r\n\"Raison d'etre\", the opening theme which is performed by Nightmare is pleasing enough - since I'm a dedicated fan of rock and metal themed songs. Also, some nice rocking background music fades in whenever the battles get intense.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Claymore is a solid shounen anime set in a dark universe. The storyline is filled with many interesting twists and is pretty absorbing as well. Action scenes in Claymore are good, however its not outstanding. Visuals are nice but for some people it may take some time to get used to and the first few episodes might be a little tedious to watch. But by continuing, you might actually end up enjoying the way I did. If you're a die-hard shounen fan, then you're missing out.",

            "content": "When i first was going to watch claymore, i was expectating just a ordinary anime with warriors defeating monsters full of blood and gore with nothing special. After watching few episodes(untill episode 9) i just started to believe about how wrong i was about the series. For most old it is, this anime never fails to suprise, bringing things that make it different and unique, becoming one of the best series that i have follow in my life, even with the flaws, the show/manga itself, is amazing and worthly to check out. Yet, the show is not perfect, i have praised it a lot buti must be sincerity that i have to tell a lot of things about the show(principally the anime), without wasting time, Lets start shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story focus on the medieval era,  where a new threat comes to haunt and end the humanity, monsters called Youmas that devour humans come spreading the horror and the terror in the life of the humans, destroying and killing every human that see. The result is in the panic and the lose of hope where everyone is afraid to die and no one is reliable since youmas can transform into humans and live between them for after devour and kill them, also them are more fast and strong than the humans. In order to put a end in this situation, a organization is founded to create warriors for fight with those monsters, where they put blood and youma guts on them in order to becoming a hybrid race of human and youma and fight with the monster in equality, those are warriors are called Claymore, warriors of blonde hair with silver eyes(99,7% is female, somehow, females are more compatible with the blood and guts of youma). The story starts with a young boy called Raki, that is attached with a claymore called Claire that saved his life by killing the youma that murdered his family, and somehow they become like partners where Raki always accompanies Claire no matter where she go and as soon the story goes, a deep relationship is being made between them. By Hearing this, you can say that the story is a typical monster slayer story with few romance into it right between the hero and the fragile girl right? WRONG! is very very different, Claymore is not really focused in only warriors fightning monsters or the romance between the characters, is not like that. The focus of the story is the horror, melancholy, and the sadness that involves the characters in most of the situations where they react very well in determinated situations such as Dangerous, Sadness etc. Also, what make the story more good is the events on it, principally involving claymores that are a mixed of human and youma. You would trust in someone that have 50% of humanity and 50% of monstroity? I guess not. This is a other thing that makes the plot very captivating, the prejudice and the fear that the humans have for both youmas and claymores(even if they are half human) and you somehow you feel sorry for the claymores because you see that some of them are not really bad or even deserved to be treacted like this, is not like a fantasy anime where everyone root for the main character, praying for him/her to win, this one, they must support everything in their backs like the fardue of fightning monsters and hate of everyone. Claymores may not express any emotions in most of the scenes, but you can see inside their eyes, the sadness and the melancholy of their fates. There a lot of things that makes the plot enjoyable such as the background stories(principally claire's) of the characters that somehow locks you into the character and you can't do nothing than root for him/her complete his/her goal. By everything i say, you may disagree of note as 7, since by what i said, is a very good dark story BUUUUT lets not stick only to the good side. There also some bad points aswell, the story itself is not original and like many animes, the events on it makes enjoyable, but also the anime have somethings that disappoints. Unfortunally, i really wanted to give a higher rating since the anime somehow is loyal to the manga with very few things changed or deleted, but i must say that the final of the anime is what affect the anime and makes it bad. I'm not saying you shouldn't see the series, but for you be prepared, since the manga ended in 2014, and the anime finished in 2007, there was a lot of things missing and hopes are increasing for a second season but unfortunally it was just a illusion, since with the alternative ending of claymore, the hopes just turns down because is very different from the manga. You can watch it and trust me, you will enjoy it, but be prepared since in the last episodes, you will see something different from the manga and it may make you a little frustrated since we all want a anime with a decent adaptation. If it actually adaptated pretty well and made into two seasons, it could have been better, since we could expect to understand more things if does have a second season but since it doesn't have, there a lot of things missing in the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI Really like the art of claymore, principally the eyes of the claymores that is really beautiful, the facial expression is not that \"BEST\" thing you have see, but is really good, plastic and in some parts very detailed. I also like the designs of the characters and their details principally the armor of the claymores, and also the effects in the fight moments, its all beautiful. What i really missed is some more details in the face expression, since there were a lot of panic and despair moments of the anime, just for cause some reality and feel in the character's expressions, but overall, is very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOne of the best things of the anime are,no doubts, the OSTs, I love the OP that gives that melancholy theme of how sad the characters are and the fardue that they carry on their back involving in a lot of situations, risking their lifes for the humanity's sake, and also i loved the ending that makes everyone hype that somehow describe the stories/fates that most of the characters had. Thats something i really liked of the show, the epic soundtracks like the rocks/guitar mixed themes in fight scenes and the melody and compositions flutes, violins, hornpipe, piano etc.,  that give that medieval feeling, creating a amazing atmosphere for the anime and also describing some sad events involving all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is will be a mixed point. The good side of claymore, in terms of characters is all of them are unique and somehow memorable in every scenes that they actually appears. They react very well in most of the scenes, showing reality in their faces and you can see and feel the despair, sadness, fear and horror when they are facing somthing. You will feel bad for them for most of the things that have happened to them like loss, traumas etc. The problem of claymore is, most of the background stories are very repetitive and annoying with a character losing someone close(friend, parents, brother etc). 1 or 2 characters having the same fate is understandable but a lot, is very weird and i know those monsters are the principal responsable for the horror and despair of the characters but i think they could have worked more in with BG stories of the characters and turn them more enjoyable to watch, because is pretty annoying when  them went into flashback and show parents or anything like that dying and they complain about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nClaymore overall, is a pretty good anime. The story may be unorginal and there are some predictable things but you can't do nothing than just keep going enjoying and wanting to see more about the everything in the world of claymore and the events that helps building a story with memorable characters where you will always root for them and feel bad/frustrated when something happens to them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nClaymore is a very good anime and if you plan to watch, you won't regret it. Unfortunally, the anime itself had potential to be one of the best ones with a very good adaptation but somehow, disappoints near of the final. I Recommend you after finishing the anime, read the manga since there are things different and more things to show after the ending of the anime. Do not read it in the chapter where you stopped in the anime, read from the start.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Amazing Soundtracks that fits with the atmosphere and enviroment of the anime\\n\r\n+Memorable Characters\\n\r\n+Epic Visuals Effects with Decent Animations\\n\r\n+Amazing Horror/Melancholy/Action Atmosphere and story.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Most of the background stories of the characters are repetitive\\n\r\n-Disappointing Final Episodes",

In general I really like fantasy especially with strong female character and here you'll find a whole buch of them ! The story is well developed and intriguing, I have complains only with the ending - it's defferent from the manga which made the continuation of this anime difficult, which is very sad. \r\nArt graphic is very very good. I like how the characters don't look the typical manga humans with large creepy eyes but look quite normal and believable. \r\nCharacters are outstanding to me - every heroinehas something typical about her and has poles in her personality. Teresa was may be my favourite - in the beginning so cold and heartless and after meeting Clear - she just transformed in a warm and kinder person. I usually don't enjoy only good and only bad characters so I loved the fact that Prissila is not the ultimate evil monster - she also has a gentle side and was thought so much in her childhood it's quite normal how it came out with her...\\n\\n\r\nClaymore is one of the best anime series I've seen. I watched in literally in a night and I'll watch it again and again for sure!",

            "content": "In the world of Claymore, humans are hunted by creatures called \u201cYoma\u201d, which possess the bodies of humans and use them to infiltrate society. some times they will shed their human shells and become monsters that no mortal man can stand up against. To combat this an organization is created which employs specialized warriors known as \u201cClaymores\u201d; young, beautiful women who have been imbued with the blood of the Yoma.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nOne of the things I enjoyed most about Claymore\u2019s story is how it utilized women. Unlike most anime (and most forms of entertainment in general), the women in Claymore are not presented in a sexualmanner. While attractive, they maintain an almost sexless air about them, and at least on the surface, they seem not to be preoccupied with romance or the pleasures of the flesh. No skimpy outfits, no watermelon tits, no naked bathing scenes. The Claymores are just badasses who kill things, and do so without constantly reminding you that they are women. In stark contrast, the men in Claymore are all virtually helpless. I feel that this is a nice and much needed role reversal for anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8/10\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Claymore is equally impressive. As a Madhouse production, you are pretty much guaranteed top notch animation. The show remains consistently smooth throughout its run, with perhaps a bit of emphasis placed on the fight scenes. What really sells the presentation, however, is the art style. The shading, lighting, and use of color work well in making Claymore as fittingly dark and dreary as possible. Being based on a beautiful graphic novel-quality manga, Claymore had big shoes to fill in terms of its visuals, and it completely achieves success here by capturing the look of the manga perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nAnother thing that carries Claymore along is its great music, a mix of haunting instrumental pieces and visceral metal. Some of the themes here are very memorable, particularly the incredible ending song, Danzai no Hana ~Guilty Sky~, a symphonic rock hybrid with beautiful lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nClaymore is great low-fantasy at its finest. The bulk of the show consists of Clare traveling from one Yoma battle to the next, but there are some great introspective explorations of the characters, most notably Clare. When we begin, Clare is frigid and emotionless. But through her interactions with Raki and her encounters with other Claymores and Yoma, specifically the transcendent Yoma known as \u201cAwakened Beings\u201d and her increasing knowledge of the relationship between all of these elements, Clare begins to change rather dynamically.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nHowever, as nice as the story is, Claymore is foremost an action show. The fight scenes are the core of the show, and if you are not a big fan of action, gore and the staple \u201ctechnique-talk\u201d of shonen anime, there is a good chance that Claymore will not tickle your fancy. But if you do appreciate amazing fight scenes when you see them, Claymore will be absolute bliss. You will be hard pressed to find a show more violent and brutal. Even Berserk does not compare. Hell, even Hokuto no Ken does not quite elicit the same cringes that Claymore gave me. As much as I am a fan of character development and great narrative, I would be lying if I said the fight scenes in Claymore did not fill me with boyish glee.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nClaymore is a great show, but it is not for everyone. If you are into more poignant stuff and are not enamored by fight scenes, you may want to pass up Claymore and watch Berserk instead. But if you love action and brutality, Claymore just might be your ticket to a great time. In all, it is one of the best all-out action/fantasy shows I have seen in a long time.",

            "content": "As this review of Claymore is coming over a decade after its actual release, I tried to level-off my expectations.\r\nBasically, the anime is about world infested with yoma, or demons that eat people. What's tricky is that these creatures are able to disguise themselves by taking the memories of a person they had consumed, and adapting into society. Given the great peril, an organization produced what is known as \"Claymore\" - individuals who have decided have themselves fused with yoma, in order to exterminate the evil beings. \r\nThe narrative follows the life of Clare, one who has decided to give up her humanity to getthe power to kill yoma. She saves a Raki, a normal boy, who decides to journey with her. \\n\\n\r\nWe've heard similar storylines before from the likes of Saiyuki, Blood +, heck, even X-Men (shows at the top of mind that came before 2007): those same people who have the \"evil\"  are the ones who are protecting the \"normal humans.\" Through this, the the usual bittersweet conflict within the audience occurs: we understand that citizens are afraid of the fighters, and at the same time we feel ever-so-deeply for those so-called \"demonic beings,\" who are sacrificing their lives for the very people who hate them. What's more is that the Claymore used to be human, and have very humane reasons for fighting. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the overly familiar plot, the series started quite slowly. The art was also unusual, seemed disproportionate, and distracting (it proved difficult to differentiate the characters, especially Claymore, who have similar features). There were a few mediocre twists after another, but eventually, the story began to pick up the pace. \\n\\n\r\nOne great positive thing I would like to point out is that the directors were not afraid to jump into the bizarre or dive into the disturbing - through the characters' unique personalities or through battle techniques or damage incurred (labeled that way, so as not to spoil anything). This definitely increased appeal. Another strongpoint of the anime is that it broke usual boundaries between characters and this can shake the audience. Many ideas and events that took place were unique and added to viewers' enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a few things in the execution of the series that were insufferable such as, but not limited to, the excessive flashbacks (especially when it came to Raki), the repetitive dialogues, and several recapitulations of certain themes. Perhaps the makers should give more credit to the audience. Once a scene of a character showing the key experiences or reason for fighting is shown, we would be able to infer what the character is feeling or would desire, instead of shoving it up our faces over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nWhat was also not appreciated was that though Clare kept getting \"stronger,\" she was not as effective in battle. Then all of a sudden, her willpower makes everything okay. Especially at the final arc, the coherence of the story was lost because of this. All logic got even more muddled when Clare was deterred to fulfill what she had set out to do for no substantial reason. It leaves the audiences with a feeling of confusion and disarray - not with the sense of intrigue and excitement, but because of poor explanation and plot flow. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Claymore did not disappoint in terms of excitement, action, and entertainment. I definitely would have rated the anime higher if it were not for the ending.",

            "content": "So basically everyone and their grandmother has seen Claymore. I think I was one of the few people who didn't know about Claymore when it first came out but I also chose not to watch it until it was completed, either way I'm usually pretty behind on the curve when it comes to the latest and greatest anime for this very reason....I hate being held in suspense for weeks while they come out with new episodes. Especially if it's an anime with a lot of fillers because then you are held in suspense indefinitely. Luckily Claymore is not that type of show. It's 26 episodesof pure action, pure gore and no fillers....prepare for a wild ride!\\n\\n\r\n~art\\n\r\nThis is a relatively new show [2007] but the animation isn't really dazzling. I couldn't detect any CGI which is a shame [Don't get me wrong I really hate CGI when it's used for visual art, but it's excellent for motion]. There are some excellent fighting scenes nonetheless, probably due to animators great sense of angling and proportions, their clever use of special f/x like slow-motion and blur but also by capturing the right level of fierceness in the characters' faces while in battle. Just their faces and their screams alone kept me riveted to the screen during the fights. \\n\r\nThe art style I really enjoyed, the coloring and shading gave Claymore the overall appearance like you were reading a graphic novel, very dark and gritty. All the towns were modest and medieval looking, the forests were foreboding and the beasts were downright scary.\\n\\n\r\n~audio\\n\r\nI watched this show both in Japanese and English. I'm pretty comfortable with watching it either way...but I do tend to watch dubs because I'm a terribly slow reader and I would be reading the captions the whole time and never once get the chance to fully take in the scenes or see characters' faces. But I did watch Claymore in both formats and I did enjoy the English dub mainly because the language was rough and real, there's no nice, censored fluffy language in this one....yes!!!!  All the voice actors were very serious and intense, the females all sounded like fierce warriors and were to be taken seriously, no one sounded cutesy or \u201cprincess-like\u201d in this anime. \\n\r\nThe sound f/x were also great for this series, I liked the sound of of the swords clashing at high speed, the sound of steel grating against the yoma's claws and the whistles of the pyrotechnics and the boom of a building being smashed... I even liked the roars the monsters made. So I would say the audio and visual aspects of the show worked well together to make the show dark and gritty without being too gloomy or depressing. \\n\r\nThe musical choices of the OP and ED could have probably been better. I think that they do match the overall tone of the series but I just wasn't too crazy about them... but the music they use within the episodes are pretty cool like that one freaky,warped sounding song that they play whenever something is about to happen like a battle, that song I love. Every time I hear it I'm like \u201cOooooh ssssshhhiiiiiitt, something's about to go down.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n~story\\n\r\nA good story is one that gets you hooked, feeling compelled to know what happens next. A good story evokes emotions from the viewer like sadness, anxiety, tension, laughter and all the rest. A good story will even make you forget that it's a story. Claymore is that type of a good story. I think what works for me with Claymore is the equal combination of emotion and action. I really dislike shows that seem to just have a lot of senseless action that leaves you wondering why they're all fighting in the first place...same thing goes for shows with excessive emotional drama [and there were a few points in this show when I wanted to grab that boy, Raki, by his hair and yank him out of the scene with his constant crying and sniveling]. I don't mind people crying and stuff but the constant whining or overly anxious people get on my nerves. Claymore tends to find a nice balance between the two. \\n\r\nWhat I also liked about this story format was the use of flashbacks that extended for 3 or more episodes, especially since it gave great insight into Claire's mind and also understanding the importance of Theresa. And since Claymore is a much longer running manga series, the animation company too the practical approach and focused on Claire's story which offered a decent conclusion. Whether or not they decide to continue the story about \u201cThe Organization\u201d or the other Claymores isn't that important...because we still had closure for Claire's story.\\n\\n\r\n~characters\\n\r\nThis is one of the few anime shows out there that falls into the shonen category considering it's a predominantly female cast. I'm not saying that there aren't shonen anime shows out there that don't sport a majority or all-female cast for example, there's Mai Hime. But even with a show like Mai Hime, you can clearly see that it was made with a cuter, more girlie sense of aesthetic compared to the much gruesome and violent Claymore. Also most noticeably with Claymore is the absence of feminine sexuality. Going back to the Mai Hime example, there were all the requisite breasts jokes/comments, \u201cpanty shots\u201d also a swimsuit/beach episode which is pretty common for a shonen anime with female leads but Claymore steered clear from all the anime cliches and kept things as realistic [within the context of this particular story] as possible. Some of the female demons walked around bare-chested and even that didn't seem exploitive, ecchi or hentai-like. \\n\r\nClaymore has a fairly large cast mainly due to the fact that we see a large number of these \u201csilver-eyed witches\u201d throughout the anime, all varying in skill and rank. But even with all these claymores walking about I found it most commendable and a credit to the character design team because even though all the claymores are tall, thin and beautiful with blond hair and silver eyes, they manage to provide each claymore with their own unique appearance. It's fairly easy to distinguish one claymore from another, some had different bodies while others had differently shaped eyes or hairstyles. And as I say this I find it funny because this show manages to pull off having distinguishable features for a large cast while other anime shows have much smaller casts and their characters all look alike [whether they're related or not]. \\n\r\nSince the cast was too large it doesn't make sense to speak about all of them on an individual basis here in this review and most likely you will become attached to Claire since she is the central character of this series.....but I also liked Theresa of the Faint Smile very much.\\n\\n\r\n~verdict\\n\r\nThis show gets more than a passing grade in my book and I have watched it multiple times. So I highly recommend it for those who enjoy the adult side of anime.",

The portrayal of the character is rather mediocre but the earlier plot drove me to the anime.\r\nAt the beginning of the plot we are introduced to the protagonist of the story, Clare (Kurea). Then she met a boy named Raki. The relationship is rather ambiguous. Sometimes Clare treats him like a lil brother and onced she kisses him like a lover would do.\r\nThe fighting scene is quite remarkable and the portrayel of the antagonists, a group of monster called Youma, is verygrousome. However, in my humble opinion, the characters are way too many considering there are only 26 episodes. So, the development of the main character is not well-presented .",

            "content": "Story - 9.1/10 (A-)\r\nThe plot is supremely well made. A female warrior, known to all as a Claymore, fighting the demons \"Yoma\", who are actually part of the species that they kill. It's a oddly interesting relation. Sure, we've all seen our share of \"Female kicking a** and ending up becoming the goddess\" animes, but Claymore brings it in. Having to deal with a small companion that you saved from the Yoma, having to deal with the loss of your mentor by solemnly holding her decapitated head. It's just the kind of show that \"goes there\". Some of the episodes might be too gore-filled, justa heads up.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 10/10 (A+)\\n\r\nEvery scene, every detail has the beautiful animation i've always longed for. The battles are intense and well played out, the heartache drama that follows is also well animated, even the death of Teresa is a scene that'll always pull me in. Claymore,  you deserve a standing ovation. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8.7/10 (B+)\\n\r\nWhile Claymore has a superb taste of blending it all together, it seems FUNimation (they really need to take out the &quot;FUN&quot;.) always has to ruin something they license. Clare's voice in the english dub is good, something i can stand, something i can listen to. Raki sounds like the damzel in distress who always seems like he's gonna get ex'd off the show. I had to include the dub along with the japanese version. Everyone else is borderline. Now go watch the Japanese version, it sounds more intense. I've always been the &quot;sub&quot; kind of person, but a dub can't hurt once in a while. That said, Claymore along with most animes has a fairly decent (occasionally excellent) voice cast. I recommend buying the Intimate Persona CD, with vocals by the cast. Really worth it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9.6/10 (A)\\n\r\nEach character is unique to the story, making that more fun to watch. From the child dealing with the death's of his family in front of him, from the misguided Priscilla with a score to settle, from the heroine that is stuck between what's right and wrong and from the mother figure known as Teresa. Really well done.\\n\r\n____________________________________\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  9.8/10 (A)\\n\\n\r\nA solid A for Claymore. As a fan, i always have Claymore somewhere in my heart. A show for the ages, something that can age over time and still feel new. The Claymore experience  was a blast, and every minute felt like a year. Every anime fan, no matter what your preference is, should watch Claymore. Give it a chance, and you'll soon be forking out the DVD money.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Averaged: 9.4/10",

With the introduction of Teresa a story base is established and it moves forward with quick slashes. Best thing about Claymore is tightness of the flow. There is no room to catch your breath, every 2 ep.s apart it tunes up a notch till the end. Without the intention to do so, I became addicted and drained it in 3 days.\r\nEach Claymore basically looks the same except the haircut, as the numbers multiplied I had a hard time differentiating between the characters. Same cocky attitude,different techniques, similar motivations.\\n\\n\r\nIt's generic fantasy world and ending wrap up makes it forgettable for me. In order to enjoy the thrill ride I tried not to read too much into it.\\n\\n\r\n- SPOILER - \\n\r\nThe explanation about all the Claymore's being female presents an interesting subtext. Triggering of Yoma powers feeds on sexual pleasure, and every male experiment ended up -awakening-. Once men get excited to the limit, it results in a premature ejaculation. Makes sense to me :).",

            "content": "Claymore is a violent, bloody, action filled anime. It is based on an ongoing manga series that is released monthly, and this is a good introduction to the manga series. I personally had to make a couple of attempts to watch this before I was able to really get into it. That being said it is worth watching, though not a priority.\r\nThe main character, Clare, is ranked as the \"weakest\" of the Claymore. This makes the series an \"underdog\" story in more than one way. The Yoma (demons/monsters they fight in the series) are stronger than the Claymore, but because Claymore are half-human/half-yoma they areable to do battle with the creatures. This story deals heavily with questions about humanity and right and wrong. The main character has a strong background story, and those close to her are heavily influenced by her. The story aside, it is very bloody and violent so it's not for the faint of heart.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime didn't sit well with me at first. The panning shots are too fast, and you're not left a lot of time for the emotional connections to develop. This is no fault to the story, this is actually a decent adaption from the manga. However, it really is moving 2.5-3 times faster than the manga series does. They truncate a lot of the dialogue and pan quickly through the emotional scenes. There are plenty of scenes that are done pretty well, but the anime really fluctuates between \"fair\" and \"excellent.\" This should have been a 40+ episode series if they had done it right. This doesn't kill the anime, but it does cripple it quite a bit. Also, the ending is very different than the part of the manga it's adapted from. They still leave it very open without tying up any of the lose ends because they're still being dealt with in the manga series. In my opinion, it would have been better if they left it exactly the same as the manga series, but it wouldn't have been the happy ending they left it with.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said it's still a good anime. Manga fans should be ok with it (we are used to manga being butchered when going anime), and anime fans should find it worthy of a little praise. I mentioned before that it is a good introduction to the manga series, but if you want to pick up where this left off then you will want to read the overlapping section that the ending changed so you can see what really happened. It's much more dark, and it really is a lot cooler. \\n\\n\r\nAdd this to your list if you get around to it, but definitely check out the manga series.",

            "content": "Going into Claymore, my anime loving friends had all warned me that it would be a tearjerker. \"The ending!\" They cried with a fiery passion, \"O, the ending! It hath plucked at mine heartstrings, it hath sliced at my heart with an oversized sword.\"\r\nTaking their advice into consideration, I sat down, got my box of tissues ready, and plunged into the final episode. And as the ending music played, I found myself staring at the screen, stunned at how non-emotional it was. As I recall, I even scoffed a few times and smiled a little.\r\nStory: One of the things that pisses me off about thestory is Clare's rank. Clare is the main character, can be insanely strong sometimes, and is the LOWEST RANKED CLAYMORE. It's explained in the story that Clare's powers are inconsistant, so her rank is low, but most of the time she's really strong, especially towards the end. I could understand if she was in the 20's or 30's, but the lowest rank? It makes no sense. Moving on, the story centers on Clare being followed around by Raki, who I'll get to later. Raki is someone who is obviously just a device to insert more variety (because there are only so many ways one can draw a tall blonde girl) and a way to introduce Clare into the story. There are demons in the story, but they're boring and don't really add that much except conflict.\\n\r\nTowards the end I stopped caring about the story entirely and finished it for the sake of finishing it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: At it's best, it was mediocre. At it's worst, it was downright hideous. The battles, which are supposed to be a main point of the series, consist of a shot of a sword moving, then a black screen with lots of diagonal cuts forming, the demon looking confused and frozen for a few seconds, and finally the demon spurting blood from wounds that seem to have a delayed reaction timer in them. When the artists try to draw Clare or anyone in a very beautiful way, it just causes me to hide behind my chair in fear. The facial proportions were terrible, the character designs okay (I give them props for being able to draw one sort of character 47 different ways), the clothing designs very good, and the youma okay.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It wasn't that memorable. It gets a five. It wasn't offensive to my ears, and it wasn't great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh boy.\\n\r\nRaki is a useless little boy who has the personality of dead grass. He's on the sidelines, he thinks he can help, but oh wait, he can't, he's grass, and in the end simply gets stepped on by everyone.\\n\r\nAnother character in particular annoys the hell out of me. Jeane, a Claymore who comes in later and I can't say much about her for fear of spoilers, is someone who is dedicated to returning a favor Clare did for her. And she does return the favor. Multiple times. Clare even says that it's not necessary for her to go to such lengths for her. Jeane then decides to follow Clare around. I only see \"stalker\" when I look at Jeane. Not \"reliable friend\". \\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they were alright. Nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Ehhhh. Whatever enjoyment I got out of the first few episodes were vanquished in the last few.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: What else is there to say?\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you enjoy long, drawn out fights, blonde women, and annoying protagonists.\\n\r\nNow, I have to go return the tissues I bought.",

It offers a great variety of everything you would want in an anime: action, battle scenes, a little bit of romance (not too much) and the idea of the anime is just something that sucked me in into watching half the anime at once. Is it worth watching? I would say yes. Now let me tell you why.\r\nThe story is just stunning. The idea, the big picture behind it offers you a world that you discover with the anime piece by piece. The story flows most of the time, of course there are confusingmoments, but it settles in a while. However  the ending...oh the ending. It actually is a decent ending. It gives us some good thoughts about life, the characters that are rather in the front get their piece and the story is about to go on. I would say a nice ending. OF THE SEASON. NOT THE ANIME, OF THE SEASON. It leaves a large hole in the story and the story could have evolved into more episodes then there are now. But up to that point I was on thorns and enjoyed every second I watched the anime. STORY: 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is enjoyable. You can see that this is not something, that was just thrown together over night. You can see a lot of detail in it, however it is not the best that I have seen. There is a dark aura present the whole time in the anime, that makes it appear sinister, somehow dark, just to boost the thrill of it. ART: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound is pretty good I must say, some of it could not fit in better then it does now. However some music was just kind of forced in, in my opinion, it didn't fit in at some moments. All around, very unique tracks. SOUND: 8\\n\\n\r\nEvery characters is a story on its own and that is what I like about it. Some of them blend together like water and wine and some are just like oil and water, very realistic from my point of view. What bothers me is that some of the characters a left unexplained and mysterious while it seems crucial to know of their whereabouts. However you can not expect this to be a miracle in 26 episodes. What also bothers me is that different characters have the same wounds and home can heal them some just can't. Why? (cricket sounds in the background) Clere improved through the whole anime like A LOT, while Raki, who was a partly (imo) main character, improved like 0 or close to it. He just wines about everything and is of almost no use. It remind me very much of Ganta from Deadman Wonderland, he just lacks the impulsiveness. But what do you know, he manages to somehow save Clare (actually Jean saves her but let's say that without Raki things would not have gone into the right direction) and it turns out that he is sort of useful.\\n\r\nAnd while we learn a lot about each individual of the \"Claymore family\" we actually learn nothing very useful of the Organization. We just know that some sinister guys work for it and they boss around the Claymores. Nothing more, nothing less. CHARACTERS: 9\\n\\n\r\nOMG did I enjoy that show. Some of the characters can really grow to your heart but remember the first rune of animes: never get attached. Some episodes end in a way that you just have to keep watching. The twists are spectacular and not everything resolves as expected, just a nice reminder that it's not a fairy tale. ENJOYMENT: 9\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, I recommend Claymore to everyone who wants to watch a new anime, loves battles and is not bothered by too much blood. Yes you can say it is a bloody anime, not overkilling it but it gets pretty rough. If would have rated this anime according to the ending it would have probably be a 7 or so, but the anime wasn't accepted that well in Japan and the company just probably decided that it was enough and decided to put and end to it... Sadness and sorrow I know, but that is how business rolls nowadays. Despite a lot of us want another season, the chances of getting another one is close to zero. I am grateful that they gave us this (close to a) masterpiece, if even a glimpse to the whole story, it was satisfying yet disturbing because of the ending. \\n\r\nI haven't read the manga yet but the anime really encouraged me to read it.\\n\r\nAnd guys remember: you can suppress everything if you just try hard enough. In addition with friends around you it can be a lot easier.",

Even though the anime turns around a simple goal: revenge - the story is full and has lot of depth. Female characters look similar to each other, too similar to  be honest, but their characters feel so different yet so alike.\r\nNot only that, but an anime where the most important main leads are female. The male lead is weak and needs protection, and has some important roles but even though he is described as a main character he feels like a supporting characterfor the main female. I'll leave you to watch and decide for yourself, but I felt like he had importance in the first 10 episodes but after that his significance was meh.\\n\\n\r\nYou will be satisfied with the constant limb-tearing, bloody combat. And there is a lot of it. The closest anime I can link this one to is Berserk. And you know what that means, if you watched Berserk. Yup. Demon slaying goodies. Only unlike in Berserk, the main antagonists and protagonists are the same people. I don't want to spoil the story for you, watch it and you'll understand why I said that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is kind of old, but is really well drawn. The only complaint I might have is the music.\\n\r\nYou have some triumph music, then irish pipe melodies, then some strange dub-step and Mortal Kombat like music. Idk how to explain it, but the music feels off in many scenes. I feel they could of done a better job there.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, this anime is superb.\\n\r\nI HIGHLY recommend it to brutal combat seeking fans.",

            "content": "Claymore is an interesting beast.  The story, despite making some admirable shifts, never manages to be anything spectacular.  The writing is smarter than you might expect (This isn't the anime that uses an all-female order of warriors simply as an excuse for fanservice).  The animation is good, but especially towards the end you can kind of feel that their budget was running out both in terms of the writing and the look of the production.\r\nWhile I was watching Claymore, it was a perfectly serviceable form of entertainment.  I didn't love it: there were parts I admired but there were also partsI really disliked.  On the plus side, those turns in the story I mentioned before.  On the minus side, the male lead caused my friends and I to coin the term the \"Raki Line\"  The line below which a character is nothing but annoying but above which their contribution is at least enough that while they may still provide annoyance, they have other reasons for being.  Raki, as you might imagine, straddles the line for a lot of his screen time though he gets at least a little bit of character development to ultimately land on the good side.\\n\\n\r\nAll the same, I find myself oddly dissatisfied giving this merely a 7.  Why?  Because while I never felt particularly moved watching it, and while I can see a ton of flaws and very few A-effort moves, it's something I keep coming back to.  Claymore has lingered on my mind long after I finished watching it, to the point where I've seriously been looking into picking up the Manga.  There's something here that has a lot more weight than anything I can technically rate on the scales we're given.  Is it the story?  The art?  The characters?  I didn't enjoy Claymore more than so many other shows that I think about less when I was watching it... but it has some sort of heart or spirit that really shines through, and I can't help but recommend it as something that may very well stick with you in a very good way.",

It was already just cool with the action and cool sword fighting that was going on. In addition to crazy random creature abilities and fighting abilities and stuff. So that part of the show was definitely cool, I enjoyed it.\r\nThere were many things to be answered, and many interesting points to be looked at. But none of them were really addressed, all the questions you might have are like, well nope. There were also things that just weren't necessary and/or relevant to the plot theydeveloped. For instance, it is clear within 10 episodes who Final Boss is. However, episodes after it they introduce Final Boss 2, Final Boss 3 and implicitly Final Boss 3,4, and 5. Why they do this? I don't know, it definitely did not need to happen. Was meaningless to the storyline, and gave rise to more questions.\\n\\n\r\nThey honestly had a streamlined, clear, concise road ahead of them which was not complicated at all. They however, did not take it. This reaaaaaaallly looks like the kind of thing that has continuing story in the manga, whereas that's it for the anime. There's so many questions and loose ends, I know there has to be more; it really feels like I'm only half way through the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song for the anime is awesome. What can I say, I love the ending. It's by awesome cute former bemani group BeForU member, Riyu Kosaka. Who makes awesome group (and individually) makes awesome DDR/Beatmania songs.\\n\\n\r\nEnding was lame I think.\\n\\n\r\nIt ends up getting a 5, and I'll tell you why. Simply because of the cool action, sword fighting scenes, and the awesome ending song for the show. The ending song actually prevented it from getting a 4 in my opinion. Nonetheless, with the amount of unanswered questions and disappointment arising from series completion,  it gets lots of minus points. Resulting in a 5. I enjoyed it but there were noticeable issues by the end of the show.",

            "content": "Sharper than Scottish sword and more explosive than Claymore mine! This series and its charming yet deadly protagonist knows what it's doing. Although I would be extra careful with phrases \"Don't lose your head\", \"Give me a hand\" and \"Are you pulling my leg\"... cause it can be taken literally.\r\nI don't know how many swimming pools of ketchup and grape juice would be spent if this was a live action show, but I have a feeling that it would be a lot. Amazingly inaccurate but even more hilarious bloody equivalents of oil well makes you either stare at screen with half smiling opened mouth orjust yell \"Yeeeaaah\" and enjoy the adrenalin. This show doesn't screw around with its action sequences. Blood, gore and limbs fall as snow on Christmas and shocking scenes of several ends of human anatomy being chopped off sometimes resemble George R. R. Martins sudden twists.\\n\\n\r\nIt might seem like an overused formula at the very beginning. Monster hunter meets a boy and they travel together, learning things about themselves and growing closer with every adventure. But it's so much more than that. Episode by episode we learn more about mythology of Claymore world, silver eyed witches, rules that they need to abide, and what happens, when they don't. Claymores has a lot in common with Sapkowskis witchers and little something with Grey Wardens from Dragon Age series. The mythology is beautifully complex.\\n\\n\r\nI started watching it in original Japanese and even though I enjoyed voice of Romi Paku in role of Teresa and got excited by recognizing Narutos voice in one of side characters, I switched to English dubbing. Dramatical acting of American cast is just breathtaking. Soft voices in quiet emotional scenes as well as intense heartbreaking screams of fighters being stripped of their humanity to become an Awakened beings.\\n\r\nAlso props to making a lot of characters a lot more than you would expect. It is quite common in anime for even villains to have their reasons why they turned to the dark side. They are not evil, because they want to be. There are traumas and soul-crushing tragedies behind that evil persona.\\n\\n\r\nEven though at times I had to force myself to watch it, I'm glad I had privilege to see and experience Claymore. It is an exceptional anime, with complex characters, hard-core messy infinite-blood-mod action and great emotional character interactions. William Wallace would be proud, Geralt would be jealous... and interested. And viewers satisfied.\\n\\n",

My only other experiences with anime before was seeing Vampire Hunter D like 14 yrs before of which I barely remembered anything about it.\r\nAnyways, I loved Claymore! The main characters are great, Clare is a great example of a strong feminine type and doesn't use sex as tool. Raki is also a great character who meshes perfectly with Clare's stone faced obliqueness. He brings a lighter and warmhearted side to the show. Personally, the strong quiet main female role that Clare portrays is my favoriteaspect of this series. The story is interesting and not overly complicated. The supporting characters are unique and bring their own flare whenever they show up.\\n\\n\r\nI had one gripe about the show that I no longer hold but since it was my first anime series I was a little bewildered by the amount of gore, but like I said I no longer hold this as a negative or a positive and instead holding it as it is.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing, I wish the series would've kept going and as a warning... If you enjoyed this series be prepared to get cut off at the end of it somewhat. It closes the main story line at the end of the series but it's left of lingering as if they were hoping to continue it, but that must be continued by the manga, of which I never looked into.",

            "content": "Claymore, as a whole, is probably one of my favorite Animes of all time; melancholic, gruesome, and moving. Although the series isn't as fresh in my mind as I want it to be, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this anime to the fullest extent. \r\nThe story flowed very nicely throughout, and since I didn't read the manga, I'm not going to complain about how it diverged from the main plot towards the end. It stayed consistent with itself, and every episode was very entertaining. Extended bloody battle scenes, sentimentality, and overcoming obstacles seemed to be the forte within this show. During some episodesI cried, I cheered, and especially, I yelled. I think my favorite part about the story is that it's constantly introducing new aspects that hadn't been heard of before, such as rankings, awakened beings, the black card, the organization, and the abyssal ones. \\n\r\nI absolutely adored the artwork in this Anime. Not only was the drawing precise and the technique unique, the character designs were so original and beautiful. The way they distinguished each claymore with a different hairstyle made it all the more enjoyable to view, because each was beautiful in their own way. Also, I've honestly never seen such fantastic designs for any monsters in any anime. The awakened beings, by far, showcased the talent of the creative directors. Specifically in the cave scene, where the one who was (I believe) unnamed, transforms into this elegant, futuristic looking white monster. I loved it.\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the sound; it was strong and acted as a good compliment to the rest of the show.\\n\r\nThis part will probably be rather long. The characters in Claymore were one of the strongest, and weakest, aspects of the show. Some characters I absolutely ADORED- I couldn't wait to see more of them- and then others were unneeded and unintentionally infuriating. For one thing, I absolutely despised Raki. He is possibly the most whiny, annoying, ill-created supporting sidekick in the history of any anime. I hated him from the second he screamed 'CLARE', and the hate grew even more during his and the latter's 'romantic interlude'. Also, Priscilla had the weakest motivation to kill ever. I really, really disliked her. But every other character I pretty much loved. Scene stealers included Galatea, Ophelia, Undine, Llena, Helen, and Teresa; they were among my favorites in a strong cast. Now for the main character: Clare. Clare was sometimes one of my favorites, and also sometimes one of my least favorites. Her cold personality was a strong point in the beginning, but towards the end, her wrath towards Priscilla grew rather annoying. I did enjoy her, though.\\n\r\nOverall, as stated in the opening, this was one of my favorite Animes of all time and is a must-see, in my opinion. I found it on Live Play, on Netflix. PLEASE check it out. :)",

            "content": "Thanks to anyone in advance for reading this review. I first was interested in watching Caymore because of an amv. to be fair this where most of the anime that watch come from. When I watched the first episode I laughed at how predictably bad it was. So after a long hiatus I gave it another go. Here are my thoughts\r\nStory: The story is about a claymores who are half yoma, half human warriors that fight yoma. These claymores have large swords which lets other claymores know the rank and name of that calymore. The main plot involves Clare and Raki. Spoiler Warning: Clare's goalto kill a claymore which became awakened and killed Teresa.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are two parts of this story. The main part involves Clare and Raki. The other part involves Teresa's story.\\n\r\nThis story is solid and keeps you going from one even to the next however, there a substance lacking elements. I will not list because of spoilers but when you watch you will know what I mean. This anime was made when the manga was still going, this should indicate to you what the ending is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Many people compliment the art and say that it is good if not great. I am not a fan of this art style. Especially since it reminds me of the art style used for Bible Black a famous hentai. Which by the way has good animation. Overall it does the job but not my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound in this show is well done. The sounds of blades hitting and cutting the targets is believable. My favorite sounds are when the claymores are using their inner yoma powers. The sound during the transformations are well done. If you are deciding which version dub or subbed. I recommend subbed because the dub is meh. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Except for Raki I liked every character in this story especially the claymores. I love how you meet the higher ranked claymores ad everyone is in awe of them. Every clamore in this show was interesting and I cared if they lived or died. I even did not mind the minor characters. You know the people who were in the villages that required the clyamore's assistance. Clare is just awesome, she never gives up and fights for what see believes in.  She has a heart as well, in that she will not kill innocent people even if just a second ago they were an enemy. Clare throughout the show is ranked 47 out of 50 which is bad. Despite this she is very important in every mission that she is in. Plus she saves everyone's hide during the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show is great to watch. There were moments that made my jaw drop in a good way. The shows keeps you relaxed and comfortable and BAM something crazy happens and you have so many deep emotions going on at once. This one of the many experiences I have had when I watched the show.  The action in this show is great it is does go on for too long. Also i do not feel cheated in that they cut off a fight too early. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is fun show that has a tone of action/ violence. There are many great and  characters that r you can relates to. I would watch this one again. The only thing you should be aware of is Raki and the ending. Other than that give this one a try. \\n",

            "content": "This anime deserves 10/10 rating! Its dark, gritty, gore level (High) and the story is engaging to say the very least! If you have never seen Bezerk its quite similar and by far one of my absolute favorites! Claymore made it to the list very easily after a few episodes! Im not big on female leads usually because its hard to relate or get into the story but with claymore I was content and later on its gets even better not to say too much but the guys get some actions too so the male race isnt completely incompetent in this anime.  I giveit such a high rating mainly due to the fact its so different than all these other animes it doesnt try to be family friendly and be funny or have a bunch of filler comedy that takes away from the story. Its a never ending rollercoaster ride that when it does end you wanna ride it all over again just to re experience it! I cant say it doesnt have its problems like all animes they are only perfect to some peoples eyes.... if you want to watch an anime that doesnt seem like it was made for your children watch claymore! It is  everything you been craving for if you dislike anime where people never die....",

There is an excessive use of stereotypical female warrior that could have been a little less boring with  some psychological nuance of the characters. There is no cohesion between the personalities and some actions. \r\nAt times the sound effects are not consistent with the scenes. There are a few mistakes in the proportion of objects.\r\nIt is a very good story carried out in the most poorly way. Totally dissappointing.",

            "content": "I will attempt to be brief in this review and try not to reveal any spoilers.  Claymore follows two lead characters named Raki and Clare, both whom are cast in a medieval era like Europe where dangerous demons named Youma hunt and feed on their natural and mostly helpless prey, humans.  Raki himself is no more then a ordinary young Human boy until one day fate causes his path to cross with Clare, a powerful half human half Youma female warrior who's seemingly soul purpose in life, like many other claymores, is to protect humans and kill the Youma that hunt them.Adventure and much demon slaying ensues while the two not only set out to seek peace of mind in a bleak dark world but to also find the limits of there own humanity.\\n\\n\r\n  The story starts with potential but never lifts itself higher than that of a generic shounen and the ending is ultimately disappointing leaving many questions un-answered and character development lacking. The artwork however is  good, the animation is smooth and fluid in the fight scenes and the backdrops of the scenery were drawn with care making the world appear a lot more believable.  I liked the idea behind the design of most the characters but do to a weak plot and even weaker ending you never really build a large amount of attachment to any members of the cast as they are simply not flushed out enough.  That being said the story wasn't bad, it just  wasn't good either.  Overall I would give Claymore a 6 out of 10. I enjoyed the action, the setting, and the art style but the story lack of strong character development held this anime back from being  something really memorable.",

            "content": "Well, that will be my first review. \r\nI guess people rather speak about things they don't like rather than the opposite. Which is why I'm picking by far the worst anime I've watched for my first review.\r\nLet the rant begin. Note that I probably wouldn't be writing this review if Claymore had a score of 5 on MAL, but it's near 8. How can people stomach it - and more so, consider it good - is just beyond me.\r\nArt. It's just horrendous. I know Claymore is an old anime. I know the drawing style changed a lot over the years. But I don't thinkClaymore's art was ever considered at least mediocre. I'm not even going to mention Hiyazaki's movies, since movies are movies, but there are plenty shows from the same period which trump Claymore in the art department. The animations are pain to watch, the whole world is coloured with shades of grey with some red spatters on top, and the characters and backgrounds are just god damned UGLY. It's not like I've ever actively searched for one, but I can't say I've ever seen an anime with art style worse than that of Claymore. \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to say that sound was the only saving grace of this anime, but I only recall the opening and ending, which were decent, but 2 songs don't make the whole soundtrack. I can't remember any of the themes in the actual show, which means they either didn't exist or were very forgettable. OST probably was just mediocre and not worth the brain power to remember. However, considering how bad the anime generally is, sound is probably the best part of it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters. Yeah, this is just Dragon Ball with an almost exclusively female cast. I vaguely noticed the poor attempts at storytelling Claymore was making, but they were immediately trumped by retarded shouting, last second saves and ridiculous LEVEL UP moments that make 90% of the show. It actually starts off decently, the pace is quite nice, and though Raki is extremely annoying since he first appears on screen, it's bearable, though filled with cliches. Unfortunately, the further it goes, the worse it gets. It culminates in the last 6 or so episodes, in which the storytelling simply ceases to exist.  They are just a huge avalanche of shounen bullshit (that is, again, LEVEL UPs, shouting etc.) that only 11 yo kids could find interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a total of 2 possible schemes for each episodes. Both start off with Claire getting roflstomped by whatever opponent, some Terese flashbacks, and then either Claire goes Youma mode or she's saved by a stronger Claymore. Oh, make that 3 - Claire goes Youma mode and overdoses, a stronger Claymore appears and intends to whack Claire, at which point Raki appears, hugs Claire and she reverts to normal. It gets boring after a while, but there's literally nothing the writers try to surprise the viewers with. It's like watching a Rocky movie turned anime, only if it was made by first year cinematography students.  \\n\\n\r\nThere is no enjoyment to be had when watching this anime, but there's a serious risk of a critical brain shutdown. So, unless you want that, stay the hell away from it. Don't believe the high score Claymore has on MAL, remember that the masses once thought the Earth is flat - they can be wrong. They definitely are in case of Claymore.",

            "content": "Claymore is an anime made by studio Madhouse in 2007. In this anime, there are female warriors known as \"Silver-Eyed Witches\" or \"Claymores\" who fight these monsters known as Yoma. These claymores are always alienated by people as basically \"monsters that kill monsters\". This story starts off with Raki losing what's precious to him. He meets Clare, another one of our main characters.\r\nStory\r\nThe story was really weak. It started off really simple and pretty much stayed that way. Around the last 5 episodes, it felt as it was being dragged out. One of the main characters ruined this show for me. The story could havebeen better. With such a weak story, I was really bored with this anime.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nIt was really nothing special, but Claymore had some of the high-quality animation that Madhouse had to offer.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI always skipped the OP and END because it didn't really appeal to me. I didn't really care for the background music either. It didn't really do anything for Claymore. \\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nNow here is one of the reasons why the story got a 3. First off, we have Clare. She is one of these Claymores. She was hated by the people of society being a Claymore. Clare does get some development as to how and why she became a Claymore. Clare was really the only major character that seemed interesting. We also have another character named Raki. Raki was so annoying, I just wanted him to shut up. He just kept crying and crying. He was such a useless character, he didn't even do shit. Raki said that he was going to get stronger to protect Clare, but guess what? HE DOESN'T DO SHIT. He was such a crybaby. Raki really ruined this anime.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI was really bored with Claymore. I kept hearing that it was good, but I was just really disappointed. The characters and story definitely could've been better\\n\r\n2/10 \\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: 3.4/10\\n\\n\r\nClaymore is actually an underrated anime, but I believe that it's just an overrated anime that is underrated\\n\r\n^\\n\r\nSome might be confused with this statement, so let me make this clear. Claymore's anime isn't really that well known, but to the people that have seen it, all I have seen/heard is that Claymore is good. I don't really think it's good. It deserves this underrated status",

Clare the main character is very well tactical. I even love how Clare gives a full introductory through each episode, It helps you know what she goes through life as a Claymore. \r\nI love the art because it shows the event and its style very well, although the blood still being splattered around. You sort of do need to protect the  humans and keep the demons away.\r\nBy Sound so far in the Anime, Its great, swords clashing through to seewhoever is victorious in battle by last man standing or by clashing. Kind of  looks like a horror movie that your watching. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character is Clare the main character through this series, shes confident, smart, aware of her surroundings, is able to protect who matters to her most, shes not even afraid of her emotions because she looks like she drowned them away from her soul.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is just good, anyone can handle it, as long as you don't really care whats on an anime and Your just having fun,watch this.\\n\\n\r\nI'm very aware that their girls holding swords, not many guys do. I think they should do a Claymore season but for guys. \\n\\n\r\nYou'll find out more when you watch it and maybe you might be surprised on what you will see. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly I recommend this to everyone. If you like it, then keep going with your emotions. \\n\\n",

            "content": "In my opinion, I would say Claymore is one of the best series ever created. The plot line as many others say is quite cliche with its ideal of revenge however this is made up for its wonderful character development and portrayal of strong women in the anime world which is something that is not only highly refreshing but also hardly seen in the industry where \"sex sells\" in anime series of hentai, harems and any other horrid story lines that exist for mere fan service purposes. Claymore is well...a little different, in all the best ways.  \r\nStory: \r\nThe story revolves around an organizationthat creates prototype female fighting warriors called \"Claymores\" (The term given by the village folk who likely notice their choice of weapon and piercing silver eyes resembling their blades). Claymores are humans that are infused with the flesh and blood of demon like creatures known as \"Yomas\". The problem with this is the ability to lose control and become one of the Yoma's from going over their physical fighting limits in their human forms. When this happens, they are forced to be executed, otherwise they will become one of the flesh eating creatures themselves. The organization also ranks each Claymore in terms of raw and special skill from 1 to 47. In the main story, we follow the under dog, Clare down at rank 47 as she has her mind set to get revenge on an Awakened Being (Someone who was a previous Claymore but lost their humanity to their yoma instincts) who killed the first person in her life that was there to support her as more as a guardian figure before anything else. In both the manga and anime, Clare sets out to hunt down this beast, making new allies along the way that shape her to allow her raw potential to shine. Little does she know, this Awakened being is the strongest Yoma in the series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nI decided to give the art a 7 due to the \"culture shock\" per say of switching between traditional anime styles today to styles of 2002. The animation is still farily well done for being something created quite some time ago however im sure many viewers can notice the aging process of animation with claymore's art style in comparison to something like Noragami, TG, AoT, etc etc. I would say it could of been executed a little better but then again this was 2002 so I don't really have much complaints for all the other amazing components the series has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nAgain, theres two ways to view this as well. The soundtracks in Claymore are extremely EXTREMELY repetitive however it doesnt leave a bad taste in your mouth. I believe its executed at all the best times for all the right environments. Many people beg to differ however in saying that the soundtrack completely kills the anime series itself. To this I say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder when it comes to OST's. Some people will say it flows well and others will say its annoying or terrible. Really its all up to the individual. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nCharacter development is HUGE in this series, not only for mere physical/combat changes but also emotional or behavioral changes. This is something that I argue to see better in the manga then the anime but then again the anime doesn't flow with the manga so I cant do much justice for it unless people decide to give the manga a try after watching the animated series. The beauty of this series is the amount of dark subjects it hits that impacts every characters life. From sexual abuse to family killings in the characters early days, each one has a reason to change and a reason to rise up and fight past all their traumas of their early lives. They also learn to change from the characters they encounter and questions the good or bad of a person throughout the whole series. Claymores learn to collaborate and bond over their struggles, strengths and weaknesses and discover that power is not dependent on the number of people you have, but instead the quality, potential and raw skill of one's self. It is through this method that they accomplish as much as they can regardless of the ranked number assigned to one's self. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI give Claymore a 10 for enjoyment because of every refreshing turn I see within the series. For the most part there is little to no humor in the series but instead very valuable life lessons and a story of strength and determination that anything is possible if you fight hard for it. I also can't stress it enough but the outweighed female to male ratio of characters actually makes this series something equally as unique as it is a masterpiece. Their outfits aren't overly sexualized and even in scenes where sexual exposure is prevalent, they dont deal with the matter in any fan service sort of ways. Its dealt with very maturely (likely due to the setting of the scene and that it wasnt for sexual fan service purposes) but in a way where you can connect with the characters and feel something that no other series has ever shown me. As cliche as it may sound, Claymore brings a refreshing new outlook to the \"girl power\" clique in proving that women can be equally as strong as they are emotional with the ability to overcome the most traumatic and horrific of events through fighting for their lives and to protect their kind along with human beings. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nClaymore beautifully foreshadows the reality that every one of us has a \"yoma\" sort of side within us. A side that is greedy for money, selfish and pleasure seeking creatures that are determined to go to any extents whether its good or bad for our own self gratification. We live a life where we are forced to make decisions everyday and trust our sheer \"good versus bad\" ideals to counteract any situation that society throws our way. Putting such things aside, Claymore is a series I highly recommend to anyone so long as they continue with the manga which highlights everything in the anime but so much more, and executed far much better. There is reoccurring soundtracks and a particularly bland plot for revenge scenario but that aside the series brings out so much more then just that and for those reasons I give Claymore a 10.",

            "content": "When the protagonists of the show are female half-demon demon hunters who all wield swords as big as themselves how can it go wrong? Thankfully this show doesn\u2019t try and find out. Obviously enough I find the basic premise of the show appealing and I also find frenetic, bloody, supernatural arse-kicking appealing so this show would have had to work hard to piss me off. That\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t some depth here, as the series progresses more and more of the back-story of the world and the characters is filled in and it unveils a deeply layered plotline which underscores and highlightsthe basic (but eminently serviceable) revenge plot that forms the main driving force of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are appealing and their decisions and the fallout from them all add a nice layer of verisimilitude to the story being presented. The actions of the characters and the world itself is presented as a fairly \"gritty\" and often grimy place and this helps to frame the frequently gory swordplay that forms the main content of most of the shows action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nThe twenty-six episodes certainly finish off the main plotline, quite nicely in fact. But lots of plot lines are left open for further explanation and expansion. So I could certainly see room for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOne quick google later - Nnnnoooo. Ah well, it appears that the anime follows the manga perfectly up to episode 20, is a little different from 21-24 and then veers completely away from the manga in 25 & 26. The manga is still going in Japan and has yet to be licensed in English. An annoyingly common situation, if my willpower were actually existent it wouldn\u2019t be an issue because I would be fluent enough to follow the Japanese manga, unfortunately that is not the case - so it\u2019s a hunting scanlations I will go.",

At the end of the series I was wishing for more information that should have been stated about the organisation and the creation of the Claymores. The character Clare is very interesting and the best part is when the series takes you into her past. You get attached pretty quickly to Clare's personality and you are always hoping to see glimmers of love, happiness or some human spark. The end doesn't dissapoint but it leaves you wanting closure. The art is great andthe action is not shabby. The thing that really makes this series is the artwork and the way they make you peceive the environment of the Claymore world. Action includes women slicing monsters litterally in half.\\n\r\n  The general plot; an organization of powerful women run by a council of questionably powerful men speaks books of what the underlying message of this series is supposed to be about. Unfortunately the lack of detail to the plot history makes this a good series and not the potential epic series.",

            "content": "Claymore originally was a manga by Norihiro Yagi and was released as an anime in 2007. It's one of the most well known anime due to its unconventional setting and plot.\r\nStory: 8\r\n Claymore has quite an interesting and original plot. The story consendrates around Clare a female warrior of a secret organisation that serves the purpose of excincting the Yoma monsters. The atmosphere in the anime is pretty dark, maybe a little gory for some but that is one of the things that adds suspense to the show. For the first third of the show the viewer is getting used to the settings, theprotagonist's psychosynthesis and backstory, when in the second part more attention is given to the present events. The third part is the black spot of the anime for various reasons. Whereas for the rest of the show manga's guidlines were followed more or less the final episodes took a completely different and ridiculus for me turn. Everything was rushed up and the ending was pretty tucky, although the directors had made these changes with a second season in mind which i can't really underestand how would be possible since with Priscilla's death the manga could be hardly followed. If only they didn't rush to an ending the anime would be so much better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\n Claymore's art is quite characteristic. The muddy color palette, the slender characters with the sharp yet melancholic look etc. They did a pretty good job in terms of animation, although i think they overdid it a bit with the \"scenes replay\" likewise Teresa's beheading etc. Again the third and last part from the battle in the north to the volcano battle was kinda tacky and poor again, but overall the art matched the plot and the atmosphere of the anime very well when it followed manga's character's designs\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\n The anime had one of the most beautiful openings and endings in my oppinion. As for the rest of the ost i think it fitted the anime nicely although you could pretty much guess when each soundtrack would appear, for example Teressa's theme appeared when something miraculous happened or when some kind of \"savior\" appeared.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\n The good thing with this anime's characters is that even though their looks might be similar to one another each one was given a distinguish personality . There was a wide range from quiet yet wise and skilled like Irene to cold and sadistic like Ophelia. Also even though all Claymores had gone through the same experince in the organisation it's really remarkable how each one adapted this experience and how it altered each one's character in a different way. The weakest character by some may be Raki since he's a bystander and sometimes a \"burden\" to the propulsion of the story but in my opinion he's needed because he makes a really nice contrast to the naivity and immaculateness of a young human contrary to an experienced and unmercyfull Claymore. He's also the anchor that many times detered Claire from giving up the battle between her human self and her inner Yoma.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\n It was a really interesting and suspenfull anime with a variety of interesting characters  and a dark and misty atmosphere. However i can't easily overlook the ending part which kinda made all the hard work in the rest of the anime go in vain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 even though for me would be a 9 since it's one of the most intriguing and suspensefull animes.\\n",

The characters were amazing I felt there emotions from there happiness to there sadness. It was just really easy to connect with them all good or evil. \n2. Artwork: I really enjoyed it although its a bit different and maybe not everyone will agree with me on it. Its not your typicalrun of the mill art style, but it still looks beautiful. The action scenes are very well done and are a very high point in the anime. If you can get use to the art you will find yourself enjoying the anime alot more.\\n\n3.Sound: From swords clashing and melancholy tones to angelic songs this anime as it all. The music just really sets the mood for whats to come. \\n\n4. Other thoughts: The voice acting was outstanding for Japanese wish I could say the same for english. One last thing that I really enjoyed was the sense of hopelessness and despair this anime brings with it. \\n\nHopes this helps if even just a little and above all I hope you all enjoy this work of art as I did.",

However, the character design is something you get used to fast.\r\nThe music is very repetitive and even though it does suit the situationit gets old very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe motivation of every character is almost non existent except for the main characters but for an anime of this type it is enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the anime is rushed because it isn't based on the manga and because of that it does feel inconclusive (hope there is a second season in production).",

I mean, the girls die, and they die so horribly you can't help but wonder what sort of twisted, sadistic mind could ever spawn such a concept and then decide to share it with the rest of us.\r\nThere is so much violence! No, really, I just can't express how absurdlyviolent this thing is. A \"cruel\" kind of violent, I guess. For instance, you spend 5 episodes getting to know a character, her feelings, what she likes for breakfast, etc. and suddenly BOOM! She's dead, just like that.\\n\\n\r\nThen you go \"OMG WTF?!\", as though one of your closest friends had been hit by a truck. Then, after the shock, you remember the chances of things ending well were pretty close to zero, anyway. In the last few episodes, the message is something like \"abandon all hope\" - but when it is finally over, you are left with the feeling that, all in all, it's a pretty good anime, if you can handle the gore.",

It\u2019s really amazing that so few people have actually heard of the existence of Claymore.\r\nNow as much as I love this anime I still find that it does have a few drawbacks such as some of the characters seem a bit hollow and dry whereas the characters who are meant to seem hollow and dryare the ones who have the personality and dam does that kid who follows Clare around get annoying...but at least he can cook lizard.\\n\\n\r\nOk well the story line is another vengeance arc one where the person is no match for their enemy but they are still intent to try and kill them but even though it has been done before there is something truly different about Claymore something that makes you think \"dam I\u2019ve got to see the rest of this!\".\\n\\n\r\nNow even though it has its set back, let\u2019s be honest here what anime doesn\u2019t? Claymore is still a cut above the rest with numerous plot twists and turns that you would really never see coming and the battle scenes really are well done they are a notch or two above most other animes who try and go all out on their fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically this is a very appealing anime and although it might not seem like much at first I say, \"Give it a chance, it'll grow on you\" and believe me it really will.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n{{Please feel free to message me to tell me how I can/could improve my reviews to make them more helpful.}}\\n",

There are a few characters that I absolutely love, but there are also these whom I would almost skip the scene when they appear.  Just remember that, when you are getting pissedof by the little boy Raki just like I did when I watched it, watch on; since he won't be in most of the episodes anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and sound aren't especially impressive either, but they are not that bad that it affects the overall enjoyment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these, I thought Claymore is definitely worth watching just because those few episodes.

            "content": "Wow. Havn't had such an appealing anime for a long time. The whole story revolves around 'Raki', 'Clare' and her 'twin goddess - Teresa'. The claymore use their half-human and half-demon powers (yoma/youki) to fight true demons. \r\nThe suspense and enjoyment towards the end of the show was amazing, I was sitting, shaking even at the thought of what could happen next. The amount of linking and (**spoiler alert**) use of the whole flashback and Clare complex was truly awesome, and made me question the whole show from front to back, further unlocking secrets the more I thought about it.\r\nThe ending was rather strange, butthat is to be expected of an anime that continues in the manga, I would LOVE to read up on what happens when I have the time.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all.....8.8 out of 10. Rounds up to a 9 :D",

            "content": "Claymore is one of those anime that did not last long enough, the anime was more interesting when describing the past than the actual current plot line. They cut the series short just as it began to look at lot more promising.\r\nSo the story would seem sufficiently standard women with pseudo monster abilities fighting actual monsters. The plot is a little deeper than that tho, it follows a good portion of origins for the existence of these hybrids and why the main character is what she is. I actually loved the origin story portion of the series and that's where most of my ratings comefrom. I was drawn more to finding out why than actually caring about the hunt for revenge.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences are wonderfully done and i can say that having been a fan of some of the better action based anime. The characters themselves kinda look very bland tho, pasty and uniform like the species is nearly 90% supposed to be. The music was well selected for the show and it really added to the depth of atmosphere in battle i feel.\\n\\n\r\ni give claymore a solid 7, its Good and could have been Great. Hopefully they will green light a 2nd season one day. We will see, so check it out and if you find it intriguing there's always a manga to get you to the end.",

(if you watch the anime first like i did, start reading from ch59, thats where things start to change)\r\nBEFORE READING MANGA\r\nfirst thing first, i loved this anime, especially the characters. everything was done extremely well and i couldn't stop watching it, when i reached episode 22 i was had to wait a day before icould finish it and i couldn't stop thinking about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nthe first half or so was brilliant, easy to follow and very enjoyable to watch. the story behind Clare becoming a claymore was amazing and the character development in just those few episodes was possibly the best in any anime ive seen. the story starts to get crazy after about 2/3-3/4 of the way through (as a lot of animes do[can you say \"animes\"?]) and it kept reminding me of Dragon Ball Z, but it was still very good.\\n\r\ni also liked how nothing was just black and white, the further in you get the more there is to it.\\n\r\ni only gave it a 9/10 because i think everyone became a bit too powerful, this was why it reminded me of DBZ, where there power levels start out reasonable and then get ridiculous the further you get. this was no where near as bad as DBZ for that but that aspect of it was still there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nvery well done and well animated, the fast moving fight scenes where similar to DBZ where the characters arent visible, just the various explosions, but it is fast paced and flows well. the only thing i can say that wasnt that good is the delay between a sword cut and the blood splashing out, but this only minor and almost every anime with fights like this does that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nthe music was very good at all times, from fast paced rock to the slower epic music. the music always suited every scene perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\npossibly the best part of the anime was the attachment to the characters and character development, especially with the story behind Clare and most of all Teresa. usually when i get attached to characters i get sad when the show/manga ends, but i wasnt in this case, i liked the ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nenjoyed every second of it, not much else to say really. 11/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\n10/10 for sure, i liked how it started where anything could happen with the story, within the first few episodes i had already become attached to the characters and i liked how there was no black and white goal right from episode one, it was just their (Clare and Raki) journey and i couldnt predict what might happen.\\n\r\nthe goal became clear about half way through and it was exciting watching them try to achieve it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAFTER READING MANGA\\n\\n\r\nthe anime barely scratches the surface of the plot in the manga (because it finishes less than half way through), as much as i enjoyed the anime, the manga is much better when you read past where the anime finished, i really wish there would be a second season but sadly i dont think there will be, they changed the story to end the anime, but the manga continues slightly differently.\\n\r\ni said earlier that everyone got \"too powerful\" but i dont think so anymore, everything works perfectly in the manga, the way the story continues after the anime is amazing.",

Things aren't like that, they will be like this from now, cause I didn't think about itearlier!\")\\n\r\nThere's no cosequence, who will lose or win particular fight depends entirely on whim of the author just like the plot changes.\\n\\n\r\nLots of blood from the beginning quickly turns into extreme and sick voilence scenes.

            "content": "Mannnnnnn... I LOVE LOVE LOVE super dark, gory, messed up stuff and Claymore is definitely that, so I really, really wanted to like this anime and for the first third or so of it I did. But, ultimately, it's just a pretty damn bad show and has too many flaws and problems to justify its positives.\r\nArt-\r\nThe visuals in Claymore are so so I suppose. I'm not sure if this was an artistic choice or merely laziness, but the anime generally lacked color and felt drab and dreary. This may have been intentional, as this is a dark and less than happy show as an ingeneral, but it was meh to look at after a while. The art is not the biggest issue with the show by any means.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty bad overall. There were one or two themes I liked and the sound effects were pretty good, but that's where the positives end. One of the important characters has some of the absolute worst and most obnoxious voice acting I've ever seen in any anime and even reliable veterans like Brina Palencia, Caitlin Glass and Monica Rial could not save it because the writing, discussed in a later section, was abhorrent. The problem, even for these very talented and accomplished voice actresses, wasn't how the lines were delivered- it's that the lines themselves were so unbelievably cheesy and bad that NO ONE could have made them not stupid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are all complete idiots. Every single enemy in the show after the first few episodes does the least logical, dumbest possible thing in their situation. COUNTLESS TIMES enemies have the good guys in a position where they could kill them and end the fight but they stop, chit chat, hesitate, chit chat some more and basically intentionally wait for the good guys to recover and kill them. Likewise, later in the anime there is a scene where the good guys are in a battle against a mini army and the good guys are already losing. So what does the super powerful general of that army do? DISMISSES THE ENTIRE ARMY AND GOES IN TO FIGHT THE GOOD GUYS BY HIMSELF! If he were to do the blatantly obvious and logical thing- JOIN his army in battle- it's a win for sure and the good guys would be wiped out. But nope... Dismiss my troops who are already winning on their own and go in by myself. And, while I'm at it, same shit as before- I've got them in a position to kill them but instead I'm going to stop, talk, ask questions, compliment them and THEN go in for the killing blow after giving them loads of time to recover or call for backup. This happened over and over and over. None of the enemies in this show actually want to win the fight and they're mind-numbingly stupid. \\n\\n\r\nAll I'll say about the writing, in order to save you guys from another wall of text rant, is if you paid a third grade student to write the lines in the combat scenes this is what you'd get. I want you guys to take a moment to grunt/groan the word \"PRISCILLA\" in the most fake angry, drawn out, exaggerated tone possible. Also try gems like \"I'll kill you!\" and \"You will die!\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a cool concept, and I love how dark and gory it is, but it goes super off the rails and gets super convoluted not even half way through and it only gets worse from there. And again, a story is only as good as its characters and the characters and the writing are both atrocious.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI swear I wanted to like Claymore. I really, really did. It is so unapologetically dark and gory- think severed heads, characters getting full on impaled in nearly every episode, characters losing limbs, characters being cut open from the back and having gaping holes, etc- and I wish more anime were like that, but the awesomeness of that alone isn't enough to carry a show with a convoluted plot, idiotic characters and abysmal and cheesy writing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read to this point I think you know how I felt about the show...\\n\\n\r\n+Unapologetically dark and gory\\n\r\n+The Claymores themselves are badass and awesome\\n\\n\r\n-DUMBEST. CHARACTERS. EVER.\\n\r\n-Writing that is cheesy at best and downright terrible at worst\\n\r\n-Convoluted plot that goes completely off the rails in the latter half of the show\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 3\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 4",

The soundtrack is BANGIN'. It has an interesting mix of metal, bagpipes, vocals and synth but it FUCKIN' WORKS. If you just want the kickass characters fighting kickass monsters to kickass music, watch the anime. If you want an actually satisfying plot/ending, read the manga.

What i expected was a great Story...\r\nWell my Problem with this was....\r\n1. All these Flashbacks. Really every Fight that finally got me was ruined by randomly throwing thousand Flashbacks (always the same -.- into it)\r\n2. JESUS we all fking know that Claire want revenge, stop telling every sigle Episode.\r\n3. Crying.... yea DIE DIE DIE DIE is all i here in the fights....doesnt help it.\r\n4. O MY GOD she is so strong. Yea the fights are the worst part ofthis Anime. Its always the same. They tell you how strong someone is. Like this\\n\\n\r\nPerson A is so strong. Person A kills many people.... Person B gets her ass kicked and then wins --> Every Fight ever in this Anime^^\\n\\n\r\nSo well i loved the Opneing and ending though and until episode 7/8 it was really great. That was a good Flashback but then the Sotry turns... meh\\n\\n\r\nRakki is leaving, we get many informations about the \"Organisation\" but everything is so foggy.....\\n\r\nSo the Story loses many points there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that make this Anime really great and it has my respect:\\n\\n\r\nIs the character Design. They mamaged to make every Claymore unique, even though there all silver eyed and same hair etc.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall i give it a 5. Maby less DIE crying and ruining scene swaps and unnecessary flashbacks would help it a loud.... dont let me get started about the ending....",

            "content": "Claymore is pretty awful and I'm going to use this review to defend that statement.\r\nIt's unfortunate that this show was done by Madhouse because I tend to enjoy a lot of Madhouse shows. But I guess not every show a studio creates can be excellent. This happens to be one of the worst I've watched Madhouse pump out.\r\nThe aesthetic is completely bland. The story follows Clare, a Claymore. Claymores are 6 foot tall Scandanavian blonde women in this world, apparently. And they wear grey to hammer home the fact that the show is completely stuck in the doldrums. Also, there's a lot of Claymores, andgiven their design it's hard to tell them apart. Madhouse had to run through the entire gamut of hairstyles for women in this show just to differentiate them.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no character development in this show. What I learned is that there's 2 leads, Clare and Raki. They're listed as \"mains.\" This is a revenge based narrative where the female lead Claire is going after someone, but there's no time for development at all. Clare develops via various deus ex machinas throughout the series as a typical \"power-up\" for no real reason or effort put into it. She gets the power-ups on demand most of the time. This is why there's a real lack of empathy for Clare in this series. It's hard to be motivated to root for someone when they're continually fighting enemies that at first seem to be hopeless no-win scenarios just to have the hero triumph cuz of plot armor. Let's speak about Raki. He's useless. He doesn't do anything except follow Clare. If Clare is written in the active voice, then Raki would definitely have been written entirely in the passive voice. However, Claymore lacks any real depth to use any literary devices.\\n\\n\r\nThe monsters that the Claymores battle are also unimaginative generic copy pasta garbage.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty unremarkable as well. There's some Scottish bagpipes played in the earlier episodes for some unknown reason. I'm not sure how there's a link between bagpipe playing and this world other than the reason it bears the name Claymore. I guess because all the girls wield the same giant phallic worshipping swords. The tracks do switch to some heavy metal tunes later on around episode 20, but it's a little too late. the heavy metal fits the show more, but it's more of a shrug when it comes in.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the battles in Claymore are simply awful. They're the worst parts of Dragonball Z, the repeated frames. In Claymore, however, it's even worse as most characters bodies are completely stationary except for a flurry of incomprehensible garbage that's repeated over and over as she flails her sword about repeatedly.\\n\\n\r\nStay away from Claymore. Maybe the manga is better, I don't know, but this adaptation is just soul-crushing.",

            "content": "Coming halfway through the Manga\u2019s 13 year run, Claymore is at its core a revenge tale full of action and sword play with medieval aesthetics, i.e. the name of the anime, a reference to the medieval sword. \r\nOver the course of 26 episodes, we get a well paced narrative that somewhat ends with a bang and then fizzles, with lots of backstory, self discovery, and conspiracy along the way. \r\nThe art is clean enough and typical of the time. It makes the somber setting believable and adds to the overall dark tone of the show. The colors are subdued, there is lots of blood sprayingand dismembering happening in the show as well. It isn\u2019t spectacular, but it is entertaining enough. The animation is efficient and really plays well in amplifying the fight scenes. They are dynamic and pretty smooth as each action passes into the next. The high energy is put on full display and it is represented well. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much to be said of the music overall, but it is fitting and a little creepy at points. The soundtrack isn\u2019t that diverse but the music only comes in when necessary and it works to the advantage of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters are concerned, we follow Clare, but we do get to meet many more other Claymores. There is even a point in the show where 20 or so team up to take on a large group of powerful youma. We get a little background on some of the other Claymores, but that is about it. The anime never dives deep into the most of the characters so it\u2019s easy to keep track of them all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was enjoyable to watch. Rooting for Clare as she journeys along, sitting in high anticipation to see what the next foe will bring, it\u2019s engaging enough that the 26 episodes come and go like the wind. There aren\u2019t too many moving parts, and the anime has sort of a one track that we follow to the end. It\u2019s clear, concise, and gives just enough to stay on track. The plot does begin to fall apart towards the end, as it throws us into new territory with very little setup. It takes a hard left and I find myself wondering how we got to a point where there is an army of claymores fighting an army of youma, and  I will say that the ending was rather lackluster. Claymore ends in an anticlimactic fight that has no clear victor, and yet it was kind of a satisfying moment? The ending felt strange in part to being released when only half of the manga had been published. It feels like there should be a second season or something more to cap off the anime, but what they have given is more than sufficient. \\n\\n\r\nAn intriguing display with a mix between stereotypical anime elements and new ideas thrown in, Claymore is an anime fit for anyone looking for something a little darker and more mature than the bulk available for view. It is also a good choice for anyone looking for something that was released prior to the 2010\u2032s. \\n\\n",

            "content": "First of all, let me state that I absolutely love the original manga Claymore written by Norihiro Yagi. In my opinion, it's one of the best and most drilling shonen manga of our generation, with great, deep characters, a fantastic story with good twists and so on. Well, several years ago, it was decided to make an anime out of it, when 'Claymore' wasn't finished yet. Did it pay off? Hell no, it didn't. \r\n'Claymore' is, and let me underline this twice, one of the worst manga-adaptions I've ever seen, an abominable example of what can go wrong if an adaption doesn't stick to theoriginal or does focus on the wrong points. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime follows the path of the manga for a while, until it breaks on a certain point and goes for his alternative ending. The Problem is, the Story of the anime lacks impact. It doesn't manage to hit the viewer in certain scenes (Theresa, North, Riful, ...) like the manga did, instead the narration mostly feels like mediocre-fantasy. Scenes get rushed more than in the manga and some characters are even pictured differently, if not entirely weaker. And eventuelly, there are the last episodes who are all fanfiction. They're so bad and repetitive written I really got angry how terrible the sourcematerial was burned. In two or three episodes you basically get the same scene four or five times, containing the same message, a girl crying for her family for example. Also, the plot goes in circles for the last episodes, as the writters clearly didn't know how to let things end. What you get on the final is an expectable Fantasy-climax who makes no sense in the context of the original and who abandons several side-plots and important characters (Riful?). Let's just never mention them again. And of course you get lots of melodrama. The Claymore-Anime-Ending is surely one of the worst you'll see in this genre, especially if comparised to the manga. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nLlike the manga-versions, only more shallow, stupid and annoying, clares personality changed quite a bit, especially to the ending, and while awesome characters from the original at least appear (some of the great four) they quickly disappear and have no valuable point in the narration of the anime. Overall, I didn't really feel with the anime-claymores, and I would descripe them as a weaker version of their originals. And dont let me start about Raki. His character got shredded completely. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nWhile the manga-art is a bit strange at first, it gets better and better as the story goes on to the point where its unique and iconic. Unfortunately, the anime skipped that development and sticked to the strange-part. Unfortunately the second, they didn't adapt the original-art, but tried to make a style who resembles him in his strangeness but ultimately, comes out as ugly. This is just my opinion, but the art of claymore is ugly and cheap. The characters models, especially in the later parts of the story, are by far more elaborated and nicer-to-look, while the anime seems to have a kit for shallow Claymore-characters with funny-blonde hair. The awalened beaings mostly look cheapy-monstrous and are shitty colorized, the eyes dont have the sharpeness of the manga. And the mouths... aren't well-drawn at all. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack tries to be all-medieval over the times. Sometimes, it manages, most of the time it doesn't. I really think Claymore would have deserved a better soundtrack. It's such an epic story with lots of fantasy, perfectly fitting for great choirs and quick action-beats, but all you get are exchangeable low-fantasy-beats you would heard in every other anime too. The OP and ED are of course exchangeable too, nothing memorable that sticks in your head more then five minutes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\r\nhere's my honest and safe suggestion: Read the manga. It does everything better than the anime, and I mean everything. While the anime-story goes completely down at the end, the manga only starts, the characters aren't well-pictured at all and overall, the anime just feels like a experience worse than the original, forced low-fantasy where thrilling fights should take place. I cant recommend Claymore to anyone, not the anime. There wont ever be a continuation, of course, thanks to the ending. Fortunately.",

            "content": "This will be a very short review. I loved this anime so much that I waited as long as I possibly could before watching the final few episodes simply because I didn't want it to be over. My two complaints are that there just wasn't enough meat to the story itself and the ending fell a bit short. That doesn't mean that the story wasn't good, it was fantastic, I just felt that it was missing some detail that could have enhanced the overall experience greatly. Without ruining anything for anyone, the organization simply plays a backseat roll overall when it deserves to be muchmore prevalent. If that one simply part was different throughout the series, you would get the feeling of the entire world Claymore has been set in. The final episode left a bitter taste in my mouth too, leaving me wanting so much more. To me there is even enough room for them to have made this into a multiple series anime. Don't expect all of your questions to be answered at the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo after everything is said and done, I give Claymore an 8 overall and would recommend it as a must see. The only downfalls are the gaps in the story arcs and a weak ending packed more with violence and action than with answers to your questions. If a second season is made, and it would only need to be even a 6 episode OVA, I would give this anime a solid 9, maybe even a 10.",

Well first of this anime has/had alot of potential but there were some cons that ruined the show for me. the biggest annoyance of them all is the main male Raki. He is by far one of the most annoying character i have ever witness. hopefully you will see what i mean.\r\nCharacter: it had suprisingly good character development and i think that they handled it very well but its expected from a anime with 26 episodes.\r\nyou really get a feel forthe characters though some could have gotten a little more development then others.\\n\\n\r\nArt: there isnt much to say here other than this anime's art style werent that \\n\r\nbad nor was it suprisingly good but i liked it and it didnt bother me at all.\\n\\n\r\nBGM/music: i really like the music in this anime and i like that they used rock music. i think that the music fits in with the \"badass\" of the anime with that i mean the girls with big sword ready to whoop your ass at any moment.\\n\r\nthe music excels most during battles and when something unexpected happens.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I really liked the concept of the story with the yoma's (demons) and the claymore. its something i havent really seen much of nor this type of story\\n\r\nthis anime has a lot of potential for further improvement.\\n\\n\r\nso overall everything is enough on its own for me to give this an 10/10 but it really is just one thing that ruined the entire show for me or most the ending atleast but its the weak ass crybaby of main male character that some how clare (main female) dont get frustrated enough to kill him.\\n\r\nthis might be a spoiler but he doesnt do shit in this entire anime and he is just an waste of space and it could have been room for a actually good charctare.\\n\r\ni cant stretch that enough how much of a fucking annyoing little fucking pussy\\n\r\nhe is and he only cries all the fucking time\\n\\n\r\nso to sum this up if the would have gone a different way with raki's personality i would have given it a 10 but if you can look past him then you got yourself a decent anime that you could just relax and watch cause the story is easy to follow. done",

I find that one of the best characteristics of this anime.\r\nClare, the main character has a very strong and defined personality, which gives credibility to the story.

            "content": "Claymore has gotten a lot of hype as an innovative and impressive shounen, and in many ways it lives up to its reputation. The first thing you\u2019ll probably notice is the distinctly feminist tone. The Claymore are all women, but unlike most other heroines they give short thrift to gender norms. It is their identity as warriors that defines them, and their sex is so incidental that the rare stereotypically-feminine act feels forced and out of character. They\u2019re also asexual and somewhat androgynous, with no male counterparts as potential love interests and purportedly repulsive bodies. This is not Sailor Moon or the ecchi of themonth.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this downplay of gender seems clearly intentional, it is also a byproduct of the story\u2019s narrow focus and mature atmosphere. Claymore is a serious show, heavy on the action, suspense, and gore, and essentially devoid of humor or the ordinary shounen antics. This context leaves little room for things like love or gender dynamics that would detract from the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond innovation, Claymore simply excels at executing the standard shounen formula. The plot is great and highly engaging, the pacing excellent, the fantasy world vivid and immersive, and the Claymore special moves and ranks are the stuff the fanbase eats up. The series especially shines in the \u201cTeresa of the Faint Smile\u201d and \u201cAbyssal Ones\u201d arcs. The former centers on what is arguably the best character (Teresa) and features a moment that is literally a jawdropper. The latter, though incomplete, has the makings of storytelling gold and will make you definitely want to pick up the manga.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Claymore also makes ample use of the less desirable elements of the genre, and so features plenty of trite, awkward dialogue; static, uninteresting characters; and repetitious fighting that is little more than an opportunity for Clare to level up. Raki is particularly awful, a standard sidekick who cowers and whines and never manages to change despite repeated vows to the contrary. The show\u2019s greatest weakness, however, is without a doubt the ending, which rushes into the climactic final battle and finishes on an artificial, incomplete note. Not only does it depart from the manga, making the only possible sequel a Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood-style revamp, it also renders the events of the earlier episodes essentially pointless thanks to a disingenuous last minute change of heart. Really, this has to be one of the worst endings I\u2019ve seen, and Madhouse has fumbled an extremely promising story by not following the manga.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore\u2018s animation has its ups and downs. Although it uses a unique, attractive palette of neutral and earth tones and features some nice scenery shots, many scenes take place at night or in a dark forest or cave, and the series uses this as an excuse to cut corners. The fight scenes similarly rely on still frames and lazy swordplay, and although the beautiful blonde-haired, grey-eyed Claymore initially draw you in, by the end they\u2019re so numerous and uniform that they\u2019re almost impossible to tell apart. Claymore\u2018s animation is by no means bad, but the fact that Madhouse is generally revered for its productions (e.g., Death Note, The Tatami Galaxy) makes these faults all the more disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, by contrast, is pretty good, an eclectic collection of bagpipes, flutes, guitars, and minimalist synth that at times borders on experimental. Somehow this all works really well and brings to life the medieval European setting while giving the series a primal feel. A few tracks are especially beautiful (e.g., Kita no Chi to Hakugin no Ou) or original (e.g., Kakusei no Kodou). But most lack appeal outside the context of the show, and the oft-used Bishou no Teresa, which sounds like it\u2019s straight out of a Disney movie, is over the top and out of place. The opening and ending songs are great and fit the story perfectly. The same goes for the English and Japanese voice casts. On the dub, Clare, Teresa, and Riful are standouts, but Raki makes an already bad character worse, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend one cast over the other.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore deserves a lot of credit, not just because it\u2019s a generally well-done shounen, but also because it breathes fresh life into the genre with its feminist perspective and serious tone. Sadly the series falls into many of the usual traps and is mired by circumstances beyond its control, but hopefully Madhouse will pick it up again now that the manga was recently finished. In any event, Claymore delivers an enjoyable story set in a mystical world and is a pretty good watch, especially for fans of the genre.",

            "content": "--Contains some spoilers, also note that I have not read the manga--\r\nWell that was a huge dissapointment. When I first started watching Claymore I thought it was pretty cool, and it seemed like it might be really good. However it quickly becomes a huge mess that isn't worth watching. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story is your typical revenge story. The main character has lost a person she loves and is now out for blood, and that's about it. At first it seems like the story might be interesting, but there are so many things that are introduced but never properly explained. There are so many times that you'rethinking \"what the hell is that, and what the heck is going on?\". Characters are quickly introduced one episode just to be killed in the next one. The organization is never really explained either, and so many more things that the story just makes no sense and you have no idea what's going on or what's important. It's a shame, because what could have been an interesting story just becomes an incoherent mess. It feels like the production team got bored after 10 episodes and just said \"screw it, just make some filler episodes and end it\". The ending is also terrible and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is decent, not much more to say about that. It's nothing special but not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nPretty 'meh' as well. It's the same 'cling clang' sounds and the flash bomb sound from Monster Hunter played over and over in pretty much every fight. The soundtrack is your generic \"badass\" metal soundtrack which is boring as hell. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTotally uninteresting and bland as hell. There's 'short haired claymore', 'tomboy claymore', 'long haired claymore', 'pigtail claymore' etc. They have no real personality and that's because they are never properly introudced. Instead we''re just told their name and what rank they have so we know how powerful they are. You're never able to form any real connection to the characters and there's no point either since many are just killed off and never mentioned again. The main character is also boring, but the worst one is FUCKING RAKI. Holy crap did this guy piss me off. He's annoying, whiny and just pathetic. He does one good thing the entire series and spends the rest of his time crying and complaining. He's like Lin from Fist of the north star, but instead of her screaming \"KEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN\" all the time we have Raki screaming \"CLARE!!!\" while crying like a bitch. The enemies are also stupid and lame (one even being so stupid as to tell the main character what her weak spot is). \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI wanted to like Claymore, but I just can't. There are too many things that are never explained so you have no idea what's really going, and the characters are so boring and soulless. Unless all you want to do is watch 26 episodes of chicks in armor killing demons then I suggest you stay away from Claymore because that's pretty much all there is to it. \\n\\n\r\n3/10 \\n",

There are lots of question unanswered, but if they answered those, the anime would have been poo probably.  The openness was nice and congruent.\r\nThe female dominance gave the anime a new welcomed feeling.  There was some thinking similar to Death Note, not anywhere close to the amount of Death Note.  There was plenty of action and fighting etc...\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty \"in with the crowd\" and such.  Like metal hardrock stuff, which made the characters seem really dominant. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the \"bad guys\" that are supposed to lose or whatever.  The directing/writing was good here.  The enemies were made out to be really strong like all stories, but they didn't end up being the ultra poo after you learned more about them.  The story kept revealing more secrets to the enemy that made it seem like it was impossible for the \"good guys\" to win.  Which is definitely what a director wants.\\n\\n\r\nGood idea for people to watch this biz",

If you watch be prepared for very little resolution as there are only 26 episodes (where as the Manga is ongoing). The series is high fantasy. Where women imbued with the powers of Yoma (flesh eating, human possessing demons) fight against the Yoma and their, quite literal, inner demons to protect mankind.  These women (who call themselves warrorirs but whom everyone else calls Claymore) are under the thumb of the clearly shady Organization.  By far the best part of the series is the interactionsbetween the warriors as they try and navigate in a word both hostile and dependent on them, where despite their prowess they have no control over their fate. The villains sidekick and overall storyline  are fairly generic if solid. It is the ladies which shine on this one folks",

            "content": "Normally, I\u2019d try and open with something witty but not to today, this series has left me witless (thank you I\u2019ll be here all week).That\u2019s not to say the series is bad, in fact it\u2019s quite good. I just don\u2019t feel like making a witty opening\u2026 okay enough of that, time to talk about Claymore.\r\nFirst off this is only pertaining to the anime (obviously). So if some question I posed gets answered in the manga, awesome. I\u2019ll probably get around to it sometime but for now anime content only\r\nThe story is a good a place as any, so let\u2019s go with that. The story itselfis a fairly typical revenge plot interlaced with a theme of He who fights monsters. It for the most part works, moves at a nice brisk pace, and is quite enjoyable despite a few minor plot holes. However they are just that, minor, and never really killed my enjoyment. There is a really nice plot twist  around episode 9 that I found pretty clever. The story leads the cast into some fun fight scenes and those are probably where the show shines. None of the fights feel dragged out and as said they are a blast to watch. I\u2019m also pretty sure that most of the fights would make some sweet metal covers.\\n\\n\r\nThat was the good now for some bad, this dealing more with backstory. The world they live in is poorly fleshed out: towns and locales are interchangeable, their religion is mentioned but   very vague and the reason for the Yoma (read monster) is never touched upon. Again this wasn\u2019t a deal breaker for me but it could have made this world feel more alive. Also there is a tendency to throw around the phrase Yoma aura to explain away the claymore\u2019s special moves and kind of feels like a cop out to fill in minor plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to sound and art, and as usual my music expertise is that of a tone deaf panda so I\u2019ll keep that section short. The OP and ED are fine and nothing special and their accompanying animations are nice as well. The soundtrack as a whole works very well and a couple songs like Teresa\u2019s theme (or what I\u2019m calling Teresa\u2019s theme) are nice. That\u2019s all I have to say music wise so let\u2019 shift over to art.\\n\\n\r\nBetween here and the characters themselves this show succeeds and fails. First the good, the Yoma\u2019s look great. They all are terrifying, look monstrous and actually kind of scared me. They all do tend to rely on more tendrils as they change to a more powerful form but the upgraded forms to looks impressive especially the ones in the final arc. The fights flow beautifully with speed and grace and are very fun to see. The world itself while somewhat bland works and the locales do look nice, but it\u2019s typical fantasy fare.\\n\\n\r\nThe Claymores are where the show kind of trips up. They all have a similar look to them and often times I keep confusing one claymore for another. Hell until one character said her name I thought we were following a different claymore. Luckily the main character Clare is distinctive enough that she was never easily lost .That being said the designs while  somewhat similar are still very nice and do invoke a kind of cold beauty that the claymores command. I\u2019ll make a side note to mention that the eyes for the Claymore and Yoma are great. I know it sounds weird but they really look cool. I\u2019ll also side note my side note to say that on occasion you\u2019ll get a shot of a serious scene and Clare or someone will have a goofy grin or comically bugged eyes. It\u2019s really disconcerting but is very rare.\\n\\n\r\nNow it\u2019s time for part 2 of fail/succeeds, this time with the characters. We\u2019ll start with the leads Clare and Raki. Clare is beautifully fleshed out in a four episode arc detailing her motivations, which is good because her motivations are what drive the series. She is interesting and you feel sorry for her and want her to succeed in her goal. She grows throughout the series and has a decent closure to her past. Raki while not getting the whole backstory arc is not completely without character development but there is very little past episode 13.He was an okay character but they made good call by downplaying him and not making him a object for Clare to rescue. \\n\\n\r\nWhere they drop the ball is the main \u201cvillain\u201d, Pricilla, who while getting a decent backstory, serves no real role besides being a counterpoint to Clare. She shows up in the flashback arc and then serves as a passive aggressive threat, not showing up till near the end. Which is sad because when she does show up she\u2019s portrayed as a tragic victim driven by her own blind morality, not even aware she has become what she despises. Obsessed with getting revenge on a person who\u2019s dead to cope with the horrid past. As you can tell I like this character, and I would gladly watch a spinoff of her child hood and what she was doing in the years between her awakening and the series\u2019 final battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe other villains while mildly interesting (Ophelia especially) are not that well expanded upon. The same goes for the supporting cast, who are really one note but enjoyable. They interact well, all are fairly sympathetic and to spark me to actually want to learn more about them.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s time to wrap this up. My Final thoughts: A decent fantasy show with a good plot and enjoyable characters. Ultimately brought down by its lack of depth. You could do worse but you could also do better. I'd check it out before laying down some cash for it. \\n",

All and all it has everything really. Mostly action but it has a little of everything as well. \r\nArt~ The colors. The creatures. The characters. All well drawn. Very realistic in a sense. No abnormally huge breasted women like most anime/manga. That gets annoyingafter awhile. Lol.\\n\r\nSound~ Beautiful classic music in this anime.

As soon as I started this anime I watched it everyday til I was finished it. I finished within 3 days. \\n\r\nOverall~Amazing. Everything fits perfectly together. Only thing I disliked was the ending. They should of added more detail to it. But, I wasn't surprised. they do that with a lot of anime. Hope this review helped. :3",

With a unique skill-set that makes her and other members both capable of taking on these foes and shunned by regular humans, the stage is set for visceral violence in a gritty medieval setting.\r\nI found the story much like a mildly thrilling roller coaster;  at several intervals, I saw drops that should have sent me reeling. Instead I ended up a little elated, and then bored. Understanding that this strikes me as \"moreto the manga\" material, nonetheless I felt little closure by the ending, and very little connection to the setting.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was good, with the battles clearly framed as to not be confusing. No remarkable instances of the series really helped on hindered. \\n\\n\r\nSeveral of the dub actors came across as exceptionally annoying, which is sad because they've done excellent work in other series. The sub was easier on the ears. Otherwise nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, with a few exceptions, felt rather unrealized and generic. Claire and a few of her compatriots supplied the only depth in terms of character, and I still didn't feel much attachment or genuine interest. \\n\\n\r\nEspecially near the end of the series I was having difficulty paying attention. The first plot-arc was interesting, but afterwards I felt more obligated to finish the series just to see where a few characters turned up in the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a mildly interesting series that's competently made. I wasn't challenged or engrossed, but neither did I find it intolerable.",

Through her jorney, accompany by this really stupid boy that you just have to put with him (cause he is necessary to the story line), you realise her past (Claymore get's really awesome after episode 8), the reason why she is whatshe is and the friends and enemies that she does along the way. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing, at the beginning they may all (the claymore's) seem very similar to you, but by the end of the first episodes you can distinguish every character.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard and fits perfectly with every scene, I serously advice everyone to have that ost.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the best feature of this anime, you'll have those you hate and those you love but it will be impossible for you to deny that every and each one of those characters don't have a major role on the plot line. The character development is something beyond imagination, with it's twists and turns (the first twist will put you completely hooked on the anime) you get amazed with the strong will of some characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I have to say that this anime is really good (I already watched ten times) but it's not all good. The end sucks, it's the most horrible thing I ever saw in my entire life and it totally kills the mood of the anime but it's worth watching, just think of the end as a filler and right after watching every episode go read the manga (cause it's even better that the anime).",

The art is just breath taking and it makes it feel like the anime is actually coming alive. The sound and the voice acting is great. The characters are so complex and they show a lot of emotion in all of the scenes. They are also very specific in the makings of how they want the characters to be. My enjoyment level was a 10 because it made me feel like I was actually in the anime. The overall scoreI have for it is 10, but if you can't see the sight of blood or anything gruesome like that, I would not recommend this anime to you.",

            "content": "Before i start this review i would be so down to see a crossover between Claymore and Hellsing!!Alright,now on to the review.Also all my reviews will be SPOILER FREE!\r\n- Claymore is an action anime where the you have claymores(half demon /half human hybrid) vs the yoma(Shape shifting Demons).This anime is dark,gritty and gory and can also be disturbing at times.The action is awesome,along with well paced story and soundtrack.Also certain anime that have 26eps will try to divide the season into two,but to me it felt like one coherent season of action,magic and hardcore brutality.FINISH HIM!\r\n- Claymore also have a wide variety of characters whohave very complex characterizations and you would go like \"oh i see that happening\". The main protagonist Claire is been shown as more powerful than she ranks..but the show stealer here is Teresa!Not only shes a badass but she is a very emotional and a sentimental person and her relationship with clare is one of the best things about this show.Also another main character in the show is raki who i thought was alright but he was used most of the times like a plot device.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n1. Clare & Teresa's relationship and the character arc of Teresa's throughout the show.\\n\r\n2. The action is great and art along with it is like icing on the cake\\n\r\n3. 2 characters named Irene and Jean (won't spoil)\\n\r\n4. Raki's character becomes really good towards the end of the season\\n\r\n5. Even if it is action heavy it also has some emotional moments :'(\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n1. Raki to me felt was used more as a plot device for the most part but hey its just me\\n\r\n2. The main villain's arc is kind of dragged a bit and doesn't hit all notes towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE : 9.6 ==> 10\\n\\n\r\nThank you :)\\n\\n\\n",

Nevertheless it is highly enjoyable and the story unfolds well throughout the episodes.\r\nOne of the thing that makes a great anime is the progressive unfolding of the world concept especially in fantasy and sci-fic  genres. Claymore does this very well and there are still stones being unturned throughout the series. It is definitely worth watching and I found myself glued to run a 12-episode marathon a night after work.\r\nThe thing that pisses me off is Rika who is unbelievably annoying with his stubborn chivalrous behavior. Such a useless character whose role is tomake the protagonist vulnerable. Just wish some yoma would have devoured him in the early episodes hahaha.\\n\\n\r\nFor a fantasy anime, there are a lot of novel concepts so it deserves a lot of merit on originality. Each episodes has good pace that I did not feel bored. No lengthy fight scenes (like in One Piece where a boss fight can last 10 episodes) or multiple sub-plots. It is straightforward thus gives a pleasant experience to viewers. Oh ya, unlike some other series, this is NOT a monster-of-the-week kind of thing. The story is great.",

            "content": "Claymore is an odd series. It follows a half human, half yoma named Clare. Yoma are humanoid creatures that feed on and disguise themselves as humans. Half breeds like Clare, called Claymores, were created by a shady group called The Organization to give humanity a fighting chance against the yoma.\r\nI call it an odd series mostly due to its presentation. Claymore starts out from the perspective of Raki, a young boy whose family is killed by a yoma, then starts following Clare after she saves Raki and the two start traveling together, becomes a prequel a third of the way into the series, and thenreturns to following Clare, ultimately leading up to an ending that provided no closure. Despite all of the lead character swapping, though, I never got lost or confused; the series was straight forward throughout. \\n\\n\r\nThere in lies one of the problems I had with the series, though. The story was predictable and shallow, and a lot of the characters felt like devices moving the plot along, rather than characters. The ending of the series was disappointing, because it provided no closure, and sets up for a sequel series (which I don't think anyone is even thinking about working on). This is unsurprising, since the anime was produced while the manga was still going, but it strikes me as odd that the series would end as it did, because the ending of the series is different from what was going on in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in the series are enjoyable, when they're being characters, and the voice acting is fairly well done throughout. There are a couple of weird line readings here and there, but for the most part, most of it is done well enough to be preferable to reading the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design and overall aesthetic for the series is well done. There's a nice contrast between the Claymores' uniforms and the grotesque design of yoma. The characters and environments look vibrant, and action scenes, even while a ton of things are happening, never become cluttered or messy. If nothing else, Claymore succeeds at giving the audience something pleasing to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack does a good job of setting the mood for each scene, but none of the tracks are particularly memorable. I suppose it does what it needs to do, and I can't really fault the series for that, although there were a few times that certain tracks would cue at odd times.\\n\\n\r\nClaymore is an enjoyable series, with some great action scenes, and although it's not without its faults, I still wanted more of it when I was done. I'm probably going to move on from it pretty quickly, but I enjoyed the time I spent watching it. It's a fun ride while it lasts, but isn't really spectacular or memorable.",

            "content": "This being my SECOND review, I decided to take down some notes about what I liked and didn't like as I watch this anime..... in little over 4 days. :() I need to get out more. Anyway, Claymore is an high speed action anime with a more mature audience in mind. It has an overall dark theme in terms of this anime's universe and the laws and practices that take place within it. The most darkness of this anime is centered around the Claymore Organization, named for it's powerful female warriors who carry large swords. It is their job to slay demons called Yoki, whofeed on humans while disguising themselves amongst the humans. The Claymore, being half Yoki and half Human, are the only ones who can spot them and remove them. This is the story of one Claymore and her quest for revenge. You know, the typical dark anime plot. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the basic summery is out of the way, I can get to the review part of the freaking review. When I first started this anime, the first thing that hit me was the stunning art style of the world in it's characters. The art style favored a more realistic approach to the environment and the fine details of the people. Although I found it quite odd that people's noses suddenly vanished when viewed from the front, kind of like one of those perspective puzzle things. It makes sense that the art style was done this way, and it would just look un-even (is the word i choose to use) if it had the typical HUGE irises, cutesy type style that you see normally. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the story was a rather typical one, \"OMG I gotta kill this bitch, for the sake of love\" and \"your turning into the thing you hate most\" (you know.... typical), the lore was very well developed, with details of the inner workings of the Claymore organization being explained in detail by the second episode. Now this is the part where I admit I made a huge mistake that made me feel like an idiot. There is a point early on that I thought was continuing the given story but just from another characters point of view, when it turned out to be a flashback on the main character. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE INDICATION THAT WAS HAPPENING, besides the fact that two different looking characters had the same name.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest things about this anime was it's characters. The motivations for each major character were laid out early on, creating the feel that you supported them on their journey to achieve their goals. However, the characters were also probably the greatest weakness to this anime as well. Why do you ask? THERE'S SO FREAKING MANY!!! It seems to me that the Claymore's could have really done with a proper hair stylist amongst them (i'm a guy, WTF am i saying!?) because they all looked pretty much the same. They all had blonde/gray hair, with either bowl shaped or long wavy hair, wore identical armor, and all used the same goddam sword. I understand the anime is called Claymore for a reason, but can we at least get some variety going around.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also a habit in this anime of introducing a minor character, throwing in a few details to simulate character development, and than just killing them off (usually by removing limbs or being cut in half, and there is A LOT of that in this anime). You can't just do that and expect us to care about them when they die. As viewers, we care about the characters we have committed to the whole time, and feel a sense of emptiness when they die.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's flaws, as an action anime goes, it does it's job very well. It keeps the action sequences going while still making every battle feel fresh and different from the last. They are fun to watch, and fun to listen to as well because nothing makes a person look more badass when killing shit than heavy rock music! Overall, I give Claymore a 7/10. MY GOD RAKI's VOICE WAS GOD DAMN ANNOYING. AND STOP CRYING YOU BIG BABY!",

            "content": "Claymore is an exciting, action-packed show with a well thought out premise. The artwork and character designs are beautiful. However, it suffers from many of the small ailments that plague shonen titles of its breed, and while the story is an interesting twist on the gothic sword and sorcery motif, it\ufffds not exactly breaking new ground.\r\nFirst the animation; it is actually pretty decent for a television series, but once again, good action shows (see works by Sunrise such as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo), don\ufffdt skimp on the fight scenes.\r\nClaymore is not so far gone as the black screen with a silver flash of lightto depict a sword duel, but it does make judicious use of still shots and pans layered with gratuitous blood spraying in order to save on animation frames.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this lack of animation in many of the fight scenes, the artwork makes up quite a bit of the slack. I especially enjoyed the creative character designs (hooray for anime heroines that don\ufffdt look like they are twelve years old!). It\ufffds difficult to make distinctions between a group of characters that all share the exact same hair and eye color, but the distinctive faces, hairstyles and sometimes even poses the characters adopt become so familiar that it\ufffds easy to pick your favorite claymore out of the crowd. The backgrounds and other small effects within the scenes are also extremely well rendered. It\ufffds obvious that Claymore used a lot of CG in its production, but the compositing is nearly flawless.\\n\\n\r\nFemale demon hunters have been a staple of Japanese pop-literature for decades now, but the writer for Claymore has managed to put an interesting twist on the premise. Being half-yoma themselves creates endless opportunities for drama and conflict within the story. Indeed, the very crux of the plot is how the various claymores, especially Clare, deal with this condition. It\ufffds the one aspect of the show that keeps it fresh in an otherwise stock shonen-action wrapper.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Claymore still has its little foibles. It suffers in a way from what I call Kenshin Syndrome, wherein the hero or heroine feels compelled in the middle of a pitched battle to stop and wax philosophic on the nature of life, the universe and this week\ufffds special attack. While not as egregiously bad for this as the show for which the condition was named, or others like Tokyo Underground, Ranma \ufffd or Dragonball (choose your flavor), the characters do often segue into long discussions of Yoki, special powers and life in general. I like detail in my shows, but could it please wait until after the bad guy is dead?\\n\\n\r\nClaymore also has the habit of drawing big fights out into many episodes. While I understand that this is good business for animation companies that want to get the most out of a manga license, it\ufffds still annoying to have one battle, with one bad guy, stretch out for three or more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Claymore is a solid show in its genre, with plenty of action, nice artwork, and an interesting story. It\ufffds not the best show in its category, but fans of sword and sorcery won\ufffdt be disappointed and even those who prefer sci-fi or drama might be interested in checking this one out.",

            "content": "Claymore, as a 26-episode anime series, only tells part of the story of Clare and the Yoma (demons) she fights. The last three or four episodes depart from the manga so as to give the series as a conclusive ending, rather than leaving a cliffhanger. Even so, the story does leave open the possibility of a new anime series, one which can follow the manga's course. The manga is published once every month, meaning 12 issues a year, so it has taken a while for the author, Nohihiro Yagi, to write everything out. As opposed to popular shounen series like Naruto and Bleach, Claymore's storyreflects a more thoughtful development that is only possible when more time is spent considering where the story should move to next.\\n\\n\r\nClare is a young-looking female warrior called a Claymore. Claymores are half-human, half-Yoma warriors tasked with slaying Yoma and their more powerful counterparts, Awakened Beings. While utilizing the Yoma's power to fight, the Claymores fall in danger of transforming into the very demons they seek to kill. The characters are always walking a tightrope act of drawing enough strength to win battles while not transforming at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched the series twice now, and I found it far more enjoyable the second time around. There's a lot depth in the series that isn't really evident unless you follow the manga's events after the series. Hopefully, a new anime series will be produced because the story is by no means complete here.",

            "content": "When it comes to anime, I tend to look toward action-based series with a cautious eye. Too often, it seems, writers for action series take the easy route and fill them with paper-thin characters and nonexistent stories. Entertaining at times, perhaps, but entertainment at its most basic. Which is why, when I first read up about Claymore, and found that the series was essentially described as \"girl that wield giant swords fight monsters,\" I was not enthusiastic. \"Oh great,\" I remember thinking, \"this is going to be another giant mess of incessant and needless fight scenes with no plot and too much fan-service.\"\r\nFortunately, I amhappy to inform you that I was utterly and completely wrong.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the setting of Claymore isn't particularly unique: In a fantasy world modeled on - what else? - medieval Europe, an organization consisting almost entirely of tall, blond, female warriors who wield large Claymores hunt down demonic creatures known as \"yoma\" to protect humans. Well, okay. The group of protagonists being comprised almost entirely by tall blond women isn't very common, especially in a shonen series, but still; this is essentially a \"good guys versus demons\" show, and it would be an understatement to say \"that's been done before.\" So what's so special about this one?\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important element that sets Claymore apart from the rest is its intensely character-driven story. Whereas many action shows shove character development to the wayside to make room for... well, more action, the characters in Claymore are at the forefront of everything; they drive the action. Because the story flows out of the decisions of the characters, there is a clear sense that actions do have consequences - something that's oddly lacking in many other shows. So don't expect an abundance of deus ex machina devices to bail the characters out of their bad decisions. This makes it much harder to predict the outcome of fights, because there are few characters you can easily bet on just because the plot dictates that they can't die.\\n\\n\r\nThe dark themes of the setting also provide plenty of opportunities for character development. The secret behind the Claymores (the name given to the blade-wielding women by everyone else in this fantasy world, due to the swords they carry) is that yoma flesh has been implanted into their bodies in order to enhance their abilities. This comes at the cost of constantly having to battle against their yoma side, lest they \"awaken\" and become the very thing they despise. Additionally, those responsible for the creation and administration of the Claymores view them as completely expendable, quickly creating friction between the organization and its own foot-soldiers.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the story starts to drag near the end, as the fights take longer and longer and become increasingly over-the-top. This would be less of a problem if the ending made up for it, but Claymore is sadly lacking in that area as well. Like many anime series, Claymore is based on a serialized manga series. And like many such anime series, the anime version of Claymore began production while the manga was still unfinished - in fact, the Claymore manga is still ongoing as of this writing. Suffice it to say, Claymore ends on a cliffhanger, leaving major plot threads hanging.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that the ending is handled badly. In fact, for a series that is dedicated to following the manga's plot, the ending of Claymore is handled quite well. It ends at a logical point, at the climax of a major story arc, rather than in the middle of an arc like other series I could name. And it does tie up a number (but certainly not all) of the major and minor plot threads. Still, it was a disappointment to see the otherwise excellent series end without a true conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is outstanding, with fluid fight scenes and crisp animation. Still, there was one issue I found with the art, and it really has more to do with character design rather than the art itself: Every Claymore has blond hair, silver eyes, and wears an identical outfit. Now think about the amount of facial detail you tend to get with the typical anime art-style and you'll begin to see why this could be a problem. It doesn't really rear its head for most of the series, however, in the last few episodes there are two dozen Claymores gathered at one place for a major confrontation, and nearly every scene just devolves into a guessing game.",

            "content": "Story: 8\r\nArt: 9\r\nSound: 9\r\nCharacters: 8 (-2 b/c Raki)\r\n  Claymore never really felt like \"just another shounen\" to me. It kept me thoroughly engaged throughout the series, I don't think I stopped watching it except to eat/sleep/shit (watched it in one weekend).\r\n  The story was pretty good, but nothing particularly special. The world is plagued by human-eating demons called Yoma. Basically the main character, Clare, is from an organization that is actually called \"The Organization\" (lol) that creates extremely powerful \"hybrid\" beings called Claymores. They are part yoma, and all of them posses superhuman speed, strength, and a level of perception that allowsthem to even predict enemy attacks. The rest is in the sypnopsis. There are some pretty good plot twists, and also some fairly predictable ones. Most characters had family eaten by yoma, and are fighting against all odds. Nothing new to the genre there, but at least they do the cliche well. Lots of action, that's really the main staple of this show. If you want a particularly well written and enthralling story, I might recommend something other than this. The action is what this show is all about, and it does excellent in that regard. Fight scenes are as numerous as they are just badass. The romance is near non existent, there is only one \"love\" scene but it's so abrupt and out of place that it almost feels like a hallucination by the main character. But everything else is riveting, not much to complain about as it was good enough to keep me hooked to the show. I wish Raki had gotten eaten his entrails eaten by yoma in the first episode, but more on that later.  \\n\\n\r\n  The art was quite good. I dunno why some of the others complain about it (its a matter of opinion I s'pose) but the show looks pretty snazzy. The way the Claymores' eyes shift to gold when its ass whooping time, how sword strikes look even at break neck speeds, there are a lot of unique art related quirks to this show and they all contribute to the enjoyment of the show. Only 2 complaints here: that blood is pretty generic in this (which sucks considering blood is spilled every 2 minutes), and Raki's face. Seriously, I was begging Clare to chop it off the whole show. The biggest plus for me is that the \"still image\" scenes are kept to a minimum, and they are only used to represent a time lapse while the characters are unable to kill an opponent. This is big plus for me because after watching berserk, I was sick of watching a picture for 15 seconds with background generic war sounds, like 4 times per episode.\\n\\n\r\n  The fight scene sounds are really good, keeping immersion levels high. This show also has one of my favorite sound tracks in any anime, only behind Death Note. The opening song is badass. The \"star wars\" blaster sound that occurs when Claymores release their yoma power is seriously annoying, but it doesn't happen every episode. And the sound of Raki bitching in EVERY scene he is present in is incredibly frustrating. Too bad shock collars hadn't been invented yet in the show, although someone will probably figure out how to make one just for Raki. \\n\\n\r\n  Now the characters are unique because... well they are all women. Hot. Really though, how many shows have nearly all the main characters as whoopass woman characters? That is one of the things that makes Claymore what it is. And as for the individual characters, they are *mostly* good. Clare has an interesting backstory story,  with a sligtly cliche \"OMG YEH KILLED MY MENTOR! I KEEL YUH!!!\" revenge plot. Still so, they pulled it off great. I was left with a lasting impression when the show ended. There are a few other interested characters that the story focused on, with equally interesting back stories. But there are also a lot of characters who are breifly introduced, then proceed to die for some stupid reason that is always their own fault. Which is very relevant to the kind of harsh world they live in: win a fight, get stronger, when more fights. Lose a fight, die, get eaten by yoma. And occasionally: lose a fight, can't handle that fact that you suck, release all your hatred and turn into an awakened, then murder the person who beat you *glares at Priscilla*. Oh... then there is Raki. Good god, I have never seen a character that did such a good job at contributing nothing to a story line. Clare finds Raki in the first episode, and from then on he proves himself the whiniest little punk the anime community has ever seen. Literally he only does 2 things the entire show: almost get Clare killed, and cry. The authors wanted him to be a plot device but failed miserably. Clare is supposed to see something in Raki's situation that reminds her of the way her mentor, Theresa, saw her when she was found basically as a broken child. But the connection is only vaguely established in the show, and it does not even come close to making up for the fact that he is a shit for brains. Every time Clare asks him to fuck off so she can take care of a Yoma pack without being hindered by him, he not only argues with her.  Then he usually agrees to stay behind only to then sneak behind her anyways, wandering into combat then forcing her to have to rescue him. Failing to establish a proper emotional bond between Clare and Raki holds the story back from what it could be.\\n\\n\r\n  Its got some quirks, but Claymore was maximally entertaining for 90% of its duration. Although I did manage a rather hefty rant on Raki, in reality I busted up laughing every time he spoke, cried, and almost got Clare killed. Because he is seriously such a dip shit.",

It's basically a return to the ultimately stupid \"Battle of the Sexes.\"\r\nIn an era where we're all suppose to come together and put our best out; regardless of sex, color, creed, et al; it always seems to be Japan's anime and otaku industries (and the people they cater to) that want to throw monkey wrenches into the engines of progress.\r\nBut hey.  That's just my personal opinion.\r\nI thought it would be better if it wasn't just women being Claymores.  I wished that some more\"gender equality\" (as oppose to some \"gender war\") would take place.  I didn't like how the anime excluded the manga part where Raki became what he became and was capable of taking down low-level Yoma...\\n\\n\r\nBut that, sadly, is how people want for it to go, I guess...",

The writers evidently decided it'd be a good idea to try and be edgy and cool, and essentially create drama and character emotions out of thin air, that go against their ideals and everything that has been set up in the story beforehand. \r\nThat's where Raki comes in. His parents were killed by Yoma, he was saved by Clare. He's Human, and Priscilla is a Awakened Being monster, and Raki finds her eating the guts of a women while traveling with here and Easly. For some reason though,the writers decided that they could just make Raki okay with Priscilla being a Yoma monster and eating peoples guts. Like really? Like for FUCK SAKE REALLY? Yeah totally, im sure a human boy who had his parents killed by yoma, and who loves clare and her job is to kill yoma for humans, would totally just accept that and not run away from her, or try and kill her. Then Later in the final battle scene when Clare is going to finally kill Priscilla and get revenge for her killing Teresa, which the whole fucking show was based off, little faggot Raki steps in between and says a lot sentimental bullshit to save Priscilla and stop clare, and all the shit he says is stuff he would never in a fucking millions years be saying ever. EVER. like seriously you make one of the main characters have feelings for the enemy? and if that wasn't bad enough, clare decides she is going to kill her regardless that Raki is telling her to stop, and THEN, FUCKING THEN the writers throw another stupid plot twist in, Jeane sacrifices herself so clare doesn't kill Priscilla and possibly awaken. like fuck you again writers, the while fucking point of the show was for Clare to get revenge and you don't let that, and at the same time you managae to royally fucking up everything. \\n\\n\\n\r\nlike seriously i really liked this show, and the last episodes completely ruined it all for me. fuck you writers you fucking wannabe controversial faggots.",

            "content": "Claymore, by far, is one of the best anime I have seen. It is merely my second time watching it, and it doesn't cease to leave me in awe at the edge of my chair. This kind of anime makes you want to raise the volume to the maximum. The manga is also outstanding, and I have yet to finish reading it. I don't like revealing any details, but all I can say is that even the Claymores have hearts, despite the fact that some of them are very comparable to monsters. I'll describe it in a simple manner. Yoma are monsters that eat theguts of humans. Claymores are half-human, half-yoma that kill Yoma. Clare is the main character that has Raki as her companion, much like she was a companion to another Claymore. For that other Claymore is the reason why she is a Claymore. I have to say, I like the story, very unique; art, very graphic (especially for you guys). Sound is very good, with cool music that fits the action taking place, which can only make you cling onto the anime even more, as well as the opening and ending songs. Characters are also good, none of them lack history; meaning they all have reasons for being Claymores. Enjoyment, was very high. I would always yell out something like \"D*MN!\" when watching how powerful and cool the Claymores are, and beautiful at the same time. Overall, it was no wonder that I wanted to watch it again. I have friends in real life that are obsessed with Claymore and love it; it's no surprise. I highly recommend this if you want something with bloody action, monsters, supernatural beings, and middle age themes. That's all for this review, I hoped you enjoyed reading it, and can hopefully watch Claymore.",

The story line actualy begins rather strange, so u might not understand it at first, but that will change in a few more episodes. \r\nClare (the main character) and her acompany Raki and their love story... NOT. I wont spoil the anime for you guys, but be sure that the plot is more then unique. The beautiful moments of joy and understanding of ones heart, the cure to us all, a singe hug...What i enjoyed the most is the emotion of danger all the time.The feeling of joy,sadness,thefeeling that never left me and i searched everywhere for that kind of anime,but i never found one... It is not the usual type of shounen anime: The main character defeats all when she snaps. If you are a lover of superpowers and demons this is the best place to be. The fights are intens , the characters are extreamly \"cool\" , overall its the best fight anime ever. Why? Well its actualy rather strange that the main characters are only girls and they are on the \"good\" side ,but the bad boys are EVIL and let me tell you they are STRONG, dont be fooled, the girls here are extraordinary STRONG.  The weak characters here, or should i say one weak character is RAKI...the audience will learn a different meaning of both words weak and strong!  I cant say anything more, i cant discribe it , i can only wish to forget it and rewatch it again and again and again..\\n\\n\r\nExcuse my wroten english i was never good at writing :P",

Right from the beginning you are treated to sword-swinging demon-slaying eye candy that hits it right on the spot for action, violence, and plenty of gratuitous blood spewing. The story follows a stereotypical plot line: Strong, beautiful, and skilled warrior finds clingy love-seeking companion, they travel together, and slay demons. However this is misleading, because after a few episodes you discover what you thought was this total badass warrior is really just the runt of the litter, and you start diving into her back story that really sucks you in emotionally andyou suddenly gain a new worldview of the series that's completely different than how you perceived it in the beginning. From there on out, it's a roller coaster of fighting, survival, and self-discovery, and I felt myself many times feeling genuinely sorry for these people and rooting them on.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a wonderful story, and you don't have to wait until the end of the series to become emotionally attached to the characters (which is a quality I enjoy).\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely recommended.",

I found a particular fondness for the characters, especially Teresa of the Faint Smile.\r\nThe soundtrack featured with this anime is simply outstanding.  I personally took the time to hunt it down on Amazon, which is not like me at all.  Every moment is amplified with a low, brooding tone or a tribalistic song to complement the beastly nature of the true beasts within each and every Claymore.\r\nThe art of each scene was also well-done, as well as the characters themselves.Over time, however, every village seemed to be the same and each character varied only in minute facial features and a different haircut.  This was to be expected, given the story behind the Claymores, but even an oddball like the one featured in the manga, Clarice, would have been a pleasant change of pace.\\n\\n\r\nMy only true irk with the series is also one of its saving graces.  The anime ends in such a fashion that it could never be continued and remain true to the manga.  It saddens me that the such a series cannot find its way back onto my television easily, but I'm also glad that the anime viewers received a satisfactory, if not somewhat melancholy ending.",

            "content": "Claymore was a pretty good anime overall. It had a lot of action, blood, disembodied limbs-pretty much all you ever want in an action shonen anime. \r\nStory (8): The story is pretty simple and very interesting. In a world that has been taken over by man-eating demons, called Yoma (I believe-I haven't seen this anime in 2-3 years), only the Claymore, people half-human, half-Yoma, have the ability to stop and kill them before they kill others. \r\nArt (10): Seriously, really phenomenal artwork. The battles look extremely epic and cool.\r\nSound (8): The music is just right for every scene.\r\nCharacter (9): Clare, the main character, has suchdepth. She's out for revenge and you can really see why and root for her. The other Claymores are also really awesome. The only character I have a problem with is Raki, who doesn't really do much, but overall, the characters are great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): When is blood, gore, and monster-slaying NOT enjoyable?\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9): This is a really fun, action-packed anime and is totally worth watching.",
