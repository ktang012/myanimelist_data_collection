            "content": "Are you a socially awkward otaku who doesn\u2019t understand why mean 3D ladies don\u2019t want your very eligible d? Sick and tired of the Real Girls and 2D waifus are all you need in your laifu? Then oh boy, do I have the perfect anime for you because I sure as hell don\u2019t want it. \r\n3D Kanojo: Real Girl is a painful experience. A lazily shat out romcom that uses cliches and plot contrivances as a crutch to hobble its way through twelve agonizing episodes. Proudly it presents insultingly stereotypical characters that are anything but three dimensional.  \r\nAll you need to do is gazeupon this glorious shitfest and it becomes abundantly clear what the show\u2019s main issue is: it\u2019s fucking hideous. The art is a disaster; backgrounds are a mess of fuzzy colors, there\u2019s very little animation, and in an attempt to stay on model the characters hardly change their expressions. All the show has going for its visuals are the character designs, and even those are just the same faces mediocrely drawn and in worsening quality as the show progresses. \\n\\n\r\nThe love interest, Iroha, has one expression for the majority of the show, pouty sad girl, the main character Tsutsui is more expressive which also means more frequently off model. From time to time you\u2019ll see characters slide across the frame on motion tweens with no animation whatsoever, making it seem like they go to a school for ghosts. And that's the closest the show came to making me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nStiff character animation is partly to blame for the lazy comedy, but also the directing is so slowly paced that even if the dialogue was good (which it isn\u2019t) there wouldn\u2019t be much to enjoy. Awkward doesn't even begin to describe how the dialogue feels, it's clumsy in a way that\u2019s too unnatural to be believable and too poorly timed to hit with any impact. Sharing some of the blame is the monotonous elevator music that adds nothing but a headache to any scene it's present in. \\n\\n\r\nThe moment the opening song starts playing I feel like I\u2019m about to have a stroke, the level of cringiness in the visuals with the depressed singing voice. The singer sounds so downtrodden like he\u2019s about to end his life, I instinctively zip straight over to the mute button so I don\u2019t have to contemplate the void while watching 3D fucking Kanojo. The rest of the soundtrack gives me the sensation of my brain slowly swelling from the aneurysm the droning music gives me. Repetitive looping of the same song with only two piano keys during dramatic scenes, slowly putting more pressure on my skull until I relieve it by turning the volume off. Do you like the sound of printers on repeat? Well, check out the sick beats on these action scenes because these swooshes and boops will knock your socks off. This exceeds all bounds of low budgeting, it\u2019s just plain and simply lazily made. \\n\\n\r\n3D Kanojo falls flat on its face as a comedy, but there\u2019s still room for resonant drama (spoiler alert it\u2019s a cringy disaster too). A story about two emotionally damaged people sorting through their feelings together is an alluring premise, and with a better writer, it could have been good. It\u2019s not fundamentally flawed, it\u2019s just terribly executed. The characterization relies heavily on cliches, and the character-driven story uses only contrivances to progress. Rarely does a development in the characters feel deserved; the story is divided by misunderstandings, a third party drives a rift in the lead pairing, then the conflict is resolved by the end of the chapter rinse and repeat. 3D Kanojo is barely competent because it relies heavily on this formulaic cheap method of telling its story. Even so, a character-driven story is only as good as it's characters allow it, but they're trash too.   \\n\\n\r\nTsutsui begins the show as the standard archetypal boy who hates real girls because people look down on him for liking anime\u2026 That\u2019s not much of a motivation, but the series had room to flesh him out more. And nothing came from it; he remains a mostly oblivious idiot for the entire series. His only \u2018character development\u2019 comes from cheap contrivances that lead him into trouble with his girlfriend then eventually the issues resolve themselves. Instead of subverting the mountain of stereotypes it chooses the cheapest route and gratifies his misogyny by making all of the girls comically cruel to Tsutsui, with the supporting character Ishino to represent the mob of angry cardboard cutouts. Her only excuse for hanging around Tsutsui and his girlfriend is that she\u2019s his childhood friend, yet it doesn\u2019t seem like she has a good reason to be there at all.\\n\\n\r\nIshino constantly verbally and physically abuses Tsutsui to an absurd degree, and of course she repeatedly asks out the boy who accused Tsutsui of being a pedophile. But don\u2019t worry guys he said he was sorry so now he\u2019s allowed to be in their friend group and even go on camping trips with them all (yes this is actually the direction the plot takes). I\u2019m not sure what I was missing here, but how can someone go from actively trying to ruin a person's life to being ol\u2019 pals in the next goddamn episode? It\u2019s a suitably moronic resolution for that tire fire of an arc, but let\u2019s leave it at that because we have more shit to cover and I\u2019d rather not open that can of worms. \\n\\n\r\nLater on in the series, a stereotypical nerdy girl appears to serve as another case of the trope Not Like Other Girls. And of course, she's not allowed to just be an archetype because whenever Tsutsui sees her he accidentally comes onto her, making her fall in love with him. Tsutsui\u2019s obliviousness defies all logic, no human is this much of a bumbling moron. Sadly this is 3D Kanojo and there is no room for logic with all these cliches stuffed in. Of course there is a plotline dedicated to this misunderstanding and the rift it causes between Iroha and Tsutsui. Lazily written misunderstandings fuel most (if not all) of the drama in this series. You\u2019ll always know how to easily resolve a situation episodes before the characters do, it's frustrating and quickly becomes painful to watch unironically.\\n\\n\r\nBefore Tsutsui and Iroha started dating, he sees the Real Girl herself crying alone in public, then proceeds to creepily follow her as she runs errands. Eventually, a shop clerk accuses Iroha of stealing, then he takes it as his chance to take off his hood and emerge from the shadows to defend her. Oh, drool\u2026 what a hero, this actually impresses her. That\u2019s what their relationship is built on, him being a creepy stalker and she is not like other girls for various shallow reasons. At this point (the first episode) the show has divided itself from reality, the main character is no longer relatable and all of the playing into stereotypes the show has done goes nowhere, there is no subversion. The author of Real Hurl genuinely believes that otaku are creeps and the key to a girls heart is stalking her until she like you back, it\u2019s hilariously stupid and borderline gross.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who has worked in retail can tell you if you ever accuse a customer of stealing you will lose your job. The whole scene is stupidly contrived to justify Tsutsui stalking Iroha moments ago. It\u2019s all so she can say to him \u201cwow you are actually a nice guy I should date stalkers more often!\u201d This is exactly why 3D Kanojo doesn\u2019t even work as least cute passive entertainment! It fails at being both a comedy and a drama and is not even enjoyable as passive entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed plenty of cutesy shoujos regardless of trashy writing, Kiss Him Not Me was pretty funny despite the stupid fat joke it was predicated on. There is no part of Real Girl that I found remotely cute or appealing. The main relationship is so codependent yet there\u2019s no actual commentary on codependency. Even though she is the title Real Girl, Iroha has literally no agency in the story. Despite being this tough girl archetype she has so little characterization of her own. She\u2019s pulled around in the story, never allowed to guide its direction. And Tsutsui\u2019s isn\u2019t always the one to drag her around. They even throw in the lowest common denominator \"not blood-related\" brother to tear her and Tsutsui apart in the final misunderstanding fueled chapter. There was even some 100% necessary incestual rOmAnTic TeNsiON that I can barely recall because at this far into the series my mind was shutting itself down to protect my sanity. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the codependency, the main relationship is downright creepy, but the show seems content with calling it cute. I had expected at least some discussion about how the main character literally stalks, takes pictures of, and fantasizes about his girlfriend typically while she\u2019s asleep in the same room as him on multiple occasions (the author\u2019s fetish hmmm??). But oh no, he\u2019s an otaku so that kind of cute behavior is normal right? \\n\\n\r\nNO! This kind of awful stereotype is so moronic that it\u2019s actually offensive. I take back what I said earlier, otakus deserve better than being portrayed like this; watch something, anything else. It\u2019s very clear that the author of Real Girl had no idea what otakus are actually like, and she wrote the main character based on a demographic she does not know firsthand. He\u2019s an otaku because we\u2019re told he is, he likes some trashy magical girl anime because we\u2019re told it\u2019s good and therefore he\u2019s an otaku, he hates women because we\u2019re told so, he\u2019s a socially inept dimwit because characters have to explain his emotions constantly. \\n\\n\r\nTsutsui is so barebones and carelessly written that constantly we\u2019re stumbling into these unanswered questions like; why does he like her, what caused him to hate women, what does he even like about anime??\\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 2/10] Contrived and idiotic beyond belief. \\n\r\n[Character: 1/10] Cliched, archetypal, thoroughly unlikable. \\n\r\n[Art: 2/10] A messy disaster, lacking animation. \\n\r\n[Sound: 3/10] Repetitive and uninspired.  \\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 1/10] Comparable to being lobotomized.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 2/10]\\n\r\n3D Kanojo is so mind-numbingly stupid it defies universal logic, I can feel my IQ rapidly decreasing even at this moment just for contemplating the hamfisted story. But not only is it intellectually insulting, it's downright offensive to anyone who dares to try and relate to these grotesquely portrayed stereotypical characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it off, the final episode closes on a non-ending halfway into the incest arc with a sequel already in the works. I can hear the mangaka laughing at me all the way from Japan because I hoped I could damn this to the void forever. Well, 3D Kanojo can fucking take the last laugh because I sure as hell am not going to waste any more brain cells on this nightmare.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended for those that have finished watching 3D Kanojo Real Girl and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nAn unlikely romance between an Otaku and a popular but broken girl that awakens their heart to the feelings that they have been hiding from \r\nBased off a popular manga of the same name 3D Kanojo real girl better known as Real girl is a romantic comedy anime that gives us the opportunity to look at what will happen if a high school boy shunned byhis fellow classmates for being an otaku was to encounter the beautiful but badly reputed troublemaker Iroha and end up receiving a most unexpected answer to a question that he asked merely as a joke. The first episode of the series made quite the impression on me because of its unique premise of paring an otaku with limited social skills with a popular and beautiful girl that would usually be out of his reach and was interesting enough that I kept it on my watch list and I'm glad that I did. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in a modern-day Japan the overall story of 3D Kanojo girl follows the life of Hikari Tsutsui a high school student that while kind-hearted and decent is shunned by his fellow classmates for being an otaku and his encounter with the beautiful but ill-reputed high school girl Iroha Igaraishi and the surprising romantic relationship that they both embark on thanks to a daring question and a most unexpected answer. As Hikari and Iroha embark on their most unexpected relationship both must learn to break out of the shells that they have hidden behind all their lives and learn that to find what true love is they must first learn to accept the strengths and flaws of both their personalities and overcome the barriers that isolation in society have created in their lives.  \\n\\n\r\nHikari Tsutsui \\n\\n\r\nHikari Tsutsui played by new voice actor Teppei Uenishi is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school student and an anime and game otaku Hikari is a quiet, cynical and blunt person by nature that while intelligent and responsible is someone that is shunned by his fellow classmates due to his interests. As a result of this, in the beginning, Hikari was an anti-social person that was overly negative and preferred to stay detached from interaction with his fellow classmates with is sole friendship within the class being with his fellow otaku Itou. As a result of being shunned by his fellow classmates, in the beginning, Hikari had a hatred of real-life girls and relationships with them and limited the interactions that he had with them preferring instead the animated ones that he sees in anime and manga. While a kind and considerate person by nature as a result of being shunned by his fellow classmates Hikari, in the beginning, was a low-key person and preferred to remain in the background where he can avoid any trouble that comes his way.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on Hikari\u2019s personality gradually starts to change as a result of not just meeting Iroha but also many people that he befriends along the way. Though shunning and viewing romantic relationships with real girls as being nothing but trouble as the series progresses this view of Hikari gradually changes. While nervous about romantic relationships but at the same time curious about them Hikari\u2019s desire to understand them was let down by the fact that he had no experience with it and more importantly had trouble reading the atmosphere and understand a girl\u2019s feelings. However, as Hikari interacts more with Iroha instead of retreating back to his world Hikari gradually becomes braver and more willing to bond with and befriend other people that would have been outside his circle of friends at the beginning showing his determination to change himself and match Iroha. In line with Hikari\u2019s new found desire to bond with and befriend others is his new-found interest in knowing the affairs of others especially Iroha and his new friends and try to solve the problems that they are bothered with to the best of his ability. While still nervous to a degree and having trouble putting his thoughts into words Hikari gradually learns how to get on with real people and as their bonds deepen show them the care and kindness that had been hidden behind his walls. While often frustrated by his inability to read the mood and his lack of experience in love Hikari does not let that stop him and tries hard to not just improve his own personality but also learn more about what love is showing how much he values the relationship he has with Iroha and how much he wants to improve as a person so as to match her. As the series goes on and as Hikari\u2019s relationship with Iroha and his friendships with his friends improve it can be seen that while happy that his life is improving Hikari is somewhat constrained with the fear that perhaps one day all of this can change and that one day he might lose everything that he has gained by meeting Iroha and his friends. But until that day comes Hikari will make the best of the situation. \\n\\n\r\nIroha Igarashi \\n\\n\r\nIroha Igarashi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yu Serizawa of Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A beautiful and popular high school girl that attends the same school as Hikari Iroha is a kind, quiet and polite person by nature that\u2019s also responsible and dutiful. Unlike most girls though Iroha despite having many classmates that want to know her is someone that seemingly prefers the solitude of being alone and as a result, she like Hikari lacks many female friends her age. While a quiet person that tries to stay away from trouble it can be seen however that Iroha is someone that dislikes seeing people get bullied and indeed is someone that respects bravery and determination which is best shown in her first interactions with Hikari. At the beginning of the series, Iroha and Hikari had a very unexpected encounter with one another that would later have much impact on their lives. Unlike the rest of the students that Iroha had met until that point, Hikari was unlike anyone that she had ever met before. While socially awkward in their interactions and having interests in topics that are unknown to her Hikari\u2019s bravery in confessing to her and his determination to stay out of trouble was something that really touched her. While finding Hikari\u2019s interests to be unique Iroha unlike the rest of the student body did not look down on Hikari and instead treated him with due kindness something that puts her in good stead in Hikari\u2019s eyes and contributed greatly to his development as a character. While respecting Hikari\u2019s determination to stay out of trouble it can be seen that Iroha dislikes seeing Hikari and her friends be bullied and will try to find a way to hit back at the bullies to deal with them when she can. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on Iroha\u2019s personality gradually starts to change as she slowly opens up to Hikari and her new-found friends. While a polite, reserved and quiet girl that seems sure of herself on the surface beneath this it can be seen that Iroha actually is a very fragile person at heart. While certainly having more experience than Hikari in matters of love Iroha due to her looks has had to deal with confessions to her on a daily basis which created not just a large amount of stress for her but also an ill-reputed reputation among her schoolmates. As a result, this created within her mind a very negative image of what a proper serious romantic relationship should be like as most people that confessed to her cannot express a reason for why they liked her beyond her looks and thus creating a belief that people only care about her looks and not anything else. As a result of this Iroha while positive and cheerful on the surface is someone that is noted to be very good at creating masks that she wears to hide her true feelings from others something that was necessary in her life until she met Hikari and made new friends. To Iroha while Hikari is unlike any other boy that she has met before they have many issues that they share that enable them to bond easily with one another. The most prominent of these is the isolation that both feel in school and the lack of trust that they have for their fellow classmates due to their past experiences. While both Iroha and Hikari found it very hard to trust each other at first due to Hikari\u2019s kindness to others and Iroha\u2019s struggles to reveal her true feelings as the series goes on and both learn about what true love is this feeling of distrust gradually vanishes as for the first time in her life Iroha is able to place her trust in someone other than herself. While the relationship between Iroha and Hikari may have started off randomly as they interact with each other and learn more about each other Iroha starts to see and understand the true problems in Hikari\u2019s personality but rather ignoring them as most people would start to instead encourage him to be more confident and proactive showing not just her love for him but also in the faith that she has that like her Hikari would be able to overcome the barriers that he has built to protect himself from an unfriendly society. The character of Iroha I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her gradual awakening of her true self and of finding someone that will appreciate everything that she has and not just her looks being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Yu Serizawa really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Iroha.\\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I felt that both the school and the areas that the cast visited during the series were both well designed and animated. The character designs for the cast I felt were also well designed and I also liked the designs of the uniforms that the cast wore as they attended school. The character of Ezomichi which is an anime character from one of Hikari\u2019s favourite shows I felt was interesting as his discussions with it matched well with his desire to find a common ground in society and I felt that her actions in the series which was larger than her role in the manga helped greatly in providing advice to Hikari for the many trials that he had to overcome in the series. In terms of music, I felt that the series OST did a great job of conveying the various moods and feelings that the cast felt as their relationships with each other developed. In particular, I really liked the series opening and ending themes which for the series was Daiji na Koto by Quruli and Hide the Blue by Bish with the former being able to create a sense of calmness while the latter being able to convey a sense of anticipation for the next episode. In terms of voice acting for the series overall, I felt that the series voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I felt that Teppei Uenishi, Yu Serizawa and Reina Ueda who portrayed the characters of Hikari, Iroha, and Sumie did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. The supporting cast for the series while not featured in this review I felt also did a great job supporting the overall story with Minami Tsuda, Shouta Aoi, Takuma Terashima and Sayaka Kanda doing an excellent job at portraying the characters of Arisa Ishino, Yuto Ito, Mitsuya Takanashi and Ezomichi respectively. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall 3D Kanojo girl was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strengths being its unique premise, strong story, excellent characters, excellent voice acting and its integration of various but related themes into the story. While the premise of having an average guy falling in love with one of the schools most popular girls is itself not unusual within the anime world I felt that the unique premise that the series introduced to the concept made it sound even more interesting than the base concept something that definitely caught my interest. Within Japan, the term Otaku is a derogatory term unique to Japan that is used to label people that have obsessive interests in aspects of Japanese popular culture such as anime and manga. The negative nature that this term conveys means that people often look down on otaku and view them with suspicion and often causing distances to form between them and the person in question. Having the main character as an otaku that falls in love with a girl I felt was an interesting premise exactly because the lack of knowledge on basic human to human interactions is something that\u2019s unknown to most otaku and seeing Hikari not only try to confront this overwhelming wall that stands between him and Iroha but make it work was something that really resonated with me. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series I felt was one of its main strong points with its focus naturally being the relationship between Hikari and Iroha after their first meeting. True to most otaku Hikari, in the beginning, was someone that adored the world of anime and manga and as a result, bore a distinct dislike of human girls and interactions with humans that don\u2019t share his passion which combined with his lack of social skills made him an outcast within the class that he was part off. Until Hikari met Iroha his life had always been stable and revolved around anime and his passion for it and being able to share his passion with like-minded friends like Itou. But the fortunate encounter between Hikari and Iroha resulted in the birth of not just the unlikeliest of romantic relationships between them but also created within Hikari a desire to change his personality and for the first time in his life embrace the world that he had for so long been ignoring and as a result learn what it actually means to be a human being. While the relationship between Hikari and Iroha is anything but smooth sailing seeing them both work so hard to overcome the many challenges both physical and mental that laid in their path as they try to understand each other\u2019s personalities was something that I thought the story handled really well. But understanding comes in many forms especially when related to love and being able to bond and connect with your other half on an emotional level is just as important a fact that I thought the story dealt with relatively well in showing the secret insecurities that both Iroha and Hikari confronted and eventually overcome as their relationship developed and blossomed. While the development of Iroha and Hikari via their relationship was, of course, the main focus of the story with it comes a secondary aspect that\u2019s just as important as the main one which is how the rest of the school and their classmates and later friends view them. With few exceptions, most of their classmates viewed the couple with scorn not understanding why and how Iroha ended up as a couple with someone like Hikari. But as their relationship develops and Hikari and Iroha\u2019s hearts start to gradually open as they overcome challenges this sense of hatred gradually starts to vanish as for the first time they can see that both are trying hard to overcome the many things that were holding them back. Watching the opinions and attitudes of the supporting cast of the series change as they bore witness to Hikari\u2019s evolution as a character and seeing them gradually realise their error and become friends with him instead of hating him was something that I really enjoyed seeing because it meant that Hikari\u2019s attempts to improve himself had succeeded. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3D Kanojo girl was a series that I really enjoyed watching with its unique premise, story and character development being its best points. The gradual understanding between Iroha and Hikari of the fact that love is not just about physical attraction but also an emotional attachment to the person that you love was something that I really enjoyed seeing and makes you realise just how deep your love for someone can be. As a final score, I would say that 3D Kanojo girl deserves a final score of 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Therefore, it is surprising that this is getting such a poor score.\r\nDon't get me wrong, it's not groundbreaking anime but I saw many shows over 7.5 that are definitely worse than this one. I feel like the MAL score is slowly becoming irrelevant.\r\nI typically can't handle shoujo anime (the pace is so slow, I feel like dying) but there's just enough mystery in the story to keep you interested. The character interactions are indeed awkward and cringey but considering the setting it makes perfect sense.\r\nFrom the setup, it looks like it's supposed to be a drama morethan a rom-com but it has comedic elements. It's a little bit odd that it portrays any other male character (other than the mc and his friend) as being complete assholes, but it doesn't affect your enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth giving a try.",

            "content": "There were two-romcom anime that were airing from the spring 18 season. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. However compare to Takagi San which was more a tease feast instead of a romcom both 3D Kanojo Real Girl Kanojo and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu were actually romcom that uses the character, drama, comedy and narrative to the fullest. However only one of the two romcom anime from the spring 18 season was good and that was Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. What Wotaku love is hard for an okatu has over 3D Kanojo RealGirl is that one the characters were likable, two that show was well paced and three the romance was actually great and believable. As much I want to go into more detail of why Wotaku is a better romcom anime than 3D Girl Kanojo stay tune for my review for Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. In that review I will go into more detail of why I love, Wotaku love is hard for an okatu while I hate this 3D Girl Kanojo which speaking of 3D Girl Kanojo is no contest not only one of the worst anime of 2018 bit is also one of the worst romcoms I have ever seen period.\\n\\n\r\nSo what went wrong with this show?\\n\r\nYour soon gonna find out.\\n\r\nHello everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome to my review of 3D Kanojo Real Girl and with that said let\u2019s begin\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows a generic okatu high school student named Hikaru Tsutsui who is shunned by his classmates for his otaku behavior. One day he gets set to do pool cleaning duty for being late along with a beautiful but reputed troublemaker Iroha Higurashi\u00a0who is also considered an outsider by other students. At first reluctant to even talk to Iroha, Hikari is able to overcome his insecurity and defend her from bullies. In yet another pool-cleaning task, they decide to start a relationship. The catch? Iroha is due to change schools at the end of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is awful.\\n\r\nAm not kidding this is one of the worst romance stories I have ever seen period.\\n\r\nFor starters this show does a horrendous job at portraying the okatu culture. Unlike Wotaku love is hard for an okatu where the show portrays the okatu culture in a more realistic way that is grounded and believable this show this show literally took all of that and throw it out the window in favor being comical and unrealistic. For example in one episode Mitsuya sees Hikaru helping his sister then Mitsuya tells his sister to scream in order for the police to catch him as well branding Hikaru as a\u00a0lolicon\u00a0for days. Okay I understand if you don\u2019t like the person as the well the hobby that he does but you didn\u2019t really have to out of your way to humiliate him in public like that so he can be a easy target for the police.\\n\r\nPeople don\u2019t behave like this and that event alone really shows how bad the character interactions are which I get to talk about now.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 alone is the worst first episode I have ever seen a romcom. Instead of having the two main characters slowly learning about each other the show decides to start off with a very contrived pool scene where they both of them fall into the pool. After that the show decided to have an awkward conversation by having our female lead Iroha ask Tsutsui that he is a virgin and Tsutsui replies honestly. The whole conversation feels forced and unnatural as both characters talk at each other instead of allowed a character they sentence plus nothing from that conversation was remotely interesting and because of these reasons alone the show did a horrendous job at establishing theses characters.\u00a0\\n\r\nTo add insult to injury all of this shit happened in the first episode where both of these characters met for the first time. I would have been okay with this if that happened in later episodes where at that point the two main characters started to understand but having that scene happened in very first of the series really shows how poorly directed and written this series is.\\n\\n\r\nThe single worst thing about the show is that the show itself at times literally forgets that it was a romcom anime as it the show at times devolves into a shitty slice of life anime with a poor portyal of otaku culture which completely kills all the potenal romcom thanks to its stiff character interactions and relationships.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story in 3D Kanojo Real Girl is awful.\\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nIf you the story was bad enough guess what? The character are even worse.\\n\r\nTsutsui is just your boring and unlikable okatu freak who is hard to relate to thanks to his stiff character interactions.\\n\r\nIroha is just your typical easy going girl who jealous a lot. While I liked Iroha more than Tsutsui in terms of personality I still thought she was a pretty mediocre character at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are just throwaway romcom characters that we all seen before as they only to exist to create drama and conflict to the narrative.\\n\r\nOverall the characters were just plan terrible.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nLike with the story and characters the visuals are shit.\\n\r\nThe character designs for 3D Kanojo Real Girl are very uninspired as they look like they were done in 1 hour without a second thought.\\n\r\nThe animation is below average it constaints of shotty camera angles, still frame and overall weak animation.\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\n3D Kanojo has very forgettable soundtrack overall. The same can apply to the shows opening theme however the ending theme was kinda decent.\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the show is pretty decent overall and all the Seiyuus did a fair job on each role.\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is pretty mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a dumpster of a romcom anime that deserves to be burned and forgotten. The story is badly written to the absolute core, the character are all unlikable idiots, mixed with a forgettable ost, weak production values and poor story directing. If you want to watch a good romcom anime from go watch Wotaku love is hard for an okatu instead of this train-wreck.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 2/10",

            "content": "**Disclaimer: This is a Rant**\r\nAfter the second episode of this anime I was expecting this anime to be better than that atrocious first episode. What I got in exchange was a shitty romcom with misleading topics and very infuriating characters... Can't believe that this is getting a second season when a lot of good shows out there are left without a sequel. So lets get into details. (There might be spoilers)\r\nThe \"story\" centers around Tsutsui who is an Otaku who only has one friend (A very shitty friend I must say). well, at least that's what this anime tries to portray on him. He hasnot contact with any humans with the exception of his neko best friend, he spends his spare time watching a mahou shoujo anime and that's pretty much his situation. I don't know what this anime tried to portray, the life of a very bullied kid or a wannabe \"Otaku\", because I'm sure as hell that this isn't the life of an Otaku, but of a socially awkward person who happens to like a Mahou Shoujo anime, I can relate to Tsutsui's situation here and thats why I felt so insulted while watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne day Tsutsui meets the most inconsistent bitch in town and for some reason she falls for him (I barely remember what was the actual reason, what I can recall is that the first episode was a clusterfuck of events) and this is where the trainwreck begins. The rest of the anime is spent in misunderstandings and shitloads of melodrama of the lowest quality possible: Tsutsui \"Fucks up\", Igarashi gets mad because why not, his \"friends\" scold him saying that he is a terrible boyfriend, Tsutsui has an existencial crisis, his Mahou shoujo Waifu conforts him and encourages him, Tsutsui Apologizes, Igarashi blushes and accepts apologize, repeat. This not only gets old, its infurating because the reasons Tsutsui \"fucks up\" aren't such a big deal to be even mad for. Oh!, and lets not forget the plot device that is never touched again: Igarashi supposedly needs to leave town after 6 months and only God knows why... Is Igarashi going to die? never mind that, because that's left unanswered. (although I suspect that's the case)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime are atrocious, some of them acts as \"comic relief\" but dear God, this \"comic relief\" isn't even cringey, it's insulting and infuriating!, how I'm supposed to laugh at a \"mother\" who makes fun of his son and also doesn't support him when he is a suspected child molester? She doesn't even seem to care about his son situation on high school. This is not funny, its sad and infuriating, Tsutsui doesn't even deserve to have such a terrible mother, neither he deserves such shitty friends that are only there at the good times, because whenever Tsutsui \"fucks up\" they shine for their disappearance, or even worse, they act cold against him and insult him, he doesn't even deserve to have such an inconsistent bitch as a girlfriend, I swear, Igarashi must have reached the top 10 worst anime girlfriends in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't that bad but not great either, there are a lot of terrible shots where characters has deformed faces, it also fails on portraying events. And the sound... Thanks God I'm not going to hear their voices ever again.\\n\\n\r\nNow I don't know if this is based on a real story and I don't really care about that, but dear God, this is a terrible depiction of what love is and what friendship is, its also terrible at describing the life of an Otaku, whoever make this totally missed the point of it. Go watch something like \"Welcome to the NHK\" which is miles beyond what this anime tried to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2,5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Watching 3D Kanojo feels like standing in the middle of no man's land where two parties are trying to bomb the living shit out of each others with cliches and cringe. By two parties, I mean our two main characters. It's so over the top, it is actually quite entertaining to watch.\r\nThe writer keeps throwing romance cliches in such a tempo it can only be called an impressive work. Our main girl is full of opposites. At the same time, she is a whore and an innocent treasure. A strong badass and a crying little girl. It's never certain if what she says is honestor a lie. I view this is a parody towards generic shoujo leads whose behavior makes no sense whatsoever. The lead guy on the other hand is at the same time a loser otaku and an ideal boyfriend. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the ridiculously fast pacing, and the girls constant lies, it's quite hard to get into these characters and call this a good romance. None of it has been made seriously after all, but it does a decent job as a comedy, though it looks like the series will be getting old soon. I can recommend this to folks who have the tendency to hate romances because 3D Kanojo quite well captures all the things that are wrong with them.",

            "content": "It is often said by many that anime is gradually getting worse. As much as I want to deny this, I can't help but reluctantly agree. Over the past few seasons, there had been such a lack of originality and overuse of cliches that besides the occasional 'a place farther than the universe', I'm wondering if anime is even trying anymore. Lets take a look at '3D girlfriend', which, as much as I wanted to like it, I can't help but getting annoyed by how cliche it is.\r\nPlot (4/10): The story to this show is extremely mediocre and predictable. A boy who is an otakuand often bullied meets a girl, the girl changed his initial opinion of 3d girlfriends (whatever that means), falls in love, starts dating, bla bla bla. Basically its 'the world god only knows' except its a whole less original and consists of a single relationship. This may not have been a bad thing except the execution is laughably poor. None of the otaku subplot is explored in a meaningful\\n\r\nway at all, which makes me wonder why the show even made the mc an otaku in the first place. The romance is very bad, with poor chemistry between the characters and is badly paced. I mean, come on! They meet and even started dating on the same day? How does that work?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10): Besides the plot, the characters in this show are very unoriginal as well. The main character, tsutsui, I feel is probably one of the blandest shojo leads I've seen. Not only does he lack any personality whatsoever, but he is also horribly inconsistent. He\\n\r\ngets angry for no particular reason and is then showed to be placid in the next scene. I suppose this show wants to characterize him as a socially awkward type of guy, but if it is, it does a very terrible job at it. Next up, we have the female protagonist, Igarashi, who, while still being better than Tsutsui, is still very boring. The third character, Itou Yuuto, is hardly worth mentioning since the only bit of development he got is as a plot device for being the mc's best friend.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound (5/10): While not being bad, the technical aspects of this show aren't very good either. The character designs are mediocre, with Tsutsui being the typical high school boy with glasses, which was copied from at least 50 other anime with basically the same design and Igarashi looks like the typical shojo lead with wavy hair. The music in the opening is pretty bad in my opinion although for voice acting, I do like Igarashi's voice a lot so I'll keep this category above a 4.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10): Overall, this show so far is pretty bad. I might watch a few more episodes to see if it gets better but I'll put it on-hold for now.",

Im not going to go into telling you what this anime is about since you can literally flick back to the main page and read the bio so Im just going to jump right into how I feel about this anime... (FYI score is fully based on entertainment)\r\nI have never really been in a significant relationship myself... Partly because the idea doesn't appeal to me, I feel as though there is nothing someone of the opposite sex can offer me while ina relationship that I can't get outside of one minus the hassle of going out with someone (of course this could just be me being narrow minded since I haven't been in one) (btw the other half of the reason I havent been in a relationship is because Im just too much of a c**t) so I have no way to say how accurately this anime portrays a socially awkward couple, but even still I want to say just how entertaining this show was... But first, lets look at some of the reasons people might try and avoid this.\\n\\n\r\nWas it repetitive? Yes\\n\\n\r\nDid some of the characters make me want to pull my hair out at times? Yes\\n\\n\r\nDid they shove comedy into some areas it just didn't belong? I think so.\\n\\n\r\nDid it follow almost every cliche romance anime hardships known to man? You already know it.\\n\\n\r\nBest of luck to you all from here on out, this is the unedited stuff coming up and my brain works like a gamer with an apm over 500 (in other words so much crap is going on you start to wonder if everything is even relevant or following a logical order)... Back on track though I think the main reason I liked this anime so much was because of how lighthearted it was (and I dont just mean that in the sense of the humour used), it was relaxing to watch. I binged this thing from 10-4am and when I finally shut my laptop last night and checked the time while setting my alarm I realised just how long I had stayed up watching this... Im not overly craving a second season, I wouldn't rant about it as being one of the best anime I have ever watched. But the fact that I could kill 6 hours without even realising it, I could have a good laugh and I could get that stupid grin on my face like a 5 year old who has just been told by his parents they will buy him icecream later then I think that is a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway in summary, I thought the anime was laid back, chill, fun to watch, interesting and kind of refreshing (Maybe because I wouldnt normally watch stuff like this idk) and if you have a few hours to spare I would certainly say you should give it a go, I mean you have nothing to loose, what you see at the start is what you get. If you don't like the first 3 episodes then I guess your relationship with this anime wasn't meant to be...........................................................................",

            "content": "This anime popped up on kissanime before I had a chance to even look at it's score from MAL. From what I've seen so far I've been surprised that such a cliched and typical plot could produce such a quality anime.\r\nThe qualities of this anime does not lie in an amazing plot, or even perfect and picturesque artwork. Its strength lies in the characters and the style in which the plot is presented. While the plot may be cliched, you're made to feel like you've never seen an anime like it before. Other reviewers have claimed that it is full of cringe cliches, however, theway the relationship is explored is what varies it from other shoujo romance animes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to explain how I feel about this anime. It's like having constant butterflies, in the sense that I can't predict what's going to happen next. Perhaps 'what's' was the wrong word, I feel like I can't predict how the next scene is going to occur. Anyways, I'm not gonna give a full review because the show isn't over and I feel like the characters is the only thing you really need to worry about review. That's because the whole show and what makes it good is the uniqueness and earnestness (not sure if this is a word) of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10: It's hard to explain why I love the two main characters so much. Everything about them feels both real and unique. While they both have typical anime traits, they represent real problems facing actual people. The male main clearly has social anxiety, and self esteem issues which are cleverly woven into the plot and with his relationship with the female main. The female main character has a much deeper and harder to read psychological profile. She is both forward and reserved, both a liar and a wholesome girl. The studio have alluded to reasons why she is the way she is, but they have smartly kept their hand hidden with that information. This uneasiness adds to the feeling of butterflies mentioned before, they use a combination of lowkey foreshadowing, and her personality and behavior itself to make you feel like something bad is going to happen. You feel like you know already, but it makes me want to watch it even more. Yet the uneasy feeling never fades. The foreshadowing such as her 'lying' about a terminal illness or her parents not being there when Tsuntsun visits/stalks her just makes it impossible for me to takes my eyes away from this show. I could write so very much more on just these characters, however, I'll save it for a full review if ya'll want to see it.",

In fact, all it took for me was to wait outuntil after the opening theme. The first bit right before the opening of the first episode had me rolling my eyes, but by the time I got half way through the episode, I was already ready to continue to the next one. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing I like most about the two main characters in particular is that although they start off based on a sort of cliche, the story launches itself from there by way of much deeper character development. I even believe that the title of this anime is slightly misleading, as the anime itself doesn't truly put nearly as much emphasis on \"2D vs 3D\" as I originally expected. These characters felt relatable and were most definitely deeper and more emotionally thought out than their initial cliche summaries. Not everyone enjoys a simple light hearted romcom (although I admit this one had me crying more than laughing), but for those who do, it is worth the watch. Thank you.",

            "content": "Believe me when the description of anime starts with \"____ is an otaku\" I typically run away, but on a whim I decided to give this a shot and look at this for what it is. \r\nThe story is not very compelling, it is a cliche Messiah complex story where some beautiful girl saves a loser from his life, and he learns to function as a normal individual. What this anime does with this; however, is why it is above par. \r\nThe pacing is great, rather than waiting 12-24 episodes for a love connection dopamine hit the anime zigs and zags with peaks and lows,the ability to connect to the story comes from the strong female lead who is unique in her own right. The character is a liar, who sees the good in people, shes also an outcast, and very honest, however none of this is done as a selling point, her tag line wouldn't be Iroha the liar, these are all just facets of the personality the author has crafted for her without over accentuating elements to make it seem like some kind of caricature. She feels real, like an attainable idolization of a modern woman. What I don't like in media is this idiotic completely inhuman moral compass where a character will freak out at another character for lying to them, it's completely unrealistic, people lie constantly and daily, it is a necessary action. Demonizing it to the point where it becomes a major plot advancement is idiotic. Morality is relative, even personal morality depends on the context and the nuance that is why it is possible to be both a liar and an honest person at the same time which is what the author took advantage of. \\n\r\nAbove all she is understanding and forgiving to the main character, putting up with his floundering without backing down thus far. \\n\\n\r\nThe male lead is less interesting but still a well written character his thoughts really reflect that of an autistic guy with no friends. The way he acts and the way he talks is not a cliche woops my hand slipped on your tit anime, it's more of a guy who is completely lost in human interactions and has no idea how to emote or act. He speaks some funny lines and has moments of redemption, but ultimately his 180 turns in between episodes are exhausting, they go from making so much progress as a couple to him batting her hand away. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's enjoyable and I don't think people are giving it a fair chance because of the cliched premise. \\n",

            "content": "3D Kanojo: A series with potential that sinned from shallow\r\nAfter watching the 12 episodes of 3D Kanojo I had that bittersweet flavor of an anime that touched interesting topics, but did not develop them correctly.\r\nIn my first impressions I commented how I liked that this series fought against the cliches and showed a fresh approach to a story that we have seen more than once in the anime; However, its execution did not end up being as solid as it would have liked, and in the end it did not know how to develop the themes it played.\r\nOf course, in defense of the anime Ihave to say that these problems come from the original material, because the manga, created by Mao Nanami, was not able to provide a credible view of the stories it told. Especially towards the end where it was noticed that the series was forced to end.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, with this disadvantage, it was not an easy job that had Deko Akao at the time of making the scripts of the series; However, I think he lost a great opportunity to polish the plot and develop all the arcs much better.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is that in each of the arcs it became clear that the rhythm was not adequate and that many times time was lost thinking about things that did not need it, and then resolving conflicts in a hurry.\\n\\n\r\nThis is very clear when Iroha's brother is introduced. In fact, considering that it is very likely that the staff knew that this series had the second season almost from the beginning, I would have preferred that this character would not appear yet.\\n\\n\r\nI think those episodes could have been used to tell arcs much better like Hikaru being charged as lolicon, or the whole issue related to Sumie (which is one of the best arcs in the series)\\n\\n\r\nIn favor of 3D Kanojo I must say that it dared to tell its story from an atypical point of departure and that it was not afraid to explore the possibilities offered by having established the main couple from the moment we go.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the chemistry between Iroha and Hikaru was one of the strong points; In addition, on many occasions, the series managed to escape stereotypes and easy exits every time it presented conflicts. However, not being able to present these conflicts with an adequate rhythm and progression, in the end they lacked impact.\\n\\n\r\nAt no time was it felt that the main couple was in danger and this ended up causing those problems to pass without pain or glory. At this point I want to clarify that it is not mandatory to make the couple run the risk of breaking up to maintain an interesting plot. Series like Horimiya or, more recently, Wotakoi are convincing proofs of it; however, when the series wants to take that course, it has to do so by betting everything.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the plot, of the antagonists and of the conflict itself has to have an adequate rhythm so that the audience can get involved. 3D Kanojo was never able to achieve this and it was largely because of how quickly everything was solved or to use bad characters in the role of villains (with bad characters I mean poorly created)\\n\\n\r\nMitsuya as an antagonist was a joke because his arc was resolved in two seconds (almost literally) and Chika barely had time to do anything because his mere introduction this season was a mistake given the little space he had to develop his character. Only the arc of Sumie managed to shine a little although a lot of potential was also wasted with this plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, despite everything, I will give the staff the benefit of the doubt and hopefully for the second season improve these details and give us a memorable outcome. Especially because the best arcs of the manga will come, although they were not developed in the best way, it could be polished in their adaptation to the anime. By the way, MANGA SPOILERS INCOMING.\\n\\n\r\nBut before the spoilers I think it is necessary to highlight that 3D Kanojo did something that is very rare to see in the current anime; during the post-credit scene they took the opportunity to announce the second season of the series. How many times have we seen something like this? At least it is curious and shows that the studio has faith in the project (It is true that the announcement had already been made via Twitter one day before the final episode was broadcasted, but it is still curious)\\n\\n\r\nNow, about that second season I must say that arcs like the relationship between Yuuto and Sumie, the first time of Iroha and Hikaru; and the operation of Iroha deserve to be rewritten so that its plot has more development. Especially so that their outcomes are not abrupt as in the original work. It is a great challenge, but it is perfectly achievable.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section, Hoods Entertainment did not use too much budget in this series. The animation is regular with terrible moments, the soundtrack is generic and the direction was not to launch rockets. Only the design of characters is remarkable because it must be recognized that they improved a lot the manga designs.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a daring series that sought to escape stereotypes of the genre, but that never found the rhythm and proper development in the conflicts presented, subtracting impact to all. Let's see if the second season bounce it back.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nThe series had to give much more, but a bad development in its arcs prevented it from having a much greater impact.",

The show at random picks clich\u00e9s to ignore and embrace never to actually address them. They create tension out of thin air and simply drop it after a set amount of time having that conflict. For that purposes they don't shy away from abusing serious and extreme topics for minor conflict. \r\nCharacter consistency is barely existent as both MCs will just randomly express the sentiment and emotions needed at this point of time in the episode.Since none of the characters has anything qualifying as virsually unique to itself the art style comes off as underwhelmingly generic.\\n\\n\r\nI dropped this show twice. The first time half way into the first episode the second time after the fourth. It's moronic and steretypic and if you think you might be the target audience of this, you should feel a little insulted. \\n\\n\r\nDon't bother.

Now let's get down to it,\r\nIt's absolutely appalling.\r\nFlat characters. Stupid development. Trying to make MC looks like some saintly dude when he's just a m*****f*cking pussy of a human being. \r\nThe anime is a clusterfuck of cliches and cringe. They copied almost the annoying cliches of annoying anime, they also copied from good anime, but they did it no justice. I decided to drop after episode 4, but since I was bored I decided to watch eps 5, and KAZAMM!Another cringey cliche and makes-no-sense development. Now I shall reveal to you what those cliches and rip-offs are.\\n\\n\r\nOne: the main heroine has some illness that's gonna kill her. Why? How is this necessary to the plot? Well, it may be necessary to character development, but I do not feel it whatsoever.  Your Lie in April handled this excellently, but 3D Kanojo fucks up everything. For 3D Kanojo, it's just there for the drama and the sad ending or a cliche twist  at the end. Fucking predictable.\\n\\n\r\nTwo: I don't need to mention it since it's obvious, but this thing's \"romance\" is just like Hajimete no Gal. An otaku with a Gyaru. But the thing is, at the very least, the MC in Hajimete no gal is somewhat likable (compares to this guy in 3D Kanojo, the dude is like superman). \\n\\n\r\nThree: it tries to make the MC sounds cool, but it just ends up making MC looks like a weakass bitch, the kind that always get NTR'ed. \\n\\n\r\nFour: Now in episode 5, for whatever reason, they had the same shitty writing as Hajimete no Gal, and what's worst is it's the shittiest part of Hajimete no Gal that is done here in 3D Kanojo. Don't the producers look at other anime's reviews and fan comments to learn to make better anime? Just like in Hajimete no Gal, the gyaru girlfriend gets annoyed and leaves the MC because the MC feels inferior to hot dudes that hit on the gyaru and voices his feeling to the gyaru. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: I do not see how this anime gonna turn into anything good. I have seen bad anime before, but after 3 episodes I will watch them to the end, but this, when I see a new episode comes out, I say to myself \"Yeah, dude, I know you're bored. But that thing will just waste your time. Go find other anime.\" This is the first anime that makes me say that! \\n\r\nTo put it in perspective, I am a very loose score giver (you can check my profile the mean score is above 8), and I give this show 1!!!",

            "content": "I didn't realize I was watching a shoujo anime when I started watching this. \"3D Kanojo\" makes it sound like it was written by some socially inept otaku guy who can't get a date. It wound up following the same path as other shoujo anime in that the relationship advances fairly quickly and the majority of the show is about love problems. However, it didn't follow through like other shows. The relationship starts up and moves forward, but it basically plateaus for the rest of the show without any major developments. The interpersonal relationships are relatively simple and the problems encountered by the characters areoften pretty easy to solve, but every character seems to lack initiative or intuition, so it's easy to get irritated with the characters and story. Parts of the show such as the character's motivations and reactions are somewhat difficult to believe on occasion, but nothing stands out as blatantly unrealistic. All-in-all, it's not a bad show, but I wouldn't call it particularly good either. Thus, I give it a rating of 5. As a shoujo anime, I definitely have a slight negative bias since I'm not the intended audience, but I can still appreciate good writing when I see it and the writing in this show was somewhat mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the technical aspects, the art was pretty good, but it was occasionally difficult to tell which character you were looking at due to similar-looking characters. The music was typical for a shoujo, which means I didn't like it, but it wasn't actually bad by any means. The voice for Itou in particular felt overdone, like they were trying desperately to make him a complete shota character and sacrificed voice quality for it. These aspects can break a show if done poorly and can be the best selling point if done well. For this show, they were up to par, but not so extravagant that they should really boost the rating, which is why my score of 5 is based almost entirely on the story aspect.",

There's still Takanashi, who a lot of gals (and aliens) have as a fitness coach interest, who spreads a rumor that the other high, gullible classmates believe instantly because they haven't been edumacated on doubt, although I doubt that's something that one be spoonfed because most people don't care (which is also a good thing, giving the benefit of the doubt and trusting, not quick to point finger guns and such). And just as I did when gossip went around about me, Tsutsun took it like a champ and didn't really care. For the purpose of the plot continuing, his little bro, Kaoru, and Otonashi's little sis, Anzu, are d-d-d-dating??? KUSO!! They haven't even hit puberty yet, and Kaoru acted as if holding hands wasn't a big deal. Kaoru loses his appetite and Anzu is worried. This is all because of her KISAMA!! of a brother. He then apologizes to their mom (as in she's the mother of all of them, since they'll be in-laws). An excellent display of conflict resolution that doesn't need a Dr. Fill.\\n\\n\r\nHow are your potatoes doing?\\n\\n\r\nNoseblade. A manga I've never heard about. In an EPIC encounter of glasses, glasses-chan and glasses broken by incestuous Iroha-brahh's (fact check: I saw a baby spoiler I shouldn't have and decided to stop fact checking), they meet and later engage in the excited way most of us do when we find one of our fellow anime kinsmen. Jumping and rejoicing happily. ShIkAsHiI! When a male talks to a female, especially with their lack of EXP or acquisition of object ID: garudamonafurendo, envy develops and envelops into the envelope that leads to a beating and e-envelope that leads to a confession. Really wanted to rhyme there. A blade comes between and cuts the eskimo, preventing all nosebleeds. This is a nosebleed-free show! (Noses may vary.)\\n\\n\r\nLater, we find that oyaji's marriage is about to be ruined. He had stuck together with Tsut's mum all these years... Putting that aside, I was really interested when he started talking about glue, but stopped after he mentioned the types of glue.\\n\\n\r\n3DK:RG attempts to be 2.5D while keeping 3 in its title. They thought that they could deceive me and za warudo into rounding it up because the decimal point in the tenths place was at least 5. However, they failed to realize that there's no such thing as decimals when it comes to anime ratings (ignores weighted score of 6.76), and that the anime scientific rule is: when approximating a number x.y, go down. You think we use the silly Cartesian/rectangular/orthogonal coordinate system, bakayaro!? e=mc\u00b3 not today Satan, not today!\\n\\n\r\nThe polygons...\\n\\n\r\n[Score Partitioning]\\n\r\nStory: 4 The polygons.\\n\r\nArt: 10 The polygons.

The interesting story start from here.\r\nIf you want to find unusuall romance, you could start this show\r\nRATING :\r\nArt : 4\r\nSMH, i don't know why, but i think this show art is pretty bad. compare to other old anime that has been released in 2006, that art was better than this art.characters movement is pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 6\\n\\n\r\nNothing special about the sound. i'm not going to say this sounds are bad. background sounds are good enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 5\\n\\n\r\nNo, i don't really like this characters so far. from what tsutsui and his bestfriend did. and this is not a logicaly thing that a popular girl will fall in love with an antisocial guy. just face the fact in real life and you will see it later with your own eyes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 4\\n\\n\r\nI don't really enjoy this show, maybe the main factor because of the arts. if the arts are bad, then you will not enjoy the show. i'm pretty sure you have the same opinion like me. i almost drop this anime because i can't hold of things what happen in the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8\\n\\n\r\nI like the way they made the story. this anime is being adapted from manga and i can say they successful. Romance, drama, and comedy mixed up well and maybe you will have some time that you pissed by the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : 5\\n\\n\r\nnothing much to say, i can say this anime doesn't really successful. once again, the main factor is from the art. so far the story is nice. do i recommend you to watch this ? if you want to watch a romance anime, you can find other anime but not this.",

            "content": "No spoilers.\r\nWhen I first picked this up I was expecting to drop it after one episode.  The premise of basically having an incel somehow get into a relationship with a really pretty girl seemed kind of shallow.  But I was entirely wrong and this is easily one of my favorite high school romance series.  The plot is simple but engaging, and the artwork is admittedly mediocre.  But the thing that makes this anime shine out above other romance anime is the characters.  Every single character is relatable, human, deep, and nuanced.  The authors did an incredible job of keepingtrue to the characters in every situation, and in not subverting their personalities for convenience or plot motion.  Even the characters I wasn't supposed to like ended up being really dear to me, because I can just feel the authenticity behind their dialogue.  I sort of expected a series that felt like it had been written by an otaku incel, but it feels more like the author is really familiar with the motivations and inhibitions of human beings in general.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, this anime didn't get a 10.  It might get a 9 on a rewatch, but overall this was pretty precisely what it wanted to be and no more.  It's hard to put into words what I mean, but the writers had a lot of room to work within with the characters and they didn't keep their plot at the same level of awesomeness as their characters.  Of course, it's meant to be that way, so it's hard to fault the authors for that.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime for anyone who likes character-driven Slice of Life anime.  It really is a diamond in the rough and I wish more people would give it a chance.  Super excited for the second season.",

            "content": "For the first episode of 3D Kanojo: Real Girl, is about an otaku(Tsutsui) who gets detention to clean the pool for some dumb reason and is doing it with the new cute transfer student(Igarashi) and they start dating and become boyfriend and girlfriend. But the catch is that she is moving to another school the next school year.\r\nIf you like highschool drama, small problems and poor depictions of otakus then I recommend this anime. Yeah the romantic escalation is great since anime in general seem to put that off and delay it until the end of the anime. But since Tsutsui is an \"otaku\", hehas trouble understanding feelings and gets himself to all sorts of stupid sh*t and stirs up trouble throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds great, music and voice acting is kawaii out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a great concept but MC is a dumb sh*t so he shakes sh*t up, would be an 8/10 but he makes it a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters would be 7/10 but MC makes it a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 7/10 since feels were stirred when watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it, the beginning and end were satisfying but the middle part of the series felt dragged af and I just wanted it to end. If Igarashi wasn't so cute and her voice so kawaii, I wouldn't even give this anime a second thought. If a season 2 comes out, I'll only watch it if there really is no shoujo to watch. \\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\r\nMC is dumb otaku, girl is cute and would not be watching if she wasn't in it. Concept of story is great but MC is dumb and stirs it all up. I wanted to finish it asap but end feelings were that it was a ride and I'm glad I watched it. MC is still dumb.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

            "content": "Are you a socially awkward otaku who doesn\u2019t understand why mean 3D ladies don\u2019t want your very eligible d? Sick and tired of the Real Girls and 2D waifus are all you need in your laifu? Then oh boy, do I have the perfect anime for you because I sure as hell don\u2019t want it. \r\n3D Kanojo: Real Girl is a painful experience. A lazily shat out romcom that uses cliches and plot contrivances as a crutch to hobble its way through twelve agonizing episodes. Proudly it presents insultingly stereotypical characters that are anything but three dimensional.  \r\nAll you need to do is gazeupon this glorious shitfest and it becomes abundantly clear what the show\u2019s main issue is: it\u2019s fucking hideous. The art is a disaster; backgrounds are a mess of fuzzy colors, there\u2019s very little animation, and in an attempt to stay on model the characters hardly change their expressions. All the show has going for its visuals are the character designs, and even those are just the same faces mediocrely drawn and in worsening quality as the show progresses. \\n\\n\r\nThe love interest, Iroha, has one expression for the majority of the show, pouty sad girl, the main character Tsutsui is more expressive which also means more frequently off model. From time to time you\u2019ll see characters slide across the frame on motion tweens with no animation whatsoever, making it seem like they go to a school for ghosts. And that's the closest the show came to making me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nStiff character animation is partly to blame for the lazy comedy, but also the directing is so slowly paced that even if the dialogue was good (which it isn\u2019t) there wouldn\u2019t be much to enjoy. Awkward doesn't even begin to describe how the dialogue feels, it's clumsy in a way that\u2019s too unnatural to be believable and too poorly timed to hit with any impact. Sharing some of the blame is the monotonous elevator music that adds nothing but a headache to any scene it's present in. \\n\\n\r\nThe moment the opening song starts playing I feel like I\u2019m about to have a stroke, the level of cringiness in the visuals with the depressed singing voice. The singer sounds so downtrodden like he\u2019s about to end his life, I instinctively zip straight over to the mute button so I don\u2019t have to contemplate the void while watching 3D fucking Kanojo. The rest of the soundtrack gives me the sensation of my brain slowly swelling from the aneurysm the droning music gives me. Repetitive looping of the same song with only two piano keys during dramatic scenes, slowly putting more pressure on my skull until I relieve it by turning the volume off. Do you like the sound of printers on repeat? Well, check out the sick beats on these action scenes because these swooshes and boops will knock your socks off. This exceeds all bounds of low budgeting, it\u2019s just plain and simply lazily made. \\n\\n\r\n3D Kanojo falls flat on its face as a comedy, but there\u2019s still room for resonant drama (spoiler alert it\u2019s a cringy disaster too). A story about two emotionally damaged people sorting through their feelings together is an alluring premise, and with a better writer, it could have been good. It\u2019s not fundamentally flawed, it\u2019s just terribly executed. The characterization relies heavily on cliches, and the character-driven story uses only contrivances to progress. Rarely does a development in the characters feel deserved; the story is divided by misunderstandings, a third party drives a rift in the lead pairing, then the conflict is resolved by the end of the chapter rinse and repeat. 3D Kanojo is barely competent because it relies heavily on this formulaic cheap method of telling its story. Even so, a character-driven story is only as good as it's characters allow it, but they're trash too.   \\n\\n\r\nTsutsui begins the show as the standard archetypal boy who hates real girls because people look down on him for liking anime\u2026 That\u2019s not much of a motivation, but the series had room to flesh him out more. And nothing came from it; he remains a mostly oblivious idiot for the entire series. His only \u2018character development\u2019 comes from cheap contrivances that lead him into trouble with his girlfriend then eventually the issues resolve themselves. Instead of subverting the mountain of stereotypes it chooses the cheapest route and gratifies his misogyny by making all of the girls comically cruel to Tsutsui, with the supporting character Ishino to represent the mob of angry cardboard cutouts. Her only excuse for hanging around Tsutsui and his girlfriend is that she\u2019s his childhood friend, yet it doesn\u2019t seem like she has a good reason to be there at all.\\n\\n\r\nIshino constantly verbally and physically abuses Tsutsui to an absurd degree, and of course she repeatedly asks out the boy who accused Tsutsui of being a pedophile. But don\u2019t worry guys he said he was sorry so now he\u2019s allowed to be in their friend group and even go on camping trips with them all (yes this is actually the direction the plot takes). I\u2019m not sure what I was missing here, but how can someone go from actively trying to ruin a person's life to being ol\u2019 pals in the next goddamn episode? It\u2019s a suitably moronic resolution for that tire fire of an arc, but let\u2019s leave it at that because we have more shit to cover and I\u2019d rather not open that can of worms. \\n\\n\r\nLater on in the series, a stereotypical nerdy girl appears to serve as another case of the trope Not Like Other Girls. And of course, she's not allowed to just be an archetype because whenever Tsutsui sees her he accidentally comes onto her, making her fall in love with him. Tsutsui\u2019s obliviousness defies all logic, no human is this much of a bumbling moron. Sadly this is 3D Kanojo and there is no room for logic with all these cliches stuffed in. Of course there is a plotline dedicated to this misunderstanding and the rift it causes between Iroha and Tsutsui. Lazily written misunderstandings fuel most (if not all) of the drama in this series. You\u2019ll always know how to easily resolve a situation episodes before the characters do, it's frustrating and quickly becomes painful to watch unironically.\\n\\n\r\nBefore Tsutsui and Iroha started dating, he sees the Real Girl herself crying alone in public, then proceeds to creepily follow her as she runs errands. Eventually, a shop clerk accuses Iroha of stealing, then he takes it as his chance to take off his hood and emerge from the shadows to defend her. Oh, drool\u2026 what a hero, this actually impresses her. That\u2019s what their relationship is built on, him being a creepy stalker and she is not like other girls for various shallow reasons. At this point (the first episode) the show has divided itself from reality, the main character is no longer relatable and all of the playing into stereotypes the show has done goes nowhere, there is no subversion. The author of Real Hurl genuinely believes that otaku are creeps and the key to a girls heart is stalking her until she like you back, it\u2019s hilariously stupid and borderline gross.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who has worked in retail can tell you if you ever accuse a customer of stealing you will lose your job. The whole scene is stupidly contrived to justify Tsutsui stalking Iroha moments ago. It\u2019s all so she can say to him \u201cwow you are actually a nice guy I should date stalkers more often!\u201d This is exactly why 3D Kanojo doesn\u2019t even work as least cute passive entertainment! It fails at being both a comedy and a drama and is not even enjoyable as passive entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed plenty of cutesy shoujos regardless of trashy writing, Kiss Him Not Me was pretty funny despite the stupid fat joke it was predicated on. There is no part of Real Girl that I found remotely cute or appealing. The main relationship is so codependent yet there\u2019s no actual commentary on codependency. Even though she is the title Real Girl, Iroha has literally no agency in the story. Despite being this tough girl archetype she has so little characterization of her own. She\u2019s pulled around in the story, never allowed to guide its direction. And Tsutsui\u2019s isn\u2019t always the one to drag her around. They even throw in the lowest common denominator \"not blood-related\" brother to tear her and Tsutsui apart in the final misunderstanding fueled chapter. There was even some 100% necessary incestual rOmAnTic TeNsiON that I can barely recall because at this far into the series my mind was shutting itself down to protect my sanity. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the codependency, the main relationship is downright creepy, but the show seems content with calling it cute. I had expected at least some discussion about how the main character literally stalks, takes pictures of, and fantasizes about his girlfriend typically while she\u2019s asleep in the same room as him on multiple occasions (the author\u2019s fetish hmmm??). But oh no, he\u2019s an otaku so that kind of cute behavior is normal right? \\n\\n\r\nNO! This kind of awful stereotype is so moronic that it\u2019s actually offensive. I take back what I said earlier, otakus deserve better than being portrayed like this; watch something, anything else. It\u2019s very clear that the author of Real Girl had no idea what otakus are actually like, and she wrote the main character based on a demographic she does not know firsthand. He\u2019s an otaku because we\u2019re told he is, he likes some trashy magical girl anime because we\u2019re told it\u2019s good and therefore he\u2019s an otaku, he hates women because we\u2019re told so, he\u2019s a socially inept dimwit because characters have to explain his emotions constantly. \\n\\n\r\nTsutsui is so barebones and carelessly written that constantly we\u2019re stumbling into these unanswered questions like; why does he like her, what caused him to hate women, what does he even like about anime??\\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 2/10] Contrived and idiotic beyond belief. \\n\r\n[Character: 1/10] Cliched, archetypal, thoroughly unlikable. \\n\r\n[Art: 2/10] A messy disaster, lacking animation. \\n\r\n[Sound: 3/10] Repetitive and uninspired.  \\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 1/10] Comparable to being lobotomized.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 2/10]\\n\r\n3D Kanojo is so mind-numbingly stupid it defies universal logic, I can feel my IQ rapidly decreasing even at this moment just for contemplating the hamfisted story. But not only is it intellectually insulting, it's downright offensive to anyone who dares to try and relate to these grotesquely portrayed stereotypical characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it off, the final episode closes on a non-ending halfway into the incest arc with a sequel already in the works. I can hear the mangaka laughing at me all the way from Japan because I hoped I could damn this to the void forever. Well, 3D Kanojo can fucking take the last laugh because I sure as hell am not going to waste any more brain cells on this nightmare.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended for those that have finished watching 3D Kanojo Real Girl and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nAn unlikely romance between an Otaku and a popular but broken girl that awakens their heart to the feelings that they have been hiding from \r\nBased off a popular manga of the same name 3D Kanojo real girl better known as Real girl is a romantic comedy anime that gives us the opportunity to look at what will happen if a high school boy shunned byhis fellow classmates for being an otaku was to encounter the beautiful but badly reputed troublemaker Iroha and end up receiving a most unexpected answer to a question that he asked merely as a joke. The first episode of the series made quite the impression on me because of its unique premise of paring an otaku with limited social skills with a popular and beautiful girl that would usually be out of his reach and was interesting enough that I kept it on my watch list and I'm glad that I did. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in a modern-day Japan the overall story of 3D Kanojo girl follows the life of Hikari Tsutsui a high school student that while kind-hearted and decent is shunned by his fellow classmates for being an otaku and his encounter with the beautiful but ill-reputed high school girl Iroha Igaraishi and the surprising romantic relationship that they both embark on thanks to a daring question and a most unexpected answer. As Hikari and Iroha embark on their most unexpected relationship both must learn to break out of the shells that they have hidden behind all their lives and learn that to find what true love is they must first learn to accept the strengths and flaws of both their personalities and overcome the barriers that isolation in society have created in their lives.  \\n\\n\r\nHikari Tsutsui \\n\\n\r\nHikari Tsutsui played by new voice actor Teppei Uenishi is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school student and an anime and game otaku Hikari is a quiet, cynical and blunt person by nature that while intelligent and responsible is someone that is shunned by his fellow classmates due to his interests. As a result of this, in the beginning, Hikari was an anti-social person that was overly negative and preferred to stay detached from interaction with his fellow classmates with is sole friendship within the class being with his fellow otaku Itou. As a result of being shunned by his fellow classmates, in the beginning, Hikari had a hatred of real-life girls and relationships with them and limited the interactions that he had with them preferring instead the animated ones that he sees in anime and manga. While a kind and considerate person by nature as a result of being shunned by his fellow classmates Hikari, in the beginning, was a low-key person and preferred to remain in the background where he can avoid any trouble that comes his way.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on Hikari\u2019s personality gradually starts to change as a result of not just meeting Iroha but also many people that he befriends along the way. Though shunning and viewing romantic relationships with real girls as being nothing but trouble as the series progresses this view of Hikari gradually changes. While nervous about romantic relationships but at the same time curious about them Hikari\u2019s desire to understand them was let down by the fact that he had no experience with it and more importantly had trouble reading the atmosphere and understand a girl\u2019s feelings. However, as Hikari interacts more with Iroha instead of retreating back to his world Hikari gradually becomes braver and more willing to bond with and befriend other people that would have been outside his circle of friends at the beginning showing his determination to change himself and match Iroha. In line with Hikari\u2019s new found desire to bond with and befriend others is his new-found interest in knowing the affairs of others especially Iroha and his new friends and try to solve the problems that they are bothered with to the best of his ability. While still nervous to a degree and having trouble putting his thoughts into words Hikari gradually learns how to get on with real people and as their bonds deepen show them the care and kindness that had been hidden behind his walls. While often frustrated by his inability to read the mood and his lack of experience in love Hikari does not let that stop him and tries hard to not just improve his own personality but also learn more about what love is showing how much he values the relationship he has with Iroha and how much he wants to improve as a person so as to match her. As the series goes on and as Hikari\u2019s relationship with Iroha and his friendships with his friends improve it can be seen that while happy that his life is improving Hikari is somewhat constrained with the fear that perhaps one day all of this can change and that one day he might lose everything that he has gained by meeting Iroha and his friends. But until that day comes Hikari will make the best of the situation. \\n\\n\r\nIroha Igarashi \\n\\n\r\nIroha Igarashi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yu Serizawa of Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A beautiful and popular high school girl that attends the same school as Hikari Iroha is a kind, quiet and polite person by nature that\u2019s also responsible and dutiful. Unlike most girls though Iroha despite having many classmates that want to know her is someone that seemingly prefers the solitude of being alone and as a result, she like Hikari lacks many female friends her age. While a quiet person that tries to stay away from trouble it can be seen however that Iroha is someone that dislikes seeing people get bullied and indeed is someone that respects bravery and determination which is best shown in her first interactions with Hikari. At the beginning of the series, Iroha and Hikari had a very unexpected encounter with one another that would later have much impact on their lives. Unlike the rest of the students that Iroha had met until that point, Hikari was unlike anyone that she had ever met before. While socially awkward in their interactions and having interests in topics that are unknown to her Hikari\u2019s bravery in confessing to her and his determination to stay out of trouble was something that really touched her. While finding Hikari\u2019s interests to be unique Iroha unlike the rest of the student body did not look down on Hikari and instead treated him with due kindness something that puts her in good stead in Hikari\u2019s eyes and contributed greatly to his development as a character. While respecting Hikari\u2019s determination to stay out of trouble it can be seen that Iroha dislikes seeing Hikari and her friends be bullied and will try to find a way to hit back at the bullies to deal with them when she can. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on Iroha\u2019s personality gradually starts to change as she slowly opens up to Hikari and her new-found friends. While a polite, reserved and quiet girl that seems sure of herself on the surface beneath this it can be seen that Iroha actually is a very fragile person at heart. While certainly having more experience than Hikari in matters of love Iroha due to her looks has had to deal with confessions to her on a daily basis which created not just a large amount of stress for her but also an ill-reputed reputation among her schoolmates. As a result, this created within her mind a very negative image of what a proper serious romantic relationship should be like as most people that confessed to her cannot express a reason for why they liked her beyond her looks and thus creating a belief that people only care about her looks and not anything else. As a result of this Iroha while positive and cheerful on the surface is someone that is noted to be very good at creating masks that she wears to hide her true feelings from others something that was necessary in her life until she met Hikari and made new friends. To Iroha while Hikari is unlike any other boy that she has met before they have many issues that they share that enable them to bond easily with one another. The most prominent of these is the isolation that both feel in school and the lack of trust that they have for their fellow classmates due to their past experiences. While both Iroha and Hikari found it very hard to trust each other at first due to Hikari\u2019s kindness to others and Iroha\u2019s struggles to reveal her true feelings as the series goes on and both learn about what true love is this feeling of distrust gradually vanishes as for the first time in her life Iroha is able to place her trust in someone other than herself. While the relationship between Iroha and Hikari may have started off randomly as they interact with each other and learn more about each other Iroha starts to see and understand the true problems in Hikari\u2019s personality but rather ignoring them as most people would start to instead encourage him to be more confident and proactive showing not just her love for him but also in the faith that she has that like her Hikari would be able to overcome the barriers that he has built to protect himself from an unfriendly society. The character of Iroha I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her gradual awakening of her true self and of finding someone that will appreciate everything that she has and not just her looks being the best aspects of her character. I felt that her seiyuu Yu Serizawa really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Iroha.\\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I felt that both the school and the areas that the cast visited during the series were both well designed and animated. The character designs for the cast I felt were also well designed and I also liked the designs of the uniforms that the cast wore as they attended school. The character of Ezomichi which is an anime character from one of Hikari\u2019s favourite shows I felt was interesting as his discussions with it matched well with his desire to find a common ground in society and I felt that her actions in the series which was larger than her role in the manga helped greatly in providing advice to Hikari for the many trials that he had to overcome in the series. In terms of music, I felt that the series OST did a great job of conveying the various moods and feelings that the cast felt as their relationships with each other developed. In particular, I really liked the series opening and ending themes which for the series was Daiji na Koto by Quruli and Hide the Blue by Bish with the former being able to create a sense of calmness while the latter being able to convey a sense of anticipation for the next episode. In terms of voice acting for the series overall, I felt that the series voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I felt that Teppei Uenishi, Yu Serizawa and Reina Ueda who portrayed the characters of Hikari, Iroha, and Sumie did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. The supporting cast for the series while not featured in this review I felt also did a great job supporting the overall story with Minami Tsuda, Shouta Aoi, Takuma Terashima and Sayaka Kanda doing an excellent job at portraying the characters of Arisa Ishino, Yuto Ito, Mitsuya Takanashi and Ezomichi respectively. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall 3D Kanojo girl was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strengths being its unique premise, strong story, excellent characters, excellent voice acting and its integration of various but related themes into the story. While the premise of having an average guy falling in love with one of the schools most popular girls is itself not unusual within the anime world I felt that the unique premise that the series introduced to the concept made it sound even more interesting than the base concept something that definitely caught my interest. Within Japan, the term Otaku is a derogatory term unique to Japan that is used to label people that have obsessive interests in aspects of Japanese popular culture such as anime and manga. The negative nature that this term conveys means that people often look down on otaku and view them with suspicion and often causing distances to form between them and the person in question. Having the main character as an otaku that falls in love with a girl I felt was an interesting premise exactly because the lack of knowledge on basic human to human interactions is something that\u2019s unknown to most otaku and seeing Hikari not only try to confront this overwhelming wall that stands between him and Iroha but make it work was something that really resonated with me. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series I felt was one of its main strong points with its focus naturally being the relationship between Hikari and Iroha after their first meeting. True to most otaku Hikari, in the beginning, was someone that adored the world of anime and manga and as a result, bore a distinct dislike of human girls and interactions with humans that don\u2019t share his passion which combined with his lack of social skills made him an outcast within the class that he was part off. Until Hikari met Iroha his life had always been stable and revolved around anime and his passion for it and being able to share his passion with like-minded friends like Itou. But the fortunate encounter between Hikari and Iroha resulted in the birth of not just the unlikeliest of romantic relationships between them but also created within Hikari a desire to change his personality and for the first time in his life embrace the world that he had for so long been ignoring and as a result learn what it actually means to be a human being. While the relationship between Hikari and Iroha is anything but smooth sailing seeing them both work so hard to overcome the many challenges both physical and mental that laid in their path as they try to understand each other\u2019s personalities was something that I thought the story handled really well. But understanding comes in many forms especially when related to love and being able to bond and connect with your other half on an emotional level is just as important a fact that I thought the story dealt with relatively well in showing the secret insecurities that both Iroha and Hikari confronted and eventually overcome as their relationship developed and blossomed. While the development of Iroha and Hikari via their relationship was, of course, the main focus of the story with it comes a secondary aspect that\u2019s just as important as the main one which is how the rest of the school and their classmates and later friends view them. With few exceptions, most of their classmates viewed the couple with scorn not understanding why and how Iroha ended up as a couple with someone like Hikari. But as their relationship develops and Hikari and Iroha\u2019s hearts start to gradually open as they overcome challenges this sense of hatred gradually starts to vanish as for the first time they can see that both are trying hard to overcome the many things that were holding them back. Watching the opinions and attitudes of the supporting cast of the series change as they bore witness to Hikari\u2019s evolution as a character and seeing them gradually realise their error and become friends with him instead of hating him was something that I really enjoyed seeing because it meant that Hikari\u2019s attempts to improve himself had succeeded. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3D Kanojo girl was a series that I really enjoyed watching with its unique premise, story and character development being its best points. The gradual understanding between Iroha and Hikari of the fact that love is not just about physical attraction but also an emotional attachment to the person that you love was something that I really enjoyed seeing and makes you realise just how deep your love for someone can be. As a final score, I would say that 3D Kanojo girl deserves a final score of 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Typically, a show scored under 7 is garbage. Therefore, it is surprising that this is getting such a poor score.\r\nDon't get me wrong, it's not groundbreaking anime but I saw many shows over 7.5 that are definitely worse than this one. I feel like the MAL score is slowly becoming irrelevant.\r\nI typically can't handle shoujo anime (the pace is so slow, I feel like dying) but there's just enough mystery in the story to keep you interested. The character interactions are indeed awkward and cringey but considering the setting it makes perfect sense.\r\nFrom the setup, it looks like it's supposed to be a drama morethan a rom-com but it has comedic elements. It's a little bit odd that it portrays any other male character (other than the mc and his friend) as being complete assholes, but it doesn't affect your enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth giving a try.",

            "content": "There were two-romcom anime that were airing from the spring 18 season. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. However compare to Takagi San which was more a tease feast instead of a romcom both 3D Kanojo Real Girl Kanojo and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu were actually romcom that uses the character, drama, comedy and narrative to the fullest. However only one of the two romcom anime from the spring 18 season was good and that was Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. What Wotaku love is hard for an okatu has over 3D Kanojo RealGirl is that one the characters were likable, two that show was well paced and three the romance was actually great and believable. As much I want to go into more detail of why Wotaku is a better romcom anime than 3D Girl Kanojo stay tune for my review for Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. In that review I will go into more detail of why I love, Wotaku love is hard for an okatu while I hate this 3D Girl Kanojo which speaking of 3D Girl Kanojo is no contest not only one of the worst anime of 2018 bit is also one of the worst romcoms I have ever seen period.\\n\\n\r\nSo what went wrong with this show?\\n\r\nYour soon gonna find out.\\n\r\nHello everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome to my review of 3D Kanojo Real Girl and with that said let\u2019s begin\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows a generic okatu high school student named Hikaru Tsutsui who is shunned by his classmates for his otaku behavior. One day he gets set to do pool cleaning duty for being late along with a beautiful but reputed troublemaker Iroha Higurashi\u00a0who is also considered an outsider by other students. At first reluctant to even talk to Iroha, Hikari is able to overcome his insecurity and defend her from bullies. In yet another pool-cleaning task, they decide to start a relationship. The catch? Iroha is due to change schools at the end of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is awful.\\n\r\nAm not kidding this is one of the worst romance stories I have ever seen period.\\n\r\nFor starters this show does a horrendous job at portraying the okatu culture. Unlike Wotaku love is hard for an okatu where the show portrays the okatu culture in a more realistic way that is grounded and believable this show this show literally took all of that and throw it out the window in favor being comical and unrealistic. For example in one episode Mitsuya sees Hikaru helping his sister then Mitsuya tells his sister to scream in order for the police to catch him as well branding Hikaru as a\u00a0lolicon\u00a0for days. Okay I understand if you don\u2019t like the person as the well the hobby that he does but you didn\u2019t really have to out of your way to humiliate him in public like that so he can be a easy target for the police.\\n\r\nPeople don\u2019t behave like this and that event alone really shows how bad the character interactions are which I get to talk about now.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 alone is the worst first episode I have ever seen a romcom. Instead of having the two main characters slowly learning about each other the show decides to start off with a very contrived pool scene where they both of them fall into the pool. After that the show decided to have an awkward conversation by having our female lead Iroha ask Tsutsui that he is a virgin and Tsutsui replies honestly. The whole conversation feels forced and unnatural as both characters talk at each other instead of allowed a character they sentence plus nothing from that conversation was remotely interesting and because of these reasons alone the show did a horrendous job at establishing theses characters.\u00a0\\n\r\nTo add insult to injury all of this shit happened in the first episode where both of these characters met for the first time. I would have been okay with this if that happened in later episodes where at that point the two main characters started to understand but having that scene happened in very first of the series really shows how poorly directed and written this series is.\\n\\n\r\nThe single worst thing about the show is that the show itself at times literally forgets that it was a romcom anime as it the show at times devolves into a shitty slice of life anime with a poor portyal of otaku culture which completely kills all the potenal romcom thanks to its stiff character interactions and relationships.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story in 3D Kanojo Real Girl is awful.\\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nIf you the story was bad enough guess what? The character are even worse.\\n\r\nTsutsui is just your boring and unlikable okatu freak who is hard to relate to thanks to his stiff character interactions.\\n\r\nIroha is just your typical easy going girl who jealous a lot. While I liked Iroha more than Tsutsui in terms of personality I still thought she was a pretty mediocre character at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are just throwaway romcom characters that we all seen before as they only to exist to create drama and conflict to the narrative.\\n\r\nOverall the characters were just plan terrible.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nLike with the story and characters the visuals are shit.\\n\r\nThe character designs for 3D Kanojo Real Girl are very uninspired as they look like they were done in 1 hour without a second thought.\\n\r\nThe animation is below average it constaints of shotty camera angles, still frame and overall weak animation.\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\n3D Kanojo has very forgettable soundtrack overall. The same can apply to the shows opening theme however the ending theme was kinda decent.\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the show is pretty decent overall and all the Seiyuus did a fair job on each role.\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is pretty mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a dumpster of a romcom anime that deserves to be burned and forgotten. The story is badly written to the absolute core, the character are all unlikable idiots, mixed with a forgettable ost, weak production values and poor story directing. If you want to watch a good romcom anime from go watch Wotaku love is hard for an okatu instead of this train-wreck.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 2/10",

            "content": "**Disclaimer: This is a Rant**\r\nAfter the second episode of this anime I was expecting this anime to be better than that atrocious first episode. What I got in exchange was a shitty romcom with misleading topics and very infuriating characters... Can't believe that this is getting a second season when a lot of good shows out there are left without a sequel. So lets get into details. (There might be spoilers)\r\nThe \"story\" centers around Tsutsui who is an Otaku who only has one friend (A very shitty friend I must say). well, at least that's what this anime tries to portray on him. He hasnot contact with any humans with the exception of his neko best friend, he spends his spare time watching a mahou shoujo anime and that's pretty much his situation. I don't know what this anime tried to portray, the life of a very bullied kid or a wannabe \"Otaku\", because I'm sure as hell that this isn't the life of an Otaku, but of a socially awkward person who happens to like a Mahou Shoujo anime, I can relate to Tsutsui's situation here and thats why I felt so insulted while watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne day Tsutsui meets the most inconsistent bitch in town and for some reason she falls for him (I barely remember what was the actual reason, what I can recall is that the first episode was a clusterfuck of events) and this is where the trainwreck begins. The rest of the anime is spent in misunderstandings and shitloads of melodrama of the lowest quality possible: Tsutsui \"Fucks up\", Igarashi gets mad because why not, his \"friends\" scold him saying that he is a terrible boyfriend, Tsutsui has an existencial crisis, his Mahou shoujo Waifu conforts him and encourages him, Tsutsui Apologizes, Igarashi blushes and accepts apologize, repeat. This not only gets old, its infurating because the reasons Tsutsui \"fucks up\" aren't such a big deal to be even mad for. Oh!, and lets not forget the plot device that is never touched again: Igarashi supposedly needs to leave town after 6 months and only God knows why... Is Igarashi going to die? never mind that, because that's left unanswered. (although I suspect that's the case)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime are atrocious, some of them acts as \"comic relief\" but dear God, this \"comic relief\" isn't even cringey, it's insulting and infuriating!, how I'm supposed to laugh at a \"mother\" who makes fun of his son and also doesn't support him when he is a suspected child molester? She doesn't even seem to care about his son situation on high school. This is not funny, its sad and infuriating, Tsutsui doesn't even deserve to have such a terrible mother, neither he deserves such shitty friends that are only there at the good times, because whenever Tsutsui \"fucks up\" they shine for their disappearance, or even worse, they act cold against him and insult him, he doesn't even deserve to have such an inconsistent bitch as a girlfriend, I swear, Igarashi must have reached the top 10 worst anime girlfriends in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't that bad but not great either, there are a lot of terrible shots where characters has deformed faces, it also fails on portraying events. And the sound... Thanks God I'm not going to hear their voices ever again.\\n\\n\r\nNow I don't know if this is based on a real story and I don't really care about that, but dear God, this is a terrible depiction of what love is and what friendship is, its also terrible at describing the life of an Otaku, whoever make this totally missed the point of it. Go watch something like \"Welcome to the NHK\" which is miles beyond what this anime tried to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2,5/10\\n\\n",

By two parties, I mean our two main characters. It's so over the top, it is actually quite entertaining to watch.\r\nThe writer keeps throwing romance cliches in such a tempo it can only be called an impressive work. Our main girl is full of opposites. At the same time, she is a whore and an innocent treasure. A strong badass and a crying little girl. It's never certain if what she says is honestor a lie. I view this is a parody towards generic shoujo leads whose behavior makes no sense whatsoever. The lead guy on the other hand is at the same time a loser otaku and an ideal boyfriend. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the ridiculously fast pacing, and the girls constant lies, it's quite hard to get into these characters and call this a good romance. None of it has been made seriously after all, but it does a decent job as a comedy, though it looks like the series will be getting old soon. I can recommend this to folks who have the tendency to hate romances because 3D Kanojo quite well captures all the things that are wrong with them.",

            "content": "It is often said by many that anime is gradually getting worse. As much as I want to deny this, I can't help but reluctantly agree. Over the past few seasons, there had been such a lack of originality and overuse of cliches that besides the occasional 'a place farther than the universe', I'm wondering if anime is even trying anymore. Lets take a look at '3D girlfriend', which, as much as I wanted to like it, I can't help but getting annoyed by how cliche it is.\r\nPlot (4/10): The story to this show is extremely mediocre and predictable. A boy who is an otakuand often bullied meets a girl, the girl changed his initial opinion of 3d girlfriends (whatever that means), falls in love, starts dating, bla bla bla. Basically its 'the world god only knows' except its a whole less original and consists of a single relationship. This may not have been a bad thing except the execution is laughably poor. None of the otaku subplot is explored in a meaningful\\n\r\nway at all, which makes me wonder why the show even made the mc an otaku in the first place. The romance is very bad, with poor chemistry between the characters and is badly paced. I mean, come on! They meet and even started dating on the same day? How does that work?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10): Besides the plot, the characters in this show are very unoriginal as well. The main character, tsutsui, I feel is probably one of the blandest shojo leads I've seen. Not only does he lack any personality whatsoever, but he is also horribly inconsistent. He\\n\r\ngets angry for no particular reason and is then showed to be placid in the next scene. I suppose this show wants to characterize him as a socially awkward type of guy, but if it is, it does a very terrible job at it. Next up, we have the female protagonist, Igarashi, who, while still being better than Tsutsui, is still very boring. The third character, Itou Yuuto, is hardly worth mentioning since the only bit of development he got is as a plot device for being the mc's best friend.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound (5/10): While not being bad, the technical aspects of this show aren't very good either. The character designs are mediocre, with Tsutsui being the typical high school boy with glasses, which was copied from at least 50 other anime with basically the same design and Igarashi looks like the typical shojo lead with wavy hair. The music in the opening is pretty bad in my opinion although for voice acting, I do like Igarashi's voice a lot so I'll keep this category above a 4.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10): Overall, this show so far is pretty bad. I might watch a few more episodes to see if it gets better but I'll put it on-hold for now.",

Im not going to go into telling you what this anime is about since you can literally flick back to the main page and read the bio so Im just going to jump right into how I feel about this anime... (FYI score is fully based on entertainment)\r\nI have never really been in a significant relationship myself... Partly because the idea doesn't appeal to me, I feel as though there is nothing someone of the opposite sex can offer me while ina relationship that I can't get outside of one minus the hassle of going out with someone (of course this could just be me being narrow minded since I haven't been in one) (btw the other half of the reason I havent been in a relationship is because Im just too much of a c**t) so I have no way to say how accurately this anime portrays a socially awkward couple, but even still I want to say just how entertaining this show was... But first, lets look at some of the reasons people might try and avoid this.\\n\\n\r\nWas it repetitive? Yes\\n\\n\r\nDid some of the characters make me want to pull my hair out at times? Yes\\n\\n\r\nDid they shove comedy into some areas it just didn't belong? I think so.\\n\\n\r\nDid it follow almost every cliche romance anime hardships known to man? You already know it.\\n\\n\r\nBest of luck to you all from here on out, this is the unedited stuff coming up and my brain works like a gamer with an apm over 500 (in other words so much crap is going on you start to wonder if everything is even relevant or following a logical order)... Back on track though I think the main reason I liked this anime so much was because of how lighthearted it was (and I dont just mean that in the sense of the humour used), it was relaxing to watch. I binged this thing from 10-4am and when I finally shut my laptop last night and checked the time while setting my alarm I realised just how long I had stayed up watching this... Im not overly craving a second season, I wouldn't rant about it as being one of the best anime I have ever watched. But the fact that I could kill 6 hours without even realising it, I could have a good laugh and I could get that stupid grin on my face like a 5 year old who has just been told by his parents they will buy him icecream later then I think that is a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway in summary, I thought the anime was laid back, chill, fun to watch, interesting and kind of refreshing (Maybe because I wouldnt normally watch stuff like this idk) and if you have a few hours to spare I would certainly say you should give it a go, I mean you have nothing to loose, what you see at the start is what you get. If you don't like the first 3 episodes then I guess your relationship with this anime wasn't meant to be...........................................................................",

            "content": "This anime popped up on kissanime before I had a chance to even look at it's score from MAL. From what I've seen so far I've been surprised that such a cliched and typical plot could produce such a quality anime.\r\nThe qualities of this anime does not lie in an amazing plot, or even perfect and picturesque artwork. Its strength lies in the characters and the style in which the plot is presented. While the plot may be cliched, you're made to feel like you've never seen an anime like it before. Other reviewers have claimed that it is full of cringe cliches, however, theway the relationship is explored is what varies it from other shoujo romance animes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to explain how I feel about this anime. It's like having constant butterflies, in the sense that I can't predict what's going to happen next. Perhaps 'what's' was the wrong word, I feel like I can't predict how the next scene is going to occur. Anyways, I'm not gonna give a full review because the show isn't over and I feel like the characters is the only thing you really need to worry about review. That's because the whole show and what makes it good is the uniqueness and earnestness (not sure if this is a word) of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10: It's hard to explain why I love the two main characters so much. Everything about them feels both real and unique. While they both have typical anime traits, they represent real problems facing actual people. The male main clearly has social anxiety, and self esteem issues which are cleverly woven into the plot and with his relationship with the female main. The female main character has a much deeper and harder to read psychological profile. She is both forward and reserved, both a liar and a wholesome girl. The studio have alluded to reasons why she is the way she is, but they have smartly kept their hand hidden with that information. This uneasiness adds to the feeling of butterflies mentioned before, they use a combination of lowkey foreshadowing, and her personality and behavior itself to make you feel like something bad is going to happen. You feel like you know already, but it makes me want to watch it even more. Yet the uneasy feeling never fades. The foreshadowing such as her 'lying' about a terminal illness or her parents not being there when Tsuntsun visits/stalks her just makes it impossible for me to takes my eyes away from this show. I could write so very much more on just these characters, however, I'll save it for a full review if ya'll want to see it.",

In fact, all it took for me was to wait outuntil after the opening theme. The first bit right before the opening of the first episode had me rolling my eyes, but by the time I got half way through the episode, I was already ready to continue to the next one. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing I like most about the two main characters in particular is that although they start off based on a sort of cliche, the story launches itself from there by way of much deeper character development. I even believe that the title of this anime is slightly misleading, as the anime itself doesn't truly put nearly as much emphasis on \"2D vs 3D\" as I originally expected. These characters felt relatable and were most definitely deeper and more emotionally thought out than their initial cliche summaries. Not everyone enjoys a simple light hearted romcom (although I admit this one had me crying more than laughing), but for those who do, it is worth the watch. Thank you.",

            "content": "Believe me when the description of anime starts with \"____ is an otaku\" I typically run away, but on a whim I decided to give this a shot and look at this for what it is. \r\nThe story is not very compelling, it is a cliche Messiah complex story where some beautiful girl saves a loser from his life, and he learns to function as a normal individual. What this anime does with this; however, is why it is above par. \r\nThe pacing is great, rather than waiting 12-24 episodes for a love connection dopamine hit the anime zigs and zags with peaks and lows,the ability to connect to the story comes from the strong female lead who is unique in her own right. The character is a liar, who sees the good in people, shes also an outcast, and very honest, however none of this is done as a selling point, her tag line wouldn't be Iroha the liar, these are all just facets of the personality the author has crafted for her without over accentuating elements to make it seem like some kind of caricature. She feels real, like an attainable idolization of a modern woman. What I don't like in media is this idiotic completely inhuman moral compass where a character will freak out at another character for lying to them, it's completely unrealistic, people lie constantly and daily, it is a necessary action. Demonizing it to the point where it becomes a major plot advancement is idiotic. Morality is relative, even personal morality depends on the context and the nuance that is why it is possible to be both a liar and an honest person at the same time which is what the author took advantage of. \\n\r\nAbove all she is understanding and forgiving to the main character, putting up with his floundering without backing down thus far. \\n\\n\r\nThe male lead is less interesting but still a well written character his thoughts really reflect that of an autistic guy with no friends. The way he acts and the way he talks is not a cliche woops my hand slipped on your tit anime, it's more of a guy who is completely lost in human interactions and has no idea how to emote or act. He speaks some funny lines and has moments of redemption, but ultimately his 180 turns in between episodes are exhausting, they go from making so much progress as a couple to him batting her hand away. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's enjoyable and I don't think people are giving it a fair chance because of the cliched premise. \\n",

Especially towards the end where it was noticed that the series was forced to end.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, with this disadvantage, it was not an easy job that had Deko Akao at the time of making the scripts of the series; However, I think he lost a great opportunity to polish the plot and develop all the arcs much better.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is that in each of the arcs it became clear that the rhythm was not adequate and that many times time was lost thinking about things that did not need it, and then resolving conflicts in a hurry.\\n\\n\r\nThis is very clear when Iroha's brother is introduced. In fact, considering that it is very likely that the staff knew that this series had the second season almost from the beginning, I would have preferred that this character would not appear yet.\\n\\n\r\nI think those episodes could have been used to tell arcs much better like Hikaru being charged as lolicon, or the whole issue related to Sumie (which is one of the best arcs in the series)\\n\\n\r\nIn favor of 3D Kanojo I must say that it dared to tell its story from an atypical point of departure and that it was not afraid to explore the possibilities offered by having established the main couple from the moment we go.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the chemistry between Iroha and Hikaru was one of the strong points; In addition, on many occasions, the series managed to escape stereotypes and easy exits every time it presented conflicts. However, not being able to present these conflicts with an adequate rhythm and progression, in the end they lacked impact.\\n\\n\r\nAt no time was it felt that the main couple was in danger and this ended up causing those problems to pass without pain or glory. At this point I want to clarify that it is not mandatory to make the couple run the risk of breaking up to maintain an interesting plot. Series like Horimiya or, more recently, Wotakoi are convincing proofs of it; however, when the series wants to take that course, it has to do so by betting everything.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the plot, of the antagonists and of the conflict itself has to have an adequate rhythm so that the audience can get involved. 3D Kanojo was never able to achieve this and it was largely because of how quickly everything was solved or to use bad characters in the role of villains (with bad characters I mean poorly created)\\n\\n\r\nMitsuya as an antagonist was a joke because his arc was resolved in two seconds (almost literally) and Chika barely had time to do anything because his mere introduction this season was a mistake given the little space he had to develop his character. Only the arc of Sumie managed to shine a little although a lot of potential was also wasted with this plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, despite everything, I will give the staff the benefit of the doubt and hopefully for the second season improve these details and give us a memorable outcome. Especially because the best arcs of the manga will come, although they were not developed in the best way, it could be polished in their adaptation to the anime. By the way, MANGA SPOILERS INCOMING.\\n\\n\r\nBut before the spoilers I think it is necessary to highlight that 3D Kanojo did something that is very rare to see in the current anime; during the post-credit scene they took the opportunity to announce the second season of the series. How many times have we seen something like this? At least it is curious and shows that the studio has faith in the project (It is true that the announcement had already been made via Twitter one day before the final episode was broadcasted, but it is still curious)\\n\\n\r\nNow, about that second season I must say that arcs like the relationship between Yuuto and Sumie, the first time of Iroha and Hikaru; and the operation of Iroha deserve to be rewritten so that its plot has more development. Especially so that their outcomes are not abrupt as in the original work. It is a great challenge, but it is perfectly achievable.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section, Hoods Entertainment did not use too much budget in this series. The animation is regular with terrible moments, the soundtrack is generic and the direction was not to launch rockets. Only the design of characters is remarkable because it must be recognized that they improved a lot the manga designs.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a daring series that sought to escape stereotypes of the genre, but that never found the rhythm and proper development in the conflicts presented, subtracting impact to all. Let's see if the second season bounce it back.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nThe series had to give much more, but a bad development in its arcs prevented it from having a much greater impact.",

            "content": "Unfortunately this is a bad one. It's not actually telling a consistent story, it's just a series of teen love problems each fitted into the frame of an episode. The show at random picks clich\u00e9s to ignore and embrace never to actually address them. They create tension out of thin air and simply drop it after a set amount of time having that conflict. For that purposes they don't shy away from abusing serious and extreme topics for minor conflict. \r\nCharacter consistency is barely existent as both MCs will just randomly express the sentiment and emotions needed at this point of time in the episode.Since none of the characters has anything qualifying as virsually unique to itself the art style comes off as underwhelmingly generic.\\n\\n\r\nI dropped this show twice. The first time half way into the first episode the second time after the fourth. It's moronic and steretypic and if you think you might be the target audience of this, you should feel a little insulted. \\n\\n\r\nDon't bother.

Now let's get down to it,\r\nIt's absolutely appalling.\r\nFlat characters. Stupid development. Trying to make MC looks like some saintly dude when he's just a m*****f*cking pussy of a human being. \r\nThe anime is a clusterfuck of cliches and cringe. They copied almost the annoying cliches of annoying anime, they also copied from good anime, but they did it no justice. I decided to drop after episode 4, but since I was bored I decided to watch eps 5, and KAZAMM!Another cringey cliche and makes-no-sense development. Now I shall reveal to you what those cliches and rip-offs are.\\n\\n\r\nOne: the main heroine has some illness that's gonna kill her. Why? How is this necessary to the plot? Well, it may be necessary to character development, but I do not feel it whatsoever.  Your Lie in April handled this excellently, but 3D Kanojo fucks up everything. For 3D Kanojo, it's just there for the drama and the sad ending or a cliche twist  at the end. Fucking predictable.\\n\\n\r\nTwo: I don't need to mention it since it's obvious, but this thing's \"romance\" is just like Hajimete no Gal. An otaku with a Gyaru. But the thing is, at the very least, the MC in Hajimete no gal is somewhat likable (compares to this guy in 3D Kanojo, the dude is like superman). \\n\\n\r\nThree: it tries to make the MC sounds cool, but it just ends up making MC looks like a weakass bitch, the kind that always get NTR'ed. \\n\\n\r\nFour: Now in episode 5, for whatever reason, they had the same shitty writing as Hajimete no Gal, and what's worst is it's the shittiest part of Hajimete no Gal that is done here in 3D Kanojo. Don't the producers look at other anime's reviews and fan comments to learn to make better anime? Just like in Hajimete no Gal, the gyaru girlfriend gets annoyed and leaves the MC because the MC feels inferior to hot dudes that hit on the gyaru and voices his feeling to the gyaru. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: I do not see how this anime gonna turn into anything good. I have seen bad anime before, but after 3 episodes I will watch them to the end, but this, when I see a new episode comes out, I say to myself \"Yeah, dude, I know you're bored. But that thing will just waste your time. Go find other anime.\" This is the first anime that makes me say that! \\n\r\nTo put it in perspective, I am a very loose score giver (you can check my profile the mean score is above 8), and I give this show 1!!!",

            "content": "I didn't realize I was watching a shoujo anime when I started watching this. \"3D Kanojo\" makes it sound like it was written by some socially inept otaku guy who can't get a date. It wound up following the same path as other shoujo anime in that the relationship advances fairly quickly and the majority of the show is about love problems. However, it didn't follow through like other shows. The relationship starts up and moves forward, but it basically plateaus for the rest of the show without any major developments. The interpersonal relationships are relatively simple and the problems encountered by the characters areoften pretty easy to solve, but every character seems to lack initiative or intuition, so it's easy to get irritated with the characters and story. Parts of the show such as the character's motivations and reactions are somewhat difficult to believe on occasion, but nothing stands out as blatantly unrealistic. All-in-all, it's not a bad show, but I wouldn't call it particularly good either. Thus, I give it a rating of 5. As a shoujo anime, I definitely have a slight negative bias since I'm not the intended audience, but I can still appreciate good writing when I see it and the writing in this show was somewhat mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the technical aspects, the art was pretty good, but it was occasionally difficult to tell which character you were looking at due to similar-looking characters. The music was typical for a shoujo, which means I didn't like it, but it wasn't actually bad by any means. The voice for Itou in particular felt overdone, like they were trying desperately to make him a complete shota character and sacrificed voice quality for it. These aspects can break a show if done poorly and can be the best selling point if done well. For this show, they were up to par, but not so extravagant that they should really boost the rating, which is why my score of 5 is based almost entirely on the story aspect.",

A lot of boys (and girls) have Iroha as a love interest, but ultimately lose to Tsutsun after he wins the scramble competition. There's still Takanashi, who a lot of gals (and aliens) have as a fitness coach interest, who spreads a rumor that the other high, gullible classmates believe instantly because they haven't been edumacated on doubt, although I doubt that's something that one be spoonfed because most people don't care (which is also a good thing, giving the benefit of the doubt and trusting, not quick to point finger guns and such). And just as I did when gossip went around about me, Tsutsun took it like a champ and didn't really care. For the purpose of the plot continuing, his little bro, Kaoru, and Otonashi's little sis, Anzu, are d-d-d-dating??? KUSO!! They haven't even hit puberty yet, and Kaoru acted as if holding hands wasn't a big deal. Kaoru loses his appetite and Anzu is worried. This is all because of her KISAMA!! of a brother. He then apologizes to their mom (as in she's the mother of all of them, since they'll be in-laws). An excellent display of conflict resolution that doesn't need a Dr. Fill.\\n\\n\r\nHow are your potatoes doing?\\n\\n\r\nNoseblade. A manga I've never heard about. In an EPIC encounter of glasses, glasses-chan and glasses broken by incestuous Iroha-brahh's (fact check: I saw a baby spoiler I shouldn't have and decided to stop fact checking), they meet and later engage in the excited way most of us do when we find one of our fellow anime kinsmen. Jumping and rejoicing happily. ShIkAsHiI! When a male talks to a female, especially with their lack of EXP or acquisition of object ID: garudamonafurendo, envy develops and envelops into the envelope that leads to a beating and e-envelope that leads to a confession. Really wanted to rhyme there. A blade comes between and cuts the eskimo, preventing all nosebleeds. This is a nosebleed-free show! (Noses may vary.)\\n\\n\r\nLater, we find that oyaji's marriage is about to be ruined. He had stuck together with Tsut's mum all these years... Putting that aside, I was really interested when he started talking about glue, but stopped after he mentioned the types of glue.\\n\\n\r\n3DK:RG attempts to be 2.5D while keeping 3 in its title.

The interesting story start from here.\r\nIf you want to find unusuall romance, you could start this show\r\nRATING :\r\nArt : 4\r\nSMH, i don't know why, but i think this show art is pretty bad. compare to other old anime that has been released in 2006, that art was better than this art.characters movement is pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 6\\n\\n\r\nNothing special about the sound. i'm not going to say this sounds are bad. background sounds are good enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 5\\n\\n\r\nNo, i don't really like this characters so far. from what tsutsui and his bestfriend did. and this is not a logicaly thing that a popular girl will fall in love with an antisocial guy. just face the fact in real life and you will see it later with your own eyes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 4\\n\\n\r\nI don't really enjoy this show, maybe the main factor because of the arts. if the arts are bad, then you will not enjoy the show. i'm pretty sure you have the same opinion like me. i almost drop this anime because i can't hold of things what happen in the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8\\n\\n\r\nI like the way they made the story. this anime is being adapted from manga and i can say they successful. Romance, drama, and comedy mixed up well and maybe you will have some time that you pissed by the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : 5\\n\\n\r\nnothing much to say, i can say this anime doesn't really successful. once again, the main factor is from the art. so far the story is nice. do i recommend you to watch this ? if you want to watch a romance anime, you can find other anime but not this.",

The premise of basically having an incel somehow get into a relationship with a really pretty girl seemed kind of shallow.  But I was entirely wrong and this is easily one of my favorite high school romance series.  The plot is simple but engaging, and the artwork is admittedly mediocre.  But the thing that makes this anime shine out above other romance anime is the characters.  Every single character is relatable, human, deep, and nuanced.  The authors did an incredible job of keepingtrue to the characters in every situation, and in not subverting their personalities for convenience or plot motion.  Even the characters I wasn't supposed to like ended up being really dear to me, because I can just feel the authenticity behind their dialogue.  I sort of expected a series that felt like it had been written by an otaku incel, but it feels more like the author is really familiar with the motivations and inhibitions of human beings in general.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, this anime didn't get a 10.  It might get a 9 on a rewatch, but overall this was pretty precisely what it wanted to be and no more.  It's hard to put into words what I mean, but the writers had a lot of room to work within with the characters and they didn't keep their plot at the same level of awesomeness as their characters.  Of course, it's meant to be that way, so it's hard to fault the authors for that.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime for anyone who likes character-driven Slice of Life anime.  It really is a diamond in the rough and I wish more people would give it a chance.  Super excited for the second season.",

            "content": "For the first episode of 3D Kanojo: Real Girl, is about an otaku(Tsutsui) who gets detention to clean the pool for some dumb reason and is doing it with the new cute transfer student(Igarashi) and they start dating and become boyfriend and girlfriend. But the catch is that she is moving to another school the next school year.\r\nIf you like highschool drama, small problems and poor depictions of otakus then I recommend this anime. Yeah the romantic escalation is great since anime in general seem to put that off and delay it until the end of the anime. But since Tsutsui is an \"otaku\", hehas trouble understanding feelings and gets himself to all sorts of stupid sh*t and stirs up trouble throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds great, music and voice acting is kawaii out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a great concept but MC is a dumb sh*t so he shakes sh*t up, would be an 8/10 but he makes it a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters would be 7/10 but MC makes it a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 7/10 since feels were stirred when watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it, the beginning and end were satisfying but the middle part of the series felt dragged af and I just wanted it to end. If Igarashi wasn't so cute and her voice so kawaii, I wouldn't even give this anime a second thought. If a season 2 comes out, I'll only watch it if there really is no shoujo to watch. \\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\r\nMC is dumb otaku, girl is cute and would not be watching if she wasn't in it. Concept of story is great but MC is dumb and stirs it all up. I wanted to finish it asap but end feelings were that it was a ride and I'm glad I watched it. MC is still dumb.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

Now enough of the spoilers, what weactually have here was somewhat of a RomCom, tha somehow doesn't feel like one, cu'z the whole plot of the story was more of how the relationship of the the two underwent from a lot of challenges form Tsutui getting a knuckle sandwich from a lotta hot guys including the THOT's oniichan who has some siscon on his THOT Imouto, were the loser otaku is a subject of jealousy, to a girl rightful for that loser otaku who came in on a wrong timing to the THOT's own insecurity of losing her loser otaku boyfriend. Strywise, is was good, but on the character level the otaku loser ia very much irritating, when he flip flops from having trust issues with his THOT girlfriend to be too insecure about himself of deserving such THOT girlfriend, that he never taken the advantage of banging her when it was petty obvious that he only needs to ask . Also, the plot mentions about that THOT who would leave after six months, now on that part, that is where it falls short of what could be a good dramatic scenario where Hood Entertainment and the anime director never took advantage of , instead they decide to just go for a happy ever after ending that has made this a bit of a bore. so what gives about me rating this anime?\\n\\n\r\nStory-Fair 6: The story plot starts out too fast.\\n\\n\r\nArt-Decent 4: There is that usual knee high stockings with Iroha, but none of that onsen , panty and bikini services.\\n\\n\r\nSound-Fair 6: Not a lot of emotions on that THOT's voice. But good opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Poor 3: Since that loser otaku keeps flip flopping of whether or not he should be with that THOT and his insecurities was pretty much getting on my nerves, when he could have banged her already.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Good 7: this is the part were I can say \"Not Bad.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall-Decent 4: Since you'd guys would be better off watching the live actions where it doesn't imitate the anime as a whole and also, it can be classified as true rom com, thai however is not bad, that thing was that the director never used up the part where the THOT would leave after 6 months....so again watch the live action, if you want the real romcom of this series , it would be  more worth it that this anime.",

            "content": "In a word this was \"Disappointing\".\r\nWhen I first saw the manga was going to get an anime, I was elated and as a fan of the original I was anticipating it. I already knew how good the plot was so even when after the first episode it started to get bad, I decided to not judge it until the end. As the series proceeded forward it got blander and more disappointing. But I will write this review without being biased on the manga so you can expect an opinion solely on the anime.\r\n STORY: \r\nA socially awkward stereotypical otaku ends up going out with themost beautiful girl in school. Turns out both the MCs are bad at communicating and so they really make you frustrated throughout the series with heaps of misunderstanding. But anyway ignoring my personal feelings, this whole relationship helps our otaku guy to interact with \"real\" people more and well yeah, in a clich\u00e9d way, get friends aside from his virtual life. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the depth of the story goes, that the anime showed. this was it. Nothing deep, nothing that would essentially make it interesting. So a stereotypical romance with elements like school, rivals, friends, siblings, gossip etc \\n\\n\r\nART: \\n\r\nHERE IT IS, THE MOST CONCERNING PART OF THE SHOW! SO yeah ts an anime, with anime art. It has anime people in it that move in a weird way, and have different faces in different circumstances, in different scenes. The character movements were stiff as hell, some positions don't make sense. The overall show tbvh was ruined thanks to the art and how it was animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nIt didn't stand out much but there were some BG sounds that didn't fit the mood and made no sense to me. But the sound tracks in an anime for me needs to stand out and in this case it didn't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\n//SIGHS// //SIGHS// \\n\r\n...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nLet me just say, I do not even know Ito's first name.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it much. A part of that could be because I was expecting a lot from this. The manga has so MUCH MORE to offer that were not included mostly because it only has 12 episodes. But even when that is considered I think a MUCH better job could've been done here. The story was basically incomplete like any other rom-com and it was uninteresting. I could honestly say I only liked the first episode and then it went down stream.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy advice: Please read the manga if the plot seems interesting to you. Otherwise, NO, I would not really recommend this one.",

            "content": "I made review back then. At first, it was good, but, as the series progress, it's getting predictable and not enjoyable to watch. I was even thinking of dropping this one but consider nothing doing so as I already reach the end...\r\nThe plot or the story is good if you ask me but the characters and some scenes ruin it. The story goes around on an anime otaku and a girl which is beautiful but have a bad reputation when it comes to having a relationship. Also, as I finish watching the last episode, it felt unfinished. The 12th episode is showing us that there'smore to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was decent but it started to drop its quality in later episodes, mostly on the last 2 episodes. They become more static and get even chubbier or wider or simply put, rushed. I don't if my eyes have a problem but that's what I see...\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is decent. But not as good as the other shows I watched. But hey, atleast I don't hate it nor like it.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, welp, as I mentioned earlier, they ruined the plot. The characters becoming cringy as the shows progress. For the first 4 episodes, the characters looks good but as it goes on, they get worst. I think, the only characters that had a good personality where the supporting characters which are Arisa and Mitsuya.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for enjoyment, welp, it starts to drop from 9 to 6. The ending is really the one that ruin it. Mix it with other things that also ruin the show. And suprise suprise! It has incest on it. Wow! I would like the show if it's main plot was incest but no, it suddenly came out of nowhere. That's why I started to not enjoy watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show has a good beginning but a terrible presentation and ending. The ending could be a good one but unfortunately, they add a scene which question's you why you have watch such thing. My last words will be, watch at your own risk.\\n",

            "content": "- Finally my review of 3D Kanojo; beginning with the story that for me, is the strongest point of the work, a pity that was wasted because of a bad direction, in short, the story tackles very interesting subjects, including themes like difficulties in relationships, something that I found great in the work, because the story in fact has much more than a simple romantic comedy, pity that had a bad direction; but the story itself, is simply brilliant, and extremely interesting.\r\n- Now about the technical part, unfortunately this is one of the negative points of 3D Kanojo, the technical part is simply weak, bothits animation and its visual as a whole are very weak even for a romantic comedy; the visual is extremely inconsistent and poor, as well as its animation, already the direction, this is another point that the anime sins, 3D Kanojo has an extremely interesting story but very badly worked unfortunately, the direction is half-mouth; already the soundtrack, at least this is saved, is a good soundtrack, but that still could have been better as well.\\n\\n\r\n- About the cast of characters, is a good cast for a romantic comedy anime, the supporting characters are very charismatic, since their protagonists are simply weak and they certainly could have been better developed; in general does not have much to say about the cast, is a good cast, but with poor protagonists.\\n\\n\r\n- Conclusion, the second season of 3D Kanojo has already been announced, so it may be that in the second season the direction and production were better, already the first season, I found a little weak, was an anime with great potential, but unfortunately it was badly worked because of his bad direction and production; is an anime that I recommend only to anyone who wants something to pass the time, nothing more; unfortunately 3D Kanojo is expendable !! \ud83d\ude14 !!\\n\\n\r\n- My favorite song of 3D Kanojo \ud83d\udc96 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzSWo0Z0uyM\\n\\n\r\n- My page about animes on facebook \ud83d\udc96 : https://www.facebook.com/pg/AnimeSpaceBR.050/posts/?ref=page_internal\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9b !!",

I could draw better. \r\nSo, we have our classic lonely otaku protagonist that goes and just so casually acts like a normie and finds a girl. So original. This show is as smart as 'him and her' that do not think before doing anything then the \"she\" gets in fightswith him, like \"B.... please!\", the MC already has no idea what life is about!\\n\\n\r\nGood things about the show: Decent sounds, but I don't mean footsteps. They even failed there, music that is missing but they have a good ending, that is respectable. Yea, that is much you can take from this show. The good part of the show is only at the start, the emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThings I hate about this show: Footsteps. -- y cani nutt heer u? --\\n\r\nSounds are bad, most of the times lacking, missing and there's no music. \\n\r\nArt sucks. After all, it's a H-Studio. \\n\r\nTypical characters and interactions. \\n\r\nThe show stops making sense after third episode, or even during the middle of third.\\n\r\nEmotions are not on point like I previously stated after episode 1. You start wondering you really would feel \"like that\" - poorly animated. \\n\r\nI enjoyed like the first 2 episodes because I could relate to myself when I 14-15 years, but seriously what the *heck* they are 17-18 years OLD, like wtf those apes don't have common sense?! - Indeed - ain't smart. \\n\r\nStupid use of flashbacks, even so they are poorly presented and give you no emotions or way to react.\\n\\n\r\nLife is too short to spend it eating *crap* content. \\n\r\nTime to drop it, I think. \\n\r\nGo watch something good. \"Old, Classic\" - Your 16 Year Old Ogii-chan.\\n\r\n[* *] - Please use a synonym I am not allowed to use.\\n",

            "content": "People are being too harsh on this show whereas some really bad shows have better score. \r\nFirst of all, I've read the manga many times because that's how much I love it. \r\nThe plot is your typical otaku romance, so nothing new here. The main difference about the other is that the male protagonist,Tsutsui, is not the typical not-doing-on-purpose-but-end-up-with-an-ecchi-scene. And he is really a realistic character not the usual working hard paid off. The female protagonist, Igarashi, is likeable and understanding about her boyfriend, well she doesn't speak much but she's pretty cool. And tbh, she's pretty and have a great personnality, why would anyonedislike her? (I'm not saying much about her because it might be a spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound overall is good nothing crazy nor bad, just normal and forgettable. However the voice actors, in my opinion, have been badly chosen. Igarashi's voice actress sometimes is so bland and expressionless, I know she stayed mostly indifferent but, in the manga she looks like to have more feelings. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice and I kinda like that style, it changed a bit from all those sparky anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhereas I gave a score of 9/10 to the manga, the anime deserves only a 7.5/10 imo. The way how the anime progress and how the story looks so rushed, even though it's understandable with only 12 eps, didn't really give me the same amount of enjoyment as the manga.",

This is early on in the series. Will edit as my opinions change and will notify]\r\nScores~ Story [6] Art [7] Sound [6] Character [7] Enjoyment [7] Overall [6.6] \r\nStory [6] \r\nThis anime breathes life into an already dense genre; Romance. It gives watchers incentives to watch the anime, to follow the development of the character and to cede their emotionsinto the relationships within the series. By no means is it a complete rejuvenation of the genre, as it rather rushes this new breath. but it instead dictates its own identity against the stereotypes of Anime romance. It's not an \"ugh not again\" but breathes enough life for the story to be over average in its department.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7]\\n\r\nPerhaps its strength but is not for everybody. 3D utilises a brighter and vibrant style which suits the tone of the anime; bubbly and romantic. Sure, it doesn't appeal to everyone's eyes, and it rather looks plain and oversaturated at times, but its quality is good and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nSound [6]\\n\r\nOp and ending songs are solid, to say the least. However, the major strife I currently have is the sometimes poor connection with the voice and the character. There are times which the voice is intriguing and pushes me into interest towards a character but there are times where I am left bored as voices get bland periodically. Not a complete strength of the anime but it holds up its role.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [7] \\n\r\n3D messes with the usual roles within an \"anime romance\" and provides us with refreshing perspectives for us to enjoy. 2 completely new people coming together to make things happen, and I enjoy it. The character themselves have some identifiable depth in the beginning and progress a bit rapidly due to the plot but all in all, the individuals are interesting to follow and hold up to their expected reactions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [7]\\n\r\nThe ability to follow 2 new identities in their pursuit of romance is [currently] enjoyable. I'm finding myself wanting to see the next episode and wondering the possibilities that may happen in the next episode. The series is keeping my attention early on but doesn't do anything past that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [6.6] \\n\r\n3D Kanojo breathes a fresh breath into the dense genre of romance which is both enjoyable as a side series and is able to keep your interest (early on anyway) as the story proceeds in its development. \\n\r\n[edit 1: Grammar]",

One of the things that I liked is the end, it felt really closed and satisfying. 6 is good, not bad, I kinda liked the show. \r\nCharacters: ok character development for the most part, Ito and Ayado felt like the weaker characters in the show. Most of the cast is or becomes pretty likeable.\r\nSound: OST is OK, VA too.\r\nArt: kinda cute, not bad but it's like... too bright.\r\nAnimation: A disaster,especially after the first half of s1, it doesn't get better than that. Really clunky, lazy and funny.\\n\\n\r\nStory: a romantic drama, simple as that. The side characters get a lot of attention and that is something that I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nMayor issue: the drama feels too forced and repetitive sometimes, especially in the episodes that I listed as painful. Ito and Ayado were annoying for me. The MC and everything Otaku related feels too exaggerated. At least the MC improves and starts to act like a person.\\n\\n\r\nOverrall: cute romantic drama with some comedy here and there that doesn't do that much, it has an ending. If you want some romance or drama then you could watch it, but there are some better shows out there.",

            "content": "So from what i have been seeing from other reviews people really didn't like this anime at all. I was wondering why that was so i decided to give it a watch and then see what i thought in the end. After watching this season of the show i can say that i actually like this anime. Not a lot but i did like it. I find the romance very nice and seeing the progress of the main characters change was also very nice. Seeing Iroha Igarashi go from this person that is a social outcast, doesn't like real girls, and likes to watch animewith his best friend Y\u016bto It\u014d. To become this person that wants to make his relationship with Hikari Tsutsui actually work. \\n\\n\r\nFirst what i thought about the story. I think the story was really good. I felt really close to Iroha because the people around me don't understand the reason why i like anime in the first place. Then when i try and explain it i get made fun of for it. So i understood what Iroha was going through. On top of that this anime had great character building moments not just with Iroha, but with all of the main and side characters you see through out the show. Most of the time you only see the change of only the main characters, but with this show you see all of the characters change in some way shape or form and that is what i really like about the story. There were times were i thought the story didn't make sense or didn't really need to be there, but all in all i really did like this story.\\n\\n\r\nNext the art. The art used for some of the scenes were very interesting when a romantic moment was happening. I liked when the background would change to this different art style to show how important the moment. It give meaning to the characters romantic relationship and not something you want to ignore. When i see an anime to something different with its art style instead of sticking to the same backgrounds and same colors i cant help but enjoy that anime even more just because they do something different with the art. \\n\\n\r\nNow the sound. The sound effects for the anime were pretty good. Nothing really popes up as exciting to me, but that's only through the sound effects. The music is something else though. When the mood changes or a character is thinking about something the music helps with this to make the viewer understand what the characters are going through. In real life when you think you always have a song in the back of your mind that plays when you want to think very long over something. This is what this anime does with the actually characters. They set the music to be emotionally to the character or characters depending on the scene and that's something i also like about anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about the characters. I have already talked a little bit about them in the beginning of this review, but there are a few more things i would say about them. Overall each character has a unique personality to them and when they all meet with each other it feels like the real them is coming out. An example would be for Iroha. Iroha wants to be by himself and think that whatever he does or what other do to him doesn't change him. But after meeting Hikari he starts to change his personality when around her and his friends. Each character has this kind of moment to realize that maybe what they have been doing wasn't the right think and by the end of the first season they realized that Iroha isn't that awkward or strange as they first thought he was. They got to know him and change there thoughts about him. Something that most people to try and do in real life today. \\n\\n\r\nFinally my overall enjoyment for the anime. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime because i felt like Iroha at points. I knew what he was feeling because i have been in the same spot as him. I have changed from others just as the same as him. And i have not been as bad at talking to others as i was a few years ago. I feel connected with this character and when that happens i just really like an anime just a little more then i thought i was going to like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is not as bad as people make it out to be. You just need to give it a chance and not compare it to other shows of the same nature. Because not all anime are the same and i can safely say that i will be watching the second season of this just so i can see the connection between the characters even more.",

Humans shit out shit. \r\nThe first 6 episodes of this anime is bearable, but the animations, characters, story, and everything starts to become a used diaper. I can't say anything unique about this anime. I was annoyed by two characters, Ito and Ayodo, I couldn't stand the laziness the anime tries to attempt with its animations, and the characters that were introduced is like any other anime I have ever watched.\r\nThe difference of the anime is the plot. The main character started a relationship with this girl, but she is moving out inthe next 6 months, so the main character tries to spend as much time as possible with her. That itself is fine, but nothing is built on it. The first 6 episodes are the only good episodes I would at least say. It's a 3/10 there, but the rest just painfully worn me out.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this anime, unless you want to admire the laziness this anime has to offer.",

            "content": "I feel 3D Kanojo gets a lot of bad rep just from the fact that it is getting a second season while many popular franchises remain in limbo. If you can put aside resentment or comparison, what you will find is a pretty decent little romance with enough heartfelt moments to carry an otherwise banal production.\r\nEYES - F\r\nVisually the show looks just plain bad. The character designs range from great (Iroha) to barely tolerable (basically the rest of the cast except Ishino), the art is generic and blah, and the animation is comically awful. The direction is there but it adds little to the toneor the story that the manga didn't already have. If you can laugh at the animation and get sucked into the main romance at the same time, you will enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nEARS - C\\n\\n\r\nNothing of note to report here. The sound effects are generic but not overbearing, and the OP and ED are catchy but nothing special. The voice acting stands out, with solid performances from Serizawa Yuu as Iroha and Tsuda Minami as Ishino. The soundtrack does what most soundtracks do nowadays - blend in - and it for the most part makes no impact. Every now and then you'll notice a catchy riff in there somewhere, but it almost never adds much to the experience of watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nHEART - B-\\n\\n\r\nThis is what carries 3D Kanojo. The writing isn't anything spectacular or groundbreaking, but the romance between Tsutsui and Iroha is incredibly real and solidly carried out. The finale is as heartwarming as the whole romance is throughout, and watching the two grow together through is charming to say the least. Tsutsui is fairly generic conceptually, but his psyche is explored in a surprisingly interesting way, and while he comes out slightly above average he does enough work as a character to make the romance what it is. Igarashi Iroha is a real joy to watch, and she's the most interesting character in the whole show with her promiscuous backstory and emotional arc. While 3D Kanojo explores more of the supporting cast and side characters than I would like, it's more that I wish the side characters were better and less that I disliked their episodes. Ishino - my spirit animal - is an absolute revelation, but Takanashi, Ito, Ayado, Anzu, Kaoru, ototo, and the rest of the cast are all pretty mediocre. Except for the mom, she's a ballerr.  \\n\\n\r\nThere aren't any big overarching themes to speak of - which is probably my favorite part about the show. It delves into specific, real situations and emotions the main couple feels, and just kind of explores whatever it wants to. But it does so pretty damn well, and it was an especially thought-provoking experience given some recent stuff in my personal life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - C+\\n\\n\r\n3D Kanojo is not going to knock your socks off or blow you out of the water. In the romance category it doesn't even stand up to the likes of Kare Kano, or Monogatari, or Doukyuusei, or Tsurezure Children, or Cardcaptor Sakura - but it doesn't need to. Those are all great shows in their own right, but while what 3D Kanojo brings to the table is not dissimilar to what other titles offer, it is indeed a unique flavor in its own way. Again, if you can laugh at the atrocious animation and get hooked by the main couple and/or Ishino, you will enjoy this show as I did. Just don't go in comparing it to the classics.",

            "content": "What a frustratingly terrible experience. This was on of the worst high school romances I\u2019ve ever seen. It manages to take every single cliche and amplify it to annoying levels. It takes the worst parts of every high school romance, adds in subpar animation and art style, forgettable music, bland and annoying characters, and some outright cringeworthy lines of dialogue. While the first 2 or 3 episodes were a mix of fun to laugh at scenes and scenes of second hand embarrassment, those were the best episodes in the series. It got worse and worse as it went on. 3D Kanojo has some of theworst drama situations I\u2019ve ever seen in anime period. They make no sense, all the character overreact like crazy, and it just made me want to see the main couple break up. For me, a romance anime has failed when I actively WANT the main couple to break up. The fights they got in were dumb and could\u2019ve been easily avoided and solved, they were shown countless times why it shouldn\u2019t work out between them, and it just became a pain to root for them to stay together. On the bright side, at least the moments of calm were entertaining to laugh at due to how dumb the dialogue was. The moments of calm were almost always immediately followed by more instances of drama however. It got frustrating and very old very quickly. The characters were all terrible. Some of their personalities seemed to change on the spot just to fan the flames of drama even more. 3D Kanojo was nothing more than Otaku bait so fans could go \u201cHey, this MC is an Otaku like me! I relate to him and this anime is so good now because this is basically me!\u201d while completely ignoring the terrible plot lines, god awful characters, laughable dialogue, and the bad animation. Somehow, this is getting a 2nd Season in 2019. I can\u2019t wait for 12 more episodes of miscommunications, misunderstandings, terrible characters, and more laughable dialogue. This was without a single doubt, the worst anime of the season and a strong contender for worst anime of the year.",

Whilst it was not awful it was neither great or original.

Otakus are not that plain. Just look how famous WOTAKOI became because it shows the bad and the good, the true behind loving anime stuff how we got related to that!\r\n-The girl. There is a good side and a bad side of course. The good one: She had superficial relationships all this time for some good reasons,to feel her empty heart, and she wanted to give a chance to a different type of a guy. Although she had the expectation of him to treat her like he had a tone of relationships before and made him so miserable and he lost the tiny confidence he had. I didn't like the guy, but that was really shitty of her and made me feel annoyed of her. Also, she knew she would go away in 6 months, but for her own good she was ok with putting this boy in all this trouble, falling in love with her and then break his heart when she would go away. She took advantage of him. \\n\\n\r\nART?SOUND\\n\r\n- worse than mediocre, plain, it was clear the animation company didn't try much for this project",

The site I was watching this on each week always seemed to have an issue and I didn't care enough for this anime to look around for another site to watch this on, add in MAL not being open for me to update my progress, I just took it as a sign to stop torturing myself with this.\r\nIt's just an over the top angsty teen romance about a social outcast who gets bullied finally gettinga girlfriend and thus starts becoming friends with other people. But I guess the twist was that this chick was supposed to be leaving in six months. She didn't want to deal with friends because of her short time at the school, but wanted to have a boyfriend? Yeah, that's logical.\\n\\n\r\nThat short time and she spends most of the time being a moody female dog over nothing half the time. And then another female chick he befriends always sides with this moody chick because apparently, her sour mood is always all his fault. And despite them being in high school, she resorts to grade school antics and lacks any kind of real communication skills to talk to him about anything.\\n\\n\r\nI stopped watching the episode after the camp trip where they came back. Another girl admitted to the girlfriend that she likes her boyfriend and the girlfriend is mad at the boyfriend because he's nice and thus he made her fall in love with him. So they get back to school and she still avoids him.\\n\\n\r\nI can't do it anymore. I'm sick of this overly dramatic teen school mess. Why can't they come out with anime mature anime like Nana?

It is not a show that will be on your favorites list by any means, but it does its job I guess.\r\nStory: Nerding guy starts dating the most beautiful girl in the school and is constantly doubting himself\r\nArt and Sound: I thought the art was alright, nothing special in the backgrounds, but the character designs were nice. I really liked the voice actors, especially for the main female character, just something about her voice made me smile. Best friend's voice sucked though.\r\nCharacter: I will say that Idid not have the highest of expectations for this show, but the main character is a pushover that is constantly doubting himself then has moments of \"grow the hell up.\" I absolutely despise the best friend in this show. Probably one of the worst \"best friends\" in recent anime. The female lead and the other side characters are not too bad, but dear god, I hated the sections with the best friend and his voice was AWFUL.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is a light-hearted anime that has its fault, if you hate wimpy main male characters, then this show is not for you. While the \"Best friend\" is awful, you can bear it for the cute moments throughout each episode. Seriously, you really have to be a big anime fan to find enjoyment out of this.",

            "content": "Real Girl can't be more cliche and stereotypical, but it's where the show really shines, in being cliche and stereotypical. Beware of some spoilers.\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nHikaru Tsutsui is your typical otaku who watches anime for long hours and is a big fan of Ezomichi (a magical girl anime) who even talks with her, but this changes when he meets Iroha Igarashi, a wild beautiful 3D girl who had many relationships with men and somehow got infatuated with Tsutsui. Iroha clearly mentions that the relationship will only last 6 months as she has to move.\r\nNew adventures will come with this eccentric couple, with many difficulties encountering theway and Hikaru trying to understand, not only why Iroha chose him, but how real girls are. This sounds very cliche, but the execution is basically flawless, it doesn't resorts to cheap panty shots, unnatural female proportions and cheap drama, only focuses on the story and the love and drama of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\r\nNot great, but not bad, just good. Clearly Hoods Entertainment have to put much more effort after the fallout of M\u00e4rchen M\u00e4dchen, and it clearly paid off here, a better-than-average art and animation which clearly express the true nature of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nA more than acceptable soundtrack and theme songs, which I clearly highlight the ED as the best part of the series, its lyrics are very common, but still powerful and endearing. The character voice acting was mostly on song with the tone of the anime, not quite good, but not bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nVery cliche characters, you have your typical male otaku MC who somehow get entangled in a relationship with the hottest girl of the school, Tsutsui actually improves along the way, and while having big self-confidence issues, he mostly manages to understand his girlfriend Iroha. Igarashi is a very stereotypical beautiful girl with behaviour problems who falls in love with the otaku Tsutsui, she, like Hikari, has doubts with herself about how his boyfriend operates and if he really cares about her.\\n\\n\r\nYuuto Itou is very typical of the sidekick of the MC, and as all the cast, he clearly grows in the series, even falling in love. Arisa Ishino is very blunt and sometimes hurtful, but mellows downs while recognizing the reality of her closest confidents. Mitsuya Takanashi is the classical enemy of the MC who opposes the relationships, Sumie Ayado is the stereotypical female otaku who fantasizes with Tsutsui for being considerate towards her.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, all of the characters are cliche, stereotypes of something, but with this flaw, all of them recognizes their pros and cons and the growth of all the cast makes this a strong point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nA romance anime lover like me will truly appreciate this anime, even taking out the problems of being cliche and stereotypical, you'll find a very interesting anime who shines in actually being stereotypical and the realness of their characters. And with the second season incoming next year, we'll be surely to get the final resolution of this series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10.",

            "content": "While not exactly very good, 3d kanojo real girl can quickly become an induced craving anime, and can affect you in some subtle way. Its constantly changing pace, but doing so with a careful approach that will not get too confusing (quite rare in a romcom), and which reflects the thoughts process of the protagonists.\r\nMidway, it creates an elegant and refined setting to provide a simple but not cheap romance, seemingly without arrogance. Typically the kind of anime that makes you think just when you're about to take a break from it ... \r\n\"come on, just one more episode\".\r\nUnfortunately, from all that, this show won'tget exactly any better. For starters, its execution is far from flawless. Take the characters for example : I can understand a romcom don't exactly need outstanding graphics, but you could make sure at the very least that the main female lead could not get confused with her friend (and vice-versa). \\n\r\nAnd it's not stopping at characters drawings clones. The show clearly lacks boldness, quite frankly, from his debut to its ending. Here's another example : being shunned as an otaku, the male main lead is most of the time seen as a gross, ugly boy. But ugly, really ? Is he ? Then why Takanashi is supposed to be a lady killer when his features are not that far from Ito ? To me they all look like pretty people if nothing else. All that to say that the supposed \"gap\" - be it exterior or interior - between the characters are not that obvious in any way, which in turn makes this anime tropes quite more obvious. Maybe it's not as important a theme as it is in \"Ore Monogatari!!\" or \"Lovely Complex\" (both which heavily relies on exterior looks/appearance issues) but since the otaku theme (even if we're not talking about exterior aspects issues here) is reminded all over the show, I was expecting more clashes on this particular subject.\\n\r\nNow, provided that you're not expecting too much from the issues forced on the characters and the contrived solutions that emerges from them, 3d kanojo real girl can still be quite enjoyable, sometimes from its soft pace and delicate situations, sometimes from the more serious aspects of life and scenes that follows, along the story. But I honestly still think the title alone is misleading.",

            "content": "Our male protagonist is that stereotypical nerdy otaku boy who is so ugly and socially inept that people feel actively repulsed by him on first sight (they only really start to hate him once they get to know him closer and get more exposure to his shitty personality).\r\nOur female protagonist is that stereotypical hot and \"popular-but-strangely-aloof\" girl all the hot and popular boys want, but who hasn't got any female friends for some inscrutable reason that defies logic. She dates around a lot, but all those hot and popular boys can't satisfy her deeply felt need for otaku D so she must keep looking -she's like a princess who keeps kissing princes in the hope one of them will turn into a frog. \\n\\n\r\nThe two meet, and romantic sparks immediately fly, because this is a romcom with nerdy otakus as the target group, and extensive focus group testing showed that they wanted the otaku to get the girl right off the bat, so there's not a second to lose.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so the girl instantly falls for the boy, who hates her guts at first since he basically hates all people, and especially those who are happier than him (which is basically all people), but she keeps kissing him out of the blue and trying to bang him until he reluctantly falls for her in return. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much relationship realism to be found in this \"romcom\", but at least *that* part is pretty spot on! Any girl who reads this who don't know how to convince a boy to fall for her should follow the example set here and just keep throwing herself at the boy until she sticks, boys can't really defend against that deviously cunning strategy in the long run!\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. The point I'm trying to make here is just that the only reason these two character ends up in a relationship is because it says so in the script, so they don't really have a choice. The romance is CONTRIVED.\\n\\n\r\nThe nerdy otaku boy has no clue what the popular hot girl sees in him, but more importantly, neither has the viewer. As usual in this kind of otaku-pandering animes, it is explained that she is drawn to him because he is \"kind\", and as usual, that basically means he acts like a half decent human being on occasion (when he's not being an insensitive jerk who is unaware of how others feel).\\n\\n\r\nThat's as we all know all it takes for a physically repulsive man with stage 4 Asperger to attract the finest babes!\\n\\n\r\nNot.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of believable chemistry between the romantic leads hampers the show badly from beginning to end. They did dedicate one of the later episodes to some kind of flashback into the girl's life that was intended to retcon some kind of personal psychological reason for her otherwise inexplicable behavior, but it still just felt contrived. I didn't buy any of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo this \"romcom\" pretty much fails at the ROM. It also pretty much fails at the COM, because it's not particularly funny either. And the art is pretty lackluster, and the music pretty bad. It is in short a pretty shitty anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is, however, not unwatchable!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters may be stereotypical and the plot trite, but it's still sort of *comfortable* to watch. You know what to expect right away, and then the show delivers exactly what you expected - a mediocre but mildly entertaining ride that doesn't challenge or disappoint too badly! There's something to be said for anime that simply upholds the unspoken social contract between creators and viewers in this way. I binge watched it without ever feeling like I risked getting surprised, or having to engage myself deeply in anything. Sometimes that's all you want from an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it for what it was, and I'm going to watch season 2 next! :P",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I've only seen the anime, never read the source material. But honestly, after watching the anime I don't know why I'd want to.\r\nRight out of the gate the viewer is bashed over the with generic material: We meet our protagonist: some otaku loser who everybody thinks is gross and lame, and like almost every other high school anime, he's running late for school. He gets to the shoe lockers and the only other person that was late that day was the girl with a reputation of being easy. Their punishment? clean leaves out of the pool after school. Cut to them cleaning leaves andthey get in an argument because the guy thinks the girl called him gross, which in his mind is pretty rich coming from the girl who's supposedly the school bike, when in reality she said wearing bangs over her face would make her feel gross. They argue some more and then they fall in the pool. Somehow they get it into their heads that they like each other, which in reality its just that shes the first girl who wasn't an ass to him and he's the first guy who didn't expect her to sleep with him. All in all, I've seen worst reasons to date someone, but it doesn't stop there! She then reveals that she's moving away at the end of the year!\\n\\n\r\nSo right off the bat, we've got our cookie cutter, bland characters established, a contrived plot to force the supposed romance to blossom, and the rest of the story sets itself up. Now, in case you're wondering, \"hey, why is he describing the first episode in so much detail?\", it's because this is literally the highest point in the entire show, its all down hill from here. It's just one manufactured point of drama after another, they get in arguments and make up. It's about the most generic romance anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nNow, before I get into my other grievances with the show, lets talk about the art and music:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is pretty bland, no snappy art changes to lighten the mood, no real design to the characters at all. Every character is thin and boxy, very two dimensional, which is pretty bad when you're characters are already tapped in a 2D plane to begin with. there's no beauty to the art, it's just there, it exists, and nothing more, there's just nothing to comment on because its so bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is forgettable, and that's putting it nicely. background music exists in this show, but there's nothing memorable about it. In fact, the most memorable part of the music in this anime is the OP, and that's because it drags on for what feels like an eternity, almost as if they put animation to the entire studio released song. I'm serious, this OP will put you to sleep if you let it.\\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about my continued grievances with this awful show. First, lets talk about hikari's best friend, who's a borderline furry. Guy just decides that in order to stand out more than he already does by being friends with the super otaku who has no other friends, that he's gonna start wearing cat ears every single day, so he can let his true self shine through more. \\n\\n\r\nthen there's how hikari just goes full on white knight over iroha, the female lead. I gave it a pass the first time it happened, since they were \"dating\", but it just keeps going, as if she's just using him so other guys will leave her alone.\\n\\n\r\nHikari is somehow able to do almost anything perfectly, \"when he puts his mind to it\", as if thats a good enough excuse to try and make the character redeemable and not a borderline NEET whose only good quality is having never missed a day of school. He's also unhealthy obsessed with a specific magical girl anime character, to the point of watching old episodes nightly and modeling a figure of Iroha after her. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I can't tell you enough to just not watch this at all. Looking back, it's as if some neckbeard incel thought up a situation that would make some perceived \"thot\" see this as a worthwhile mate and accept him as he is, while simultaneously changing her to fit his worldview, and then they decided to make an anime out of it. Which is absolutely insane. Hikari isn't even a likeable character like other hardcore antisocial and socially awkward otakus, like tomoko from watamote. She at least tried to change and better herself. Hikari thinks everyone else needs to change to accept him, and thats just not a sympathetic character trait in any show. \\n\\n\r\nDO NOT watch this unless you are some neckbearded, basement dwelling, fedora tipping, THOT shaming, white knighting, nice guy Incel, because that appears to be the target audience. Its just a bad show, and somehow this dumpster fire is getting a second season.",

            "content": "Ok, so first of all I'm a little bit shaken by the SCATHING reviews of this show. I'm sure this review (which is at most my second ever, but one I felt pretty compelled to write after reading the hate, especially considering I'm only giving it a 7) will be buried, but for those of you who find it, hopefully it helps.\r\nThis show (well, first cour of a 2 cour show) is not NEARLY as bad as people are making it out to be. Here are the top complaints I see: \r\n1. MC is basically an oblivious moron\r\n2. MC's relationship with Igarashi is totally unrealistic,they barely knew each other!\\n\\n\r\n3. Based on point 1, literally nobody would ever think the same as the MC in any of these situations, and since I can see all sides of this story MC is a dumb-dumb while I'm a romantic genius because WE ALL KNOW WHY HE'S WRONG BUT HE CAN'T SEE IT (spoiler alert, most of the time it's because we've seen the other side of the story and you can't do that in real life...dramatic irony).\\n\\n\r\nThis show, like many others that people pan for being high school romances (and some of them for good reason), but it's honestly one of the most realistic high school shows I've seen. If this were your *standard* high school romantic dramedy, you'd have the MC being roasted by viewers because he didn't \"realize\" that his crush sneaking into bed with him on the school camping trip was a sign she liked him. In this show [SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER], we have a character who doesn't realize someone likes him because he feels he'd never be liked, despite being in a relationship with someone else (who he feels he doesn't deserve to have like him). [SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\nQuick story from my high school life, where I was a legitimately talented musician and had a strong group of friends (most of which a really eclectic mix of jocks, arts kids, drama folks, smart guys, weebs, etc...mainly because all of shared a few common interests), but had a bit of an inferiority complex in middle school where I was mostly alone - \\n\\n\r\nI was in a class with a girl named Bree (also spelled Bri or Brie, but hers had 2 e's) during freshman year, and we got along really well. I was doing my best to be outgoing and funny since I had swapped schools and basically knew nobody, and it seemed like it was going well! I had a group of friends from band (we had a solid month of practice before school, so I got to know most of them really well), and I came into the year somewhat confident. Anyways, freshman year passed, sophomore year came, and Bree and I ended up in a few of the same classes the next year. We always got along pretty well, and by a few months in had some solid inside jokes and had worked on a group project or two that I guess went alright. \\n\\n\r\nValentines rolled around. Bree and her friend (who was always with her) were being a bit coy with me...and then her friend gave me a letter on V-day itself. As far as I remember, it only had a few hearts on it, just kind of in keeping with the day. \\n\\n\r\nI opened it up, and inside was written:\\n\\n\r\n\"Be mine, lol!\"\\n\\n\r\n\"...but, will you really?\" \\n\\n\r\n\"xxx-xxx-xxxx\"\\n\\n\r\nand I NEVER CALLED HER OR EVEN TEXTED.\\n\\n\r\nThis girl LITERALLY ASKED ME OUT in a note, but I was too worried about it being a \"joke\" that I never called or texted her...and our back and forth in classes soured, and we kind of just stopped talking. \\n\\n\r\nI asked her YEARS later what she meant with that message...she said \"I WAS ASKING YOU OUT YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! JESUS YOU WERE INSECURE!!!\" Luckily we just laughed after that, since she was getting married and I was dating someone, but still, it just goes to show -\\n\\n\r\nHIGH SCHOOL KIDS ARE LITERALLY RETARDED AND NO LAWS OF REASON APPLY TO THEIR ACTIONS. IF YOU WERE TO SHOW AN AVERAGE HIGH SCHOOL BOY (who had never been in a \"real\" relationship) TAPE OF THE GIRL HE LIKED SAYING THAT SHE REALLY LIKED HIM, HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY HE WAS AT LEAST 70% DOUBTFUL THAT SHE WASN'T JUST GIVING HIM A HARD TIME.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that this show gets the main characters together early on is great, because it just serves to highlight the other idiocies of high school age kids. Never trust, never doubt, but also at the same time fully trust and doubt everything while assuming your relationship will last forever. This show is the epitome of high school romance, and people don't get it because they probably never actually dated anyone in HS. \\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, 7/10 for the first season - step brother at the end seemed kinda shoehorned in, and the animation was nice and watercolory, but there were a few moments where it seemed like they were just kissing with their mouths half open and not moving. Enjoyable first cour though.",

            "content": "If something isn't groundbreaking or revolutionary is it automatically bad?\r\n3D Kanojo is just that, it doesn't bring that much new to the table. Stereotypical, yes... cliches, yes... bad..? Well no.\r\nStory: Hikari Tsutsui is a step from being a NEET, he's into 2D and pretends not to see the what happens around him, his sole friend and class mate Ito who is also a otaku is the only person who he talks to. His ability to be social and interact with people ends where it begins, he's only escape from the tortures of real life are anime and manga. Until one day because he was watchinghe's favorite show he is late for school. Also late with him is Igarashi Iroha, one of the prettiest girls in school, who is a a-hole. After being ordered to clean the school pool as a punishment for being late Iroha mostly from curiosity starts to put the moves on our boy Tsutsun. But everyone in school even including him know the story's Iroha messing around with boys so he try's to the best of his ability to stay away from her. \\n\r\nStereotypical so far, it gets better. I give the story a 8 since i finished the whole anime and in retrospect some things do make more since now.\\n\\n\r\nArt: ... it sucks.\\n\r\nThe art is something that so many people complained about that iv'e almost didn't watch the show, and they are partly right. The animation leaves a lot to be desired, it's crude, it lacks depth, some time frames are just to dang long but since this is a rom-com i just didn't mind it, if it was a action or a sports anime this would have been a disaster but since it's a high school romance the animation did it's joob to help tell the story.\\n\r\nI'm giving it a 7 because i like the character, they are clean, nicely done and they are not \"color coded\". \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nYu Serizawa outdid her self with the role of Iroha. Coming from Mayura from Sousei no Onmyouji i can really tell the improvement and i can say that if this is the way she's headed i'm interested in what she does next.\\n\r\nUenishi Teppei who did Hikari Tsutsui is a relatively new VA and this is his first big role, witch you wouldn't be able to guess just by listening to him.\\n\r\nThe music is ok, generally no complaints about the sound\\n\r\nA solid 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is where i come into a bit of a pickle, since i finished both seasons i would like to rate the characters on both seasons but this review is only for the first. All in all there is some character development in the show, decent enough but maybe still not quite there. Since it is a 12 episode season i can understand the lack of some big back story or getting to know character inside out but i still think it could have been a bit better. All in all the characters aren't like in some animes hard to remember, they have there motives, goals (to fall in love since it is a romcom) but all in all just little more on this front would have made this show a whole lot better.\\n\r\n7 on character design\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell i watched the show in one go, it was fun, it was emotional a bit. It didn't feel like i was just waiting for the episode to finish. Depends on what are you expecting, i came board without any high expectations and i really, really like really enjoyed it. I'll give it a 9 for enjoyment and almost making me late for work.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's one of the few shows that i didn't think about drooping. It didn't bring much new to the table and it didn't need to. It managed to tell a interesting story and for me it was fun.\\n\r\nOverall i give it a 8 and recommend it to all who are looking for some fun easy going romcom to watch  \\n",

            "content": "I would usually go through all the ratings like Story: until Overall: But i'm making this review after barely making it through episode 2 of the English Version, it's just dreadful...\r\nFrom the very beginning of episode one you are BOMBARDED with trope, after trope of completely stupid anime cliches. The main character and his friend have the worse voices for their parts, the blonde guy doesn't sound anything like how he should, and the Main Character is so bland and doesn't try to do any emotion in his voice at all, and for a character whos supposed to be meek, he never sounds meek atall. On top of that i thought in the beginning the show was amping him up to be smart because he wanted a perfect attendance record that he blows twice in 2 episodes for \"a convenient meeting he didn't plan on\".\\n\\n\r\nBefore i go further with how the MC and the few people i've seen thus far are completely trope'd and don't seem to know what they are talking about half the time, let me say the writing is some of the worst shit i've seen in anime. The characters motivations change at the flip of a hat, a store owner without any proof accusers the main girl of stealing and threatens to call the police, only for the main character to come up to the store owner and proof she wasn't stealing by BLUNTLY ADMITTING HE WAS STALKING HER TO EVERYONE IN THE STORE, and SHE DIDN'T CALL THE COPS FOR THAT?!, It just cuts to the next scene... Also for even the slightest nice thing the main girl kisses the guy she doesn't know, whos been insulting her the entire time they were around one another, and everytime they get in a situation where it seems like they'll part ways the main character is just walking somewhere and BAM shes there, not on purpose but thats where she happened to be cause CLICHE PLOT CONVENIENCE. He also sees the Main girl getting pulled away by some guy who says she's his girlfriend which they never give clarification on, then he tries to fight him off of her, she sits there and watches when he tells her to run, then when he loses and i guess semi passes out (IDK it faded to white) the guy is just... Gone?! He won and could continued to drag her away but she's still there... \\n\\n\r\nLater on she talks with him on the roof, and flips from normal to sad to normal again all in between saying she was lying about her previous statement which i can only assume is to make her seem mysterious?????? I HAVE NO IDEA. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character throughout all of this is meek as shit and can't take even the slightest semi mean comment from a girl whatsoever but will sit and take it anyways??? There's also a doctor who after figuring out what the MC was blabbing about cause apparently he can't talk to a random guy now thats not threatening him, instead of clearing up he wasn't dating the Main girl decides to call a random person he's never meet pathetic and not good for a girl hes i guess walked around casually with or some shit with no sexual inclinations but there not friends or something... It might seem like I'M babbling but this is what i've seen from this disaster of a show. The cringe is real.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that Crunchyroll having even the ending song from this show in their awards apparently means they know nothing about picking for anime anything of the year.\\n\\n\r\nOne last note, the only positive thing about the dub version of this series is that they got Hilary Haag to voice the guys favorite magical girl character, i'd give you a name but idk what it is and MAL hasn't updated it with any pic and i'm not going back in to find out... \\n\\n\\n\r\nPlease, if you care about anime whatsoever don't watch this. I'm telling you this for your own good, this is one of the worse things i've seen in maybe like 2 years... This show is an insult to any fan of dubs along with any anime fans intelligence.",

            "content": "1.This anime is a picnic anime ( shorter anime to watch between longer ones ) So first off I wouldn\u2019t really recommend this anime for anyone that was looking for a new anime to start watching. 2. THE EPISODES: this anime is based off a manga Like most anime\u2019s, but just don\u2019t get too attached with it because they stopped making more episodes after episode 12 which ended in a cliff hanger. \r\nHey 3.THE PLOT: ok if I have to make a summary about this anime it would be \u201cTsutsui and Ikarashi fought and then made up\u201d that\u2019s all to the plot buddy\u2019s. So especiallymyself, personally I like watching longer anime\u2019s like naruto and dragon ball and I usually finsh them fast because I\u2019m so indulged in them so watching long anime\u2019s is no problem for me. While this one was only 12 episodes I felt like my soul leaving my body every time I watched it because it was the same lame plot every episode.\\n\\n\r\n To truthfully speak this kind of plot is perfect for a manga because the reader will enjoy the long development of both characters as over time they change but that\u2019s not true for anime because your  constantly watching the same thing, the whole entire anime there was no development it was like taking two steps back and then two steps forward and calling it progress.\\n\\n\r\n So overall I don\u2019t think I enjoyed the anime that much but I do believe I would enjoy the manga that I would hopefully start reading soon but one thing that I did enjoy about the anime was the art, I do believe that art and animation was outstanding which is not someone common in more recent anime\u2019s. Again I don\u2019t think I would recommend this anime to anyone there are better romance\\drama anime\u2019s out there but if you are planning to read the manga, you could watch the anime to get more experience about the characters and get the plot a bit more.\\n\\n\r\n Other than that if your just interested in the art style of the anime could be another reason to watch it other than that I don\u2019t think I have anymore positives but that\u2019s my personal opinion if your still interested in watching it try watching the first 4 episodes of the anime which will technically sum up the whole anime for you since the plot is repetitive in such a small anime which made me give it a mediocre score.\\n\\n\r\n 4 THE CHARACTERS: Most notably Iroha. Now the following is my opinion that many won\u2019t agree with but I feel she exaggerates her feelings ALOT. there is this scene where one of the characters accidentally spills hot water on there hands and Tsutsui rushes in to help like any normal person would and in doing so he held that characters hand to wash it with cool water but Iroha of course couldn\u2019t understand that and ran away into the woods crying because Tsutsui held that character\u2019s hand. See what I mean when I say it\u2019s juat a bit too exaggerated? Now I know that kind of reaction is considered \u201ccute\u201d when an anime girl is jealous but I just feel this one crossed the line. Now this type of plot could\u2019ve been fixed if the other partner felt jealousy, but NOPE there was none.",

I won't read this sht, all his points are invalid.\". Well, at least give my review a chance.\r\nSo, let's start with my disappointment for Shigatsu. Shigatsu is a GOOD show. Contradicting, yes, but hear me out. I watched it because, as everyone else usually doesstarting drama anime, I wanted to get emotional. It became a disappointment because it never even got near to making me feel anything.\\n\\n\r\nA short reason would be because the main characters, which are the focus of the drama aspect of the story, did not get the development they needed. Before the \"moment\", the show went on for ages on sht that is completely irrelevant to the main point of the show. As I was troubled of the ongoing crap, I was force choked into feeling sad for someone that I don't even know much of (due to lack of character development). Combine these and you get a disappointing end to a good hopeful of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nWith all these, how do I even get to think it's a good Anime then?\\n\\n\r\nBecause it is!\\n\\n\r\nPeople mistakenly equalize \"Good stories\" with actual \"Good\" shows. A good story (for you) does NOT mean that it is a good Anime, HUGE mistake.\\n\r\nI didn't like the show for the reasons I have dictated, but that doesn't mean it's bad.\\n\r\nShigatsu has great animation, to start things off. The ost is phenomenal and iconic in the Anime community, with good reason. Seeing the Anime as a whole, you can see that a lot of passion and care is given in the creation of it and it shows! As a simple gauge, look at the OPs & EDs; they're amazing. Sadly, people think the story was good because the presentation (anime itself) was good which as I have stated, isn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, let's see the relationship of Shigatsu with 3D Kanojo; Why do I deem Shigatsu as a good Anime even with my dislike of it but see 3D Kanojo as the worse version (Bad anime).\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers for Shigatsu & 3D Kanojo*\\n\r\nYou can connect the two in how they start up with the good bits of the plot. Both shows feature a heroine which \"seemingly\" have some kind of illness that may or may not be terminal. Both shows present the event in which the heroine doesn't have much time left. Both shows could have been good.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we have the important similarities out of the way, let's now focus on the differences.\\n\\n\r\nI have stated somewhere above, a summary of despite being a disappointment, why Shigatsu was good. If you remember, I have stated the care and passion given in the creation of the show as one of the reasons for it being a good show. This might be one of the most, if not the most important need of a show to be deemed respectfully pleasant.\\n\\n\r\n3D Kanojo lacks ANY sign of this. Okay, compare the OP of 3D Kanojo with another of a show that aired the same season; specifically Wotakoi. Now, tell me, which of these 2 would you say lacked respect for the viewers by being awfully done to the point of torture and which was done with care and passion? You can simply take this answer with the show itself as it's basically the same throughout. For every aspect of the show, the animation was awful, the VAs sound dead inside, just like the Anime. The story was going nowhere, the characters got nothing. The show was a torture to watch and I hope no one else gets the disrespect the show has given its viewers.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - 3D Kanojo is a massive f* you to anyone who watches it. No one says you can't enjoy watching a show like that, but facts are facts. No care was given to the show which is very evident if you actually look yourself. A lot of people \"wanted\" this kind of story just like they did with Shigatsu, but getting what kind of story you want does not mean it's good. Wake up, 3D Kanojo is really, really bad.",

            "content": "TL;DR: Overall a nice romance exploring the development of two people as a couple, sometimes a bit too clichee. Quite some romantic moments and kissing scenes.\r\n__________________\r\n3D Kanojo is a show about the hardcore otaku Tsutsui, who only has one single (otaku) friend, and doesn't care about real girls. As you would expect, he then gets to know a girl which is not grossed out by his appearance and actually takes a liking to him. They become a couple, he starts opening up, befriends other people, and eventually someone else falls for him too, yadda yadda you know the story.\r\nNow, the setting is of course veryshoujo-like; the very definition of an outsider starting to date a cute openminded girl. But in my opinion, it still was incredibly well done. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked:\\n\r\n- They start dating very early on, even in the first episode I think, and the show revolves on how they develop as a couple (and individually while being a couple)\\n\\n\r\n- There is no huge love-rival drama dragged throughout a bunch of episodes, not like other shows where it seems like the whole world tries to rip a couple apart.\\n\\n\r\n- Pretty much all the characters ended up to be pretty likeable to me. They have all very different personalities and each of them has their own issues to deal with, but they still get along together and it just makes an enjoyable combination.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like:\\n\r\n- Sometimes Tsutsui was TOO dense in my opinion. That made it feel like the show wants to tell you that even a complete idiot can get a girlfriend. Of course, as an otaku without friends it makes sense that he can't understand much about other peoples feelings, but for me it sometimes was too much.\\n\\n\r\n- I would've liked to learn more about Igarashi. Her past isn't explored that much, and you only learn from her family in the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\n- Considering that from the first episode it was already known that Igarashi would have to move in half a year it had basically no impact on the show at all. Then again, that's probably the focus for the second season.",

            "content": "Not even sure where to begin, but to give a quick heads-up: this review will contain lots of sarcasm, just in case y'all don't get it. If you see me praising the anime, that's probably and definitely sarcasm. \r\nAnother warning: there will be some spoilers here.\r\nWhen I first saw the name and the cover art of this anime, I was genuinely interested. I was the type to not read the summaries of animes or mangas; just jumping all in to experience the ride of not knowing on what's going to happen. I had an expectation that 3D Kanojo: Real Girl was about a high schoolboy. who was some sort of gamer, somehow had his favourite character from his game come to life or some sort. But no, I was wrong, obviously. It was nowhere near my expectations. I was met with another boring story plot, but I decided to give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I regret ever giving it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons I strongly disliked this anime is because\\n\\n\r\n1. Overly stereotypical characters.\\n\r\n - The characters in this anime are extremely challenging on being able to relate to them, let alone liking them. The author does quite a terrible job in writing and creating their characters. The main protagonist, Tsutsui, was originally supposed to be an otaku who isolates himself from his classmates and happens to be bullied just because he likes anime and manga. Bonus points: he also has at least one friend who happens to have the same interests as him, if I'm not mistaken. The classmates somehow always finds a reason to pick on Tsutsui, with the author hoping that we as the audience would somehow sympathize with him and his awful life. This anime's genres were mainly romance and comedy, and they sure executed the comedy wonderfully; just not in the way it was supposed to be. The amount of exaggerated moments and actions in this anime made me laugh out of pure pity and disbelief. I wasn't sure how to react other than raising my eyebrows so high up until it reached Mars. In the real world we live in, it is true that some people may be bullied because of their interests, but for the whole school, along with some random bystanders outside the school, to dislike Tsutsui because he's an otaku or looks like one is utterly disgusting. But hey, this is the world of anime, so it should be okay, right? (Spoiler: No, not really.)\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the main protagonist's love interest, Iroha. From what I've gathered, I do believe she was supposed to be that 'one deadpan girl' who had a blunt attitude and was rumored to be some sort of whore. Not sure, I wasn't exactly paying attention to this anime from the very start. That's how uninterested I am during the 20+ minutes of the episode. But this love interest somehow meets the main character due to both being late, and apparently, she intentionally came to school late? I think she mentioned a reason why she did so, but at this point, I think I've forgotten the reason since I might've thought it was a stupid reason to arrive to school late. Iroha asks if she could date Tsutsui, but of course, he rejects. That's probably the only smartest thing he has ever done throughout the whole two episodes or less. Until he decides to stalk her to 'get to know her better', of course.\\n\\n\r\nTsutsui follows her as she goes through her day, seeing that she wasn't the 'bad guy' she was painted to be in school, I suppose. Eventually, the love interest was being accused of stealing a book by the staff. I don't work at any stores, but I'm pretty sure that the staff won't just come up to a customer and loudly accuse them of stealing, causing a huge commotion. And wow wee, the main character heroically swoops in to save the day (being the hero he is), literally stating every single thing Iroha has been doing throughout the day which marks him as a stalker. Talk about the knight in the shining armour made of gold, amirite? To my surprise, the love interest never found it creepy, nor did the bystanders said or did anything about it. Totally relatable, sister. I would 10/10 immediately marry someone who stalked me throughout the day before standing up against this accuser in a bookstore.\\n\\n\r\nI will talk about their relationship more soon, but for now, let's focus on the rest of the characters. Tsutsui, being the loner he is, only has one friend, Yuuto (I had to search up his name since I don't remember 90% of the characters' names). They both have some things in common: both being otaku nerds and getting punished by their fellow classmates for liking weeb stuff. I don't really care so much about Yuuto and barely paid any attention to him (especially the anime itself), so I can't say much about him, other than \"Are those real cat ears or what?\"\\n\\n\r\nTsutsui also has a childhood friend who apparently bullies him a lot, saying that the only reason she does it is because she has the 'childhood friend privilege'. Nice. If only I had a childhood friend so I can totally mock and insult him 24/7 for having passions. She's just another irrelevant character I never paid attention to as well, so moving on.\\n\\n\r\nHis family, however, is utterly disgusting. The family is unbearably unsupportive and biased, they  actually succeeded in making me feel bad for the main character. I don't know about you, but I'd feel very awful if my sibling comes up to me and says \"I don't want to be like you when I grow up because people who like a certain thing, let alone anime or manga, sucks.\" Also, if a family member of yours is being accused of a serious crime, are you going to tell them that they have no future and is a disgrace to the family WITHOUT even looking for evidence? Talk about some supportive family. Definitely the best, 10/10. \"Oh hell, my son is a child molester although he says that he isn't and there is no proof whatsoever, so I'm just going to tell him that I won't believe in him because he literally has no life :)\" < And the best mother of the year goes to Tsutsui's mom.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the dysfunctional family, we have this blonde classmate named Takanashi who also likes Iroha. He constantly bullies Tsutsui and tries to ask Iroha out, although she is clearly dating Tsutsui. Of course, Takanashi is annoyed by the fact that Iroha chooses an otaku over the 'hot, popular blonde guy' so he is the main reason why Tsutsui is accused as a child molester after Tsutsui tries to help a little girl find her brother who happens to be Takanashi. I stopped watching after a while, but I still had a bet that Takanashi would end up being friends with Tsutsui. I heard that they did, but not in the way as I expected. I expected that it wouldn't go pretty easy, after everything Takanashi had done to Tsutsui, and falsely accusing someone could have a terrible consequence. Instead, they both hitched off as friends without a problem, which also leads me to how this anime creates conflicts and resolves them without challenging the characters and even giving them consequences.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure there are other characters that I probably missed or haven't seen yet, but merely thinking about it already gives me a migraine. On to the next reason why I despise this anime!\\n\\n\\n\r\n2. Bland and predictable story plot. Especially the overused cliches that were executed rather poorly.\\n\r\n - I can't tell you how much money I've put into betting with my brother over this anime. I always predicted their cliches, saying that the bully would somehow turn into the main protagonist's friend and that a girl who also happens to be an otaku would develop a crush on the main protagonist. Most of my predictions were, 'surprisingly', correct, although I still haven't got the answer on whether Iroha is going to die or not. But seeing how this anime turned out, I think I'd like to take my 50 cents back right now. I don't think this anime would really want to kill off one of their main characters and cause a heartbreak for poor, lonely ass Tsutsui. After all, this is the anime where mistakes doesn't come with a consequence. \\n\\n\\n\r\n3. The main protagonists' relationship isn't built on a strong foundation.\\n\r\n - The main character said he wanted to date her (for some reason unknown or forgettable), and the love interest mentions that she will be leaving town in six months forever. I half expected that she was dying since she did visit a hospital, but I'm not going to buy her cheap excuse of having asthma. Eventually, she did accept, and I have two questions about it.\\n\r\nWhy are they going out in the first place if they both knew that the love interest was going out of town forever without a single hope of coming back? Is there a reason why the main protagonist is dating her? \\n\\n\r\nAnd as the story 'progresses', I begin to notice the incredible lack of communication between the two lovebirds. Every time the main protagonist somehow messes up, his girlfriend won't even tell him what's wrong and expects him to figure it out himself. Damn, talk about some relationship goals, amirite? In result, this gives Tsutsui lots of self-doubt, confusion, etc. Once he resolves everything by simply apologizing, his girlfriend just forgives him that easily. So, the moral was: if you do something wrong and apologize, everything will be back to normal. :)\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons why I think that the main protagonist should not be in a relationship is because he isn't happy with himself. And if he fails to make himself happy, he won't make his significant other happy either. And I don't think his love interest did anything memorable to make him realize his flaws or change into a better person. \\n\\n\r\nI think the main reason why his love interest is dating him is because stalking her and saving her is 'so hot <3'. And if you're hoping that stalking your crush would get her/him into a relationship with you, you're wrong and you need more education asap. Even if you do get her/him into a relationship with you, I don't know what to tell you except that you both need professional help.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI'd love to write more about why I despised this anime, but I think I would lose more brain cells if I kept going on, eventually. What baffles me is the fact that this anime is getting a second season. I know a lot of romantic comedy animes which had executed their stories so well and doesn't even get a second season. Again, might I remind you, this anime was featured on the Aniplex channel on television. I had high hopes for this one when I first watched the trailer way back. When I rewatched the trailer months after, I had a bad feeling about it. After watching simply 5 minutes of the anime, I was left with the question of \"What in the bloody hell is happening?\" and whenever I do get the answer, I sometimes wished I never asked anything, let alone watch it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nI was originally going to stop at episode two, but I decided to give it a chance and reached until the sixth episode before completely breaking down, shutting the lights and going to bed exactly at midnight. I wasted my time watching, and this anime made me appreciate 'Kotoura-san', another anime that I wasn't too fond of. A great example of romcom animes are: 'Wotaku ni Koi no Muzukashii' and 'Net-juu no Susume'. They have an amazing portrayal of realistic relationships, and instead of having to tell a clich\u00e9 story about highschoolers, their main characters are working adults which is refreshing. Wotaku ni Koi no Muzukashii and 3D Kanojo: Real Girl might have some character design similarities, but the huge difference is their story-telling, character personalities, etc. \\n\\n\r\nI won't be reviewing any of the animation, voice acting, or the music in this anime. Personal thought on the OP though? I think I can relate to the singer. I would also sound lifeless inside as I sing a song for a terrible anime. Animation is sort of wonky and unpleasant to look at sometimes. I wasn't really paying attention to the voice acting since I was busy clearing off the blood in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI will now end this rant which I call a review, and thank you for coming to my TEDx Talk. Now if you'd excuse me, I'll be going to church to repent my sins and pray to God, asking for forgiveness for watching this horrible mess.",

            "content": "3D Kanojo Real Girl was originally a shoujo manga that is fairly famous in Japan, I think that\u2019s the reason why it got adapted. I never got a chance to read it\u2019s manga, but it is on my bookmarks. I still haven\u2019t figured out the reason why I went back and watch this, but atleast I did get to enjoy the later half of the series.\r\nThe plot was simple. An otaku guy, who\u2019s really awkward to everyone and has only 1 friend, happens to meet a hot and beautiful girl and for some point they become a couple. That\u2019s like every otaku\u2019s dream romance, whichmade this series very generic as this plot is quite common but in a different setting. I think it was the progression of their story that made this series different from any other show I had seen. The problems the characters\u2019 faced were quite realistic and relatable, which made this series really engaging and intriguing. I think that\u2019s why the manga is quite liked by alot of people.\\n\\n\r\nBut the problem with this series is the inconsistent pacing and the abrupt ending of the series. There were times I feel the series was dragging the problem too much and other times, it was too fast. It was a hassle to watch cuz it made some parts of the series boring to watch. And yes, the last episode, WTF was that? It just\u2026end. Also, introducing another character that seemed to be really important at the last episode made me have alot of questions in my mind. I know that this series will have a sequel, but bruh, at least end the season properly.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. I have a love-hate relationship with the lead characters. There are times I feel them and there were times I want to smack their heads and get their act together. Sigh. But the thing is, the stuff I hated about the lead characters were the stuff I liked about them. All of the characters here in this series were not just your typical 2D characters in a series, they have different sides of themselves, good and bad, that made them alot more human and relatable. Tsutsui Hikari is an awkward otaku, yes, but he is also really caring and kind to the people he cares about, and really really oblivious to his surroundings. With those traits of his, you would understand better the decisions and actions he made. Even with Igarashi Iroha, she\u2019s a mysterious girl at the very beginning. But seeing her real and true self later in the series made me like her and understand her. I still do wanna smack their heads, but yeah, I can\u2019t blame them.\\n\\n\r\nNow, compared to the lead characters, I felt that I need more time with the supporting characters. Because the story was so focus on the lead characters, the growth of the supporting characters were either abrupt or really slow. I do hope to see them grow more in the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nLet me say this first, I HATE THE ART AND ANIMATION. There, I said it.\\n\\n\r\nI think I mentioned above that the original is a manga and I bookmarked it on my reader. The reason why I have it on my bookmarks was because of its art. I really like the artstyle of the mangaka. It wasn\u2019t unique of anything, but it was interesting and refreshing to me. But the anime version was\u2026.BORING. I don\u2019t like it at all. It didn\u2019t followed the art from the manga, the animation is really bad. Everything is bad. It was really disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, maybe I\u2019m too harsh in judging the character design and all, but the animation. Uuuggghhhh,..it would have been nice if they put a bit of effort to it. It was too stiff and rigid. I think the only positive point i could give would be the sequence of the shots and scenes. That\u2019s all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series was okay. It was a good watch but it was nothing amazing. I do recommend this to people who wanna watch some otaku-related romance. I\u2019m also looking forward to its next season and the live-action movie.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all for now, thanks for reading!!",

            "content": "When you have given up having anything to do with people, closing yourself up inside that damn thick and nothing but useless shell of yours, despite knowing yourself that it can go nowhere. Yet, for some reason, some people who doesn't know you keep coming to bother you and succeed in dragging you out of that shell. That's basically what there is to this series. \r\nTruthfully, this Anime was a disaster. The art was done poorly. You can tell that characters and background are not matching in both color and style for so many cuts. Then there are cuts where background felt like it wasn'tfinished in time and had to throw something in to cover it up. Over all color tried to pain it in a pink like color of romance, but actually manage to make the whole contrast with what went on with the plot even harder to overlook. Not to mention the animation was jagged. I'm not saying I want it to be smooth like some great Anime out there, but come on! You have to be kidding with that kind of animation. Sometime the action when so fast, sometime it went to slow. Cuts with repeating actions didn't quite match with sound effect either. Then, I don't know if it's just my internet, but there are even times when the audio actually cracked or jump up compared to the animation it was supposed to be with. And, best thing saved for the last, voice acting was so bad I can say with confidence that I can do a better job than what the original voice acting staff did. \\n\\n\r\nYet, somehow, the bad acting and by that, I mean, monotonous voicing actually fits with what type the characters are, surprisingly. One is a shitty coward archetype of a normal Otaku, one is the kind of can-not-say-no bullied kid, one is I'm-so-pretty-everyone-can-only-see my-look-and-talk-about-it lonely girl. These 3 were monotonous for the most part. But what amazing is, they are supposed to be monotonous like that. Given their background as revealed in this Anime, they really should be monotonous. The 2 Otaku with being bullied by classmate, and I'm just saying, this is pretty clear since they are archetype of what went on with Otaku in Japan. The girl is told to have gone out with so many people that I bet she would be so tired of it. They are right to be monotonous. It's surprising to me what should feel like a disaster of production miss actually turned out to be just fine with how the setting for characters are \"supposed\" to be to fit their own archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nYes, as I said, the characters are pretty much all but archetypes. From protagonist, heroine, protagonist best friend, romance adviser, pitiful rival, good-girl-yet-had-to-be-dumped third wheel, even mob characters are at most, archetypes of people in society. Having so many characters coming from some mold thrown into one series, it's no wonder to see that story line was at best mediocre. Shut in (by that I mean no more normal-human interaction) gets in trouble to meet a pretty girl and romance happen even if the guy was against it at first. And it was so fast for development to go from \"no way\" to \"yeah way\" in almost no time, like, 1 episode. After that, what went on was all misunderstanding except for, well, the third wheel characters. But heck, if you have experience with shoujo manga or anime, you'll see they are but old tropes and cliches. To be honest, it was painful to get through all 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed it was painful. But not only because of low production value or cliched plot line. But because I actually feel for well, most characters. I mean I have been most of them. Exactly because they are archetypes that they are relatable. I can see how the 2 Otaku are afraid of their desires for a romantic relationships. I can see how the heroine started to take interest in that good for nothing protagonist and how all other characters play their roles. Even if I say all of that up there about production value, I actually enjoyed it. I enjoyed how the characters felt so real, to a level of it being hilariously true that it's hurt. \\n\\n\r\nSumming it up: \\n\r\nArt: 3. \\n\r\nPoorly done and barely pass.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3. \\n\r\nBad, but somehow fits where it need to. However, it doesn't change the fact it was bad.\\n\r\nEven the opening and ending songs were hard to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4. \\n\r\nDecent;y done archetypes. But actually relatable.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5. \\n\r\nCliched. But because it's cliched, it can not go down any further.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10.\\n\r\nIt's out of my own experience that I'm giving this disaster a 10 on enjoyment. So I don't think this is going to be of help.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7. \\n\r\nNot something I would recommend to people, but if you find it and has been in this culture long enough while having almost the same problems, I bet you would want to watch it to see how the characters reach their happy ending, even if you can see they are going to from the very beginning.",

            "content": "Im wirting this review after seeing all the low scores and bad reviews. This anime is definitely worth givinga shot but i can understand why some people may hate this show.\r\nFirst of all the main character. He is your typical otaku type character with no real social skills. This may annoy some people, they expect the main character to be some macho dependable hero. No, what made 3D kanojo really good for me was the fact that the main character is really realistic in that sense. Introverted socially akward people will find him super relatable. He is not your typical hero, infact most of whathe says is super cringe worthy that makes you wanna slap your face then slap him afterwards because some of you may have made the exact same mistakes with women that he makes in the anime. But i would say that all the other characters are also quite unique, well thought out and realistic. Its that realism that may put some people off, the awkward, illogical and emotional tendencies of human beings.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story its obviously not complete yet but i havent read the manga so i cant speak about how well if follows the source material.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art, remember this is based of a shoujo manga, if you know anything about shojo manga then you will know that the style and art is rarely ever worth getting excited about. That being said, its about the dailogue and key moments which is done relatively well. So dont watch this expecting some kyoani level animation at all. That being said the flowery background feel that you get wth screens on shojou manga is done quite well on key scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI didnt particular hate or notice much of the music so while enjoyable nothing particular amazing or anything.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall this anime is worth watching especially if youre a kinda introverted guy, you will relate so much to this anime that if might just turn of the screen in frustration. I will definitely be looking out for a season 2 if that tells you anything about how much i enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nTL DR: This anime is about the characters and their relationshp and dialouges with each other. The characters can get a little bit realistic and cringe worthy so that might put you off but that is also what makes it great. So dont be turned off by the score and give it a try. Its definitely not for everybody but some of you will definitely enjoy this anime.",

Like being socially awkward is one thing but this guy is denser than a black hole. It feels really stupid and is painful to watch after sometime.\r\nThe animation quality also has some issues. It was average at the beginning but then gets worse a various points, it gets significantly bad towards the end of the season. I loved the opening song though - never skipped it. \r\nThe ending in itself wasn't anything great. Iguess there is going to be another season considering the introduction of a new character and some unanswered questions. Well, I cannot say I am looking forward to it. I honestly had lost interest by the 10th (?) episode itself I guess.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are having second thoughts about watching this: I honestly don't feel this is worth the time and I also don't know how good the manga is either. So, if you decide to give it a try, proceed at your own risk. I think this anime deserves a try at least.",

            "content": "Why should you watch 3D Kanojo: Real Girl?\r\nStory is Good (7). The story of 3D Real Girl is simple yet it is fun to watch. A full blown otaku is pulled into the world of 3D Girls (Real Life Girls) by a drop-dead gorgeous yet mysterious girl who's trying to look for something real in her world. I wanted to point out that even if my rating for the story is just 7, the amount of enjoyment I got from following the character's mundane yet interesting interactions is still a 9.\r\nArt is Good (7). The manga, which was the source of this anime adaptation hasa very basic art that does not try to hide the feelings of its characters. As for the anime, I was looking for the same treatment/interpretation to stand out from similarly animated anime that dominates the anime market. This was a bit of a disappointment to me since I really appreciate experimentation in how anime is presented artistically. Megalo Box is one of the standouts of the 2018 Spring Anime (I will go in more detail on my review of Megalo Box after it ends almost less than two weeks from today).\\n\\n\r\nSound is Good (7). \"Daiji na Koto (\u3060\u3044\u3058\u306a\u3053\u3068)\" by Quruli the opening song is really well made. It is honest, innocent and simple that it perfectly sets the mood of the story for me. I would have given the sound an 8 or even 9 if it was the same for the rest of the OST of 3D Real Girl. I really felt that it is a wasted effort to have a good start, but a mediocre follow up. \"HiDE the BLUE\" by BiSH the ending song is nice but not good enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Good (7). Iroha Igarashi. I don't know but she immediately spring rocketed to my no. 1 favorite anime character after watching the first episode of the story. She was the reason why I kept coming back to watch each and every episode of the anime and started catching up with the manga. The air of mystery that surrounds her paired up with her unpredictable actions is a straight 1-2 punch to my heart. She truly a 10 for me; however, it is not the same for the other characters. From Tsu Tsui to Mitsuya, they were all generic characters that were not fully developed... yet. I would give an honorable mention to the character of Ayado since she is such an adorable and innocent character.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the overall rating of this anime for me is good. I truly enjoyed the story which is the important thing when you watching something. You need to remind yourself sometime that watching is not a chore, but it is a tool to make feel good and be entertained. \\n\\n\r\nJust a side note, there is also a live action adaptation of this anime that would be out by September of this year. So if you are into that, please give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said. I would give 3D Real Girl 7 magical Iroha figure out of 10.",

I'm in the 4th episode now and their story is going strong. It's quite rare for an anime to show a relationship rather than just their usual take of the 'build up'. Also they do not miss the chance toshow affection! hate it when an anime has like 0 kisses but lots of sexual tension. this is super cute and great, please watch it!",

Also its a romance anime where teh focus is not on how the MCs get into a relationship but rather what problems they have to face while being in one.\r\nI actually like 3D Kanojo even more after every episode I watch. I really love it when the main characters are lovely people. Thats why this anime reminds me of Ore Monagatari or Say I love you.\r\nAlso it may be only me but its like Iroha is hiding something or just not telling something about herself which makes me kinda curious to knowwhat it could be. Also its kind of funny watching an anime about an otaku xD \\n\r\nFor an anime with just 12 episodes the story and the relationship developement between the characters arent that bad at all. But ofcaurse sometimes it may appear rushed, which in my opinion is often the case when an anime is under 24 episodes.\\n\r\nAll in all I enjoy watching 3D Kanojo.\\n\\n\r\nWell now after I finished the first season there are some things I want to add to my review.\\n\r\nAfter episode 7 it got a bit boring due to our MCs lack of understanding others and thus not being able to decide whats the best thing to do is. \\n\r\nIn the last 2 episodes a new character and I guess maybe rival to Tsutsui in the future (season 2) appeared. Also we get to see some cute/romatic moments not only from the MCs but also the supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\nI think 3D Kanojo had more potential but in the end its pretty mediocre. It still is fun to watch but my score definetely dropped after episode 7. I guess because a 2nd season is on the way they left some stuff open so I hope season 2 will be more intresting.\\n",

La historia se centra en los problemas que pasan en su relaci\u00f3n, aunque en ciertos puntos tambi\u00e9n desv\u00eda la mirada hacia los personajes secundarios y sus problemas, generalmente amorosos. La mayor\u00eda de problemas que sufren la pareja protagonista es debido a la inseguridad y la falta de comunicaci\u00f3n del protagonista, el cual debidoa ser marginado por los dem\u00e1s, no puede socializar ni entender a los dem\u00e1s.\\n\r\nAunque el anime no nos aporta nada nuevo y los personajes no dejan ningun peso importante en nosotros, este anime podria considerarse como anime romantico y de comedia con el que pasar el rato. A mi me gusto moderadamente aunque el personaje principal no me llego a gustar sinceramente.\\n\r\nActualmente se espera una segunda temporada de este anime.",

            "content": "Quick review. First this is my first review ever and I came out of my way to do this because of how low rating this anime is. I been watching anime for probably 7+ years so I think this is quite significant for me to do this. \r\nThis is one of my favorite romance anime of all times and I am happy i disregarded the rating. If you don't care about Art, Sound or Story and all you care about is the character and mainly ROMANCE, this is 100% for you. This is a no BS anime with misconceptions, 3rd party person who takes overhalf of the show.... Its literally pure romance. The anime seems low production, maybe some \"cringy\" things here and there, but like i said, if you are looking for ROMANCE, this is right for you. I have not watched a good romance anime like this in a while. I really hope more people understand and give it a try. I believe this anime is a hit or miss to some people, you either love it or you hate it.  \\n\r\nQuick thing on the otaku. I almost didn't watch this because of the otaku stuff.... but I did anyways because I am in need for new animes to watch since I watch so much anime. The character is good.... why? Because they are no blind or anything. The Otaku MC isn't some dumb unrealistic MC from my eyes. And the chick is the same. Her personality and everything is unique and awesome to watch and cute. I myself don't understand or truely know what an otaku is, even though all I do is play games and go to school, but if boobs are in front of my face, I would get em. Most animes that haves these \"otakus\" completely ignore the boobs and are like 70%  not interested in romance. But this anime is different which is why it is is good. The MC actually develops. \\n\r\nAlso, there are very few animes out there that are quick date into just development.\\n\\n\r\nSo give it a try if your into purely romance. I have watched this 5+ hours straight yesterday... and this is one of the few animes especially in the drama/romance animes that I did not get bored watching. Don't be deceived by the rating the anime currently has. I give it a 10/10 not because to boost the rating, but for the romance genre, it is a 10/10.",
