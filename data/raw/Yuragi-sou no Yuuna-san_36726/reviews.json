            "content": "With the sudden outburst of the Isekai genre, it seems that the Harem genre is no longer the most cancerous genre in the anime medium. As a result, I can now conspicuously boast about being a harem fanboy without drawing much attention, since people would be busy shitting on Overlord and SAO while I am doing that.\r\nThere is certainly a lack of public awareness regarding the whole harem genre scene, especially amongst the fledgling anime fans. The situation is so bad that recently, I saw somewhere posted on Disqus that Kogarashi, protagonist of the anime that this review is about apparently, is the most uniqueHarem main character because he becomes completely nonplussed seeing a pussy few inches from his face and in addition to that he is totally against the idea of willingly performing lascivious acts. Oh. My. God. I can already see the (world)ending! *fix glasses then moves on*\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched the show, I would advise you to wait for the blue rays to come out since the regular TV version hides the whole point of the anime i.e it censors boobs and asses.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] Coming to the story, I don't know why you guys even bother about the small stuff at this point. Haven't you already learned your lesson from watching other harem anime? The story is as cheesy as it goes. A poor 15ish years old itinerant decides to settle for a while so that he can enjoy his youth by attending a high school(ironic). Whilst ferreting for a cheap place, he stumbles upon an inn which is practically free to live in but, obviously, has a catch i.e it is haunted. Turns out that our boi is a psychic, powerful at that, who can vanquish his foes easily with nothing but just a fist. Mentally preparing his mind to get rid of the spirit that haunts the inn, he enters the inn to witness the greatest \"plot\" twist ever. The spirit is a girl, boobalicious at that. Not being able to finish her ass off cause reasons, he decides to straight up ignore her and resigns to the idea of living in the inn anyway. But lo and behold another interesting turn of events, the room that our boi gets designated is the very same room that the boobalicious babe's soul is tied to. What for- misfortune? Then like a chick magnet he starts adding chicks one after another to his harem. Then they lived (un)happily ever after.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters] YuragiYuuna has everything, or rather our boi has everything. From ghosts to humans to foxes to cats, his harem knows no limits. You name anything, his harem is a superset containing that. What? A ninja girl who also happens to be studying in the same school as our boi and is living in the same inn? That is rather specific. Butt he has it. Once again let me reiterate that our boi has everything, literally everything. Preach it. \\n\\n\r\n[Art] It is good. It feels good. It looks good. It gives you pleasure. It makes you want to reach beyond the digital boundary separating your one free hand and that booty of Yuuna then grab it so hard that her scream becomes the scream that pierces the heavens. Nuff said.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 10/10 stuff. Daame~~ and iyaa~~ have helped me pass exams crucial for my future. YuragiYuuna is a lifesaver, I owe my life to the series. Rather than all other anime that destroy lives, it saves lives.\\n\\n\r\nYuragiYuuna is a real fun ride to go on and if you are a fan of cliche harem stuff like To Love ru or Rosario to Vampire then look no further, you have arrived at the right place. \\n\\n\r\n\"A boobenlightening experience.\" - IGN\\n\\n\r\nTL;dr\\n\\n\r\nPros:-\\n\r\n- Boobs\\n\r\n- Asses\\n\r\n- School girls with mini skirts\\n\r\n- Bath scenes, lots\\n\r\n- Lolis\\n\r\n- Deres\\n\r\n- Boobs\\n\r\n- Asses\\n\\n\r\nCons:-\\n\r\n- Your expectations before watching the show",

            "content": "Every season, every year, there are new shows that you shouldn\u2019t watch with your parents or little siblings around. The ecchi and harem category constitutes for bringing glorious fan service at every way possible. I\u2019m not going to lie, watching Yuragi-sou n Yuuna-san (Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs) felt like diving into a pleasure of ecstasy.\r\nBased on the manga of the same name, it felt inevitable this show would eventually get animated on TV. It was just a matter of not if but when. The time came when the series decided to adapt itself into 12 episodes for a 1-cour season. What does thatmean? Well, that pretty much says the anime will not cover most of the material from the manga. It\u2019s a disappointment to fans for who wanted to see some of their favorite chapters in anime form. But make no mistake, this show still has what it takes to bring on fan service to a level that is satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not rocket science to figure out but the show features a harem of girls and a main male protagonist. Fuyuora Kogarashi is the lucky (or perhaps misfortunate depending on how you look at it) guy with an ability to see supernatural entities. After training and learning to fight against spirits, he is now looking for a normal life. This lands him to a boarding house known as the Yuragi Manor where his life really takes a turn. Pretty simple story right? To be honest, this show\u2019s plot is about as simple as it gets. Kogarashi is the standard protagonist who encounters a variety of beautiful girls. The most unusual one though is actually not human but takes the shape of a ghost. Meet Yuuna Yunohana, the female Casper of the inn!\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be straightforward here. You better get used to seeing fan service like ass, boobs, and compromising scenes often in the show. It\u2019s an ecchi that doesn\u2019t try to hide its intentions from day one. The first episode easily positions Kogarashi as an accidental pervert when he gets into some awkward moments with Yuuna. It\u2019s a bit impractical considering Yuuna isn\u2019t human but the show loves to create these moments for the sake of fan service. Despite being a ghost, Yuuna is actually very innocent when it comes to feelings and is very shy about herself. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t truly know more about her past although the show makes it clear that she\u2019s not malicious in any way or form. The character chemistry between her and Kogarashi is very noticeable as the two understands each other more. \\n\\n\r\nAs a show with a harem, expect girls of all type of personalities. Ninja girl Sagiri is serious and overreacts when she is complimented by others. Yaya Fushiguro has a cat-like personality of always being curious with playful energy. Nonko adds more of the adult humor in this series with her carelessness and seemingly never taking anything serious (with exception of manga drawing) Chitose Nakai has a more mature personality and is very helpful towards others. Then, there\u2019s Chisaki, a friendly girl that misunderstands many situations in the show especially regarding men. You get the big picture here? It\u2019s a troupe of female characters that fills almost every category of harem archetypes.\\n\\n\r\n If you don\u2019t fancy harem shows of similar nature (example: To-Love Ru), you\u2019re not going to find much enjoyment here. And unfortunately, don\u2019t expect much character development from them either. It\u2019s a 12 episode show that pretty much dedicates itself like supernatural sit-com of misadventures. Almost every episode consists of story segments to show Kogarashi\u2019s new unusual life. There\u2019s going to be tons of misunderstandings and teasing all around. As it also contains supernatural elements, expect some common logic to be thrown out the doors. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t really care who the studio for this show would be in the end as long as they made the characters look faithful. Thankfully, that is the case even though a studio like Xebec took on the project. Oh who am I kidding? They did work on the To-Love Ru franchise before. Nonetheless, expect fan service to be saturated all over the place. Some of the moments from this series also reminds me of To-Love Ru especially when Kogarashi accidentally gropes a girl\u2019s chest, ass, or some other private body part. The main selling point is the character reactions as some characters tends to overreact more than others (I\u2019m looking at you, Sagiri, Yuuna, and Chisaki) There\u2019s a lot of suggestive camera angles on the female characters so be ready for that too. While the technical quality of the show isn\u2019t anything spectacular, it definitely leaves little to the imagination when it comes to that fan service. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a harem. It has fan service. It\u2019s sexy. There are probably countless other words to describe Yuragi-sou no Yuuna but it\u2019s pretty much you\u2019d expect. There\u2019s nothing really unique about it with its harem cast and daily shenanigans. I can say honestly that fan service can be sold well to an audience when it has a clear mission in mind. For this particular anime, they completed that mission.",

            "content": "Well, well, lookie what we have here. \"It's the seasonal trash of harem and ecchi that has dawned on us again once in awhile!\" I beg to differ, because of what this show has been, it was a time waster but yet did find a fairly good time watching this overall.\r\nStory (just for contextual reasons as it serves very little meaning thereafter):\r\nKogarashi Fuyuzora, our male harem MC, has had quite the life: He's a qualified spirit medium, trained from young to harness the ability to see, discern and exterminate evil spirits. However, his background is anything but noteworthy as he is poor and homeless, andis searching for a place to reside in.\\n\\n\r\nEnter in the \"haunted\" Yuragi Inn, which he has found in the search for a lodging place, and is cheap due to the inn being haunted by a high school JK whose corpse was laid for as long as it has held. Nevertheless, Fuyuzora settles in and unwittingly does as the former popular inn now houses women of all dimensions (sexy, loli, you name it). Since it has always been his duty to purify ghosts, it is not until his encounter with the ghost, Yuuna Yunohara, changes his life upside-down (and eventually helping her to be purified as a good spirit)! Together with the residing women of Yuragi Inn whom look ordinary from the outside, but with their unique supernatural powers, our male harem MC's life will never ever be the same again!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just to provide the introduction to the main series overall, but what \"sets (the story) apart\" is with the characters who supports the episodic plots:\\n\r\nKogarashi Fuyuzora is more than just the dense harem joker, amidst from always falling prey into the seemingly endless amount of insane lewd ecchi moments, he's a solid character that does willingly as his motivation and passion of a spirit medium does, through trained possessed experiences as a child which shapes who he is ar his core.\\n\\n\r\nThe residents of Yuragi Inn:\\n\r\nYuuna Yunohara the titular female ghost, has no recollection about her past existence, but the point through is that for seemingly some reason, her being bound to Yuragi Inn does not forebode well to the inn if it ever wants to receive customers again (who knows?), and therefore attaches herself to Kogarashi in order to find a cure to the bounded curse and be set free.\\n\r\nSagiri Ameno the demon-slaying ninja, with her sole purpose to venture and fulfill her clan obligliations to eliminate harmful and evil spirits. On the way, her tsundere-ness grows with the non-acceptable lewd and hidden love moments with Fuyuzora, to the point of her imagination running wild.\\n\r\nYaya Fushigoro the human-cat vessel for the Cat God, she serves the purpose of providing others with her power, while maintaining a dandere look, one that doesn't demand others attention, but yet when needed, she is a force to be reckoned with.\\n\r\nChitose Nakai the loli-looking girl who's the caretaker of Yuragi Inn, but with a definite twist of luck. That's because her power is manipulating the luck of the people of her choice, but with great power comes great consequences, so her power isn't used much. Other than that, despite her appearances, she is a great caretaker whom cares for everyone.\\n\r\nNonko Arahabaki the busty crude girl whom isn't afraid to show her affections...at the sight of alcohol, that which stores her power as an oni. Her side job of being an manga author is what she does to maintain her constant supply of alcohol. Always the proactive character, her power is one that must not be undermined.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters:\\n\r\nKoyuzu Shigaraki, a raccoon kid who is capable of shapeshifting into other people, with the help of her leaf charms which by no surprise helps her be covert with her movements, and the overtime settlement at Yuragi Inn helps her coincide better with the girls and Fuyuzora.\\n\r\nChisaki Miyazaki, the oh-so-dull high school classmate, with the usual troupe of being popular for the most aestethical of traits, which is beauty. Similar to Sagiri, she is yet another tsundere that is aware of her own existence beside Fuyuzora, constantly having lewd thoughts and unable to maintain her stance (for majority of the time).\\n\r\nRyuuga Genshiro and Oborou Shinto, the male heir of his own clan and the half-daughter of the Black Dragon God bloodline. Mostly for filler (the manga covered a bit more), both characters won't stop at nothing to realize their ambitions, with Oboru subsequently moves to Yuragi Inn in the hopes of harbouring a child through Fuyuzora, and in the midst, you;ve guessed it once again, like Sagiri and Chisaki, another girl vying for Fuyuzora's naive attention.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd think that the whole host of characters are what defined the overall series, and you'd be right to say that, because this show is entirely subserviant to the growth of the many characters, and for a sense, they all work their parts well.\\n\\n\r\nXebec's production values are good to say the least since it's a harem rom-com series, and they don't have to take a lot of considerations and liberties with the source material (decent but good manga adaptation). Both the art and animation are neither striking nor noteworthy, but for what's presented here overall, I'll take it anyday. The character models are definitely unique and props to the character designers as they stand out and it's easy to discern the character traits. Overall, an easy-to-the-eye production with good art and animation that doesn't make you cringe a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one that gives off the Slice-of-Life feels, yet it doesn't force you to grow on it much. Luna Haruna's OP definitely gives off that vibe, that it's a series that just explains its insane cheesy traits and it's good. Same with the ED by Yuuna, Sagiri and Chisaki, which supports the claim that whatever this anime wants it to be, \"Lets-a-go!\" with it. A good mix of genres I must say.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not a fan of trashy ecchi, I would ask you to turn away at this moment. What's not to love about ecchi series such as this one, while it takes your time away by watching and insulting trash, it certainly doesn't disappoint if you're one that doesn't take everything here seriously, and honestly it's just a good time overall. I'd recommend this to diehard ecchi fans who just can't be milked enough from the genre.",

            "content": "Well... this was some anime. \r\nSo now that all episodes has finally released; I can finally review this anime.\r\nStory: (7/10)\r\nSo the story starts off with our MC (Kogarashi Fuyuzora) going to the hot springs for a place to stay, witch also happens to have a ghost \"haunting\" it. But since people claim it's \"haunted\", the place is pretty cheap to stay in. I should also note; the room he's staying in is the \"haunted\" room of the hot springs. Now, Kogarashi has a power to send ghost running in just one punch. So, with that ability, he can take advantage of the cost, and sendthat ghost running without having to worry about a ghost messing around with him. But that ghost happens to be a female (witch will also be our romance protagonist.) And of coarse; a guy doesn't really want to hit a girl. And her name is Yuuna. I should also mention Kogarashi has an ability to force ascend a ghost before they become corrupt. But to do that, I believe they have to have a lingering regret, but I could be wrong. So, Kogarashi ask's Yuuna what her lingering regret is, so she can ascend. And she doesn't know what her lingering regret is, but that get's explained why later in the anime. (witch I won't spoil.) So, Kogarashi is determined to make her happy to find her lingering regret. Now that that's out of the way; we can finally move on to the Art.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow I really did like the art style for this anime. It's very Moe, witch I am a fan of. Each character had their own unique style, and that's something I don't really see much. I mean in some anime, I see the exact same character ripped from some other anime, just with a different name, personality and minor changes to their appearance.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, there's nothing to say here, except for a 2018 anime, it's obviously probably going to be top tier. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the art, these characters are really enjoyable, and have there own unique personality's. Apart from Sagiri. She reminded me of Sera from Is This a Zombie? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10) \\n\\n\r\nI would had rated this a 10, but there are some things I disliked about this anime. Well, really, one thing. That is that There a some moments in the anime witch you know you have seen in all the previous episodes. But the comedy, ecchi, romance, is all fantastic. One thing they have to get right in comedy; is the facial expressions. And they definitely succeeded. There are a lot of funny moments in this anime what did make me laugh out loud many times. I also do think this anime could had benefited from an uncensored version, due to the annoying out of placed smoke covering up everything. But from what I've heard, the OVA is uncensored, but i'm not entirely sure if that's true. But I will be watching that at some time. I'll edit this review to confirm it. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: Yes, the OVA is uncensored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the most risky anime I have seen in a while, even with the censorship. But yeah, this anime is definitely worth a watch. I highly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the ecchi genre. But that concludes my review. \\n\\n\r\nSo, I give this my final score of: (9/10).\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. :)",

There's a lot of funny interaction between the characters since they all live together in a hot spring resort. However, there does seem to be quite a few tsundere types though which sometimes gets annoying.\r\nThere doesn't seem to be an overall plot to the show so it feels like you're watching a slice of life series.\r\nAll in all, the show might be for you if you're big into comedy shows, otherwise, I'd recommend you lookfor something else",

            "content": "Dear god I would have so much money if I had a quarter for every time this series did the lucky pervert trope.\u00a0 We would literally be down half a show in that case.\r\nStory:\r\nYuragi no Yuuna focuses on the story of Fuyuzora Kogarashi, an exorcist whose preferred (and only) method of cleansing evil spirits is through the use of his fists.\u00a0 Now moved to a new town with the prospect of getting through his high school life normally, he finds himself living in the Yuragi inn, a bathhouse turned boarding house filled with supernatural women, of various kinds, tropes, and (as apparent with this show'scontent), chest sizes.\\n\\n\r\nAs your run of the mill ecchi harem supernatural story (this is a surprisingly common genre despite the number of adjectives), Yuragi no Yuuna is a series without any shame when it comes to flaunting its wide assortment of supernatural women, doing the classic lucky pervert trope at any instance it can while systematically having our main protagonist conquer almost every existing female in the show one at a time through happenstance, or by virtue of him always being there to act as the hero and saving the featured girl of the episode/showing them his good side.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about it.\u00a0 Being so focused on fanservice, hardly any other aspects of the series have any notable presence, and we're unfortunately left with a show that can only stand because of that feature.\u00a0 It gets to the point that the punchline for any given episode IS the fact that Kogarashi either accidentally sees/fondles/looks away from the naked body of the show's female characters, and the A or B plot of the show is devoted to that final moment.\u00a0 The series is so baseless and devoid of plot the further you get that unless you're really needing a fix on ecchi, there's no reason for you to watch this.\u00a0 There are a few major arcs that do happen in the middle of it, but even then the punchline is still something sexual or related to something perverted.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Ecchi (for you ecchi fans)\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Not much else\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFuyuzora Kogarashi is our resident male harem protagonist this time around, boasting an upbeat attitude for a (hopefully) successful highschool life after surviving years of being possessed by various spirits and finally learning how to kick their ass so they don't bother him anymore.\u00a0 His trait of chivalry and protecting girls is what nets him the ladies, and the two common things you'll see him do is either: give an ass-beating to whoever is threatening him or his friends at the time using a convenient skill he picked up from one of the ghosts that were haunting him, or beat an ass cause he's ended up in a situation where he is either accidentally touching or tasting the privates of one of the girl's resident female characters.\u00a0 Though more to him than most harem protags, there's not much else to explain.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast for the most part falls into the same spectrum of being a member of Kogarashi's harem.\\n\\n\r\nYuuna, being the series's titular character/main girl is a ghost bound to Kogarashi's room, and proceeds to make his life a living hell by freaking out and tossing him out the window any time he accidentally touches where he's not supposed to even though it's clearly her fault that she ended up in that situation in the first place.\u00a0 The point of the series is to try and help her pass on to heaven, but since this show hardly focuses on actual plot, it's nothing more than a backdrop that gets forgotten 2 episodes into the series.\\n\\n\r\nOther girls involve Sagiri, the series's token tsundere threatened by her lack of feminine qualities and Chisaki, the only normal girl in the entire series who gets swept up in all of this and I guess is sort of the 'perfect waifu' trope.\u00a0 Or something like that.\u00a0 (There're a few others, but I'd argue these are the main ones.)\u00a0 These girls are mostly there to act as the bait for ecchi fans, and are usually the ones subjected to the treatment as a result.\u00a0 Most other characters are simply there to act out their predestined tropes, and being honest, have few other reason to be a part of this series otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Pretty much your standard harem cast\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Xebec, the company responsible for To Love Ru and Keijo, it...honestly makes sense for them to be responsible for this series.\u00a0 With bright colors with an almost glossy look to it, Yuragi no Yunna is a visually 'cute' and 'moe' series given common features such as round eyes and shapely bodies on its primarily female cast.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's the boring stuff.\u00a0 For ecchi, the series really tests the limit of what is allowed on television, using massive beams of light to cover up what's only allowed on the blu-ray, going so far as to devote entire scenes to accidental skinship and the comedic turmoil that comes with trying to get out of it.\u00a0 Expect this often because it's nigh inescapable given how this show has nothing else otherwise to entertain its audience.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Bright, colorful art\\n\r\n+/- A...lot of fanservice.\u00a0 A lot.\u00a0 Excessive really.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nLuna Haruna's \"Momoiro Typhoon\" is an upbeat song meant to sound cute in order to exemplify the typically upbeat and comedic atmosphere the show exhibits.\u00a0 Personally I think it's alright.\u00a0 Nothing too memorable about it aside from the hot spring sounds that're sprinkled throughout the song to remind you that the show is set in a bathhouse.\u00a0 Similarly, the show's ED \"Happen\", sung by the seiyuus of the Yuuna, Sagiri, and Chisaki (basically the entire harem) is a seiyuu song meant to have less energy compared to its OP sister.\u00a0 I find it pretty unmemorable too, so there's not really much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHaving heard of Yuragi no Yuuna prior to the anime's release, I was rather unsure what I was going to find myself in, given how it was a series that was apparently pretty popular yet I had never really heard of it being talked about.\u00a0 Having watched the show...now I know why the series is popular to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, this was a pretty bland watch.\u00a0 The show is so devoid of any kind of actual content due to the fact that more than half of the available runtime is used for gag chapters and/or lucky pervert situations that run for WAY too long that after the halfway part, I really stopped caring about what was going on.\u00a0 Constantly shouting \"It's not his fault!\" at every accusation towards Kogarashi was just wasting my breath, and choosing to pander to the lowest common denominator really didn't do it any favors.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I would just say skip this.\u00a0 If the show spent any amount of considerable time of making the plot of helping Yunna get to heaven a reasonable part of the series, then I would at least give it that for intrigue reasons, but since it doesn't and instead chooses to show us her tits for the fifth time in the same episode, this one is worth a pass.",

            "content": "Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san is your typical ecchi harem romance that airs ocasionally in your typical anime season. Except that fails in the third component of the \"ecchi harem romance\" and especially in the supernatural segments. Go with caution as there'll be some spoilers.\r\nStory (4/10):\r\nFuyuzora Kogarashi is a spirit medium that got broke and found a mysterious dorm called the Yuragi-sou (Yuragi Inn) where it says it's haunted by the ghost of a girl named Yuuna Yunohana. There is also a bunch of strange inhabitants like the ninja Sagiri Ameno, innkeeper Chitose Nakai that can manipulate one's fortune, Nonko Aharabaki, an ultra drunk well endowed mangaka,and much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is to help Ms. Yuuna Yunohara to find her personal lingering regret with the help of our main character Fuyuzora Kogarashi (read with Sagiri Ameno's voice), except that everything happens but the actual finding of Yuuna's lingering regret.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, in an ecchi harem romance anime, I usually expect a bunch of \"accidental\" boob grabbing, nice panties shots, funny deredere reactions from the girls and the harem male lead, and some intimate moments. In the last part is where Yuragi-sou fails a lot, very few moments of romantic moments, except the punctual situations of the Yuuna-Fuyuzora Kogarashi date in a hot spring and the Sagiri love poisoned segment.\\n\\n\r\nThe two \"arcs\" that have a certain relevance with the supernatural beings are the Black Dragon God arc where Fuyuzora Kogarashi with Sagiri and Koyuzu go on a mission to rescue Yuuna; and the final arc of the season where there is a couple in torment because of an accident of the boyfriend, wihich Fuyuzora Kogarashi and Yuuna help them to leave this world in peace.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that we have very few of the \"supernatural\" parts which I think they could have made wonders for Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san, rather it's much more focused on the comedy aspect with a blend with slice-of-boob-life moments. I don't expect a High School DxD or a Zero no Tsukaima every season, but if you don't wanna consider the supernatural element of here, please make this anime more slice-of-lifey.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I suggest you to wait for the uncensored version as you'll enjoy better this ecchi harem romance anime in its full \"glory\", you should also go here with the mentality to just watch tits and ass and boob grabbings, nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):\\n\r\nNothing too much impressive for a low budget ecchi harem romance anime, all girls check my expectations for a ecchi harem romance series with all the physical attractiveness possible forms, from the very well endowed Nonko to the lolis Koyuzu and Chitose, not forgetting the middle of the roads Sagiri, Yuuna and Chisaki.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation looks quite acceptable and the backgrounds are relatively decent to not put you off in any moment.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing otherworldly, but nothing disappointing, it compliments the relative mediocrity of Yuragi-sou. The OP and ED are quite unremarkable and never entertaining to the point to not google it to hear the full version, which I generally do with at least one of the themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nYuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs has a very amicable and nice cast that surprised me why the rest of the series doesn't give more supernatural feelings, considering the nature of a 70% of the characters featured here:\\n\\n\r\nOur main character Fuyuzora Kogarashi is a very strong medium that has helped several ghost in pain to ascend to Heaven. Now wanting to enjoy a normal life, changes school struck with Yuuna, he plateaus quite a lot and starts to enjoy the life in the Yuragi Inn, which is quite understandable with the all hot bishis there.\\n\\n\r\nYuuna Yunohara is the ghost of a bound girl who was found dead in the Yuragi-sou, her poltergeist talent is quite strongs that activaces mainly because Fuyuzora Kogarashi keeps touching her unconsciously and then she throws her to the water. Yuuna never knows what happened before her dead and has amnesia.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri Ameno is a cold blooded ninja that trains consistently and in typical tsundere fashion, she occults all her feelings to Fuyuzora Kogarashi, even when love-poisoned, she manages to keep some of her cool aura around her.\\n\\n\r\nChisaki Miyazawa is classical hottest girl in high school that doesn't believe in spiritual things, but by encountering Fuyuzora Kogarashi, she starts to feel something for him and gets to know better the rest of the girls of the Yuragi-sou, even the unseen Yuuna.\\n\\n\r\nOf the rest of the cast, the most importants are the well endowed drunkie Nonko Aharabaki, the feline Yaya Fugishiro, the lolis Chitose Nakai and Koyuzu Shigaraki, and the ex servant of the Black Dragon Lord Oboro Shintou, who in classical Xenovia fashion, she wants the genes of Fuyozora Kogarashi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\r\nOf course as a man of culture who appreciates their ecchi harem romance anime will sure enjoy quite a lot of the series as they tick all the necessary ingredients to enjoy this kind of series. However, don't expect much more in here, as the supernatural part here is quite mediocre and the romance is reduced to minimal situations.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final comment, I'll be surely waiting the uncensored version to have better pleasant visuals of the hot bishis of here, and a possible new season, hoping that in there we can have much more supernatural elements to enhace this cute ecchi harem romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10. It's very improvable show, but was quite bad executed.",

            "content": "I personally don't hate ecchi and harem anime, besides there are several times i usually enjoy them a lot and quite useful to fill my boredom, and this anime is one example, it's \"not good but also not that bad\" category because there are many flaws here but still quite enjoyable and it's still worth watching for harem anime fans out there or just want to fill your free time. First of all, i am not a type of person who like to review and judge an anime when it's still airing but this time i hardly must break it because i can't hold myselfto express my opinion about this anime after these episodes they offered. \\n\r\nFirst is the story, let's be honest here, anybody who watch an ecchi-harem anime hardly thinking about a decent story right, this is the simplest premise of story this anime has: it's started with our mc (Kogarashi) moves to a cheap lodging where he meets a cute ghost (Yuuna) and promise to release her from the world by fullfill her wishes so she can rest in peace. The story premising is simple, but with 9 episodes aired already i'll be honest there is only slightly progress happen, only 1 or 2 episodes who probably focusing on it, we instead always got unlimited dose of ecchi moments where the mc always end up in bad situations either he got beaten up by other girls or being treated as a pervert entire time which is ALWAYS he never meant to do that in the first place, not mainstream enough? We also got one tsundere giri, a legal loli, a drunk onee-san, and cat girl, and oh a normal student girl (which all of them are basic formula of any harem anime). But before you got irritated, actually after some episodes later, the mc starts growing like a man and get better and most all the girls are getting tamed already by the mc who solve their each problems. The problem is the progress seems happen after episode 5 and later after that and pretty much the main story is just being a decoration here, which is understandable because \"plots\" are more important in this kind of anime. Now the characters, in my opinion most characters are boring and forgettable, until the point you can't care much about them and only care for the \"plots\", and in early episodes some of them are being so annoying, especially the tsundere ninja girl and heroine of this anime, Yuuna herself who keeps being the main factor of main character's misfortunes. The main character is so bland at first and always accept any misfortunes he got instead stand a chance to protect his pride (one of the most mainstream thing in harem), but later like i said he then start to gaining respect from them for what he did (being a cool and you'll get take down all the bit**es!). But the character design is top notch for me, all the characters are looking good even the main character which is a wise decision i think because it fits when he shows his cool moments sometimes. Another good thing they did pretty well so far is the fine animation which i don't really have problem from beginning, yes sometimes there are bland drawing but i don't have problem with it personally. The music and ost are average, the voice acting is not bad although some high pitching voices from the girls can irritate my ears sometimes, but rest of them are yeah, not that bad in my opinion. I probably going to update this review if in any case this anime could change my mind in the future either is gonna be a good one or a bad one, it depends on what they have to offer for the episodes left.",

If you are looking for some plot driven show, this is not for you.\r\nStory 7\\10\r\nOur MC is a exorcist, and he gets a room with a ghost girl called Yunna and other supernatural creatures that look human. There is an established goal made in episode one, and its for yunna to ascend peacefully, and so far the show has not forgotten it even if they digress sometimes.\r\nArt 9\\10\r\nDrawn amazingly, the anime feels smooth, looks great, key parts look better, high quality all over.\r\nSound 9\\10\r\nMusic is subjective, but the whole soundtrack isgreat, especially for a laid back anime.

The main girl and MC however I am giving this show praise in regards of the characters.  MC is not bland, has a personality and it would be fun to hang out with him irl unlike other generic boring MC's in anime in general, and to find one in a fanservice anime as well. I was happily surprised but I could tell from the character design and premise of the story he would not be bland. The main girl Yunna is amazing as well, just cute all over and beatiful to its core, 9\\10 for waifu standards.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\10\\n\r\nSlice of life echii comedy's are 50/50 for me since I like more serious anime plot driven animes besides for very few, but this show makes me laugh and entertains me to the point I ask myself where did 23 minutes go every time I watch the latest episode.\\n\r\nOverall 8\\10\\n\r\nThis could change, but I doubt it, For a echii to get a 9\\10 or higher and not be dxd would be considering it a masterpiece in its genre.I would recommend giving the three episode rule/",

Yunohana Yuuna a Lala/Momo ripped off, both love to sleep besides the guy both often get themselves being sexually groupe by the guy and both doesn't seems to do anything to avoid it, Miyazaki Chisaki is a Sajenjin ripped off, who seemly have the same level of personality, Fushiguro, Yaya was certainly the Celine ripped off around here, Ameno Sagiri, well there is no doubt that she was the combination of Nana and Yami all rolled into one, Arahabaki Nonko can be considered as the Ryoko Mikado of To Love Ru who serves as the quintessential MILF around here and Shintou Oboro , well she was more like modified version of Zastine, what about Chitose Nakai? well pretty much she is the Yuki Mikan around here. Now just hoe enjoyable was this anime????? Well I'd say, it kinda look like that I wanna go to Japan seek out original creator  Miura Tadahiro and Xebec's studio executives and do what Sanzo of Saiyuki does to Goku when he's pissed, so my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory-Pathetic 1: It was a knock off of \"To Love Ru\" and just like it, it was just PATHETIC to the bone.  \\n\\n\r\nArt-Very Good 8: Cu'z it all about panties, boobs, and the guy who touches them girls and just wait a bit when the uncensored version come out. \\n\\n\r\nSound-Fair 6: I like the opening song, and the rest, I have no comment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Patchetic 1: Cu'z It was just like watching another version of To Love Ru where the characters where just a ripped off from the said anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-Poor 3: Like I've said, I kinda wanna go to Japan and do some Saiyuki stuff  like when Sanzo is pisssed off at Goku to the original creator and the studio exec, due to me being pissed off with this thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-Patchetic 1: It was just like any other harem anime with ecchi stuffs, not worth anything, so anybody who thinks this should have a season 2 , should ought a________ themselves. \\n",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be ready by those that have finished watching Yuragi and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.  \r\nBased off a popular manga of the same name Yuragi Sou no Yuuna san better known as Yuuna and the hot springs inn is a supernatural romantic comedy that also includes elements of Ecchi within it that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a spirit medium that despite being born with the rare ability to see and interact with spirits encountersenough misfortune that can sink a battleship were to be introduced to a seemly cheap boarding house called Yuragi manor that\u2019s available for him to rent. What's the catch you may ask. Well the inn you see is haunted by a beautiful girl called Yuuna that coincidently lives in the room that you chose to rent. \\n\\n\r\nRomantic comedy\u2019s like Yuragi aren\u2019t anything that\u2019s rare within the industry given how easy it is to create them but inserting not just ghosts but also various types of supernatural creatures like Oni\u2019s, Cat gods, Zashiki Warashi, Tanuki\u2019s and demon slaying ninja\u2019s is something that\u2019s not just unusual but also quite wacky as well something that I felt this series was aiming for all along. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one that did a good job of introducing both the main character Koga and his profession and skills as a spirit medium and the titular character of Yuuna and made enough of an impression on me that I decided to watch the series to the very end. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place within the modern day Yuuna and the hot springs inn is largely set within the titular boarding house and the town Yukemuri town that it inhabits. The boarding house which was formerly a famous hot springs inn that was relatively famous within the local area had shown a steep decline in visitors due to the number of increasing supernatural incidents that had started to take place within the inn. The overall story of the series follows the life of Kogarashi Fuzuyora a 16-year-old teenager who as a result of being born with the rare ability to not just see and interact with spirits but be able to be possessed by them has found his life to be one that consists of nothing but misfortune. So bad in fact that despite being a high school freshman Koga still hasn\u2019t managed to secure a place to lodge yet even as his first day is edging ever closer. However, one day after banishing a particularly pesky spirit Koga hears of a boarding house that doesn\u2019t just have a free room but also one that\u2019s unbelievably cheap as well. Despite the seemingly sketchy nature of the boarding house in question Koga glad only that he had a place to stay thought none of it and decided to take up the offer. But never did Koga expect to find himself sharing his room with a beautiful teenage ghost that has amnesia but also finds himself living with a host of beautiful girls that inhabit the boarding house that are anything but human. \\n\\n\r\nBut as Koga gets over the initial shock and begins to settle into both the boarding house and into the life of a high school student Koga starts to realize that while Yuuna and the members of the boarding house may not be your average housemates each of them despite being powerful and unique individuals of their own right have their own fears, insecurities and aspirations that constrain them things that Koga himself knows and understands all too well.\\n\\n\r\nAs Koga starts to gradually bond with the house\u2019s inhabitants and help them overcome their problems Koga not just gains something that\u2019s been lacking in his life due to his unique skill set which is that of friendship but also come to realize that despite not being full humans the inhabitants of the boarding house can be just as kind, thoughtful and helpful as they are and that their unique skill sets can become unexpectedly handy when the human\u2019s come under threat from the many malevolent and wacky opponents that start to show up. Joining Koga in this comedy filled adventure are a host of characters that include the friendly but overactive Yuuna, the kind and honest Chisaki and the sharp-tongued but unexpectedly insecure Sagiri. \\n\\n\r\nKogarashi \\n\\n\r\nKogarashi voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuki Ono of Food Wars and Strike the Blood fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and a rare example of a psychic user that cannot just see and interact with spirits but also be able to banish them with his fist Kogarashi in the beginning of the series was shown to be a kind, caring and honest person that while homeless and poor in the beginning did not let this affect his outlook on life. A friendly, intelligent and joking person by nature Koga while unused to having friends at the beginning of the due to the side effects his abilities give him was shown to someone that was not just able to forge friendships easily but also someone that was noted to be very loyal to them and willing to do his utmost to help them overcome their problems no matter what problems it is. Unlike most psychic users that are able to interact with spirits Kogarashi is someone that can be said to be more open-minded than most as he prefers to judge spirits based on their actions rather than on their physical appearance and as a result prefers to first get to know the spirits as individuals and understand them rather than say banish them on sight as most other psychic users would have. This within the series is shown in how Kogarashi met and interacted with Yuuna and how he handled the demon that showed up during the seaside trip that his class went on. While someone that is seen to dislike the more militant aspects of psychic mediums Kogaraishi is shown to be someone that\u2019s not afraid of using physical force if it meant that it can help protect his friends from harm. Despite the seemingly questionable nature of his role as a psychic Kogarashi is seen to be someone that\u2019s proud of his abilities despite the great misfortune that this had subjected to his life too which is shown in his willingness to reveal his job to others and offering to use his skills to help those that are in need despite the ridicule that Kogarashi knows would result. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and more of Kogarashi\u2019s personality is revealed his personality gradually starts to change. While shown to be someone that had been blessed with the rather unusual ability of not just being a psychic user but also being one that was born with the ability to be a spirit medium it can be seen that Kogaraishi did not view this blessed ability with anything approaching joy. While happy that his ability enables him to be able to not just interact with spirits but also banish those that are shown to be of a visible danger to humans it can be seen that this ability is something of a double-edged sword to him as while useful it also had the rather unfortunate side effect of making Kogarashi\u2019s life a literal hell as his status of a spirit medium meant that Kogaraishi often ended being possessed by various spirits whose vastly differing personalities caused him to undertake many actions that had the effect of causing him to be marked by society as a weirdo and ensured that Kogarashi had few of any friends prior to his arrival at the inn. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, while making his life hell its interesting to see that this past of his also created something of a silver lining for each of the spirits that possessed him despite leaving his body left behind the many innate skills that they had attained when they were alive skills that not just varied but also proved to be extremely useful to Kogarashi within the series as he protected his friends. The number and variety of skills that Kogarashi had as a result of the spirits I felt were interesting and impressive and I felt more than made up for his past. While shown to be a friendly person and someone that made his decision after giving it much thought it can be seen that this attitude of his changes when he sees his friends lives at stake and indeed in this state it can be seen that Kogarashi actually loses his calm and laid back attitude and instead adopt one that\u2019s not just determined but also willing to fight hard to save and protect them even if it meant that do some questionable things like storm a palace almost single handily which is best shown in his rescue of Yuuna from the dragon gods palace. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Kogarashi I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with his evolution from a quiet, friendly and laid-back person to one that was determined to make actual friends and protect them from harm with his unique abilities being especially well done. Given the hell that his abilities caused him I'm actually quite surprised that Koga not only resisted the urge to resent his powers but instead realize how useful it can be if it was used to calm and befriend spirits which is another thing that I admired about Kogarashi\u2019s character. I felt that his voice actor Yuuki Ono did an excellent job of portraying the character of Kogarashi. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYuuna \\n\\n\r\nYuuna voiced by new seiyuu Miyuri Shimabukuro is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Koga\u2019s friends within the series. A ghost girl that Koga encounters early in the series after unknowingly renting the room that served as her home within the boarding house and thus making Yuuna his roommate. A curious, nervous but polite ghost Yuuna despite being a ghost is someone that comes off as something that\u2019s different to what most people imagine ghosts to be as Yuuna far from being malevolent is actually someone that\u2019s innocent, friendly and kind. As a result of both the fact that she\u2019s a ghost and the fact that the boarding house that she calls her home has seen a massive decline in tenants Yuuna in the beginning of the series can be seen to be someone that was relatively lonely as she lacked any real opportunities to make any new friends. As a result of this upon meeting Koga Yuuna was seen to have become overjoyed at the thought that she will be able to forge a new friendship with someone new and as a result was able to forge an immediate friendship with Koga. This immediate bond of friendship that Yuuna forges with Koga was aided greatly by the fact that Koga was different to the other tenants of the inn in that while he was human he also had the unique ability to not only see and interact with spirits but also by the fact that he treats them with respect rather than simply banish them like many of their kind would. This curiosity to Koga and the fact that he defended her from an attack served to form a strong bond between the two that only grew stronger as the series went on. While a friendly and curious ghost that was seemingly carefree it can be seen that Yuuna was someone that was quite perceptive and was shown to be conscious of Koga\u2019s attempts to help her attain her wish something that was both heartening to her and at the same time scary to her due to her inner conflicts that only increased as the series went on. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being a ghost, it can be seen that Yuuna still has a surprisingly number of things that and places that she wants to be able to do and see with some of them being quite normal like being able to go to school and going on a school trip with others and others being rather unique like having a sleepover and trading secrets with her fellow girls. This I felt was interesting as fulfilling these wishes for her actually allowed Koga and the others the opportunity to give Yuuna the school life that she wasn\u2019t able to have due to her early demise. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Yuuna gets to not just encounter and befriend Koga but also meet many other people her personality gradually starts to change. At the beginning of the series while initially wary of Koga due to his abilities as a psychic this feeling of distrust gradually vanished due to the kindness that was shown to her by him and she became very loyal to Koga acting as both a constant companion to him and a valued friend. This bond with both Koga and the many tenants within the boarding house only served to deepen as the series went on and indeed by the latter points of the series the bonds that Yuuna had managed to forge with Koga and the tenants while allowing her to forge many new friendships also served to make her realize just how important such bonds were and causing her to become much more protective of her friends to the point that she will be willing to use herself as a means to protect them. \\n\\n\r\nWhile content to simply observe and accompany Koga in his daily activities in the beginning of the series this attitude of Yuuna gradually starts to change as she gets to bear witness to the efforts that Koga puts in to protect those dear to him from harm which had the effect of causing her to realize that unlike him she was clumsy, na\u00efve and would do more harm than good if she tried to help. However rather than let these negative feelings affect her it can be said that this actually had the opposite effect as this prompted her to not just analyze her own strengths and weaknesses but also try to improve her skills and knowledge as she tries to be of better use to Koga. This I felt was interesting as it showed not just her determination to improve herself but also of her determination to be of better use to Koga someone that she grows increasingly fond off as the series goes on. \\n\\n\r\nChisaki \\n\\n\r\nChisaki Miyazaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Eri Suzuki of Amanchu and Toji no Miko fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Koga\u2019s classmates and friends within the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and the class idol within Koga\u2019s class Chisaki from initial impressions were seen to be someone that was kind, honest and understanding of others and while appreciative of the fame and praise that comes from her classmates Chisaki doesn\u2019t let this affect her core personality. Indeed, despite the fame Chisaki rather than being arrogant and prideful as some girls in her position will be is instead someone that\u2019s friendly, honest, considerate and caring to all she meets and ensuring that she has no shortage of friends within the school. While an open minded and kind person by nature Chisaki is also shown to be someone that\u2019s wary of outsiders and is someone that trusts slowly due to the number of people that would like to be her friend and as a result was shown to be quite wary of Koga at the beginning of the series. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, Chisaki at the beginning like her fellow classmates while curious about Koga\u2019s declaration that he was a psychic and had the ability to interact with spirits thought that it was just another attempt to make himself look more interesting to others. However, this later changed after Chisaki found herself the target of a malicious spirit that forced her to enlist the help of Koga despite the fact that she was still skeptical of his abilities. While the experience of seeing a spirit be not just revealed but convinced to stop their activities was an educational experience for Chisaki the unintended actions of Koga\u2019s tag along spirit Yuuna caused Chisaki to have a rather bad first impression of Koga and saw him as a violent pervert much to Koga\u2019s dismay. However, after seeing the way Koga resolved the situation with the spirit this attitude of her\u2019s gradually starts to change. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Chisaki begins to realize that Koga\u2019s abilities weren\u2019t just real but also that unknown to her and the general population creatures other than humans were coexisting with them. While understandably unnerved at this thought it can be seen that rather be frightened of this new revelation Chisaki due to her strong curiosity instead become more interested in this new world that was seemingly hidden from view as well as the various events that happen inside Koga\u2019s world. While developing an intense interest into both the world and into Koga as the series goes on this also extends to Yuuna as well. Unlike most people her age Chisaki while scared of Yuuna at first due to the fact that she was a ghost gradually got over this fear as she interacted with her and realized that far from being a malevolent spirit Yuuna was someone that was very similar to her both in terms of age and life experiences and as a result become fast friends. \\n\\n\r\nThis aspect of their bonding with each other within the series I felt was interesting as it proved to be an educational experience for both of them as they both sought to learn about each other and it was quite funny seeing the two converse with each other via messages. The character of Chisaki I felt was an interesting one and one that was developed quite well as the series went on. Her development from someone that while kind and caring was dismissive of things that she couldn\u2019t see to one where she was more open-minded and more willing to believe in not just the abilities of others but also of the fact that in this world beings that she hasn\u2019t seen before can indeed exist I felt was done well. I felt that her seiyuu Eri Suzuki did an excellent job of portraying the character of Chisaki. \\n\\n\r\nSagiri \\n\\n\r\nSagiri Ameno voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Comic Girls fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Koga\u2019s friends within the series. A teenage girl and a Kunoichi of the Chuuma ninja army Sagiri at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was cold, direct and sharp-tongued and while a beautiful girl was widely seen as unapproachable by many within the school that she goes due to both her intimidating presence and also because of the fact that she sees all men as enemies due to her upbringing within a single gender school. As a result of this at the beginning of the series it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising to see that Sagiri had a very antagonistic relationship with Koga as she believed that like all men Koga was nothing more than a beast that took advantage of vulnerable woman and as a result was not just protective of her fellow tenants but also showed a intense desire to fillet Koga with her kunai if she sees him do actions that she sees as suspicious which thanks to Yuuna is commonplace within the series. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, while someone that trusts others slowly and reacts brashly it can be seen that Sagiri is someone that has a firm sense of honor and is someone that both places a lot of trust in promises and someone that adheres to them no matter what kind of promises it was. In line with  Sagiri\u2019s firm sense of honor is something that can be seen to be the core of her motivation as both a person and a woman which is her firm sense of justice and her loyalty to the role as a Kunoichi that maintains the peace between the human and spirit realms a role that Sagiri is seen to be very loyal to. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Sagiri gets to not just encounter new situations but also meet many people that she never thought she will become friends with Sagiri\u2019s personality gradually starts to change. From the onset of the series, it can be seen that Sagiri while very loyal to her role as a kunoichi of the Chuuma school was someone that actually placed an emphasis on the former and as such placed a higher emphasis on her role as a ninja than that of a woman. This, when combined with the fact that Sagiri was educated in a single gender school, meant that she was both unused to how to converse with boys her age and unaware of the effect that her figure and beauty had on them which had the unfortunate effect of making her dislike boys due to her series of misunderstandings. However, as the series goes on and Sagiri gets to not just partner up with her self-proclaimed enemy Koga but also understand the effects that she has on people this attitude of her\u2019s gradually starts to change. In addition to her attitude towards boys becoming much softer and friendlier this change also had the unusual effect of awakening within Sagiri an inner fear of sorts where Sagiri develops a fear of the fact that she does not look feminine enough despite the fact that she\u2019s seen as one of the most beautiful girls within the school. This act of insecurity only served to expand as a result of seeing the kind of figures that her friend Chisaki and her housemate Nonko had and awakened within Sagiri a strong desire to try and change herself physically by adopting a new change in wardrobe. \\n\\n\r\nThis inner struggle of Sagiri\u2019s I felt was interesting as it while it did a great job of contrasting between her default direct and brash personality it also showed an obvious character development of her that came about as a result of not bonding with Koga but also realizing that so far in life she has been keeping an unnecessary distance between people of other genders. While shown to be very loyal to her duties and her ninja school in the beginning as the series goes on and as Sagiri gradually starts to realize just how valuable friendship can be to her this loyalty is supplemented by her loyalty to her friends and indeed it can be seen that at this point Sagiri is willing to act against the interests of her duties if it meant that she can save her friends from a nasty situation a decision that the Sagiri of the past would have scoffed at which is best shown in the attempted rescue mission that she enacted to save Yuuna from the dragon god. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Sagiri I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her development from a cold, blunt and sharp-tongued girl that treated all men with suspicion to one that was not just friendlier but also more understanding of others feelings being especially well done. I felt that Sagiri\u2019s development of the inner insecurity within her and her quest to become more feminine was used really well within the series to show not just her gradual realization of how attractive her figure was to others but also to indicate her growing feelings towards Koga. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Sagiri. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series were pretty well done with the characters designs doing a good job of reflecting the type of species that their true self was and the types of traits that they possessed. A good example of this within the series was Yaya\u2019s default behavior and Nakai\u2019s guise as an inn master that had dual personalities that differed from each other. Settings wise I thought the series made great use of a variety of terrain that did a great job of showing the kind of locations that can exist within the world. Of this, I felt that the dragon palace which was the home of the dragon god Genshiro was perhaps my favorite. While combat within the series wasn\u2019t especially common given Koga\u2019s determination to use diplomacy first and violence second I thought that the few fights that were within the series were well done with Koga and Sagiri\u2019s fight with the stripping monster and the brief fight between Koga and Genshiro being notable ones. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, I felt that the series OST did a great job of providing an effective soundtrack to the many wacky moments within the series. The series opening and ending themes which were Momoiro Typhoon that was sung by veteran singer Luna Haruna and Happen Kogarashi Ni Fukarete which was sung by Miyuri Shimabukuro, Eri Suzuki and Rie Takahashi in the guise of their characters I felt were both fun and catchy songs. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main characters or supporting ones. In particular, I felt that Yuuki Ono, Miyuri Shimabukuro, Eri Suzuki, and Rie Takahashi all did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Kogarashi, Yuuna, Chisaki and Sagiri respectively. In addition, while I didn\u2019t cover them within this review, I felt that Yui Ogura, Ai Kakuma, Sayaka Harada , Mikako Komatsu and Yoshimasa Hosoya all did an excellent job at portraying the supporting cast of Yaya, Nonko, Nakai, Oboro and Genshiro respectively. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Yuragi Sou no Yuuna san was an anime that I really enjoyed with its main strong points being its interesting premise, story, interesting characters, strong voice acting and its inclusion of fantasy creatures and supernatural elements into a typical school harem story. While the inclusion of supernatural elements like Yuuna and fantasy creatures like Oni\u2019s, cat god vessels and Zashiki Warashi within the series was a welcome change from what we usually see within harem animes I felt these weren\u2019t really used that well within the series due to their lack of character development which I felt was a shame. This was in contrast to the development that was given to the human characters of Sagiri and Chisaki who within the series I felt was developed pretty well with Sagiri, in particular, changing the most compared to how she was at the start of the series. The overall story of the series while funny wacky and featuring plenty of good examples of clothes shredding scenes I felt was too predictable and genetic and added little to make it stand out when compared to others within the genre. However, despite this, the story was not without its funny moments and these served to provide a great deal of entertainment to me as I watched the story unfold. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I felt that if Yuragi was given much better character development and some more unique scenarios that made use of the fantasy creatures then perhaps it might be more entertaining but as it is if you want an anime that\u2019s funny, simple and ones that features plenty of clothes shredding moments then you should give Yuragi a try. As a final score, I would say Yuragi deserves a final score of 7/10.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Gone are the days we sit back and just appreciate the show.\r\nThe people who say the MC is generic, the art is nothing special, the ecchi is a bit cliche, and the story (if there even is one) is drab- I can't say they're completely wrong.\r\nHowever, no matter how overplayed a trope is or how \"unoriginal\" an anime can be, I like to think each title has a bit of its own special magic, and that's what contributes to our enjoyment. This show has that magic.\r\nThe overall package just works together tomake it really enjoyable. I can sit back and no matter how \"terrible/cringe\" this show gets, I can enjoy it. The art style is delightful, the OP/ED gives it a memorable signature, and the harem is kawaii.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you want a more objectified look at why I like this anime: the humor is funny, the girls are likable, well-designed, and well-written, and the story is simple yet not all too predictable. I can't dislike a show that has me chuckling and swooning.\\n\\n\r\nTo end on a more neutral note, if you like comedy and ecchi, I can't see this anime faulting you. The supernatural theme is a nice touch and works. You can tell that even though they may have a smaller animation budget, love was put into character details and expressions. Give it a shot and you may just enjoy the kawaii within.",

Then look no further than Yuragi-sou Yunna-san! \r\nStory: The story basically revolves around our main man Fuyuzora.  He is a guy who specializes in taking care of spirits by punching them.  He moves into a yep you guessed it, a haunted hot springs where he rooms with the cute ghost girl haunting the place.  He takes a liking to her, and decides to help her along with all the other residents in the building with their problems.  \r\nArt:  The art in this anime was really good! All thecharacters looked nice and there was good attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening theme was really catchy and i didn't have to skip it everytime like I usually do with an anime opening.  All the characters sounded nice as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All the characters were likable and fun to watch.  Fuyuzora was a good guy who was also a badass who had a majority of the girls wanting him.  Yunna was a cute ditsy ghost girl who was really sweet and actually didn't blame perverted mishaps on our guy Fuyzora like most girls in an anime do.  All the other girls were cool too.  There was a drunk horny manga artist, a tsundere ninja, a cat girl, you name it! I liked everyone and didn't have a problem with anyone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Overall:  Overall, I enjoyed this anime.  It was a really nice easygoing show that had its ecchi funny moments along with its occasional badass action moment.",

Well now that we're at the end of the road with this show I gotta say I'm really glad I gave it a shot. Cause this one is a lot of fun. Made me laugh and smile tons of times. \r\nThe cast makes this whole thing for me. This group of characters was a ton of fun. Kogarashi is a great lead, he's no pushover really and is a good guy at heart. He caresand that matters a lot to me in a lead. Yuuna of course was my favorite of the girls, she's so sweet and precious it makes me want to hug and hug her and love her. She warmed my heart lots of times. Chisaki, Sagiri, and Yaya were other favorites. All the girls were great and all the side characters were a ton of fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing may not be anything spectacular or new, but as I said I think this cast makes the show shine. The mostly episodic nature of the show was pretty fitting for that. I know the manga is the same way too. I think that style lends itself to letting the characters run things so to speak. The main overall plot isn't important right now. It's getting these characters comfortable with each other and with their surroundings. It was handled pretty well to me. I liked just about all the side adventures they went on. \\n\\n\r\nOnly thing really negative I have to say about this show is maybe the animation isn't too good at times but really that's not too big a deal for me. Always preferred a great story over great animation. And maybe some of the gags didn't work all the time. But they were never awful or anything. Overall I really liked this show. I'd watch 8 or 10 seasons of this stuff. Speaking of.....\\n\\n\r\n8/10.",

But other than that, the storyline is pretty much as a laid-back show to enjoy unnecessary (censored) ecchi moments (which plays a big part in this anime). The amount of laughter was optimal, and the girls were aesthetically beautiful!!!   \r\nBut other than that, I still believe the manga is a lot better and represents a big spoiler party for the majority of this season. But yet I rated highly as I think it is worth mytime watching this enjoyable adaptation.  \\n\\n\r\nBut to make this show better, in my opinion, they should have a second season to introduce more characters (some characters. introduction felt rushed), and yes, the storyline gets more interesting deeper into the manga.  \\n\\n\r\nBut other than that, hope you all find this helpful and may convince you to check it out.",

As a result, I can now conspicuously boast about being a harem fanboy without drawing much attention, since people would be busy shitting on Overlord and SAO while I am doing that.\r\nThere is certainly a lack of public awareness regarding the whole harem genre scene, especially amongst the fledgling anime fans. The situation is so bad that recently, I saw somewhere posted on Disqus that Kogarashi, protagonist of the anime that this review is about apparently, is the most uniqueHarem main character because he becomes completely nonplussed seeing a pussy few inches from his face and in addition to that he is totally against the idea of willingly performing lascivious acts. Oh. My. God. I can already see the (world)ending! *fix glasses then moves on*\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched the show, I would advise you to wait for the blue rays to come out since the regular TV version hides the whole point of the anime i.e it censors boobs and asses.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] Coming to the story, I don't know why you guys even bother about the small stuff at this point. Haven't you already learned your lesson from watching other harem anime? The story is as cheesy as it goes. A poor 15ish years old itinerant decides to settle for a while so that he can enjoy his youth by attending a high school(ironic). Whilst ferreting for a cheap place, he stumbles upon an inn which is practically free to live in but, obviously, has a catch i.e it is haunted. Turns out that our boi is a psychic, powerful at that, who can vanquish his foes easily with nothing but just a fist. Mentally preparing his mind to get rid of the spirit that haunts the inn, he enters the inn to witness the greatest \"plot\" twist ever. The spirit is a girl, boobalicious at that. Not being able to finish her ass off cause reasons, he decides to straight up ignore her and resigns to the idea of living in the inn anyway. But lo and behold another interesting turn of events, the room that our boi gets designated is the very same room that the boobalicious babe's soul is tied to. What for- misfortune? Then like a chick magnet he starts adding chicks one after another to his harem. Then they lived (un)happily ever after.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters] YuragiYuuna has everything, or rather our boi has everything. From ghosts to humans to foxes to cats, his harem knows no limits. You name anything, his harem is a superset containing that. What? A ninja girl who also happens to be studying in the same school as our boi and is living in the same inn? That is rather specific. Butt he has it. Once again let me reiterate that our boi has everything, literally everything. Preach it. \\n\\n\r\n[Art] It is good. It feels good. It looks good. It gives you pleasure. It makes you want to reach beyond the digital boundary separating your one free hand and that booty of Yuuna then grab it so hard that her scream becomes the scream that pierces the heavens. Nuff said.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 10/10 stuff. Daame~~ and iyaa~~ have helped me pass exams crucial for my future. YuragiYuuna is a lifesaver, I owe my life to the series. Rather than all other anime that destroy lives, it saves lives.\\n\\n\r\nYuragiYuuna is a real fun ride to go on and if you are a fan of cliche harem stuff like To Love ru or Rosario to Vampire then look no further, you have arrived at the right place. \\n\\n\r\n\"A boobenlightening experience.\" - IGN\\n\\n\r\nTL;dr\\n\\n\r\nPros:-\\n\r\n- Boobs\\n\r\n- Asses\\n\r\n- School girls with mini skirts\\n\r\n- Bath scenes, lots\\n\r\n- Lolis\\n\r\n- Deres\\n\r\n- Boobs\\n\r\n- Asses\\n\\n\r\nCons:-\\n\r\n- Your expectations before watching the show",

            "content": "Every season, every year, there are new shows that you shouldn\u2019t watch with your parents or little siblings around. The ecchi and harem category constitutes for bringing glorious fan service at every way possible. I\u2019m not going to lie, watching Yuragi-sou n Yuuna-san (Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs) felt like diving into a pleasure of ecstasy.\r\nBased on the manga of the same name, it felt inevitable this show would eventually get animated on TV. It was just a matter of not if but when. The time came when the series decided to adapt itself into 12 episodes for a 1-cour season. What does thatmean? Well, that pretty much says the anime will not cover most of the material from the manga. It\u2019s a disappointment to fans for who wanted to see some of their favorite chapters in anime form. But make no mistake, this show still has what it takes to bring on fan service to a level that is satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not rocket science to figure out but the show features a harem of girls and a main male protagonist. Fuyuora Kogarashi is the lucky (or perhaps misfortunate depending on how you look at it) guy with an ability to see supernatural entities. After training and learning to fight against spirits, he is now looking for a normal life. This lands him to a boarding house known as the Yuragi Manor where his life really takes a turn. Pretty simple story right? To be honest, this show\u2019s plot is about as simple as it gets. Kogarashi is the standard protagonist who encounters a variety of beautiful girls. The most unusual one though is actually not human but takes the shape of a ghost. Meet Yuuna Yunohana, the female Casper of the inn!\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be straightforward here. You better get used to seeing fan service like ass, boobs, and compromising scenes often in the show. It\u2019s an ecchi that doesn\u2019t try to hide its intentions from day one. The first episode easily positions Kogarashi as an accidental pervert when he gets into some awkward moments with Yuuna. It\u2019s a bit impractical considering Yuuna isn\u2019t human but the show loves to create these moments for the sake of fan service. Despite being a ghost, Yuuna is actually very innocent when it comes to feelings and is very shy about herself. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t truly know more about her past although the show makes it clear that she\u2019s not malicious in any way or form. The character chemistry between her and Kogarashi is very noticeable as the two understands each other more. \\n\\n\r\nAs a show with a harem, expect girls of all type of personalities. Ninja girl Sagiri is serious and overreacts when she is complimented by others. Yaya Fushiguro has a cat-like personality of always being curious with playful energy. Nonko adds more of the adult humor in this series with her carelessness and seemingly never taking anything serious (with exception of manga drawing) Chitose Nakai has a more mature personality and is very helpful towards others. Then, there\u2019s Chisaki, a friendly girl that misunderstands many situations in the show especially regarding men. You get the big picture here? It\u2019s a troupe of female characters that fills almost every category of harem archetypes.\\n\\n\r\n If you don\u2019t fancy harem shows of similar nature (example: To-Love Ru), you\u2019re not going to find much enjoyment here. And unfortunately, don\u2019t expect much character development from them either. It\u2019s a 12 episode show that pretty much dedicates itself like supernatural sit-com of misadventures. Almost every episode consists of story segments to show Kogarashi\u2019s new unusual life. There\u2019s going to be tons of misunderstandings and teasing all around. As it also contains supernatural elements, expect some common logic to be thrown out the doors. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t really care who the studio for this show would be in the end as long as they made the characters look faithful. Thankfully, that is the case even though a studio like Xebec took on the project. Oh who am I kidding? They did work on the To-Love Ru franchise before. Nonetheless, expect fan service to be saturated all over the place. Some of the moments from this series also reminds me of To-Love Ru especially when Kogarashi accidentally gropes a girl\u2019s chest, ass, or some other private body part. The main selling point is the character reactions as some characters tends to overreact more than others (I\u2019m looking at you, Sagiri, Yuuna, and Chisaki) There\u2019s a lot of suggestive camera angles on the female characters so be ready for that too. While the technical quality of the show isn\u2019t anything spectacular, it definitely leaves little to the imagination when it comes to that fan service. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a harem. It has fan service. It\u2019s sexy. There are probably countless other words to describe Yuragi-sou no Yuuna but it\u2019s pretty much you\u2019d expect. There\u2019s nothing really unique about it with its harem cast and daily shenanigans. I can say honestly that fan service can be sold well to an audience when it has a clear mission in mind. For this particular anime, they completed that mission.",

            "content": "Well, well, lookie what we have here. \"It's the seasonal trash of harem and ecchi that has dawned on us again once in awhile!\" I beg to differ, because of what this show has been, it was a time waster but yet did find a fairly good time watching this overall.\r\nStory (just for contextual reasons as it serves very little meaning thereafter):\r\nKogarashi Fuyuzora, our male harem MC, has had quite the life: He's a qualified spirit medium, trained from young to harness the ability to see, discern and exterminate evil spirits. However, his background is anything but noteworthy as he is poor and homeless, andis searching for a place to reside in.\\n\\n\r\nEnter in the \"haunted\" Yuragi Inn, which he has found in the search for a lodging place, and is cheap due to the inn being haunted by a high school JK whose corpse was laid for as long as it has held. Nevertheless, Fuyuzora settles in and unwittingly does as the former popular inn now houses women of all dimensions (sexy, loli, you name it). Since it has always been his duty to purify ghosts, it is not until his encounter with the ghost, Yuuna Yunohara, changes his life upside-down (and eventually helping her to be purified as a good spirit)! Together with the residing women of Yuragi Inn whom look ordinary from the outside, but with their unique supernatural powers, our male harem MC's life will never ever be the same again!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just to provide the introduction to the main series overall, but what \"sets (the story) apart\" is with the characters who supports the episodic plots:\\n\r\nKogarashi Fuyuzora is more than just the dense harem joker, amidst from always falling prey into the seemingly endless amount of insane lewd ecchi moments, he's a solid character that does willingly as his motivation and passion of a spirit medium does, through trained possessed experiences as a child which shapes who he is ar his core.\\n\\n\r\nThe residents of Yuragi Inn:\\n\r\nYuuna Yunohara the titular female ghost, has no recollection about her past existence, but the point through is that for seemingly some reason, her being bound to Yuragi Inn does not forebode well to the inn if it ever wants to receive customers again (who knows?), and therefore attaches herself to Kogarashi in order to find a cure to the bounded curse and be set free.\\n\r\nSagiri Ameno the demon-slaying ninja, with her sole purpose to venture and fulfill her clan obligliations to eliminate harmful and evil spirits. On the way, her tsundere-ness grows with the non-acceptable lewd and hidden love moments with Fuyuzora, to the point of her imagination running wild.\\n\r\nYaya Fushigoro the human-cat vessel for the Cat God, she serves the purpose of providing others with her power, while maintaining a dandere look, one that doesn't demand others attention, but yet when needed, she is a force to be reckoned with.\\n\r\nChitose Nakai the loli-looking girl who's the caretaker of Yuragi Inn, but with a definite twist of luck. That's because her power is manipulating the luck of the people of her choice, but with great power comes great consequences, so her power isn't used much. Other than that, despite her appearances, she is a great caretaker whom cares for everyone.\\n\r\nNonko Arahabaki the busty crude girl whom isn't afraid to show her affections...at the sight of alcohol, that which stores her power as an oni. Her side job of being an manga author is what she does to maintain her constant supply of alcohol. Always the proactive character, her power is one that must not be undermined.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters:\\n\r\nKoyuzu Shigaraki, a raccoon kid who is capable of shapeshifting into other people, with the help of her leaf charms which by no surprise helps her be covert with her movements, and the overtime settlement at Yuragi Inn helps her coincide better with the girls and Fuyuzora.\\n\r\nChisaki Miyazaki, the oh-so-dull high school classmate, with the usual troupe of being popular for the most aestethical of traits, which is beauty. Similar to Sagiri, she is yet another tsundere that is aware of her own existence beside Fuyuzora, constantly having lewd thoughts and unable to maintain her stance (for majority of the time).\\n\r\nRyuuga Genshiro and Oborou Shinto, the male heir of his own clan and the half-daughter of the Black Dragon God bloodline. Mostly for filler (the manga covered a bit more), both characters won't stop at nothing to realize their ambitions, with Oboru subsequently moves to Yuragi Inn in the hopes of harbouring a child through Fuyuzora, and in the midst, you;ve guessed it once again, like Sagiri and Chisaki, another girl vying for Fuyuzora's naive attention.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd think that the whole host of characters are what defined the overall series, and you'd be right to say that, because this show is entirely subserviant to the growth of the many characters, and for a sense, they all work their parts well.\\n\\n\r\nXebec's production values are good to say the least since it's a harem rom-com series, and they don't have to take a lot of considerations and liberties with the source material (decent but good manga adaptation). Both the art and animation are neither striking nor noteworthy, but for what's presented here overall, I'll take it anyday. The character models are definitely unique and props to the character designers as they stand out and it's easy to discern the character traits. Overall, an easy-to-the-eye production with good art and animation that doesn't make you cringe a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one that gives off the Slice-of-Life feels, yet it doesn't force you to grow on it much. Luna Haruna's OP definitely gives off that vibe, that it's a series that just explains its insane cheesy traits and it's good. Same with the ED by Yuuna, Sagiri and Chisaki, which supports the claim that whatever this anime wants it to be, \"Lets-a-go!\" with it. A good mix of genres I must say.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not a fan of trashy ecchi, I would ask you to turn away at this moment. What's not to love about ecchi series such as this one, while it takes your time away by watching and insulting trash, it certainly doesn't disappoint if you're one that doesn't take everything here seriously, and honestly it's just a good time overall. I'd recommend this to diehard ecchi fans who just can't be milked enough from the genre.",

            "content": "Well... this was some anime. \r\nSo now that all episodes has finally released; I can finally review this anime.\r\nStory: (7/10)\r\nSo the story starts off with our MC (Kogarashi Fuyuzora) going to the hot springs for a place to stay, witch also happens to have a ghost \"haunting\" it. But since people claim it's \"haunted\", the place is pretty cheap to stay in. I should also note; the room he's staying in is the \"haunted\" room of the hot springs. Now, Kogarashi has a power to send ghost running in just one punch. So, with that ability, he can take advantage of the cost, and sendthat ghost running without having to worry about a ghost messing around with him. But that ghost happens to be a female (witch will also be our romance protagonist.) And of coarse; a guy doesn't really want to hit a girl. And her name is Yuuna. I should also mention Kogarashi has an ability to force ascend a ghost before they become corrupt. But to do that, I believe they have to have a lingering regret, but I could be wrong. So, Kogarashi ask's Yuuna what her lingering regret is, so she can ascend. And she doesn't know what her lingering regret is, but that get's explained why later in the anime. (witch I won't spoil.) So, Kogarashi is determined to make her happy to find her lingering regret. Now that that's out of the way; we can finally move on to the Art.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow I really did like the art style for this anime. It's very Moe, witch I am a fan of. Each character had their own unique style, and that's something I don't really see much. I mean in some anime, I see the exact same character ripped from some other anime, just with a different name, personality and minor changes to their appearance.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, there's nothing to say here, except for a 2018 anime, it's obviously probably going to be top tier. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the art, these characters are really enjoyable, and have there own unique personality's. Apart from Sagiri. She reminded me of Sera from Is This a Zombie? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10) \\n\\n\r\nI would had rated this a 10, but there are some things I disliked about this anime. Well, really, one thing. That is that There a some moments in the anime witch you know you have seen in all the previous episodes. But the comedy, ecchi, romance, is all fantastic. One thing they have to get right in comedy; is the facial expressions. And they definitely succeeded. There are a lot of funny moments in this anime what did make me laugh out loud many times. I also do think this anime could had benefited from an uncensored version, due to the annoying out of placed smoke covering up everything. But from what I've heard, the OVA is uncensored, but i'm not entirely sure if that's true. But I will be watching that at some time. I'll edit this review to confirm it. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: Yes, the OVA is uncensored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the most risky anime I have seen in a while, even with the censorship. But yeah, this anime is definitely worth a watch. I highly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the ecchi genre. But that concludes my review. \\n\\n\r\nSo, I give this my final score of: (9/10).\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. :)",

            "content": "Dear god I would have so much money if I had a quarter for every time this series did the lucky pervert trope.\u00a0 We would literally be down half a show in that case.\r\nStory:\r\nYuragi no Yuuna focuses on the story of Fuyuzora Kogarashi, an exorcist whose preferred (and only) method of cleansing evil spirits is through the use of his fists.\u00a0 Now moved to a new town with the prospect of getting through his high school life normally, he finds himself living in the Yuragi inn, a bathhouse turned boarding house filled with supernatural women, of various kinds, tropes, and (as apparent with this show'scontent), chest sizes.\\n\\n\r\nAs your run of the mill ecchi harem supernatural story (this is a surprisingly common genre despite the number of adjectives), Yuragi no Yuuna is a series without any shame when it comes to flaunting its wide assortment of supernatural women, doing the classic lucky pervert trope at any instance it can while systematically having our main protagonist conquer almost every existing female in the show one at a time through happenstance, or by virtue of him always being there to act as the hero and saving the featured girl of the episode/showing them his good side.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about it.\u00a0 Being so focused on fanservice, hardly any other aspects of the series have any notable presence, and we're unfortunately left with a show that can only stand because of that feature.\u00a0 It gets to the point that the punchline for any given episode IS the fact that Kogarashi either accidentally sees/fondles/looks away from the naked body of the show's female characters, and the A or B plot of the show is devoted to that final moment.\u00a0 The series is so baseless and devoid of plot the further you get that unless you're really needing a fix on ecchi, there's no reason for you to watch this.\u00a0 There are a few major arcs that do happen in the middle of it, but even then the punchline is still something sexual or related to something perverted.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Ecchi (for you ecchi fans)\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Not much else\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nFuyuzora Kogarashi is our resident male harem protagonist this time around, boasting an upbeat attitude for a (hopefully) successful highschool life after surviving years of being possessed by various spirits and finally learning how to kick their ass so they don't bother him anymore.\u00a0 His trait of chivalry and protecting girls is what nets him the ladies, and the two common things you'll see him do is either: give an ass-beating to whoever is threatening him or his friends at the time using a convenient skill he picked up from one of the ghosts that were haunting him, or beat an ass cause he's ended up in a situation where he is either accidentally touching or tasting the privates of one of the girl's resident female characters.\u00a0 Though more to him than most harem protags, there's not much else to explain.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast for the most part falls into the same spectrum of being a member of Kogarashi's harem.\\n\\n\r\nYuuna, being the series's titular character/main girl is a ghost bound to Kogarashi's room, and proceeds to make his life a living hell by freaking out and tossing him out the window any time he accidentally touches where he's not supposed to even though it's clearly her fault that she ended up in that situation in the first place.\u00a0 The point of the series is to try and help her pass on to heaven, but since this show hardly focuses on actual plot, it's nothing more than a backdrop that gets forgotten 2 episodes into the series.\\n\\n\r\nOther girls involve Sagiri, the series's token tsundere threatened by her lack of feminine qualities and Chisaki, the only normal girl in the entire series who gets swept up in all of this and I guess is sort of the 'perfect waifu' trope.\u00a0 Or something like that.\u00a0 (There're a few others, but I'd argue these are the main ones.)\u00a0 These girls are mostly there to act as the bait for ecchi fans, and are usually the ones subjected to the treatment as a result.\u00a0 Most other characters are simply there to act out their predestined tropes, and being honest, have few other reason to be a part of this series otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Pretty much your standard harem cast\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Xebec, the company responsible for To Love Ru and Keijo, it...honestly makes sense for them to be responsible for this series.\u00a0 With bright colors with an almost glossy look to it, Yuragi no Yunna is a visually 'cute' and 'moe' series given common features such as round eyes and shapely bodies on its primarily female cast.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's the boring stuff.\u00a0 For ecchi, the series really tests the limit of what is allowed on television, using massive beams of light to cover up what's only allowed on the blu-ray, going so far as to devote entire scenes to accidental skinship and the comedic turmoil that comes with trying to get out of it.\u00a0 Expect this often because it's nigh inescapable given how this show has nothing else otherwise to entertain its audience.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Bright, colorful art\\n\r\n+/- A...lot of fanservice.\u00a0 A lot.\u00a0 Excessive really.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nLuna Haruna's \"Momoiro Typhoon\" is an upbeat song meant to sound cute in order to exemplify the typically upbeat and comedic atmosphere the show exhibits.\u00a0 Personally I think it's alright.\u00a0 Nothing too memorable about it aside from the hot spring sounds that're sprinkled throughout the song to remind you that the show is set in a bathhouse.\u00a0 Similarly, the show's ED \"Happen\", sung by the seiyuus of the Yuuna, Sagiri, and Chisaki (basically the entire harem) is a seiyuu song meant to have less energy compared to its OP sister.\u00a0 I find it pretty unmemorable too, so there's not really much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHaving heard of Yuragi no Yuuna prior to the anime's release, I was rather unsure what I was going to find myself in, given how it was a series that was apparently pretty popular yet I had never really heard of it being talked about.\u00a0 Having watched the show...now I know why the series is popular to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, this was a pretty bland watch.\u00a0 The show is so devoid of any kind of actual content due to the fact that more than half of the available runtime is used for gag chapters and/or lucky pervert situations that run for WAY too long that after the halfway part, I really stopped caring about what was going on.\u00a0 Constantly shouting \"It's not his fault!\" at every accusation towards Kogarashi was just wasting my breath, and choosing to pander to the lowest common denominator really didn't do it any favors.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I would just say skip this.\u00a0 If the show spent any amount of considerable time of making the plot of helping Yunna get to heaven a reasonable part of the series, then I would at least give it that for intrigue reasons, but since it doesn't and instead chooses to show us her tits for the fifth time in the same episode, this one is worth a pass.",

            "content": "Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san is your typical ecchi harem romance that airs ocasionally in your typical anime season. Except that fails in the third component of the \"ecchi harem romance\" and especially in the supernatural segments. Go with caution as there'll be some spoilers.\r\nStory (4/10):\r\nFuyuzora Kogarashi is a spirit medium that got broke and found a mysterious dorm called the Yuragi-sou (Yuragi Inn) where it says it's haunted by the ghost of a girl named Yuuna Yunohana. There is also a bunch of strange inhabitants like the ninja Sagiri Ameno, innkeeper Chitose Nakai that can manipulate one's fortune, Nonko Aharabaki, an ultra drunk well endowed mangaka,and much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is to help Ms. Yuuna Yunohara to find her personal lingering regret with the help of our main character Fuyuzora Kogarashi (read with Sagiri Ameno's voice), except that everything happens but the actual finding of Yuuna's lingering regret.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, in an ecchi harem romance anime, I usually expect a bunch of \"accidental\" boob grabbing, nice panties shots, funny deredere reactions from the girls and the harem male lead, and some intimate moments. In the last part is where Yuragi-sou fails a lot, very few moments of romantic moments, except the punctual situations of the Yuuna-Fuyuzora Kogarashi date in a hot spring and the Sagiri love poisoned segment.\\n\\n\r\nThe two \"arcs\" that have a certain relevance with the supernatural beings are the Black Dragon God arc where Fuyuzora Kogarashi with Sagiri and Koyuzu go on a mission to rescue Yuuna; and the final arc of the season where there is a couple in torment because of an accident of the boyfriend, wihich Fuyuzora Kogarashi and Yuuna help them to leave this world in peace.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that we have very few of the \"supernatural\" parts which I think they could have made wonders for Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san, rather it's much more focused on the comedy aspect with a blend with slice-of-boob-life moments. I don't expect a High School DxD or a Zero no Tsukaima every season, but if you don't wanna consider the supernatural element of here, please make this anime more slice-of-lifey.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I suggest you to wait for the uncensored version as you'll enjoy better this ecchi harem romance anime in its full \"glory\", you should also go here with the mentality to just watch tits and ass and boob grabbings, nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):\\n\r\nNothing too much impressive for a low budget ecchi harem romance anime, all girls check my expectations for a ecchi harem romance series with all the physical attractiveness possible forms, from the very well endowed Nonko to the lolis Koyuzu and Chitose, not forgetting the middle of the roads Sagiri, Yuuna and Chisaki.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation looks quite acceptable and the backgrounds are relatively decent to not put you off in any moment.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing otherworldly, but nothing disappointing, it compliments the relative mediocrity of Yuragi-sou. The OP and ED are quite unremarkable and never entertaining to the point to not google it to hear the full version, which I generally do with at least one of the themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nYuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs has a very amicable and nice cast that surprised me why the rest of the series doesn't give more supernatural feelings, considering the nature of a 70% of the characters featured here:\\n\\n\r\nOur main character Fuyuzora Kogarashi is a very strong medium that has helped several ghost in pain to ascend to Heaven. Now wanting to enjoy a normal life, changes school struck with Yuuna, he plateaus quite a lot and starts to enjoy the life in the Yuragi Inn, which is quite understandable with the all hot bishis there.\\n\\n\r\nYuuna Yunohara is the ghost of a bound girl who was found dead in the Yuragi-sou, her poltergeist talent is quite strongs that activaces mainly because Fuyuzora Kogarashi keeps touching her unconsciously and then she throws her to the water. Yuuna never knows what happened before her dead and has amnesia.\\n\\n\r\nSagiri Ameno is a cold blooded ninja that trains consistently and in typical tsundere fashion, she occults all her feelings to Fuyuzora Kogarashi, even when love-poisoned, she manages to keep some of her cool aura around her.\\n\\n\r\nChisaki Miyazawa is classical hottest girl in high school that doesn't believe in spiritual things, but by encountering Fuyuzora Kogarashi, she starts to feel something for him and gets to know better the rest of the girls of the Yuragi-sou, even the unseen Yuuna.\\n\\n\r\nOf the rest of the cast, the most importants are the well endowed drunkie Nonko Aharabaki, the feline Yaya Fugishiro, the lolis Chitose Nakai and Koyuzu Shigaraki, and the ex servant of the Black Dragon Lord Oboro Shintou, who in classical Xenovia fashion, she wants the genes of Fuyozora Kogarashi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\r\nOf course as a man of culture who appreciates their ecchi harem romance anime will sure enjoy quite a lot of the series as they tick all the necessary ingredients to enjoy this kind of series. However, don't expect much more in here, as the supernatural part here is quite mediocre and the romance is reduced to minimal situations.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final comment, I'll be surely waiting the uncensored version to have better pleasant visuals of the hot bishis of here, and a possible new season, hoping that in there we can have much more supernatural elements to enhace this cute ecchi harem romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10. It's very improvable show, but was quite bad executed.",

            "content": "I personally don't hate ecchi and harem anime, besides there are several times i usually enjoy them a lot and quite useful to fill my boredom, and this anime is one example, it's \"not good but also not that bad\" category because there are many flaws here but still quite enjoyable and it's still worth watching for harem anime fans out there or just want to fill your free time. First of all, i am not a type of person who like to review and judge an anime when it's still airing but this time i hardly must break it because i can't hold myselfto express my opinion about this anime after these episodes they offered. \\n\r\nFirst is the story, let's be honest here, anybody who watch an ecchi-harem anime hardly thinking about a decent story right, this is the simplest premise of story this anime has: it's started with our mc (Kogarashi) moves to a cheap lodging where he meets a cute ghost (Yuuna) and promise to release her from the world by fullfill her wishes so she can rest in peace. The story premising is simple, but with 9 episodes aired already i'll be honest there is only slightly progress happen, only 1 or 2 episodes who probably focusing on it, we instead always got unlimited dose of ecchi moments where the mc always end up in bad situations either he got beaten up by other girls or being treated as a pervert entire time which is ALWAYS he never meant to do that in the first place, not mainstream enough? We also got one tsundere giri, a legal loli, a drunk onee-san, and cat girl, and oh a normal student girl (which all of them are basic formula of any harem anime). But before you got irritated, actually after some episodes later, the mc starts growing like a man and get better and most all the girls are getting tamed already by the mc who solve their each problems. The problem is the progress seems happen after episode 5 and later after that and pretty much the main story is just being a decoration here, which is understandable because \"plots\" are more important in this kind of anime. Now the characters, in my opinion most characters are boring and forgettable, until the point you can't care much about them and only care for the \"plots\", and in early episodes some of them are being so annoying, especially the tsundere ninja girl and heroine of this anime, Yuuna herself who keeps being the main factor of main character's misfortunes. The main character is so bland at first and always accept any misfortunes he got instead stand a chance to protect his pride (one of the most mainstream thing in harem), but later like i said he then start to gaining respect from them for what he did (being a cool and you'll get take down all the bit**es!). But the character design is top notch for me, all the characters are looking good even the main character which is a wise decision i think because it fits when he shows his cool moments sometimes. Another good thing they did pretty well so far is the fine animation which i don't really have problem from beginning, yes sometimes there are bland drawing but i don't have problem with it personally. The music and ost are average, the voice acting is not bad although some high pitching voices from the girls can irritate my ears sometimes, but rest of them are yeah, not that bad in my opinion. I probably going to update this review if in any case this anime could change my mind in the future either is gonna be a good one or a bad one, it depends on what they have to offer for the episodes left.",

If you are looking for some plot driven show, this is not for you.\r\nStory 7\\10\r\nOur MC is a exorcist, and he gets a room with a ghost girl called Yunna and other supernatural creatures that look human. There is an established goal made in episode one, and its for yunna to ascend peacefully, and so far the show has not forgotten it even if they digress sometimes.\r\nArt 9\\10\r\nDrawn amazingly, the anime feels smooth, looks great, key parts look better, high quality all over.\r\nSound 9\\10\r\nMusic is subjective, but the whole soundtrack isgreat, especially for a laid back anime. I listen to the op and ED(ending being amazing) along with other parts of the ost, if you don't want to watch this series, check out the music at least its the one thing I can say you won't regret.\\n\r\nCharacters 8\\10\\n\r\nFor an echii anime, you have your tsundere, milf, cat girl kudere and a 1000 year old loli standard stuff. The main girl and MC however I am giving this show praise in regards of the characters.  MC is not bland, has a personality and it would be fun to hang out with him irl unlike other generic boring MC's in anime in general, and to find one in a fanservice anime as well. I was happily surprised but I could tell from the character design and premise of the story he would not be bland. The main girl Yunna is amazing as well, just cute all over and beatiful to its core, 9\\10 for waifu standards.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\10\\n\r\nSlice of life echii comedy's are 50/50 for me since I like more serious anime plot driven animes besides for very few, but this show makes me laugh and entertains me to the point I ask myself where did 23 minutes go every time I watch the latest episode.\\n\r\nOverall 8\\10\\n\r\nThis could change, but I doubt it, For a echii to get a 9\\10 or higher and not be dxd would be considering it a masterpiece in its genre.I would recommend giving the three episode rule/",

Yunohana Yuuna a Lala/Momo ripped off, both love to sleep besides the guy both often get themselves being sexually groupe by the guy and both doesn't seems to do anything to avoid it, Miyazaki Chisaki is a Sajenjin ripped off, who seemly have the same level of personality, Fushiguro, Yaya was certainly the Celine ripped off around here, Ameno Sagiri, well there is no doubt that she was the combination of Nana and Yami all rolled into one, Arahabaki Nonko can be considered as the Ryoko Mikado of To Love Ru who serves as the quintessential MILF around here and Shintou Oboro , well she was more like modified version of Zastine, what about Chitose Nakai? well pretty much she is the Yuki Mikan around here. Now just hoe enjoyable was this anime????? Well I'd say, it kinda look like that I wanna go to Japan seek out original creator  Miura Tadahiro and Xebec's studio executives and do what Sanzo of Saiyuki does to Goku when he's pissed, so my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory-Pathetic 1: It was a knock off of \"To Love Ru\" and just like it, it was just PATHETIC to the bone.  \\n\\n\r\nArt-Very Good 8: Cu'z it all about panties, boobs, and the guy who touches them girls and just wait a bit when the uncensored version come out. \\n\\n\r\nSound-Fair 6: I like the opening song, and the rest, I have no comment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Patchetic 1: Cu'z It was just like watching another version of To Love Ru where the characters where just a ripped off from the said anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-Poor 3: Like I've said, I kinda wanna go to Japan and do some Saiyuki stuff  like when Sanzo is pisssed off at Goku to the original creator and the studio exec, due to me being pissed off with this thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-Patchetic 1: It was just like any other harem anime with ecchi stuffs, not worth anything, so anybody who thinks this should have a season 2 , should ought a________ themselves. \\n",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be ready by those that have finished watching Yuragi and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.  \r\nBased off a popular manga of the same name Yuragi Sou no Yuuna san better known as Yuuna and the hot springs inn is a supernatural romantic comedy that also includes elements of Ecchi within it that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a spirit medium that despite being born with the rare ability to see and interact with spirits encountersenough misfortune that can sink a battleship were to be introduced to a seemly cheap boarding house called Yuragi manor that\u2019s available for him to rent. What's the catch you may ask. Well the inn you see is haunted by a beautiful girl called Yuuna that coincidently lives in the room that you chose to rent. \\n\\n\r\nRomantic comedy\u2019s like Yuragi aren\u2019t anything that\u2019s rare within the industry given how easy it is to create them but inserting not just ghosts but also various types of supernatural creatures like Oni\u2019s, Cat gods, Zashiki Warashi, Tanuki\u2019s and demon slaying ninja\u2019s is something that\u2019s not just unusual but also quite wacky as well something that I felt this series was aiming for all along. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one that did a good job of introducing both the main character Koga and his profession and skills as a spirit medium and the titular character of Yuuna and made enough of an impression on me that I decided to watch the series to the very end. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place within the modern day Yuuna and the hot springs inn is largely set within the titular boarding house and the town Yukemuri town that it inhabits. The boarding house which was formerly a famous hot springs inn that was relatively famous within the local area had shown a steep decline in visitors due to the number of increasing supernatural incidents that had started to take place within the inn. The overall story of the series follows the life of Kogarashi Fuzuyora a 16-year-old teenager who as a result of being born with the rare ability to not just see and interact with spirits but be able to be possessed by them has found his life to be one that consists of nothing but misfortune. So bad in fact that despite being a high school freshman Koga still hasn\u2019t managed to secure a place to lodge yet even as his first day is edging ever closer. However, one day after banishing a particularly pesky spirit Koga hears of a boarding house that doesn\u2019t just have a free room but also one that\u2019s unbelievably cheap as well. Despite the seemingly sketchy nature of the boarding house in question Koga glad only that he had a place to stay thought none of it and decided to take up the offer. But never did Koga expect to find himself sharing his room with a beautiful teenage ghost that has amnesia but also finds himself living with a host of beautiful girls that inhabit the boarding house that are anything but human. \\n\\n\r\nBut as Koga gets over the initial shock and begins to settle into both the boarding house and into the life of a high school student Koga starts to realize that while Yuuna and the members of the boarding house may not be your average housemates each of them despite being powerful and unique individuals of their own right have their own fears, insecurities and aspirations that constrain them things that Koga himself knows and understands all too well.\\n\\n\r\nAs Koga starts to gradually bond with the house\u2019s inhabitants and help them overcome their problems Koga not just gains something that\u2019s been lacking in his life due to his unique skill set which is that of friendship but also come to realize that despite not being full humans the inhabitants of the boarding house can be just as kind, thoughtful and helpful as they are and that their unique skill sets can become unexpectedly handy when the human\u2019s come under threat from the many malevolent and wacky opponents that start to show up. Joining Koga in this comedy filled adventure are a host of characters that include the friendly but overactive Yuuna, the kind and honest Chisaki and the sharp-tongued but unexpectedly insecure Sagiri. \\n\\n\r\nKogarashi \\n\\n\r\nKogarashi voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuki Ono of Food Wars and Strike the Blood fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and a rare example of a psychic user that cannot just see and interact with spirits but also be able to banish them with his fist Kogarashi in the beginning of the series was shown to be a kind, caring and honest person that while homeless and poor in the beginning did not let this affect his outlook on life. A friendly, intelligent and joking person by nature Koga while unused to having friends at the beginning of the due to the side effects his abilities give him was shown to someone that was not just able to forge friendships easily but also someone that was noted to be very loyal to them and willing to do his utmost to help them overcome their problems no matter what problems it is. Unlike most psychic users that are able to interact with spirits Kogarashi is someone that can be said to be more open-minded than most as he prefers to judge spirits based on their actions rather than on their physical appearance and as a result prefers to first get to know the spirits as individuals and understand them rather than say banish them on sight as most other psychic users would have. This within the series is shown in how Kogarashi met and interacted with Yuuna and how he handled the demon that showed up during the seaside trip that his class went on. While someone that is seen to dislike the more militant aspects of psychic mediums Kogaraishi is shown to be someone that\u2019s not afraid of using physical force if it meant that it can help protect his friends from harm. Despite the seemingly questionable nature of his role as a psychic Kogarashi is seen to be someone that\u2019s proud of his abilities despite the great misfortune that this had subjected to his life too which is shown in his willingness to reveal his job to others and offering to use his skills to help those that are in need despite the ridicule that Kogarashi knows would result. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and more of Kogarashi\u2019s personality is revealed his personality gradually starts to change. While shown to be someone that had been blessed with the rather unusual ability of not just being a psychic user but also being one that was born with the ability to be a spirit medium it can be seen that Kogaraishi did not view this blessed ability with anything approaching joy. While happy that his ability enables him to be able to not just interact with spirits but also banish those that are shown to be of a visible danger to humans it can be seen that this ability is something of a double-edged sword to him as while useful it also had the rather unfortunate side effect of making Kogarashi\u2019s life a literal hell as his status of a spirit medium meant that Kogaraishi often ended being possessed by various spirits whose vastly differing personalities caused him to undertake many actions that had the effect of causing him to be marked by society as a weirdo and ensured that Kogarashi had few of any friends prior to his arrival at the inn. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, while making his life hell its interesting to see that this past of his also created something of a silver lining for each of the spirits that possessed him despite leaving his body left behind the many innate skills that they had attained when they were alive skills that not just varied but also proved to be extremely useful to Kogarashi within the series as he protected his friends. The number and variety of skills that Kogarashi had as a result of the spirits I felt were interesting and impressive and I felt more than made up for his past. While shown to be a friendly person and someone that made his decision after giving it much thought it can be seen that this attitude of his changes when he sees his friends lives at stake and indeed in this state it can be seen that Kogarashi actually loses his calm and laid back attitude and instead adopt one that\u2019s not just determined but also willing to fight hard to save and protect them even if it meant that do some questionable things like storm a palace almost single handily which is best shown in his rescue of Yuuna from the dragon gods palace. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Kogarashi I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with his evolution from a quiet, friendly and laid-back person to one that was determined to make actual friends and protect them from harm with his unique abilities being especially well done. Given the hell that his abilities caused him I'm actually quite surprised that Koga not only resisted the urge to resent his powers but instead realize how useful it can be if it was used to calm and befriend spirits which is another thing that I admired about Kogarashi\u2019s character. I felt that his voice actor Yuuki Ono did an excellent job of portraying the character of Kogarashi. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYuuna \\n\\n\r\nYuuna voiced by new seiyuu Miyuri Shimabukuro is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Koga\u2019s friends within the series. A ghost girl that Koga encounters early in the series after unknowingly renting the room that served as her home within the boarding house and thus making Yuuna his roommate. A curious, nervous but polite ghost Yuuna despite being a ghost is someone that comes off as something that\u2019s different to what most people imagine ghosts to be as Yuuna far from being malevolent is actually someone that\u2019s innocent, friendly and kind. As a result of both the fact that she\u2019s a ghost and the fact that the boarding house that she calls her home has seen a massive decline in tenants Yuuna in the beginning of the series can be seen to be someone that was relatively lonely as she lacked any real opportunities to make any new friends. As a result of this upon meeting Koga Yuuna was seen to have become overjoyed at the thought that she will be able to forge a new friendship with someone new and as a result was able to forge an immediate friendship with Koga. This immediate bond of friendship that Yuuna forges with Koga was aided greatly by the fact that Koga was different to the other tenants of the inn in that while he was human he also had the unique ability to not only see and interact with spirits but also by the fact that he treats them with respect rather than simply banish them like many of their kind would. This curiosity to Koga and the fact that he defended her from an attack served to form a strong bond between the two that only grew stronger as the series went on. While a friendly and curious ghost that was seemingly carefree it can be seen that Yuuna was someone that was quite perceptive and was shown to be conscious of Koga\u2019s attempts to help her attain her wish something that was both heartening to her and at the same time scary to her due to her inner conflicts that only increased as the series went on. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being a ghost, it can be seen that Yuuna still has a surprisingly number of things that and places that she wants to be able to do and see with some of them being quite normal like being able to go to school and going on a school trip with others and others being rather unique like having a sleepover and trading secrets with her fellow girls. This I felt was interesting as fulfilling these wishes for her actually allowed Koga and the others the opportunity to give Yuuna the school life that she wasn\u2019t able to have due to her early demise. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Yuuna gets to not just encounter and befriend Koga but also meet many other people her personality gradually starts to change. At the beginning of the series while initially wary of Koga due to his abilities as a psychic this feeling of distrust gradually vanished due to the kindness that was shown to her by him and she became very loyal to Koga acting as both a constant companion to him and a valued friend. This bond with both Koga and the many tenants within the boarding house only served to deepen as the series went on and indeed by the latter points of the series the bonds that Yuuna had managed to forge with Koga and the tenants while allowing her to forge many new friendships also served to make her realize just how important such bonds were and causing her to become much more protective of her friends to the point that she will be willing to use herself as a means to protect them. \\n\\n\r\nWhile content to simply observe and accompany Koga in his daily activities in the beginning of the series this attitude of Yuuna gradually starts to change as she gets to bear witness to the efforts that Koga puts in to protect those dear to him from harm which had the effect of causing her to realize that unlike him she was clumsy, na\u00efve and would do more harm than good if she tried to help. However rather than let these negative feelings affect her it can be said that this actually had the opposite effect as this prompted her to not just analyze her own strengths and weaknesses but also try to improve her skills and knowledge as she tries to be of better use to Koga. This I felt was interesting as it showed not just her determination to improve herself but also of her determination to be of better use to Koga someone that she grows increasingly fond off as the series goes on. \\n\\n\r\nChisaki \\n\\n\r\nChisaki Miyazaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Eri Suzuki of Amanchu and Toji no Miko fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Koga\u2019s classmates and friends within the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and the class idol within Koga\u2019s class Chisaki from initial impressions were seen to be someone that was kind, honest and understanding of others and while appreciative of the fame and praise that comes from her classmates Chisaki doesn\u2019t let this affect her core personality. Indeed, despite the fame Chisaki rather than being arrogant and prideful as some girls in her position will be is instead someone that\u2019s friendly, honest, considerate and caring to all she meets and ensuring that she has no shortage of friends within the school. While an open minded and kind person by nature Chisaki is also shown to be someone that\u2019s wary of outsiders and is someone that trusts slowly due to the number of people that would like to be her friend and as a result was shown to be quite wary of Koga at the beginning of the series. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, Chisaki at the beginning like her fellow classmates while curious about Koga\u2019s declaration that he was a psychic and had the ability to interact with spirits thought that it was just another attempt to make himself look more interesting to others. However, this later changed after Chisaki found herself the target of a malicious spirit that forced her to enlist the help of Koga despite the fact that she was still skeptical of his abilities. While the experience of seeing a spirit be not just revealed but convinced to stop their activities was an educational experience for Chisaki the unintended actions of Koga\u2019s tag along spirit Yuuna caused Chisaki to have a rather bad first impression of Koga and saw him as a violent pervert much to Koga\u2019s dismay. However, after seeing the way Koga resolved the situation with the spirit this attitude of her\u2019s gradually starts to change. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Chisaki begins to realize that Koga\u2019s abilities weren\u2019t just real but also that unknown to her and the general population creatures other than humans were coexisting with them. While understandably unnerved at this thought it can be seen that rather be frightened of this new revelation Chisaki due to her strong curiosity instead become more interested in this new world that was seemingly hidden from view as well as the various events that happen inside Koga\u2019s world. While developing an intense interest into both the world and into Koga as the series goes on this also extends to Yuuna as well. Unlike most people her age Chisaki while scared of Yuuna at first due to the fact that she was a ghost gradually got over this fear as she interacted with her and realized that far from being a malevolent spirit Yuuna was someone that was very similar to her both in terms of age and life experiences and as a result become fast friends. \\n\\n\r\nThis aspect of their bonding with each other within the series I felt was interesting as it proved to be an educational experience for both of them as they both sought to learn about each other and it was quite funny seeing the two converse with each other via messages. The character of Chisaki I felt was an interesting one and one that was developed quite well as the series went on. Her development from someone that while kind and caring was dismissive of things that she couldn\u2019t see to one where she was more open-minded and more willing to believe in not just the abilities of others but also of the fact that in this world beings that she hasn\u2019t seen before can indeed exist I felt was done well. I felt that her seiyuu Eri Suzuki did an excellent job of portraying the character of Chisaki. \\n\\n\r\nSagiri \\n\\n\r\nSagiri Ameno voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Comic Girls fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Koga\u2019s friends within the series. A teenage girl and a Kunoichi of the Chuuma ninja army Sagiri at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was cold, direct and sharp-tongued and while a beautiful girl was widely seen as unapproachable by many within the school that she goes due to both her intimidating presence and also because of the fact that she sees all men as enemies due to her upbringing within a single gender school. As a result of this at the beginning of the series it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising to see that Sagiri had a very antagonistic relationship with Koga as she believed that like all men Koga was nothing more than a beast that took advantage of vulnerable woman and as a result was not just protective of her fellow tenants but also showed a intense desire to fillet Koga with her kunai if she sees him do actions that she sees as suspicious which thanks to Yuuna is commonplace within the series. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, while someone that trusts others slowly and reacts brashly it can be seen that Sagiri is someone that has a firm sense of honor and is someone that both places a lot of trust in promises and someone that adheres to them no matter what kind of promises it was. In line with  Sagiri\u2019s firm sense of honor is something that can be seen to be the core of her motivation as both a person and a woman which is her firm sense of justice and her loyalty to the role as a Kunoichi that maintains the peace between the human and spirit realms a role that Sagiri is seen to be very loyal to. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Sagiri gets to not just encounter new situations but also meet many people that she never thought she will become friends with Sagiri\u2019s personality gradually starts to change. From the onset of the series, it can be seen that Sagiri while very loyal to her role as a kunoichi of the Chuuma school was someone that actually placed an emphasis on the former and as such placed a higher emphasis on her role as a ninja than that of a woman. This, when combined with the fact that Sagiri was educated in a single gender school, meant that she was both unused to how to converse with boys her age and unaware of the effect that her figure and beauty had on them which had the unfortunate effect of making her dislike boys due to her series of misunderstandings. However, as the series goes on and Sagiri gets to not just partner up with her self-proclaimed enemy Koga but also understand the effects that she has on people this attitude of her\u2019s gradually starts to change. In addition to her attitude towards boys becoming much softer and friendlier this change also had the unusual effect of awakening within Sagiri an inner fear of sorts where Sagiri develops a fear of the fact that she does not look feminine enough despite the fact that she\u2019s seen as one of the most beautiful girls within the school. This act of insecurity only served to expand as a result of seeing the kind of figures that her friend Chisaki and her housemate Nonko had and awakened within Sagiri a strong desire to try and change herself physically by adopting a new change in wardrobe. \\n\\n\r\nThis inner struggle of Sagiri\u2019s I felt was interesting as it while it did a great job of contrasting between her default direct and brash personality it also showed an obvious character development of her that came about as a result of not bonding with Koga but also realizing that so far in life she has been keeping an unnecessary distance between people of other genders. While shown to be very loyal to her duties and her ninja school in the beginning as the series goes on and as Sagiri gradually starts to realize just how valuable friendship can be to her this loyalty is supplemented by her loyalty to her friends and indeed it can be seen that at this point Sagiri is willing to act against the interests of her duties if it meant that she can save her friends from a nasty situation a decision that the Sagiri of the past would have scoffed at which is best shown in the attempted rescue mission that she enacted to save Yuuna from the dragon god. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Sagiri I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her development from a cold, blunt and sharp-tongued girl that treated all men with suspicion to one that was not just friendlier but also more understanding of others feelings being especially well done. I felt that Sagiri\u2019s development of the inner insecurity within her and her quest to become more feminine was used really well within the series to show not just her gradual realization of how attractive her figure was to others but also to indicate her growing feelings towards Koga. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Sagiri. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series were pretty well done with the characters designs doing a good job of reflecting the type of species that their true self was and the types of traits that they possessed. A good example of this within the series was Yaya\u2019s default behavior and Nakai\u2019s guise as an inn master that had dual personalities that differed from each other. Settings wise I thought the series made great use of a variety of terrain that did a great job of showing the kind of locations that can exist within the world. Of this, I felt that the dragon palace which was the home of the dragon god Genshiro was perhaps my favorite. While combat within the series wasn\u2019t especially common given Koga\u2019s determination to use diplomacy first and violence second I thought that the few fights that were within the series were well done with Koga and Sagiri\u2019s fight with the stripping monster and the brief fight between Koga and Genshiro being notable ones. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, I felt that the series OST did a great job of providing an effective soundtrack to the many wacky moments within the series. The series opening and ending themes which were Momoiro Typhoon that was sung by veteran singer Luna Haruna and Happen Kogarashi Ni Fukarete which was sung by Miyuri Shimabukuro, Eri Suzuki and Rie Takahashi in the guise of their characters I felt were both fun and catchy songs. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main characters or supporting ones. In particular, I felt that Yuuki Ono, Miyuri Shimabukuro, Eri Suzuki, and Rie Takahashi all did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Kogarashi, Yuuna, Chisaki and Sagiri respectively. In addition, while I didn\u2019t cover them within this review, I felt that Yui Ogura, Ai Kakuma, Sayaka Harada , Mikako Komatsu and Yoshimasa Hosoya all did an excellent job at portraying the supporting cast of Yaya, Nonko, Nakai, Oboro and Genshiro respectively. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Yuragi Sou no Yuuna san was an anime that I really enjoyed with its main strong points being its interesting premise, story, interesting characters, strong voice acting and its inclusion of fantasy creatures and supernatural elements into a typical school harem story. While the inclusion of supernatural elements like Yuuna and fantasy creatures like Oni\u2019s, cat god vessels and Zashiki Warashi within the series was a welcome change from what we usually see within harem animes I felt these weren\u2019t really used that well within the series due to their lack of character development which I felt was a shame. This was in contrast to the development that was given to the human characters of Sagiri and Chisaki who within the series I felt was developed pretty well with Sagiri, in particular, changing the most compared to how she was at the start of the series. The overall story of the series while funny wacky and featuring plenty of good examples of clothes shredding scenes I felt was too predictable and genetic and added little to make it stand out when compared to others within the genre. However, despite this, the story was not without its funny moments and these served to provide a great deal of entertainment to me as I watched the story unfold. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I felt that if Yuragi was given much better character development and some more unique scenarios that made use of the fantasy creatures then perhaps it might be more entertaining but as it is if you want an anime that\u2019s funny, simple and ones that features plenty of clothes shredding moments then you should give Yuragi a try. As a final score, I would say Yuragi deserves a final score of 7/10.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Gone are the days we sit back and just appreciate the show.\r\nThe people who say the MC is generic, the art is nothing special, the ecchi is a bit cliche, and the story (if there even is one) is drab- I can't say they're completely wrong.\r\nHowever, no matter how overplayed a trope is or how \"unoriginal\" an anime can be, I like to think each title has a bit of its own special magic, and that's what contributes to our enjoyment. This show has that magic.\r\nThe overall package just works together tomake it really enjoyable. I can sit back and no matter how \"terrible/cringe\" this show gets, I can enjoy it. The art style is delightful, the OP/ED gives it a memorable signature, and the harem is kawaii.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you want a more objectified look at why I like this anime: the humor is funny, the girls are likable, well-designed, and well-written, and the story is simple yet not all too predictable. I can't dislike a show that has me chuckling and swooning.\\n\\n\r\nTo end on a more neutral note, if you like comedy and ecchi, I can't see this anime faulting you. The supernatural theme is a nice touch and works. You can tell that even though they may have a smaller animation budget, love was put into character details and expressions. Give it a shot and you may just enjoy the kawaii within.",

            "content": "I'll be the first to admit that ecchi harems aren't really my thing. But given this is a Shonen Jump anime, I had to check it out no matter what. Well now that we're at the end of the road with this show I gotta say I'm really glad I gave it a shot. Cause this one is a lot of fun. Made me laugh and smile tons of times. \r\nThe cast makes this whole thing for me. This group of characters was a ton of fun. Kogarashi is a great lead, he's no pushover really and is a good guy at heart. He caresand that matters a lot to me in a lead. Yuuna of course was my favorite of the girls, she's so sweet and precious it makes me want to hug and hug her and love her. She warmed my heart lots of times. Chisaki, Sagiri, and Yaya were other favorites. All the girls were great and all the side characters were a ton of fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing may not be anything spectacular or new, but as I said I think this cast makes the show shine. The mostly episodic nature of the show was pretty fitting for that. I know the manga is the same way too. I think that style lends itself to letting the characters run things so to speak. The main overall plot isn't important right now. It's getting these characters comfortable with each other and with their surroundings. It was handled pretty well to me. I liked just about all the side adventures they went on. \\n\\n\r\nOnly thing really negative I have to say about this show is maybe the animation isn't too good at times but really that's not too big a deal for me. Always preferred a great story over great animation. And maybe some of the gags didn't work all the time. But they were never awful or anything. Overall I really liked this show. I'd watch 8 or 10 seasons of this stuff. Speaking of.....\\n\\n\r\n8/10.",

But other than that, the storyline is pretty much as a laid-back show to enjoy unnecessary (censored) ecchi moments (which plays a big part in this anime). The amount of laughter was optimal, and the girls were aesthetically beautiful!!!   \r\nBut other than that, I still believe the manga is a lot better and represents a big spoiler party for the majority of this season. But yet I rated highly as I think it is worth mytime watching this enjoyable adaptation.  \\n\\n\r\nBut to make this show better, in my opinion, they should have a second season to introduce more characters (some characters. introduction felt rushed), and yes, the storyline gets more interesting deeper into the manga.  \\n\\n\r\nBut other than that, hope you all find this helpful and may convince you to check it out.",

So don't take this to heart! \r\nLet's begin...  \r\nLiterally one of those \"if you want a show to watch while your brain is offand you just want to watch something\"\r\nThis show has nothing you can call a plot, no character interest/investment all the show tries to do is force an excuse for a \"plot\", whichi am not even going to start on... through the use and abuse of ONE aspect. Taking ANY excuse to force the MC into a position where he is the pervert the criminal or did something wrong and therefore must be punished with extreme prejudice (quite literally) for simply being the male in the group who can't even stand for f****** common sense. \\n\r\n(in spite ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of said moments the MC literally having no fault on his own). \\n\\n\r\nSo this means that when shit happens, (and shit will happen because the show HAS to rise it self up from oblivion somehow) let's beat the mc up to a pulp because he's a sexist and who's too stupid to realize he should basically grovel and kiss the ground the women of the show walk on\\n\r\n *sigh...*\\n\\n\r\nMy problem with this show is not that the author tried to  rip of Akamatsu's or even Takahashi's \"modus operandi\" but the fact it was so badly exploited and abused to the point where I lost total interest for this show because of all the cringe said excess caused for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe best and only quality this show has to offer and I'll be honest here, is the animation more specifically the char design and even half of that is all in the fan service which is there to make everyone forget the show has no purpose. \\n\\n\r\nI am not saying not to watch this show... \\n\r\nWhat I am saying and to sum it up is that this is basically a show for those who would think about boning a ghost girl with the IQ of a kindergarten and an \"Oni\" with a very selective alcohol tolerance levels depending on \"the plot\". I only mentioned those 2 but the show has the whole nine yards of the fetish tropes and stereotypes...",

            "content": "Yuragi-Sou No Yuna-san is your typical, eechi harem anime that airs every season, so I\u2019ll keep this as brief as possible. \r\nPlot: 4\r\nThe story is about Kogarashi, a spirit/psychic medium who\u2019s living in the Haunted Inn with Yuna and other girls, and his goal is to figure out what lingering regret she is to have her ascend to the afterlife. Unfortunately, the show barely addresses this and as a result there\u2019s no real plot. It\u2019s a slice of life comedy based on the interactions between the Inn members and the eechi fanservice situations Kogarashi finds himself in.\r\nThe comedy is terrible. I\u2019m tired of all therepetitive bed scenes where Yuuna is naked, Kogarashi ends up fumbling her, Yuuna starts blushing, misunderstands the situation and uses her polygermism to send him flying out the window. Like it wasn\u2019t funny the first time and it pissed me off how how many times it was repeated each episode. It\u2019s as if the writers lacks any variety besides cringey eechi scenes with girls misunderstanding the situation Kogarashi is placed in- because none of them have enough common sense to let him explain what happened. This brings me to my next point, there\u2019s way too much fanservice \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the better parts of the show. The girls are distinct, likeable and memorable. However, they are cliche stereotypes that don\u2019t have much character development throughout the season e.g. Sagari is your typical tsundere, Nonko is a alcoholic boob naked girl, Oboro is a bootleg Xenovia (from Highschool DxD) that wants Kogarashi\u2019s babies. Kogarashi is your self-insert, bland MC with a shitty psychic power of punching hard. I swear, it annoys me when writer pulls the convenient deus ex machina ghost possession excuse for everything situation Kogarashi is in or to explain why he\u2019s so good at something. It makes the story predictable because it happens so often\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it annoys me when the MC\u2019s power is simple/basic compared to the supporting cast (coughs MHA) instead of something weak, but having them be creative with it. Best girl is Chisaki by a mile because she\u2019s the only who feels more \u201creal\u201d and well rounded than the rest of the girls. \\n\\n\r\nSounds: 7\\n\r\nI like the opening song. It\u2019s fun, upbeat, catchy and lighthearted like the show. The osts didn\u2019t really stand out to me. However, I enjoyed the narrators voice for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid, like a 6-7/10 to me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4-5\\n\r\nDespite the criticisms I have with this show, I like Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs Inn. It\u2019s a fun show, but not enough to overlook it's apparent flaws.",

Compliment it with some pretty artwork and some humor and its turns out into a solid show.\r\nHowever, I feel like there were many missed opportunities within this anime. The pacing was really slow and none of the characters really showed any progress. Also the anime has way to many girls, many of them sharing similar personalities to one another. We see a glimpse of what the anime could be in the last episode withthe ghost lovers and parts of the black dragon arc.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna rate it badly cause its poorly developed plot and characters as its a harem anime. Still, I find myself wanting a bit more and wish they would've developed the characters more and how spirits become evil and corrupted over time. I have hopes for a next season to really fix these issues.\\n",
