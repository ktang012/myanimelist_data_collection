            "content": "Overview:\r\nNearly every review of JoJo 2012 praises it as a MASTERPIECE, because it represents a triumphant return for the macho manly anime of the past. I have a slightly different perspective than most critics on MAL, so unsurprisingly my conclusion was a little different as well. If I was born between 1995 and 2000 and grew up during the \"sparkling kawaii desu moe\" era of anime where every male protagonist is a whiny pussy, I too would be inclined to give Jojo a 10/10 out of sheer novelty alone. However, I was born in the 1980s and I actually remember the GAR days of manlyanime. In the 1990s, you watched anime largely by going to the video store and renting whatever anime was available. Almost ALL of it was cheaply licensed, ultraviolent OVAs from the late 80s and early 90s. Were those anime better? Well believe it or not...no, not really. There were indeed some awesome anime like Fist of the North Star (Hokuto no Ken), but for every Fist of the North Star there was absolute garbage like: Genocyber, Violence Jack, MD Geist, Mad Bull 34, Angel Cop, etc. Simply being macho didn't make an anime good by default back in the 1990s, and that shouldn't be any different today! I am going to look at Jojo from a fair and objective view rather then simply heap praise on it based on principle alone.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS!)\\n\\n\r\nThe 2012 JoJo anime adapts the first 2 arcs of the manga, so this is the JoJo series you should watch first sequentially! JoJo is about the Joestar family and their epic feats of badassery over the generations. The first generation of Joestar asskicking takes place in Victorian England with Jonathan Joestar, whom I will call Johnny JoJo. The dumbass father of Johnny JoJo decides to adopt the blatantly evil son of a man who \"saved his life\" when he had a carriage accident. Even though it is later revealed that papa Joestar knew that Brando was a dishonest man and wasn't actually trying to save him, he adopts Dio anyway and continuously believes Dio over his own son despite the fact that Dio may as well have \"evil\" tattooed on his forehead. Dio is a 1 dimensional bully who exists to make Johnny JoJo miserable, steal his father's affection, and ultimately try steal his inheritance. Dio will perform some act of over the top evil like brutally murder Johnny's dog, and papa Joestar will instantly believe Dio's side of the story, simply to frustrate the viewers. This is like that Spongebob episode where Spongebob adopts an evil lamprey as a pet and keeps blaming the obviously innocent Gary the snail whenever anything goes wrong. The difference is that JoJo isn't a comedy cartoon for small children. It is a Shonen demographic anime that actually expects us to take this seriously! Johnny JoJo discovers that Dio is attempting to poison his father and inherit the fortune, so he goes to find the poison shop where Dio has been purchasing his product. Johnny JoJo proves Dio is guilty, but Dio uses a mystical artifact Johnny has been studying to transform himself into a vampire and start wrecking shit. Dio kills papa Joestar and seemingly gets killed in turn by Johnny, but it turns out Dio survived and wants to create a vampire army to take over the world. Johnny takes some mystical martial arts training to unleash sunlight with punches (just go with it) and goes on a crusade to take out Dio. Unfortunately, that son of a bitch simply won't stay down and eventually Johnny must sacrifice his own life in manly fashion to save his wife and unborn child.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to come right out and say it, Dio is a SHIT excuse for a villain. There are many things that can make a great villain: complex motivations, based on a historical figure, or even being extremely evil in an interesting fashion that is fun and frightening to watch. Dio is a cliche bully archetype that gets turned into a vampire, then decides to take over the world because he wasn't already cliche enough. In a way, Dio does remind me of the villains from oldschool GAR anime like: the bullies in Genocyber that randomly decide to rape a homeless child, or the bully in Devilman who decides to butcher the class bunnies for no reason. However, those bullies were quickly and brutally dispatched because that kind of character isn't very interesting. They exist to piss off the audience and grant a cathartic revenge fantasy when they get killed. Dio just lingers on and on like a sulfurous fart that won't go away. Johnny JoJo is a gentlemen and a badass, but his character depth never goes beyond that. He doesn't have a strong internal struggle or ambiguous goals or anything that makes complex character. I know that isn't the point of JoJo, but a show aimed at older audiences should probably try to have SOME level of complexity unless the action is so awesome it doesn't matter. However, JoJo isn't a non-step action violence fest like Hellsing Ultimate. JoJo actually does take a LOT of time to focus on plot and characters, which is why it is disappointing that the plot isn't very good and the characters are paper thin archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a decent but certainly not masterful arc 1, we get to see the adventures of Johnny JoJo's grandson: Joey JoJo. Joey JoJo must go to Mexico to fight against the evil vampires that created the mystical mask from part 1. He teams up with the grandson of one his grandfather's old allies along with a surprisingly friendly Nazi dude named Rudol Von Stroheim. I guess the writer of JoJo meant to use the name \"Rudolph\" because \"Rudol\" isn't even a real German name. Rudol's catchphrase is German (insert whatever) is the best! Characters with goofy catchphrases can work like Korbowitz in Berserk or Armstrong in FMA, but I wasn't really feeling this one. Honestly I just found myself wishing this guy would be replaced with Captain Germany the manly werewolf from Hellsing. This second arc does have some pretty awesome action scenes including Joey JoJo punching the vampire leader into Outer fucking SPACE! However, the plot and characters still come WAY short of being called a masterpiece or anything approaching a masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is heavily stylized and admittedly does a good job creating the look and feel of anime from yesteryear. There are lots of still-shots to recreate the look of cheap animation from the days where anime had extremely limited budgets. There are plenty of \"action lines\" that the old anime had in abundance especially pre-1990. I think my favorite part of JoJo might actually be the art because it really does recapture and recreate what anime used to look like and now no longer even resembles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381Di8Cw0-I  A speech from the director of JoJo from  0:43 - 1:11\\n\\n\r\nDoes JoJo do a decent job capturing what old school anime used to look and feel like? Yeah, and that is why it isn't a bad show. Does being retro make it a masterpiece by default? Absolutely not. The story may not suffer from pointless \"tournament arcs\" like so many shonen anime, but the plot isn't honestly very good. Like the characters, the plot is very simplistic and doesn't exactly carry JoJo into the realms of truly great anime. The male characters are actually manly and don't resemble either Keitaro Urashima from Love Hina or Shinji Ikari from NGE, the 2 characters that basically convinced anime executives that Otaku identify more with Beta males and completely neutered anime. However, JoJo's mediocre action and old school animation doesn't quite make up for its simplistic and overall  lackluster story and characters. At the end of the day, JoJo 2012 is a good anime, but is JUST a good anime. It doesn't nearly deserve the ratings it has received on MAL, or the praise it receives on 4chan. I WOULD recommend it to younger viewers who want to see what old anime was like, but I caution against the kind of blind praise that has already made this anime absurdly overrated.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my favorite series ever, and it finally got a real weekly anime adaptation after 25 years\u2014the \u201894 and \u201800 OVAs and the Phantom Blood movie, which never saw DVD/home video release do not count\u2014there is definitely some bias in this review. That said, there\u2019s a reason I still didn\u2019t give it a perfect score, and it\u2019s because I\u2019m still trying to keep a hint of objectivity in here.\r\nArt - 8/10\r\nI suppose I\u2019ll start off with how it adapted the source material. Unlike the OVAs and Phantom Blood movie, there were no cuts in content, and it actually adapted parts 1 and 2 ofthe manga: Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. The studio, David Production, did what I would consider a masterful job in terms of bringing out Araki Hirohiko\u2019s style into the manga. He is an artist, and you can see his art evolve throughout the long-running JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure franchise. DP hired multiple art directors and tried to incorporate the different faces and builds in body throughout the series. Also, because there is no such thing as \u201ccanon\u201d colors for characters, DP, in an unexpected but very innovative manner, used their poor budget to their advantage\u2014by changing color schemes and using colorful abstract backgrounds during monologues and still-frames. I\u2019ll give the art by itself a 10/10, even though sometimes Jonathan and Joseph, the titular JoJos in this series, suffer from Gorilla Face Syndrome, since the BD/DVDs are doing a great job of fixing it.\\n\\n\r\nOn still-frames, this is one of TWO flaws I found throughout the whole series. DP was contracted by Warner Bros. and they were given a pretty weak budget to work with. As a result, some might say that there are lots of times where this show is more of a \u201clive-manga\u201d or stream of the manga. The \u201canimated\u201d SFX from the source material, plentiful still-frames, and lack of actual animation at times are what add to this idea. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, it\u2019s not like every episode is a slideshow; however, there are DEFINITELY times when it feels that way\u2014I\u2019m looking at you, episode 16. Honestly, I feel like DP made it up to us with some episodes that were battle-heavy, like episode 20 and most definitely the final 3 or so episodes. Especially the last one. For this I will have to give the animation itself a 7/10. The distinct art style and use of colors  boost it up to an 8 for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSo-no Chi no Sa-da-me, JOOOOOOOOO~JO! There are two opening themes, JOJO~Sono Chi no Sadame~ by Hiroaki \u201cTOMMY\u201d Tominaga , and BLOODY STREAM by Coda. Both were tailored for their respective Part in JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, in both lyrics, atmosphere, and animation itself\u2014we actually get some pretty good CG depicting events in Parts 1 and 2. They were extremely catchy, and I never skipped them. The ending theme was Roundabout by progressive rock band YES, which actually came out in the 70s\u2014and influenced the original manga! and I applaud DP for that choice. The song\u2019s lyrics fit extremely well and it is actually one of Araki Hirohiko\u2019s favorite bands! Also, because it is an 8 minute song, they used different snippets, some soft, some more intense, depending on what kind of note the episode ended on. That was genius and definitely made the watching experience better. If it were up to the OP and ED alone I'd give the sound a 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual soundtrack, because of the difference in atmosphere between Parts 1 and 2, or at least I assume it\u2019s for that reason, DP hired two composers and gave us two soundtracks per part. Phantom Blood was mostly orchestral, very fitting with the late Victorian feel we get when we think of England in the 1880s. It fit extremely well and I applaud Matsuo Hayato for his beautiful soundtrack. Part 2, being much more dynamic and quite literally \u201call over the place\u201d, has Iwasaki Taku, who worked with his friends Lotus Juice. The soundtrack he made has soft, orchestral pieces and, well, everything. He has rap/hip-hop, rock, metal, DUBSTEP, and even flutes and drums that bring a middle-eastern feel. Personally, I thought the dubstep was actually very good and tamer than most, and that it fit well the middle-eastern sounds he composed for with the Pillar Men, the main antagonists of Part 2. The sound direction, however, was not as amazing. Iwasaki Taku complained himself, over Twitter, that his songs were not being used correctly, and, after paying close attention to episodes 22 and 23, I can\u2019t say I disagree. David Productions flubbed it when it came to transitioning the music and providing an appropriate atmosphere with the songs in those two episodes. For that reason, although the music itself was superb, I will have to give it an 8 total.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nStory is pretty simple, to say the least. The original story came out in 1987, in Shueisha\u2019s Weekly Shonen Jump. Phantom Blood can be pretty much summed up as Castlevania with Hokuto no Ken elements, which shouldn\u2019t be seen as bad in any way. Araki Hirohiko wanted to make a solid base so that he could evolve his work throughout time, and I think he did a pretty good job, taking in the work of contemporaries around him. The first part is hot-blooded, fast-paced, and the definition of \u201ccamp\u201d. Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando are probably the most one-dimensional characters you will ever find, but it is because they were so static, they polarized each other and made the fight between them so interesting. Dio Part 1's main antagonist, from the first episode, is depicted to us as the very definition of EVIL at the age of 12! Although the story is simple, the characters are definitely what make the sure. In Battle Tendency, the story takes a more adventurous route and we see our new JoJo, Joseph Joestar, go from New York, to Mexico, to Italy, to Sweden, and it\u2019s amazing. The main antagonists of this part are a powerful trio of \u201cPillar Men\u201d called Wham, ACDC, and Cars, responsible for the creation of the stone mask that set the events in Part 1. The continuity is great and you definitely feel time passing as you watch the series, characters like Speedwagon and Erina are shown old, and with every major timeskip you see differences in character design. Story, when it boils down to it, just has to be interesting. I was definitely interested in the stories for Parts 1 and 2 of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. They were simple, straight, and to the point, which made it possible to expand more on the character dynamics, arguably the strongest part of this series. There were no long and obnoxious training arcs, the fights are NOT dragged out\u2014probably the most common flaw in shonen battle series\u2014and if there are cliches, they are exaggerated to their extremes. This series does not take itself that seriously, and when it does, you can bet that you\u2019ll be on the edge of your seat. Story gets a 9/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters. Araki sure knows how to get you attached to characters. And then rip them away from you. There are definitely deaths in this series and they are dramatic and will definitely tug at your heart. Also, the voice actors are passionate and work admirably together. Takehito Koyasu, with his smooth, deep voice will send chills down your spine whenever Dio is formulating a plot or mocking JoJo. Okitsu Kazuyuki may be a newbie, unlike the slew of veterans in the rest of the cast, but he makes Jonathan Joestar so damn LIKABLE with his passionate screams, calm reassurance, and definitely makes the heart of gold in this character shine brightly. Sugita Tomokazu, probably best known for his characteristic shonen gag voice as Gintoki (Gintama) and serious/apathetic voice as Kyon (Haruhi Suzumiya series), makes a perfect Joseph Joestar, because Joseph embodies the ideal shonen protagonist\u2014smart, strong, funny, and extremely expressive. Basically, where the animation fell short, I believe that the voice actors definitely picked up the slack. Everyone has fun, because this is supposed to be a fun series. I love it. Characters get 5/5 from me. Both as they were written and how they were acted, you can definitely feel the chemistry between all the voices and that made it way more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. I keep on mentioning this when I score each aspect of the show for this review. Ultimately, when you watch an anime, or any show, movie, etc; you do so because you want to enjoy and be entertained. I can almost guarantee that if you go and watch this show with a blank slate and just a pure, unadulterated desire to be entertained, you will not come out disappointed. Just keep in mind that JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure is a series that is 25 years in the making, and this is but the beginning. It is without a doubt my favorite manga series, and this long-awaited anime adaption gives it the justice that it deserves. If you watch it, and enjoy it, like I said you probably will, then I implore to take up the manga. You can skip right to Part 3, the most popular arc in the franchise, but I recommend reading from the beginning, you\u2019ll pick out some tiny things left out that couldn\u2019t be conveyed through the anime, and you\u2019ll see the evolution of Araki Hirohiko\u2019s art throughout the ages.\\n\\n\r\nBut first, if you watch the anime, I recommend Muda Muda Muda Subs  [MMM] subs or CommieSubs [Commie]. They are the most accurate subs and if you prefer a better script, go with MMM, if you want better typesetting and subtitled SFX, go with Commie. Personally, I used MMM because they are a group that got together solely for this series, released in a timely schedule with accurate subs, took advice/criticism well, and also have better encoding. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that after this review some of you watch this show and develop the same love I have for it!",

            "content": "The keyword \"Bizarre\" in it's title is more then appropriate.\r\nAnd considering the many details the show has it's difficult to find a point to start talking about it to explain everything, but I'm going to give an attempt.\r\nThe First thing to address is probably the story and the storytelling of JoJo.\r\nwhere it basically does everything wrong in such a way that it becomes hysterical to watch and not to mention the big layer of 80's cheese that covers it all.\r\nJoJo tells it's story through the worst way possible \"exposition\". and not just a little bit. The characters will explain literally EVERYTHING that is happening infront of you, and it's not just done in your typical anime fashion. No, Every Character will explain things as if they are pooping out the biggest turd of their life that was been clogging their bowels for weeks. making it hysterical to hear them do so. Jojo's story itself is very simplistic in each arc. protagonist faces an evil that is bent on world domination. and that's about it. however This is the first series I've ever seen that has multiple shifting protagonists. without spoiling to much, I can say that each story arc headlines the offspring of the previous protagonist. which keeps the show very fresh, because of the shift in characters.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on the the art and animation. \\n\r\nOne of the things I absolutely loathe is talking during battle scene's.\\n\r\n(Looking at you Bleach!)\\n\r\nbecause it kills the pacing and tension of the combat. As I explained above Jojo likes to explain A LOT but they manage to keep the pace up despite lengthy dialogues and maintain intense visuals to keep you on your toes during the fights. The visuals are very clean, sharp, and use some very unique color pallets to address dire situations. suddenly placing characters in a complete green pallet against a dark/pink background.\\n\r\nThe animation to be fair is very limited and makes use of clever tricks to make a \"less is more\" kind of effect. flashy backgrounds, shaky cam, etc. which works very well for shows like this to maintain the high detail of characters, yet it makes the fights less dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music is phenomenal, very catchy and colorful, which matches the overall feel for the show. and a lot of different styles come to play, jazz, rock, even dub step. And choosing Roundabout by Yes as a title track!? is to me a strange choice but it works.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair the Characters in the show come across rather weak.\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, because of the shifting protagonists we're also time skipping every arc. which only allows 1 or 2 characters from the previous arc to reappear. this makes it very hard to latch on to a character because the time spent with them is so limited. and the expositional nature of the series also pushes you away from a character. we are not allowed to get under their skin and get a chance to feel like they feel. because they will address their emotions the moment they bother them.\\n\r\nThis is probably why the protagonist of the sequel, (Stardust Crusaders) Jotaro is one of the most popular protagonists of this series. because he hardly talks at all, he's mysterious, silent, you don't know everything about him and that is what makes you curious about a character. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, in overall the show was still an enjoyable ride, the combat scene's are every enjoyable and varied, the character designs are incredibly flamboyant and unique. it's all around 80's cheesy fun. that deserves a decent 7. \\n",

            "content": "First, a premise: I am NOT a Jojo fan from any previous series, nor I ever read the manga. When I approached this new anime, I did it only out of advice from an online friend, knowing that Jojo's Bizarre Adventure was... kind of a milestone and a very famous manga? Really, that's it. I had no idea what was expecting me. Which actually made it all the more enjoyable.\r\nNow, TO THE REVIEWMOBILE!\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story so far, if not complex or especially well written, is fun, thrilling, and chock-full of action and awesomeness. The first impression I got from Jojo's Bizzare Adventure was that thiswas going to be a completely over-the-top experience. No subtle psychological games here. This is all about big brawny men facing each other in large-hamming contests not less grand than their mano-a-mano fights. The premise quickly gets so outrageous that it can only be fun - as long as it doesn't take itself too seriously, which luckily is not a mistake this adaptation makes. To sum it up, this is the kind of plot that I could expect Charles Dickens to write after he got stoned on some heavy stuff and watched Hokuto no Ken, Hellsing and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, AT THE SAME TIME. Make of that whatever you want to.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing short of awesome to me. The colour are straight out of some hippie's acid trip. It's a compliment, actually! They're gorgeous and out of this world, giving an unreal feeling to the entire anime. The graphic representation of sounds makes this anime into some sort of moving comic. The animation in itself is not extra smooth, but I feel like this is not really important here. The only thing that really annoys me is the censorship, but that's not the animators' fault. The OP, on the other hand, must be the most amazing one in YEARS.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nForget the soundtrack, which is still excellent. When you have a great rock song like \"Roundabout\" (by English band YES, no less) for an anime's ED, you know you're dealing with people who has real taste. The song wins the prize for best anime OST this year alone, hands down.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the fun really lies. Jojo is a World of Ham where every. Single. Character. Is out there to chew the scenery in unbelievable ways. The villain is the most... villainous I've seen as of late. Even secondary characters pull off outrageous, ludicrous stunts, both in action scenes but more often in dialogues. Everyone will just scream all the time in the most hot-blooded possible way. It sounds ludicrous? It is. But it's so exaggerated that it works perfectly! Again, the magic element is that the anime doesn't take itself seriously. It's aware of the ridiculous levels of testosterone that are flying around and does nothing to tone them down, with everyone screaming at the top of their lungs in an almost Kamina-esque way. As a result, all main characters and a good deal of the secondary ones pass through as a single troupe of uncomparable badasses; and whenever someone loses a fight, it's only because someone managed to top his badassery with EVEN MORE badassery. And Dio Brando, is the most badass of them all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't give less than a 10 to the enjoyment of this series. To me, every episode is 25 minutes of hysterical, orgasmic fun. It just boils down to that: if you like people acting outrageously, exaggerate exclamations, fights to the last broken bone and the last drop of blood, martial arts and supernatural powers in an unlikely setting, all finely crafted and delivered in an ultra-dense form, this anime is for you. If you don't, well, why do you watch anime?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nA must watch, and possibly the best show of this season!",

            "content": "It's time to take a trip back to the 1800s, an age of time when the Napoleonic era and the rise of many colonies took place among various empires. History isn't easy to trace with certain origins but Jojo's Bizarre Adventure has its origins traced back with its original series. The fantastic journey finally begins! Yup, it's here and and this series suddenly is one hell of an anime that will not only bring some nostologia but excitement to you. Join Jojo Joestar and his many bizarre adventures as he embarges on a journey and learn about the wonders of the world.\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure (2012)is a reboot in the title of the same name based on a collection of manga written by Hirohiko Araki. He has also collaborated in other works but Jojo is his most famous presentation. The series picks up its way from the 19th century focused on Jojo Joestar and...his bizarre adventures as he fights equally bizarre adversaries. \\n\\n\r\nI have not read or seen the original series but this reboot has made a strong impression on me. The premise of the series is based the Joestar family. He is the titular character and judging by the title, the adventures are based on his experiences. To me, I consider this series to be a classic, nostalgic, and exhilarating tale. It is nostalgic because the period of time the series takes place. Think about it: the 19th century. It's a time when technology is nothing compared to what we have today. Everything is realistic, artistic, and presented in a natural form. This setup is quite lucid and easy to understand with even new viewers to anime. Hell, if I could understand it, anyone probably can.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off well and immediately wastes no time getting to the drama. In fact, we are already introduced some intense rivalry between Jonathan Joestar (Jojo) and Dio. It gets to the point and doesn't push itself to make any surprises. Well, I for one was surprised by how well the series executed its starting points and made a strong impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, viewers can clearly see that Jonathan Joestar (Jojo) is a nobleman with a heart of gold and cares others above his well-being. This is proved through his actions, words, and his way of helping out others. He is also seen as a tough fellow who doesn't let anyone push him around, especially Dio. This clearly sets up the rivalry between Jojo and Dio as the two seems to be on the opposite side of things. We already know that Jojo is a noble man. However, Dio is far from that as viewers can see him as a selfish, impure, and ill-mannered individual. His behavior, dialogue, and actions makes him a dangerous adversary as he not only has the physical prowess but aptitude and brilliance to match his capacity. This combination makes the rivalry that more exciting. To add onto to the drama, we also have a love interest. Unfortunately, events becomes inevitable as a seemingly potential romance is ruined by Dio. Talk about being a spoiled brat. It is quite intense to watch the drama between the duo especially when we see the clear gap between the the two. It's almost like David vs. Goliath as Jojo plays the role of the underdog.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the rivalry, there also exists a mysterious object that can seemingly turn the tide. It is a mysterious mask that seems to have ancient powers. These powers manifests by the spills of blood which leads to devastating results. It's definitely fun and exciting to see how far the rivalry will take now given that lives are also at stake.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on this mysterious object and among other artifacts later on. In fact, the story itself is actually divided into two separate arcs that follows a different generations of Jojo Joestar. The first arc known as Phantom Blood details on the rivalry between the duo. The second arc marks a glorious adventure starring Joseph Joestar (a descendent from the previous storyline) along with a new friend. Together, they embark on an adventure like never before taking on adversaries, improving themselves, and learning about the world and its wonders.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the story, I found both arcs presented quite well. The first arc, also known as Phantom Blood, starts off in an explosive and dramatic action detailing the intense rivalry between Jojo and Dio. On the other hand, the second arc (known as Battle Tendency) follows on a more adventurous tale in contrast to Phantom Blood. We meet the next descendent of the Jojo generation. He meets Caesar and although their relationship starts off like oil and water, over time, the duo gains mutual respect for one and the other. Unfortunately though, there is more conflict than just that as a trio of powerful antagonists are introduced in the latter half. This threat puts Jojo and Caesar in jeopardy and forces them to train themselves like never before. Ultimately, the two arcs are separate entities but are quite an entertaining watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I probably haven't touched much on the topic of this as much as I should have been but perhaps the characters of the series are the most interesting aspects that connects the show together. Jojo is the dynamic titular character of the series which follows a generation pattern. I've already talked about the first generation but both Jonathan and Joseph Joestar shares many aspects in terms of personality. Both characters are fiercely loyal, passionate, courageous, loving, and always looks after other people's well-being above their own. Although lacking in depth initution or acumen, they both are often able to come up with strategies that catches their adversaries off on guard. In particular, it is their determination to protect what they hold dear that pushes them to be their best. \\n\\n\r\nLet's not get too attached though because the Jojo franchise also offers many other fascinating characters from its collection. Previous characters such as Erina and Speedweagon makes their returns to provide valuable assistance. More importantly though are the new characters that really makes this show shine. We have Caesar who viewers may see as a polar opposite of Joseph Joestar. Caesar is a man that is confident, casual, and often likes to hang around the ladies. In sharp contrast, he is a man that Jojo loathes at first. Yet later on, we can see that they get along quite well and even risks lives for one and the other. On a more mature side, there is also Lisa Lisa, a deadly beauty to the eye who provides invaluable aid to Jojo and Caesar. Like most battle shounens, there are the antagonists. In the first arc, there's Dio. The second half introduces a trio of antagonists known as the Pillar Men. Their elemental powers pushes the duo of Jojo and Caesar over the edge and presents an intense challenge like they never faced before. It's also humorous to watch some of their random gags sometimes even if they are randomly peculiar; i.e. Wham's tendency to reflexively attack others when someone steps on his shadow, AC/DC's crying, and Cars' passion to protect living things (other than humans of course).\\n\\n\r\nThe action of the series is ridiculous. However, I mean 'ridiculous' in a good way because the over exaggerated way it is being portrayed. Every attack is spoken directly with dialogue and a stamp of dynamic that is humorous, entertaining, delightful, and grabs interest to viewers. Who wants to just watch characters shouting resolves like \u201cI'm going to save you, I swear!\u201d all the time? In this series, the characters presents their attacks in an enthralling way that stimulates attention while often making jokes about the dialogues themselves. Some of the characters' names are parodies as well such as AC/DC that is based off the Australia band of the same name. Most of the male characters also are manly with their flexed biceps and strong attitudes. It contrasts some of the shows I've seen and presented in a more old school way. The female characters in the show are also well portrayed with their maturity rather than being a stubborn, jealous, or tsundere as of many today's anime series. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, the series has a edgy way of production. The artwork might not be what people see nowadays. In fact, it's more classic, nostalgic, and holds that old 1900's style. David Production (Level E, Inu x Boku SS, Dogs: Bullets & Carnage) handles the artwork and they did a beautifully good job in my opinion. It protrays the old 1800s well with the old school vehicles, Victorian style architectures, and some of the ancient artifacts. It's like going back in time and relieving those old school memories.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is also well performed. The first and second OP songs are very well orchestrated that is classic to the ears. Hell, I could set \"BLOODY STREAM\" by Coda on repeat all night long. It's not only entertaining to watch but also artistic with those manly poses from the main characters. Its definite old school theme sticks well is adapted. Likely wise, the ED song produces a similar feeling of that nostologia of the 1800's where adventures and collecting treasures are a source of many people's inspirations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series gets a score of \u201c9\u201d from me. It has gar characters, that old school feeling, and very entertaining dialogues. It doesn't force itself either because all of them are spoken with humor as opposed for a purpose. The characters are appealing with their personalities and their interactions. From what I see, they are natural and falls in the case of a glorious presentation. The nostalgic music and artwork also gives fresh breath of cool air. No random fan service, no confusing plot twists, no cheap humor, no regrets. This series is definitely one hell of an adventure and worth your time.",

            "content": "This adaptation of JoJo covers Part 1: Phantom Blood & Part 2:Battle Tendency. Both parts are unique 80's horror shonen filled with MANLINESS! The following will be split into two reviews per part below. The reason for this is that every JoJo part should NOT be skipped as each have their own tone. Examples include: Phantom Blood being a classical vampire hunter story while Battle Tendency feels very much like an Indiana Jones film. However, both animes are filled with stylish colors, great characters & outstanding music!!\r\nPART 1: PHANTOM BLOOD (EPS 1-9)\r\nThe beginning of JoJo seems a bit rough at first but manages to givethe outline for its primary themes of the series. Taking place in the late 1880's in England, we are introduced to the Joestar family & the Brando Family. The story starts to move when Dio Brando is adopted into the Joestar family as Dio is an ambitious jerk who wishes to rob the family of its fortune & would resort to murder. \\n\\n\r\nJonathan Joestar is our JoJo for the series whose life changes once Dio discovers the stone mask using it to make himself a vampire. The rest of the series involves Jonathan learning the Ripple martial art to battle against Dio & his vampire army & going on an adventure involving zombies, Jack The Ripper, martial artists, bizarre super powers, over the top dialogue & manly tears.\\n\\n\r\nBeing inspired by Fist Of The North Star & possibly Bram Stroker's Dracula, Phantom Blood is a blend of manly characters & horror elements making it a unique short tale. To some people, Jonathan comes off a rather too \"good hearted\", however having experiencing Fist Of The North Star (specifically The Shin Arc chapters 1-10/episodes 1-22) the \"corny moments\" come off as very tragic to me.\\n\\n\r\nPart 1 feels more like a classical tale of vampire hunters especially with its location & time period as we have normal humans battling against the forces of darkness. This is further aided with its music as it has the feel of an epic tale & often resorts to something akin to immediate music.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the concepts of Stands & its much later \"Bizarre\" quality weren't developed yet, this story almost works as a stand alone with its tragic finale giving much highlight to fans of Manly series such as Sakigake Otokojuku, Riki-Oh, Cyber Blue, Kongo Bancho & Fist Of The North Star respectively. \\n\\n\r\nPhantom Blood may not be the best part of JoJo but serves as a teaser of what the series can become as it expresses the original themes Hirohiko Araki thought of: The struggle of humanity, the temptation of evil, the strive for perfection & the importance of family. \\n\\n\r\nPART 2: BATTLE TENDENCY (EPS 10-26)\\n\\n\r\n50 years after the events of Phantom Blood, Joseph Joestar makes his debut as the grandson of Jonathan Joestar. The story begins once Straights uses the stone mask battling Joseph who then later encounters The Wermacht & the series villains; The Pillar Men who created The Stone Masks of Part 1.\\n\\n\r\nThis story continues the original message of the importance of family as history repeats itself with the descendants of The Joestars & The Zeppelis having to face Aztec Vampires. Battle Tendency succeeds as a sequel as it vastly improves The Ripple technique along with having 3 major enemies this time around. Much like part 1, this sequel contains over the top dialogue, manly battles, creative abilities & flourishes more into comedy while still retaining its signature horror.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph Joestar is vastly different from his grandfather, as he comes off as more rebellious & comedic which more fans seem to like as a leading JoJo. Other differences in Part 2 is being more expressive in flamboyancy in ways serving as a contrast to the more masculine tone of part 1. This is aided by its opening & villains The Pillarmen as the fabulous colors pay homage to Araki's coloring style & foreshadows its future in Part 5. While it may deter to some viewers, this part does retain its masculine audience as the characters continue to carry various warrior ideologies. The tone for this series is more adventurous as it contains more locations than the 1st series as well as a bigger roster of leading characters. Aiding these characters are various theme music used in this anime as it ranges from 90's rap, upbeat pop, german lyrics, dubstep, electro, rock, classical & even Italian singing. Note the anime uses mostly instrumental tracks while the OST contain lyrics within their songs.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2 is about breaking The Joestar family curse & the passing of lineage as it displays how men learn to accept their pasts & discover the value of the next generation. Most of the content in Battle Tendency is greatly appreciated due to the tragic events that occurred in part 1 as it helps the viewer see the progress of not just a family but the author's writing style. \\n\\n\r\nLook forward to Part 3 Stardust Crusaders as it focuses more on horror & introduces its iconic STANDS creating the structure of the following parts of JoJo.",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure isn't just about silly glitz and glamour that some people seem to assume upon viewing. When watching it, \r\nIt almost gave me that first impression, but to my curiosity and interest it became something more than just this being a generic show.\r\nIt is an undeniably fun series first of all. \r\nSecondly, it is a shounen that is unique and different to a hell of a lot of shounen animes out there today that I feel bring an interesting blend of Dark comical yet a wacky and serious tone to viewing and the thing I love the most about this show is thatits able to shift really well in between those elements where other shows seemingly get lost within those transition and after just give up its own originality of what it was and what it wanted it to be in the process. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a show that never loses its own identity or what its trying to be which is why its one of my favourite animes\\n\r\nIts like to entertain in style which is why I appreciate this a lot.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga is something ongoing from this point on in its entirety to the story stretching back to 1986 when other well known shows like Hokuto no ken, Dragon ball, Sakigake!! Otokojuku etc so yeah it goes back a long time to the grand daddies of the shounen genres of the past.\\n\\n\r\nAs I give my review of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) without spoilers please be aware that this anime only covers the events of 2 timeline within the story first being\\n\r\nPart 1 Phantom Blood containing episodes from 1 - 9 and Part 2 Battle Tendency containing episodes from 10 - 26 showing the main characters each being a member of the Joestar family in different timelines along with a different story from the manga as you see the family tree starts to keep going and going embracing a previous heritage notion from their own.\\n\\n\r\nNow to get a look into about the main characters\\n\\n\r\nwe begin our focus on the life of the very first Joestar of the bloodline and of course in the story of Part 1 in the year of 1887.\\n\\n\r\nJohnathan Joestar: The main protagonist of part 1 hes a decent physically strong british nobleman as well being a Manly son of a gun, he is always thinking positive about those around him and is very polite, he seems like an ordinary gentleman.\\n\r\nBut he has a dark cloud looming around him in the form of his step brother Dio who turns his world upside down and for the most part are always against one another forming a rocky yet typical rivalry between the 2 that later on becomes the very battle between good versus evil where johnathan has to match his demonic and vastly cunning step brother by learning about a power source known as \\n\r\nThe ripple which allows him to use a mystical ancient martial art that mixes in naturalistic elements to combat against Dio's power \\n\r\nand speaking of Dio..\\n\\n\r\nDio Brando: The main antagonist of part 1 (as well as a my favourite character) He is not only a sinister human being at heart but also has a deep seeded hate towards his step brother Jonathan due to his social standing at the beginning of his childhood being raised by a poor Englishmen Dario Brando with a deceitful, uncaring personality who then became Dio's father after finding him in a wreckage of a carriage crash that had involve the father and mother of Jonathan. \\n\r\nDario raises Dio due to the circumstance that he did so only to gain profit off the joestar of some of their possessions resounding into a horrible upbringing of Dio in his childhood that grew with a passion to hate step father Dario and than later turns his attention to becoming part of the joestar family and tearing them apart from the inside.\\n\r\nDio is not only a constant threat to the joestar family in the series and within the manga itself but that he also later on is possessed by a strange stone mask that resides in the joestar's household that he later takes giving him deadly mysterious powers of a vampire.\\n\r\nOn top of that he has an unquenchable appetite for being ambitious and dangerous. what I like is how crafty his personality seems to be, he might seem like a stereotypical villain but he's someone I feel keeps part 1 very engaging to watch along with other characters in part 1 that also play a major key role for Johnathan Joestar and Dio Brando's progression and development.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2 Battle Tendency is the time skip way after the events that took place 50 years ago. The year is 1938 around the era of World War 2 we now are introduced to the other main character of the story at this time \\n\\n\r\nJoseph Joestar: He is the grandson of Jonathan Joestar, A very entertaining, funny and charming character to say the least, his mission becomes more similar to his grandfather where his actions take root to put a stop to the evil curse of the stone mask's own power that now has its creators resurrected to threaten all of humanity they are known as the pillar men, the 3 pillar men that go by the name of Esidisi (ACDC), Wamuu (Wham) and their Leader Cars (kars), they are pretty much the antagonists at this point of the story and are very dedicated and dangerous threat to anyone that tries to stop them which make the trio powerful villains also in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters are really well done in this anime that becomes to the point where it feels so natural with a lot of the characters they have their strengths and weakness through the show as you see. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while the story and characters are engaging they are by no means picture perfect and what I mean by that is the way certain character's aspiration and motives sometimes look like they are trying too hard to amuse us the viewers, which might seem like the case or so? they either are represented just purposefully that way because the writing tries to portray the characters to be so in this manner of being either on the outrageous end of the spectrum or just trying to be forcefully entertaining in or both?  \\n\r\nand for me with some scenarios in the anime it doesn't seem that well balanced on those terms, which might indicate some certain scenes of being unbalanced due to its stylistic nature here and there in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nIt could also feel like a hit or miss to others while experiencing this since at times they can be some annoying sarcasms and while I do applaud them trying to explore these facets of the characters, it kinda gives me those in between moods of ''should I be taking this seriously or not?''\\n\\n\r\nWhen I really want to know and understand about something in the series or just to decipher what certain characters have mentioned it leaves out certain explanation for logical understanding on some of the mad stuff that are going on in this anime that you will see while watching it which might not make a lot of sense, it is kinda hard to unravel some things that happen within those moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nicely handled by the studio behind this and for the most part its pretty colourful along with the art style of MANime!!\ufeff that shows it clear as day which can be said the same of the manga that it carries itself from.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is clearly based of western music that is heard in the Opening and the Closings and it fits brilliantly which gives me that charismatic impression that Hirohiko Araki gets from his influence on these types of music artist and scores and funny enough its even shows with the names of the characters having an inspiration from these certain music artist or other establishments.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also dramatically over the top which adds to the theme\\n\r\nthat JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has this in abundance of manly troupes the anime goes along with, I really loved Koyasu Takehito performance as Dio.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is enjoyable to say the least and feels really dynamic and worth your time if you want to be entertained in some ways depending on your preference of course and for me its no secret that its one of my favourite of all time simply put it deserves an overall score of 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "For veteran viewers that's been around long enough to notice it, the manly man protagonist has become something of a dying breed. A relic of anime's past that has been dwindling away year after year with no signs of slowing down. Many saw the change as a product of the times. Something that should simply be accepted as a predestined occurrence. The manly man was no longer marketable. Their role as a protagonist was brought to retirement, reduced to being a part of the growing collection of side character archetypes, stockpiled for future use as high school delinquents and muscle-bound uncles with far too muchgusto. \\n\r\nSure, we've seen a few cases of deviance with shows like Kaiji, Cromartie High School, and to a lesser degree, Gurren Lagann, but there was never truly something that represented the MANLY MAN in its purest form..., until 2012. Almost like divine providence, or an act of public backlash, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure announced its TV debut. An anime that stood as an embodiment of this dying breed, completely packaged with macho-man poses, testosterone-fueled rants, and a whole lot of physical smack-downs. GAR resurrected in all its glory!\\n\\n\r\nSelf-aware in execution and oozing with machismo, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is an unapologetic slug-fest that marches to the beat of its own drum. It doesn't waste its time trying to pander to modern day expectations but simply demands the viewer to accept it for what it is. It's a bully to the uninitiated but a celebratory return to those still nostalgic for the beef heads of 80-90s action-hero Americana. \\n\\n\r\nIn an industry that has become pro beta-male for over a decade, JoJo requires you to forget all common notions built up during that time period. It requires you to draw back to an era where chivalry wasn't there to simply admire your enemy but to swiftly kick their asses as well. To a time where protagonists weren't written to be afraid of a woman's touch, but fully embraced it. A time where conflict and friendships alike were solved over the neanderthal \"punch first, ask questions later\" logic; bonds formed by fists just as quickly as they end them. It's MANLY MAN shit! Stupid, illogical, exaggerated, hammy, so heterosexual that it borderlines on homoerotic..., but still AWESOME MANLY MAN SHIT! \\n\\n\r\nTo help facilitate this testosterone-driven nonsense, we're introduced to the Joestar family.\\n\\n\r\nFrom one generation to the next, the Joestars' battle against the supernatural has been a long and arduous one. The 1st arc, consisting of episode 1-9, serves as our jumping off point for this journey to come. Because this arc has been set aside to perform all the necessary world-building required for the series, it could feel slow for those expecting all the crazy fights and epic poses that the internet has turned into full-time memes at this point. And while we certainly do get a serving of that early on, the focus for these 9-episodes are far tamer than what the rest of the series would eventually come to offer. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where we're first introduced to the Joestars and Brandos, two families with faiths intertwined by a red thread of ill-faith and bad-blood. Through a series of unfortunate events, the son of the Brando family, Dio, finds himself abducted into the Joestar family after his father dies of an unknown illness. It doesn't take long before the son of the Joestars, Jonathan, and Dio to develop a bitter rivalry; one that went from petty squabbles to a full-fledged vendetta after Dio's devilish schemes are unveiled.\\n\\n\r\nThrough that turmoil, we are introduced to the MacGuffin that would go on to become the source of all conflict in the series, and many other follow-up installments yet to come. The object in question is an ancient mask. The wearer of this mask is granted the rebirth abilities and supernatural power of a vampire. And as I'm sure you've guessed by now, Dio gets his hands on this mask and makes quick use of it. And so begins the conflict that would last for generations. To stand a fighting chance against Dio and his newly gained powers, Jonathan came to learn of a mysterious force known as the Ripple technique. With both sides armed with their respective abilities, the only thing left is to kick some ass!\\n\\n\r\nThis 1st arc doesn't truly pay off until viewed in conjunction with the 2nd half of the series (episode 10-26). Taking place 50 years after the events that occurred in the 1st half, we're introduced to Joseph, the grandson of the Joestar lineage, a kid that's an arbitrator of jokes and a whole lot of ass whippings. While he found himself confronting the same problems as his British ancestors, his methods of dealing with them are far less aristocratic. This is where Jojo truly becomes JOJO, as we're thrown into an adrenaline-driven narrative that takes the inklings of manliness only hinted at in the 1st half and amplifies it to insurmountable heights. With more battles, more poses, more manly moments, more epic face-offs, more white-knuckled encounters, and more bravado pumped into every scene; the 2nd half was pure awesomesauce! Action-packed and borderline nonsensical, for those only wanting a fix of GAR in their lives, look no further!\\n\\n\r\nBringing this work to life, David Production made sure that every frame was oozing with personality. One noteworthy example of this was how they manage to juxtapose flamboyancy with manliness in a way that felt domestic to the show. On paper, the thought of these two worlds intermixing would seem like a disaster, but with the right amount of care and effort, David Production proved that the integration of these two opposing elements was not only possible but worth the effort, as the end result was impressive to look at. It was like high-end fashion meet the robustness of Mad Max. As odd as that sounds, the self-awareness in which the creators treated the project made every bit of it easy to buy into.\\n\r\nThis was further exemplified with a comic-book inspired art-style that they choose to incorporate, which used a mixture of pop art and bold graphic designs. This mixture of gusto and sass also bled into the characters. Every random pose highlighted with gonzo wall-texts and neon-color splashed everywhere. Outfits that looked like the illegitimate offspring of steroids and glitter dust. This weird hybrid of husky-man GAR and metrosexuality is a style that will become synonymous with the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe music choice was also a mix-bag, ranging from new-school EDM, synth-pop, orchestral ballads, and old-school J-rock. There was never a dull moment with this constant rotation of musical styles. The soundtrack added an extra punch to a show that's already dripping with style. It's sensory overload in the best way possible. Another thing worth noting was the opening song, a style that's deep-rooted in the machismo crooning commonly found in the 80s and early 90s with a graphic visual style adopted from contemporary art. And as if all this greatness wasn't enough, we're even blessed with a 70s prog-rock classic for an ending, \"Roundabout\" by YES. In a way, the opening and ending themes were a great reflection of Jojo itself: old-school meet new-school. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's ultimately the secret ingredient that makes JoJo so beloved by many. It's a love-letter to the past in an envelope from today. \\n\\n\r\nA title that's full of style, charisma, and self-awareness, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure proves that you don't always need complexity to tell a compelling story, as long as you're fully committed and there's an undeniable passion behind it, even simple stories can become crowd-pleasers. And in that regard, JoJo was a success. It never tried to be more than what it was. It's an anime comfortable in its own skin. It just so happen that that \"skin\" is a muscle-bound brute with an odd obsession for fashion. If you're tired of seeing pushover beta-males and stories that take themselves way too seriously, then this title is for you. A title that has not only proven that GAR isn't a lost cause but also a missed part of the medium worth bringing back out of retirement.",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is popular for it's manga and I had no idea what to expect when picking up this anime. Manga is not my means of entertainment but the anime as it was presented to me intrigued me to watch it. It was recommended to me as a masterpiece, a must watch and as one of the best shounen with intelligent fights. So is it a masterpiece? To put it objectively, yes and no.Please evaluate the review after you have read it, thank you. Keep reading.\r\nFirst of all for those who have no idea what this is about let me clear this up foryou. It's about the rivalry between good and evil,mortal and immortal, between men of courage and those who succumbed to their fear of death and their mortality, those who find love and happiness in a family and those who believe happiness is in power and immortality. It's about men doing manly things and accepting their role and fate it is as gar as something can be. Sounds simple right? Well that's because it is. The story is in no way complex and one might say it's cliche and we have seen this before but the selling point of this show is it's over the top execution and exaggeration in everything it does. Characters who seem like they can't speak in a normal way and just yell all the time on top of their lungs, ridiculous over the top situations, exaggerated statements of obvious things(eg. sky is blue, he punched him, he is falling OMG!!! etc), ludicrous fight scenes where the mc's stop in the middle of the fight to take a great pose just to seem cool or say something awesome, over the top moments and unrealistic conclusions of fight scenes or storyline. Here arises a question of whether is this good or bad, is it enjoyable or not, does this fit the anime or falls flat on their faces? It does and it doesn't.Let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nThe story consists of two parts or more accurately of two arcs. The first nine episodes are the 1st arc and the remaining episodes are the 2nd arc. Each arc has different main male character, different villains and stories but they are nicely connected together and to the main premise of the story. There are two magic elements that make this whole over the top approach work. The first is the fact that this show doesn't take itself too seriously like ever. The second and most crucial part in my opinion is the pace in which the story is developed. This is where the problem in the first arc lies for me. It was so horrible that I actually wanted to drop the show but glad that didn't. In the first part the pace is so fast that it overwhelms you with it ridiculousness, exaggeration and unrealism. Character development and story progression feels rushed. The motives for some characters to become close friends with mc are questionable and unrealistic. The main villain is bad just to be bad at least some of his actions indicate this or they are just plain stupid and pointless not to mention that some of his motives are not believable. So much stuff is unexplained or seems ridiculous that it falls literally flat on your face. Some people might like this but this is actually the main reason why someone might drop this show not giving it a chance which it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that the second part comes and here is where the magic starts to happen.The pace slows down dramatically and becomes incredibly fitting to the show. The main character changes, the story gets a lot better and the villains are just incredible. The development and progression of the story and characters becomes perfect. Suddenly the intervals between the yelling, the over the top fights, the posing, the exaggerated claims, the ridiculous moments and the unrealistic elements fall in perfect equivalence and if before they were overwhelming now they start to entertain you. The enjoyment skyrockets. The dialogues are funny and even the statements of obvious facts start to be enjoyable.One last thing to mention about the story is that the fighting system is fairly simple although individual elements can be complex and on top of that some strategical thinking takes place in most of the battles fought.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack in this anime is top notch. From your typical action and tension scenes to your melodramatic moments ost's are in perfect synch and fit incredibly well to every scene. Voice actors are just insanely good and bring out the manliness and badassness of the characters in the right fashion not to mention how well they fit to every character with no exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is amazing.Bright and intense colors are very pleasing to the eye and they enhance the over the top effect of the anime awesomely well. The facial expressions are distinct and the surrounding backgrounds are well portrayed which accomplishes the atmosphere and the mood of every scene. The battle scenes are very well depicted although the details of the background are left out it's in no way at the expense of the enjoyment overall. The only flaw that could be noticed is that at some moments it felt like I was watching a series of still frames but other than that it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect where this show exceeds is it's characters. The writer knows how to create enjoyable and memorable characters. Mostly this is true in the second arc because the pace is what determines the development of the characters as well. That doesn't mean that we don't come across with likeable characters in the first part. The second part has the most perfect male lead ever. Masculinity level over 9000. He is funny,smart,strong,charming and generally a badass. Side characters are very likable and memorable as well and almost none of them is pointless to the story. Villains are well developed and have their own personalities and ethics, some of them are real warriors and men with a capital \"M\". You will definitely feel attached to some characters in a minor or a major way. They pose, they scream on top of their lungs, they have their own code and morals in life which they follow,they chase their goals and accept their fate like true warriors, they spout exaggerated claims and they are really enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment factor is over the roof. If you are like me than you might find the first 9 episodes horrible but I strongly recommend to stick with it until episode 11 and then decide if you want to drop this show or not. If you want an easy fun ride where real men embroil themselves in epic fights for their honor, pride, their code in life or to protect their loved ones and humanity and they do it in an exaggerated, over the top, ridiculous way than this show is for you. Stop everything you are doing and go watch this but leave your critical self out the door and don't expect realism in a show where its primal goal is to amuse its viewers. Although you will find your fair share of intelligence,drama,action and comedy. I would have scored this a 9 if it wasn't for the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\n*Every feedback is appreciated, thank you.*\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: MOST WILL NOT AGREE WITH ME. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE A BABY BECAUSE I DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINION, DON'T READ.\r\nLife occasionally gives you things that you don't understand. Sometimes its people, or school work, and sometimes, its why something is popular. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure was recommended to me by so many people who regarded it as one of the best series ever. Upon watching it, I realized that to enjoy the show, you must turn your brain off and just take it in. As such, I did, yet I still ask the question: WHY THE HELL IS THIS SERIES SO POPULAR!!!????????? That'san exaggeration of course, as I do understand the appeal of a show like this, but it certainly does baffle me to know that this show has so many deeply devoted fans who consider it their favorite anime. In my honest opinion, Jojo is one of the worst series I have ever seen so far, and I promise this isn't a troll and I know that I am in a minority.  Usually, I am a completionist who must finish every series I watch all the way through. I just couldn't do that with this one, and its the first series I ever dropped. Personally, I found every scenario really stupid, with dumb characters, and surprisingly good music. I'll do my best to explain why I hate this series so much and though I know most will disagree with me, at least try to understand where I am coming from. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation- My god does this anime look like shit. I get what they were going for: a very stylized, comic book style art style. I don't have a problem with that, and I feel that it could have added to the story. However, it just looks so unpolished. I give points for the interesting style and occasionally decent animation, but the art makes this anime look like it's from the early 2000's. Hell, I saw footage of the 1993 adaptation of Jojo and at some parts, it barely looks better. I will also say that character designs are very uninspired and I found many of them to look remarkably similar, but with some different colors on them. Overall, the art was pretty bad on this one, and the solid animation doesn't make up for it. \\n\\n\r\nStory- Art style doesn't prevent a story from being good. Like I said, I figured out to watch this show with my critical brain turned off, but here is what I noticed even without it. First, SO MANY PLOT CONVENIENCES!!! Occasionally they are fine, but I found most of the show's scenarios were that there was an item in the exact right place at the exact right time, or that a character was holding something that was never shown or alluded to. One of the worst examples was when fighting a monster weak to sunlight in part 2. Once the monster was lured outside, it just so happened to be exactly noon, and there was a well in the exact spot where the sun was shining brightest, which was used to reflect light to the monster on both sides. Even with no critical mind, I noticed that and it bothered me, and I can name plenty of other similar scenarios. Also, Part 1 was incredibly boring to me. The 7 year time skip from episode 1 to 2 was really stupid and we got no sense of what the characters involved went through. It was jarring. On top of that, scenarios that weren't plot conveniences, which were few and far between, were just too stupid to be entertaining, and too cringy to be funny. I know that they were trying to be \"bizarre\", but they took it way to far. It wasn't even stupid funny, just stupid. The premise was somewhat interesting with the idea of a multi-generational epic, and there were a few episodes that were actually kind of entertaining, but overall, the story was just really bad in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- I wish that the characters helped, but unfortunately, they don't. I'll name most of them. Jonothan Joestar was bland. The seven year time skip changed his personality totally and we got no idea of what happened during that time. He was supposed to be a gentleman, but he did some rather rude things to Dio (though he deserved them). He was supposed to be a weakling who can't win a fight, but he suddenly transformed to a monster who can win with a broken arm. All of that is just stupid, though he was entertaining sometimes. Dio was a decent villain, but only because he was so easy to hate. He had little motive, and was simply an asshole for no good reason. He also went from wanting money, to wanting to take over the world in literally one episode. I just found that jarring. Speedwagon was interesting, but my problem with him is that in less than an episode, he went from fighting Jojo, to becoming his best friend and biggest supporter. Thankfully, I was somewhat interested in his character. Zepelli was by far the most interesting character, but we didn't find out much about him at all. Joseph Joestar was mostly an annoying, arrogant brat whose presence on screen usually made me want to tear my eyes and ears out. Caesar was also annoying as fuck. Finally, Lisa Lisa was intriguing, but not enough for me to want to finish the show for her story. Overall, the characters were along a normal curve, with some being rather good, some being rather bad, and most being meh. \\n\\n\r\nSound- I will however, give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack for Jojo was actually really nice. It always fit the mood and added to the scenes (as much as it could). It was mostly epic fight songs, but that works for a series like this one. Also, there were some nice atmospheric songs that added to the mystery aspects of the show. Also of note, was the second OP, as it is absolutely fantastic and one of my personal favorites. The ED theme is also great, not only for it being a giant meme, but just for being a great revival of an awesome old song. Finally, I have to admit that sound effects were pretty nice. While none of it blew me away or anything, it was definitely very good. Jojo's sound is by far its best quality. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- As I said, I am usually a completionist, so when I drop a show, that means that I really don't like it. Needless to say, I did not get much enjoyment out of this show at all. Every episode was a drag to watch, and no matter how much I would pray for something to be entertaining, it rarely ever was, even with my brain turned off. It just wasn't interesting or fun enough for me to want to finish it to the end. I honestly can't force myself to watch the next 9 episodes because that would be torture for me. I did get some enjoyment out of certain parts, which is why I can't give a 1 there, but I really don't understand why people love this show so much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- I'm usually a pretty generous reviewer. The fact that I score anything below a five means its really bad to me. I just can't get myself to finish this show because I can find barely any redeeming factors. With brain on or off, I don't understand how this show could have such a huge following of deeply devoted followers. It honestly baffles me. I've probably pissed off a lot of people right now, so I won't say more because I like my life. All i'll say is that if you are reading this and haven't seen the show and are on the edge, and if you have seen my other reviews and have similar tastes, don't waste your time on this one. \\n\\n",

            "content": "If I had to describe JoJo's Bizarre Adventures with one word, that word would be, without a doubt, passion. A story of young and righteous men and their fight to secure a safe future for their families, friends, and ultimately, the world. A record of a fierce rivalry between the ultimate evil and a man who serves the side of justice, and the legacy they leave behind. A tale of fleeting romance, brotherly bonds, and, of course, hot blooded battles. This is the epitome of JoJo, one of the most unconventional, interesting, and captivating shows I have had the pleasure of watching thus far.\r\nJoJo's BizarreAdventures' 26 episodes are split into two arcs, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. Phantom Blood tells the story of Jonathan Joestar, better known as JoJo, heir to the wealthy Joestar family fortune, and his fated encounter with Dio Brando, the son of a lowly con man, and how one ancient stone mask forever changed the fates of not only JoJo and Dio, but those who would eventually follow in their footsteps. Battle Tendency follows the life of Joseph Joestar, Jonathan's grandson and also known as JoJo, and how his grandfather's legacy ultimately involves him in a struggle to save the world from certain doom. Through larger than life battles, passionate characters, and, for lack of a more appropriate word, bizarre situations, JoJo's unique definition of the word \"epic\" certainly makes this show entertaining and addicting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEven in the face of insane and unconventional battle scenes along with plot that was so over the top that it could have been considered silly, the aspect of JoJo that stood out the most, that was the most memorable, and that was the show's strongest selling point was its cast of characters, heroes and villains alike. Each important character has a unique personality along with their own strengths and weaknesses, and they all give you a good reason to either cheer for them or to absolutely hate their guts. You would be hard pressed to find another cast of characters that drew you to them quite like JoJo's cast of characters. \\n\\n\r\nJonathan Joestar epitomizes the image of a true hero. He fights for the honor of his family, radiates an aura of kindness and gentleness, and protects those who are powerless. While mild mannered, he fights with the tenacity of a true warrior, and never gives up as long as he draws breath. His grandson, Joseph Joestar, while not as good-willed and honest as his grandfather, still shows genuine empathy towards his loved ones and respect towards his enemies. A fighter who relies more on his quick wits and brilliant battle strategy creating abilities rather than overwhelming his opponents through feats of strength; he utilizes the weaknesses of his adversaries and manipulates them to his advantage.\\n\\n\r\nIt is rare these days to find a villain that truly embraces the meaning of evil, and one such villain that pulls it off excellently is Dio Brando. A man who will kill your dog because you angered him, steal the first kiss of the girl you're in love with, and simply physically beat you up from time to time can't be described with any other word other than evil. Treating the family that took him in after he is left penniless and alone in the world as a stepping stone to wealth and power, and taking every opportunity to trample upon JoJo's kindness and goodwill, he makes one believe that some people are simply born bad. A good villain should make your blood boil, send chills down your spine, or give you a sense of odd respect every time you see him, and Dio Brando is precisely the kind of man that will evoke all of the said reactions at the same time. The Pillar Men are the kind of villains that don't seem like evil incarnate, but their lack of empathy and desire to attain absolute power make them fine antagonists in their own right. I will refrain from describing them in greater detail due to spoilers, but they themselves will tell you exactly what kind of personalities they have; you can be sure of that.\\n\\n\r\nWatching JoJo was like reading an antique comic book from the turn of the century, both in art style and literal sense. The end of each episode made me immediately load the next episode, akin to eagerly turning the page of an action comic book to see what comes next. The age old sound effects of BAM!, or POW!, or ORAORAORA! (okay maybe not that last one), make the battle scenes much more entertaining, and I found my eyes glued to the screen for the whole 25 minutes of each episode. The story is fairly well written and fluid, and they take the time to explain any inconsistencies when they arise. While the action or story can become a bit overwhelming to the point where it seems silly, or ridiculous, or unnecessary, that is simply part of the experience of watching JoJo. When you take a show for what it is, you are then able to appreciate it more; JoJo is no different. \\n\\n\r\nThe art seems to be, as stated before, straight out of a vintage comic book. Bold lines, action sounds, and muscular men make up 90% of JoJo's art, with the occasional beautiful woman. The animation is quite graphic, and is not for the faint of heart. There are bloody battle scenes, grotesque zombies and vampires, along with a whole plethora of other strange and insane scenes. The soundtrack is another one of JoJo's strong points. The OP for both arcs are catchy and will stay with you for awhile; the ED is \"Roundabout\" from an English progressive band called Yes, and suits the show very well (there are many allusions to famous music bands and icons throughout the show). \\n\\n\r\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventures is not a show for everyone. If you're the more logical or rational type who dislikes anything over the top and/or unnecessary/pointless, JoJo won't be your cup of tea. However, it is definitely a show worth checking out if you enjoy action, passion, and, of course, the age old fight between heroes trying to save the world and villains who are trying to either destroy or rule it. And remember, any resistance in enjoying the show is, in Dio's words, MUDAMUDAMUDA!",

            "content": "Quick Disclaimer. I have a ton to say about Jojo's, so this review will be very long, which is saying a lot since my other reviews are crazy long to begin with, so read with your own discretion.\r\nBattle shounen have a bad rap in the anime community, and in my opinion, it is mainly for good reason. They are overly repetitive, extremely long in running time, and have extremely archetypal characters that develop very slowly because of said running time. However, this is only because the shows of the genre that are like this are by far the most popular (The Big 3, Fairy Tail,etc.). This creates a stigma that says that all battle shounen are shit, which I believe isn't true. Don't get me wrong, most of them are very bad, but there are a select few that rise above the failings that plague most battle shounen, and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is one of them, even if it still isn't perfect (I hear Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a good example as well, but I haven't watched it yet :P).\\n\\n\r\nSince this show is split into two parts (the first 9 episodes adapts the first part of the manga series, Phantom Blood, whilst the remaining episodes adapt the second, Battle Tendency), I will talk about some things that help and hinder the show across both parts, and then delve into the pros and cons that concern each respective part after that.\\n\\n\r\nThe main way this show decides to stray away from it's other battle shounen brethren is basically be as stupid as possible. There are so many logic flaws and asspulls littered throughout Jojo's Bizzare Adventure that you can find yourself facepalming at some points. On the other hand, however, the show wouldn't be nearly as fun without some of the silly shit it pulls. What it lacks in logic it makes up for with extreme passion and energy, and it's hard not to get caught up in the spectacle of it all. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there was one thing that appeared readily throughout the runtime of the series that really tried to hamper the fun atmosphere it's sheer stupidity had set up. Every time a character tries to pull any sort of move or tactic, accompanying dialogue is there to spell it out for us. Granted, some explanation is needed for some of the more complicated plots the characters pull off, but it goes too far when a character screams something along the line of \"I'm going to deliver a Hamon Kick straight to your face!\". It's like the show assumes the audience is just as stupid as it is, and this dialogue can really take you out of the experience at times with it's excessive amounts of hand-holding. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I will talk about with this show as a whole (except for art and sound, which will come later) is how much the spotlight is put on the two main characters of each respective parts. It really seems like the main characters are the only ones capable of moving the plot forward in this show. This doesn't mean that there aren't any other good characters in the show besides the mains, because there are. Hell, one of the mains is actually very bland. There are some very interesting and extremely likeable characters, but most of them have very little power with the plot, especially during fight scenes, where the main leads are always the ones to beat the bad guys, even when some characters are clearly stronger than them to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the two arcs separately, starting with Phantom Blood. For me, Phantom Blood is easily the weakest of the two parts, and it's easy to see why. With only 9 episodes dedicated to it, many elements of the plot feel extremely rushed, and we have no time to form bonds with most of the characters because of this. There are a decent number of characters for 9 episodes, and other than 3, none of them really get proper time to flesh out. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character for this part, Jonathan Joestar, is the bland MC I was talking about earlier. There isn't much to him other than very basic motivations. He doesn't even have much of a personality to him. The only good thing about his character was his relation to the antagonist, Dio Brando, who is by far the best part of Phantom Blood, and possibly the only thing Phantom Blood does better than Battle Tendency. While yes, Dio's motivations are as cliche as they come (basically just become more powerful), it's the immense amount of pressure and pain he puts on Jonathan throughout Phantom Blood's length. He becomes such a menacing presence because he is with JoJo for all of his adolescence and young adult years, and we witness the physical and psychological torture he puts on JoJo.\\n\\n\r\nAs for any other characters, the only character that I even sort of liked would be JoJo's mentor, Will. A. Zeppeli. He was very cool and a pretty decent mentor character, but he failed to really captivate me. Robert E. O. Speedwagon, Jojo's travelling companion, was basically just a commentator for this part, saying what happens during a fight, which as you already know, I very much disliked, so it goes without saying that I also dislike this character. Erina and Straizo are better in the second part, but fail to make much of an impact in this one, due to lack of focus mainly. \\n\\n\r\nIf Phantom Blood was the only thing to this anime, I would leave this show with mediocre memories of JoJo as a whole. However, Battle Tendency had so much more to offer. Since there was many more episodes for Battle Tendency to make use of, everything benefited as a result. The plot, while probably more silly than the last, is a lot more fleshed out. Also, Jonathans grandson, Joseph Joestar, is a way better protagonist. While he comes off annoying and cocky at times, his energy and his tactics in battle make him much more of an interesting character. He embodies what makes JoJo's Bizzare Adventure good, and that is it's wacky yet passionate tone it takes. \\n\\n\r\nAs for other characters, whilst they don't have much effect on the plot as said, they have such better personalities and backstories than Phantom Blood could ever dream of. Ceasar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, was a good foil to Joseph, with his more gentlemanly and suave personality initially clashing with Joseph's more brash attitude, and he also had a great backstory. The same can be said about the mentor character  this time around, Lisa Lisa. With a show that is teeming with overly muscular men, it is nice to see a woman who is just as, if not more powerful than most of the other characters. I just think the show didn't really respect her as much as they should've. She get's used for fanservice purposes quite a lot, and whilst most other characters get this as well, she almost immediately gets sidelined for Joseph in fights. Still, she gets enough respect still be a good addition to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains of the show, save for Kars, are the weakest part of Battle Tendency for me. Whilst Kars is shown to be a very menacing presence much like Dio is, the other three, Santana, Esidisi, and Wamuu failed to capture that. Wamuu was the best out of those three, since he strayed a lot from the villain formula used mainly in this show. Although he was an antagonist, he was very honorable in comparison to his brethren, which was a nice breath of fresh air, even though he was fairly weak. Santana and Esidisi, however, didn't do much for me. \\n\\n\r\nBefore going into art and sound, I saved my favourite character in this entire show for last. Rudol Von Stroheim, a militaristic and proud Nazi Commander, is the last guy you would think as the best character in an anime. He was just so badass and surprisingly selfless whenever he was on screen, and although there is a lot of screaming in Jojo's, his screams are the ones that are the most impactful to me. God he is just so awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Jojo's certainly isn't the best there is to offer when talking about newer anime. This isn't really surprising considering that the production studio, David Production, was founded by the former head of Gonzo, which is pretty notorious for less than stellar animation quality. However, unlike Gonzo, Jojo's is very consistent with it's artstyle, even if it the quality isn't the best. It is still effective when it comes to fightscenes, and is flashy and flamboyant enough when it needs to be, which is almost necessary for a show such as this one. The character designs are fantastic though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a bit of a mixed bag. The OST has some decent tracks, but many are filled to the brim with extremely out of place dubstep, which really can hamper the mood of the show, especially when you realize the show is set in the late 1800's to early 1900's. However, the two OP's and ED are fantastic for the show. With a show that has classic rock references everywhere, it is only fitting to have the ending theme be Roundabout by Yes, a classic rock single from 1972. Lastly, we have the voice acting. It's just so good. The screams are just so great. I can't get enough of them. SEKAI ICHI!\\n\\n\r\nWhilst Jojo's Bizzare Adventure (2012) is by no means a perfect entry into the battle shounen genre (not like there really is ever, but still), it manages to break away from the many tropes that hinder many of it's counterparts to give us a show with so much energy that you can't help but love it, even with so many flaws. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is enjoyment in the purest sense of the word. It's something you can watch to just have a good time and not think about anything. Hell, it's probably better that way, or else you would probably end up hating it! If you want to watch something that is just mindless fun with a couple heartfelt moments sprinkled in, there isn't much of a better recommendation. It certainly looks like Jojo's is going to become one of those long running shounen, but this is one I can get behind.\\n",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is probably right now one of the most praised titles on this database, but is this actually deserved?\r\nWell, after an era where moe has overtake the industry, with shows trying too hard to be cute that ended up being annoying, plus the overexpose of those titles, it's no wonder a show that pander to old school anime fans, when the anime was good, and was full of GAR male and manly protagonist and not loser and pussies. But nostalgia is one of the best liars, and actually, the old school anime is, most of the times, ultraviolent OVAs without any substance, withidiot plot and unidimensional characters that were just wish fullfillment to people wo dreamed to be real men. Real men, according to sexist ideas.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure is one of the most well-remenbered Shonen Jump's titles, along with Fist of the North Star, another GAR manga. Those days, studios made animes they'll know are gonna be successful, because making psychological cyberpunk thrillers with deep plot and though-provoking dialog is fine, but it's even finder made an anime that will sell after the bankrupt many studios had suffered. So, JoJo's was a sure value, it was gonna be successful. And it was, but not only in Japan, where is a loved classic, also here in the Western fandom, reaching really unexpected levels, with fanboys praising it, no one to contradict them and memes everywhere. (Who doesn't know the \"It was me, Dio\"?)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot it's more a collection of sagas, with different protagonists, the mangaka improvises to make sure the fans get hooked up. It's always the same, there's a Joestar male family menber who can control a tecnique named Hamon, which it's actually a superpower working according the plot conveniences in every fight, and has to fight evil immortal vampires. The first anime season is based on the two first anime sagas.\\n\\n\r\nThe first one is more idiotic, with characters completely undimensional and a  story so clich\u00e9 you wouldn't believe it: our hero has a friend who turned out to be the villain and join the evil forces because he has a serious big ego issues, and after his fiend betrayed him and kill his family, he's now the chosen one to defeat this evil forces learning and training an ancient tecnique (Hamon). But before fight his archnemesis, he must fight tons of evil minions. Oh, and there's a damsel in distress love interest. Everything is as cliched as i told you.\\n\\n\r\nThe second one is less cliched, but more narmy. Appears new villains, and some characters from the previous arc suddenly turned into ones despite they didn't showed any signs in the past. It looks like they're gonna have more badass female characters, but at the end of the day that's just a false promise. Female characters are still as passive as always. But what made this second half really awful is the over the top scenes like the killer squirrell, or the way the big bad is defeated. It's not so bad is good. It's so bad it's impossibly stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty frustrating. The hero from the first-half, Jonathan, fits more the traditional hero role, and it's eassier to root from him because he's more sympathetic, but he's so undimensional he becomes bland. The hero from the second-half, his grandson Joseph, he's a less tradiotional hero, and less undimensional, but less sympathetic too, and despite all the chances to develop him, actually he just become stronger, but at the end of the day you don't feel he changed that much.\\n\r\nThe secondaries go from idiots for pure plot convenience (Jonathan's father, trusting always people he musn't despite being obviously evil) to just so plain useful you need to pity them (Speedwagon, whose only purpose is commenting the obvious, or Smokey, only there to be The scream by Edvard Munch). But the worst is the first arc's main antagonist, Dio Brando, that' so pure evil, so campy, so succesful in his plans because all the Joestars are so dense, with lots of wasted opportunities to have depth, but no, he just born evil. Just that. And he's obnoxiously egocentric.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pure cringe, defying anathomy and physics. And the so called fabulous posses are just ridiculous, making the sequences laugh-worthy. So, after all the crap i said, you must woonder, why is JoJo's so popular? So acclaimed? My answer is simple. Pandering. It panders to the ones who miss the \"good old days\", who decide which animes are good or bad. At the end of the day, it's just wish fullfillment, like the harem based on light novels.",

            "content": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken\r\nI'm new to Jojo, i haven't read the manga so i didn't knew what i was getting into, nor i was expecting more than one protagonist, i instantly thought it was similar to Hokuto no Ken with a Castlevania type of vampires, and that was great, i was really surprised at everything this anime had to offer.\r\nStory\r\nThe story has two parts, Part 1 is Phantom Blood and Part two is Battle Tendency; Part 1 starts with the story of two young boys that met in their youth, Jonathan Joestar (JoJo) a boy from a wealthy and respected family and with astrong will and caring for people, and from the other side we have Dio Brando a boy from a poor family that arrived at the Joestar's mansion because Dio's father ''saved'' JoJo's father and owes him his life, so he takes Dio as his son, and since his arrival he is shown as a evil person, making Jojo's life miserable.\\n\r\nThere's a mask that will tie their destiny, for the worst (this part was the serious one and the bloodiest one) and Jojo will learn a technique to fight back, and it's called Hamon, a power using his energy.\\n\r\nPart 2 starts 50 years later, more adventurous than part 1 and is focused on not only one mask but the creatures that created the masks, Cars, AC/DC, Wham and another creature Santana, fighting against them is Joseph Joestar, Jonathan's niece, alongside with other companions to his adventure. It has a lot of comedy than drama but with SpeedWagon in both parts everything gets more dramatic x10, it was funny even tho the scenes weren't funny, it was the exaggeration of him. I liked that they didn't put filler eps. with their training. The key of the story is the characters, the characters makes the story so amazing and enjoyable, filled with exaggeration and the vogue poses were hilarious, if you pay attention you will see a couple of background characters making poses, and how can i forget the crying machos full of testosterone, nothing manlier than a big muscular man crying for his Bro.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style is something that i liked a lot instantly, it has a manga like art style, i really enjoyed seeing that kind of animation, and sometimes the colors changed in some dialogues, i can point out a lot more, but is as simple as that, the animation was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music was almost perfect, you can enjoy the really amazing VA to both great OP and the great ED just like the sound effects and the almost outstanding background music, but there was something that i couldn't stand, the thing is i like Electronica and its ramifications except aggrotech and the awful dubstep, and this anime has dubstep in some fights and not because i hate that ''music'', i can't see dubstep fitting in an anime that has a lot of references of Rock, so it dropped the quality for me, but taking out that negative disgrace and put in everything else the sound in general was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are really important in this anime, without the amazing characters everything else would drop in quality, the story wouldn't be the same if they weren't made like they actually are, so much character development and that's something important, i wouldn't thought this would made me shed tears, but it did, 3 times. It's important to point out that almost every characters has a name of a rock band or a rock band member, i spotted every single one and i laughed at how little time Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham were on screen.\\n\r\n-Jonathan Joestar is a great character, seeing how much he grew from a boy who couldn't fight and was beaten by Dio in everything until he snapped and made a killer combo on him, it was wow, and then to a very mature and kind person, too much kind for his own good, but he can't be blame, it was his nature.\\n\r\n-Dio Brando is one evil dude, that wanted to get rid of the Joestar's so he could take their fortune, he is one though hard to kill bastard who hates and respects Jonathan.\\n\r\n-Will Zeppelli is a great character, is a shame that he wasn't that much on screen.\\n\r\n-SpeedWagon is a unique character, he lived as a thug until he met Jonathan and his kindness, after that he followed him and considered him as a friend; But how can one character make everything more dramatic, the character that relates everything and explains attacks, happenings, he explains everything even the little details and the obvious things, if only he had a kid to pass that greatness.\\n\r\n-Joseph Joestar is more of a goof, always taunting at his enemies, and staying cool and having an Ace out of his sleeve everytime for any situation, he is much less serious than Jonathan but is a kind person like him in his own way.\\n\r\n-Ceasar Zeppeli is Will's niece, he is a casanova with a dark past to him, he has a competitive relation with JoJo, competing to outbest eachother and later on both developing a Bromance.\\n\r\nAnd then there are other great characters like Wham, Strotheim and a bunch more that are great, there are a lot of characters for me to write about them, but it would be too long, i only have to point out that the VA on everyone was really amazing, even the support characters have the same engage as the main characters, that's why the characters are outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWhat else can i write, with the combination of everything that i wrote already, you have an outstanding enjoyment.",

            "content": "Many people suggested JoJo to me and I probably came to watch it expecting too much.  This is a very generic shounen anime, with cool masculine elements added to it. Art is cool (even if I prefer the illustrations made by the author much more than their anime counterpart) and sound too. Story however is poor and the main reason is that characters are poorly written. The first arc features a bland protagonist with absolutely no depth behind his sense of justice and an even less deep villain who has at least a nice character design, but is just evil for the sake ofevil. Other characters in the first half, expecially the mc's father, are just outright stupid. Other than characters, there isn't really much else for the story. A villain appears and main characters aquire poorly-introduced-super-powers to punch their way to the final fight. Oh and those super powers can do basically whatever according to the plot needs, with no consistency whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSecond half is a little better than the first, as characters at least use some tactic in the fight, even if that is usually just a decently written @$$pull. Weapons materializing out of thin air because who cares are to be expected. Plot is still a mess but I enjoyed this part more, probably because by this time all my hype and expectations had already been shuttered. As soon as I turned my brain off and accepted the show as it is, it became less dreadful to watch.\\n\r\nDo not come to jojo expecting a masterpiece\\n\r\nCome here for a poorly written plot, dumb characters that explain their tactic to the enemy, a few punches and a lot of random moments. Come here for juvenile humor, muscles and the most linear story a shounen could tell you. Come here for a generic anime that's probably iconic for the sole reason that it was one of the first modern shounens and so ended up being influential.\\n\r\nStill, I have to admit it has a certain style to it, with the manly feel, the cool poses and a few interesting character designs. That's probably its saving grace. And it \"could\" be enjoyable if you shut your brain off. I'll give the show a 5.",

            "content": "This first series of recent Jojo adaptations adapted two story arcs from the manga, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. With that being said, I will be reviewing both arcs to the series separately since their quality varies between both.\r\nPhantom Blood's role is to introduce Dio Brando and how he would become entangled with the Joestar family bloodline for later installments of the franchise. The storytelling here is rather bland to a good extent as it lacks the energy found with later story arcs of the series and our lead protagonist, Jonathan Joestar, is rather cliched with his typical pure-hearted personality. Ruthless parenting and strained siblingrelationships are nothing new in anime, with these storytelling elements making Phantom Blood feel rather dated in terms of plot. On the plus side, later developments in Phantom Blood do redeem the arc somewhat when Dio's transformation into a vampire, the over-the-top action scenes and the title's penchant for naming characters after American rock musicians pop up.\\n\\n\r\nBattle Tendency is where Jojo's trademark energetic and over-the-top characters and battles are fully shown off when Jonathan's grandson, Joseph, is our new protagonist when he clashes with the Pillar Men. Unlike his grandfather, Joseph is a more fun protagonist here as he is more impulsive, loves to toy with his foes regardless of how heated things get and is known to improvise quite a bit to get himself out of heated situations. The Pillar Men are just as eccentric as Joseph with their personality quirks and being named after American music bands, yet are still formidable enough with their abilities to be legitimate threats to Joseph and his allies that test their abilities for combat and show off Joseph improvising whatever means he can think up of overcoming them. The substance of the series in terms of plot and characters is rather typical of shounen titles in its haphazard revelations and developments, but the style it milks is what allows Jojo to stick out from most franchises appealing to the demographic.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, this animated spin on Jojo does well for the most part with showing off the title's trademark energetic and over-the-top look. Details drawn on characters are exaggerated with the large, muscular bodies of the male cast and the series has fun milking use of bright color tones to compliment the energetic mood of the series. Stylistic approaches to the series such as some of the ridiculous poses struck by characters and sound effect texts displayed onscreen add to the title's fun approach. The soundtrack is energetic and diverse with musical selections such as militaristic themes, opera pieces and mysterious beats that help to enhance the exaggerated feel of scenes played out throughout the series. The only low point of the title's presentation comes from its rather subpar animation as shortcuts are employed at a number of points throughout the title's run such as still shots, jump shots and speed stripes.\\n\\n\r\nIssues aside, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure was still a fun romp for the most part thanks to its stylish approach with its characters and battles and shows that there are occasions where style can prevail over substance as Hellsing Ultimate proved.

            "content": "[6.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nStarting reviews with a quote is often cheesy and forced, however, I figure i'd fall in line with the series if I do, so...\r\n\"Mama Mia!\" \r\nThat was Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's first season and it was indeed bizarre and quite the adventure, with a sprawling cast of characters and two massive arcs that end up giving more than they take. What felt like a generic action shounen, which I am strictly not a fan of, ended up transitioning into something just a little bit more... bizarre. Perhaps not quick enough, though, but the end result here is undeniably fun. I think that's the easiest way tocharacterize this series as a whole at the moment. Fun. It is a fun show. It has fun characters. It has wacky fun twists. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nFun/10\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nJust joking! I wouldn't be myself if I didn't criticize everything and hate on things that are hardly even made for me. Onto the animation, or, as I could put it more accurately, the moments that are actually animated. In classic action shounen fashion, this series has the air of a slap-dash production. A lot of it feels rushed, as most anime does, and that shows the most in the animation quality. \\n\\n\r\nIt is sparingly good with a deeper pang of mediocrity to downright ugliness. That being said, it has some smart tactics up its sleeve to cover up said ugly animation with what can only be called \"signature Jojo-isms\", which is how i'll be referring to them from now on. Signature Jojo-isms are the parts of the series that we, and to a certain extent, I, recognized immediately as unique to this product. The moments and artistic choices that I was aware of coming into the series because they span seemingly throughout all of culture. \\n\\n\r\nShoddy animation is hidden behind posing, rumbling text on screen, awesome use of color and ultimately an appealing visual style. I feel like a series like this can actually be consumed frame-by-frame and the end result wouldn't actually be any worse than what we have here. The animation feels like a transition from one pose to another, rather than just something fluidly paced. If anything, it is a clever use of budget. It feels natural to have these characters move less when they're so focused around standing still and looking good. This isn't me excusing the poor animation in some areas, but it is me complementing the series in understanding its strengths and not trying to amend impossible weaknesses. This is undoubtedly the smart way to go about presenting a series. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also standout. What effort and time they didn't have for the animation they clearly outsourced well for the sound. Both the music and the sound effects have a great cheese to them that really brings the series to life. The opening to the second arc is a total ear-worm that I don't see myself forgetting anytime soon. But this design goes past just sound-effects and the opening, the backing music even has personality to it. Each character ends up having a somewhat memorable theme. In the shows superior second arc, we get plenty of recognizable stingers and bombastic techno-anthems that seriously pound your eardrums in the best possible way.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the Pillar Men to our favorite Nazi, everyone gets a time to shine, musically. Once again, I feel like this show could've easily been consumed in some kind of less movement focused visual medium, like a Visual Novel. Especially since it is so focused around the music. What you'd be losing, however, is the grandiose voice acting. Don't get me wrong, everything here is over-acted to shit but I think that's how it was meant to be. It is all silly, and the actors are clearly having a hoot yelling just about every line they read. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters & Story] \\n\\n\r\nThe series really ramps up in quality as it progresses, not necessarily in the art department but in the overall enjoyment of what is transpiring in front of you. We start with a mildly generic battle-arc that has sparring moments of entertainment mixed in with a jambalaya of boring nothingness. The first arc really leaves a lot to be desired. Both the settings and our protagonist feel incredibly weak in comparison to the second arc, where the series really decides to take off. \\n\\n\r\nWhen we meet the second JoJo, Joseph, you end up seeing exactly what direction this show is going and understanding exactly why this is positive. It went from a slightly wacky battle Shounen to an off-the-wall batshit insane battle Shounen, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. I find that most battle shounen in anime tend to go down the same path and I rather not harp on the entire genres problems this review since I do that so often in my other outings. All that needs to be said is that JoJo is bizarre enough to stand out from the already bizarre selection of battle shounen that end up getting mushed together into one lump of over-moralizing strung-out garbage. \\n\\n\r\nOf course we get plenty of the cliches that come with the genre, though. From the over-abundance of still images with a few action lines thrown in to training arcs and jobbing that act like the cherry on top of the action shounen pudding. We have side-characters that do nothing but gawk at the action, and the general illogic of battle, where every moment feels like decades and characters just stand around chatting and explaining rather than actually fighting. We also have one of my least favorite cliches, as a character watches their friends get decimated before doing something, instead of helping them right away. Because of course they have to monologue and let the story unfold as dramatically as possible. For example, Joseph battles one of the three main baddies in this chariot race. Joseph cheats by piling rocks at the starting line and makes the baddies chariot unable to begin the race, while he flies by. Moments later, however, it is revealed that the baddy actually wanted this to happen and needed to be behind Jojo all-along. Yet his reaction to the initial rock pile-up, even when Joseph was hundreds of meters ahead of him, was that of shock. Why? Who was he playing to? The viewers? \\n\\n\r\nThese are issues that even Jojo can't overcome. That being said, what it does within this genre it does well. The villains were both memorable and the unfolding battles, during their peaks, were solid. Even if the barrage of episodes leading up to the final climax, or what I call \"battle build-up\", where the characters fight through seeming gauntlets of nothingness is just tedious to sit through. What's great about Jojo is that it does its best to even make those moments funny, and I think at its best, Jojo's is hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nAs something that can be defined as the pulpiest possible anime, which is already an insane sentence to write since most anime is pulpy. Jojo's embraces that title and really runs the miles with it. You have man-eating squirrels, bubble-blowing Italian men, and every character death, major or not, treated as the worlds greatest tragedy. It is so unabashedly corny that you can't help but laugh. And maybe that's not the emotion I should be feeling during the sad moments, but the fact that the show so willingly plays every one of these bizarre and silly scenes as totally straight makes it so endearing and comical. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to analyze here, though. The thematic elements are blunt and childish, as they are supposed to be. Every piece of symbolism is so hammy and funny that it really doesn't hold any weight. But it really shouldn't in a series like this. You should understand exactly what kind of show this is and revel in the mawkish glory. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nWhat I can't help but think about is how this series does just about everything a parody should do, yet can't really be classified as a parody. Everything is definitely exaggerated, but I wouldn't even say it was deliberately exaggerated for comedy. The author, I feel, just wanted to make something bizarre and indulge in that quality. Comparing it to something like an earlier series I ended up dropping, Food Wars, the differences are palpable. Food Wars can be classified as a parody of action shounen, yet it was both less funny and less creative than Jojo. It was even less bizarre! A parody is supposed to over-exaggerated elements, but when non-parodies like Jojo's are already so absurd I can't help but feel like this entire genre is beyond parody at this point. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is interesting. Maybe I just haven't thought of a proper approach to parodying a genre that already comes off as way over-the-top. Maybe Jojo's really is a parody of sorts. But it plays like the kind of B-movie you end up really attached to because of how seriously it commits to the role of being that crappy B-movie. At the end of the day, that's all you can really ask for. A fun, campy series that embraces the cliches of its brethren with enough vigor and prowess that you end up with a product that not only exceeds your expectations, but completely surpasses them, for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nStill weighed down by the genre trappings, much like any above-average Shounen action series that I've seen, Jojo's crafts its own visual style and personal identity, while also  wearing its faults and scars like a cloak. Don the mask, become a supreme being, indulge in the inanity. Get in on the campy fun.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nNothing on this planet exists quite like the notion of family. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents; everyone has or has had them. And while we may not always get along over the dinner table, deep down the connections we share with our family are unlike anything else we know. Many times, these bonds are tested, often verging on the point of breaking. But with a careful hand (and maybe a bit of Hamon), the ties that bind us can truly never be broken. Such is the tale of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and what a taleit is.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with Jonathon Joestar, a young boy who earns himself a new brother, Dio Brando. After many altercations, the two find themselves at a crossroad.\\n\\n\r\nImmediately when the anime begins, it gives off an enticing presence. It's not overpowering, but you know right from the get-go that this one behaves completely different from anything before it. The overly detailed characters, the verbose explanations, and the over-the-top outcomes of anything that goes on culminate in this amazing vibe the show gives off. It might be somewhat unfair to say, but it's better to experience it than to have it described to you. That's how unmistakable and unique the show feels.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, getting slightly spoiler-y, spans multiple generations of the Jojo family tree. It's actually quite fascinating for two reasons: it shifts the focus from one main character to the next and allows for complete and fulfilling story arcs. Time skips in any show are always a tricky thing to pull off, because it requires the audience to reinvest themselves in characters that either had rushed/skipped character development or in ones that are brand new.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure opts for a mix of the two. It utilizes both old and new characters to make the transition easier. By providing the old ones, we as an audience already understand and know their background. Their purpose, then, was to serve as catalysts for the new. In this way, the new characters never feel distant, since their literal familial history gives them the needed personality and character traits. Now, obviously, the later characters stand apart from their ancestors in one form or another, but the way in which everything tied together so nicely was great to see.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was an award in \"Explaining the Current Predicament,\" Jojo's Bizarre Adventure would win with flying colors. No matter the situation, no matter how dire things may seem, the show will, without fail, explain exactly what is going on. Interestingly enough, this never gets old. This is most likely due to the nature of the show itself being incredibly over-the-top and crazy in the first place. The overall goals during each arc are simple, and are not the focus. Instead, it's what is happening then and now. Whether Jojo is running with a football or holding a glass of water, every detail is looked at. This further adds to the already awesome presence the show gives off.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note. Being completely honest, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is the same from beginning to end. It doesn't explore any themes, it's not trying to enlighten you, and it never provides a new insight on life. It's a wacky ride from start to finish. And while in context it is coherent in the story it tells, there is really nothing here to analyze. It's tough men and women fighting to save the world.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAnother standout feature in this adventure is the art style that the anime adopts.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost come the character designs themselves. Gone are the days of huge eyes and scraggly teenagers late into high school. No, the characters here are \"real\" men and women. Taking place in areas outside of Japan, the characters fit the part, both in aesthetic and physical appearance. Furthermore, everyone is heavily detailed. Contours on their faces, sharp lines for their muscles, and varying outfit choices make them stand out not only from among different shows but from one another as well.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the style. Style here isn't so much the art but in how it is presented. In this case, it is done in \"comic book\" fashion. Actions sometimes get accompanying onomatopoeia, facial close-ups, frame breaks; it really feels like a comic book has come to life right before your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is in the art itself. The show essentially takes all the colors of the rainbow, puts them in a bucket, grabs a handful of this paint, and chucks it at the drawings. What we get are a flurry and amalgamation of colors that are constantly changing. It not only makes the scenes contain varying and interesting color palettes, but makes the different scenarios refreshing to look at since they morph every few minutes or so. It's a really cool effect that the show employs masterfully.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the show's faults comes in its actual animation. For the most part, it is quite minimal. The massive amount of character details, the cool presentation, and the revolving art are the portions of the show that saw the majority of the resources, leaving little for this section.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure has a slew of characters, but I'll talk about some of the more important ones: Baron and Caesar Zeppeli, Speedwagon, Jojo, and of course, Dio.\\n\\n\r\nBaron and Caesar are what most men aspire to be: charming with the ladies, strong both physically and mentally, and stalwart in their convictions. But above all else, they have the innate ability to do whatever it takes to turn the situation in their favor. If anything, their characters serve to demonstrate that sometimes we can't always do things on our own. Sometimes, we require a little outside influence.\\n\\n\r\nSpeedwagon is that guy you wish you had as a friend. It doesn't matter what you may be doing, he always has your back through thick and thin. And if we had to give that explanatory award to one individual, Speedwagon earns it without a doubt. Almost exclusively there to give us the rundown of what is going on at that very second, his \"power\" isn't demonstrated until much later, and even then it is only alluded to. Constantly in the shadows of the more vocal and obtuse men of the show, he may seem like a side character, but there is no Jojo without Speedwagon.\\n\\n\r\nJojo is definitely a good protagonist. Smart, strong, and skilled in many arts, his ability to turn a situation in his favor is rivaled by no one. His success as a \"Hamon\" user makes him a force to be reckoned with, and his chivalrous ways allow him to be the true gentleman that he's always been. Right alongside Speedwagon and the others, you'll be calling out \"Jojo!\" right up until the finish. At this point, you may be asking yourself, \"Yea, but which one?\" To which I respond, \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n\r\nArguably the best character from the show is Dio Brando. His characterization is interesting because of how well it plays with the family idea. Driven by hate towards his own father and the Joestar name, he makes it his mission to thwart Jojo whenever he can. He's not necessarily wrong, just completely misguided. He's intelligent and honorable as a warrior, and his ideals about obtaining power and ruling over all are evil. But these goals mirror his true feelings; he's extremely lonely. Pushing Jojo and Jojo's father away was more instinctual than intentional. He never really experienced true love, in any form, in order to allow him to realize that what he always really wanted was right next to him all along.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP sort of \"sets the stage\" for what the show is all about. It's not so much a song as it is a small poem. The best part is actually the \"Jojo\" part that happens a select view times; it sort of sounds like the beating of a heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP is more artistic in its lyrics and presentation. The trumpets, vocals, and continuous drum/cymbal beat make it a bit more lively, coinciding with the more lively atmosphere and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is obviously the most interesting. Not only because it is a Western song, but why it was chosen in the first place. My interpretation is not so much in the lyrics themselves but in just the title alone: \"Roundabout.\" That is, as is demonstrated by Jojo time and again, the solution to the problem at hand is almost always quite roundabout.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack does have some good pieces, such as the triumphant score that plays when Jojo is going to win or the Pillar Men's more Aztec sounding piece. Also of note here is the sound effect, used to great effect, when the camera is zooming in or moving from one scene to the next.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, I found everyone did fine work in the roles they represented. This is especially true for characters like Speedwagon or Von Stroheim who consistently had to scream or elevate their voices to match the scenarios at hand.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI can't recall not laughing during any single episode for this one. There was always something ridiculous happening on screen, from the comedic writing to the crazy yet \"realistic\" answers for the zany holes that the characters found themselves in. Even just Speedwagon saying, \"What?!\" or the bad guy at the time going, \"Impossible!\" would always give me the biggest grin imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not afraid of showing some rather gruesome material. Things such as accordian'd fingers, heads chopped horizontally at nose-level, and melting flesh are the norm. If someone gets unsettled by such content, the anime might not be for them. But if you can handle such brutality, it just makes the entire experience that much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is just straight up fun. It's presentation, the story, and the writing make it supremely different from almost any other show out there. On enjoyment alone the show could be considered perfection. It honestly is that much of a great time. But considering the whole package, the final product doesn't quite reach that status. Yet it goes without saying there isn't and probably will never be anything quite like Jojo.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, Jojo makes its mark\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, unique art style with little actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Jojo, Dio, Speedwagon, and the rest play their parts\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OPs, good ED, nice soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, really nothing else like it\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Imagine if Dragon Ball Z was actually good, or if Kill la Kill wasn\u2019t so weird.\r\nI feel sorry for this anime. It takes a stupid, pointless idea and makes the best of it. The world has dozens of stories about macho dudes beating up other macho dudes because they don\u2019t agree with their morals. In the worst cases, these stories are filled with overcomplicated fight systems nobody cares about, and silly monologues.\r\nThe world of macho dudes who never really die, where time doesn\u2019t exist is a bit tired now. Franchises like Naruto, One Piece and Dragon Ball will outlast the heat death of the universe.It\u2019s bizarre how no author of these mangas pulled a Robert Jordan, but nothing is as bizarre as this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMacho-ness, like most tropes, is bad because it\u2019s boring. The problem with using tropes has nothing to do with sophistication. It\u2019s just that after seeing the same technique for 100 stories, you get bored. You become like JoJo and can predict their next sentences. Bad cliches are used by storytellers who don\u2019t know what kind of story they want to tell. Is it an epic adventure? A silly show about silly people beating each other? An examination of good an evil?\\n\\n\r\nJoJo\u2018s strength is the focus, unlike all these shows. The anime makes it clear what it wants to be early in the beginning. Then, every single thing that happens connects to that. JoJo wants to deliver a simple story of good and evil. The bad guys are really, really bad. The good guys are really good and charming. If the fate of the world was really in the hands of a macho dude, we\u2019d all be filled with adrenaline. When it\u2019s a bunch of colors on the screen, you need more than this.\\n\\n\r\nSince JoJo knows its purpose is to deliver excitement, it will do everything it can to raise the stakes. Bad guys don\u2019t come back after being defeated just because you can milk the show a little more. They come back because it raises the stakes, makes us wonder how they can be defeated. The anime establishes that everyone knows what everyone\u2019s next move is, which is exciting because we wonder when will one of these will fail.\\n\\n\r\nBattles in anime always have pre-determined results. Every battle in anime is a man playing chess against himself. So a battle is only as exciting when the writers can challenge themselves, when they find ways to overturn their own schemes. The set-pieces drive the battles, not just meaningless shots of people using fists. Each battle is a progression of moves. It\u2019s an odd way to describe a fight but they\u2019re like a chess game in how every move has a clear influence on what happens next. There\u2019s something thrilling in seeing a person trying hard to beat himself up in chess.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the animation that sparks up the battle, which is weird. Most of the time, exciting fights are well animated. They have fluid movements that create a kinetic energy. JoJo opts for more still shots, but its set-pieces and beautiful progression saves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style itself is very old school and gloriously macho. It\u2019s so old-school it\u2019s jarring at first. Everyone has a Schwarznegger build and dangerously low amounts of fat. Even characters who don\u2019t fight look muscular, with square faces and bodies of an endomorph. This style can be ugly. It does suffer from Same Face Syndrome, but they make up for it in other ways. Where it fails to dazzle in character shapes, it succeeds in customes and hairstyle. Every important character has a unique, often elaborate dress style.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, beyond the endomorph build, JoJo\u2018s version of macho is unique. Perhaps it was common in old times, but today it\u2019s rarer. We now love our heroes rebellious, slightly selfish and enforcing their morality in brutal ways. We want Deadpool and Iron Man, heroes who are only good because the plot requires it. The macho-ness of JoJo is the \u2018respectable gentleman\u2019, a man who respects even his enemies. The first part drills this the most, but even the second arc with the rowdy second JoJo has it. Wham is an honorable villain. JoJo duels him fairly and with respect, rather than with malice.\\n\\n\r\nSo the characters don\u2019t look gritty and tough. Rather, in the language of 12-year-old kids, they look gay. Their customes are elaborate and decorative. They look like men who are so sure of their macho-ness that they don\u2019t mind looking so ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThe female design also enforces this weird form of macho-ness. JoJo doesn\u2019t downplay the female\u2019s femininity. In fact, it shows it with all the glory. Although there are no ecchi moments, the female characters look distinctly feminine \u2013 lipstick, eyelashes, gentle features. A common problem in battle shounen is that everyone is so macho, the show is afraid of femininity. So besides having longer hair and breasts, the females look like men. JoJo doesn\u2019t need sexuality to remember its female characters are female. It\u2019s a macho series that doesn\u2019t view femininity as a weakness.\\n\\n\r\nFor all its fun (and it\u2019s a lot of fun), there\u2019s a glass ceiling it cannot break. It\u2019s a great macho adventure about saving the world, but that\u2019s all there is. It does a lot with its style, but it\u2019s always limited by it. Dragon Ball Z looks pathetic next to it, but JoJo is overshadowed by Kill la Kill. For all of its weirdness and energy, it never becomes as absurd Kill la Kill. It aims there and it succeeds enough to not become useless. I\u2019ll definitely check out the sequels, but Imaishi\u2019s cartoon prove there is so much more you can do with macho bullshit and saving the world. The fact JoJo keeps up with it and and is still worthwhile is a point for it.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo is excellent at what it does. There are plenty of silly people who think there\u2019s no value in adventure stories about saving the world. It may not be Kill la Kill, but it gets everything else right \u2013 the pacing is focused, the art is beautiful, the fights are coherent. It\u2019s the sort of thing that inspires a lot of anime that can\u2019t measure up to it.\\n\\n\r\n6 skedaddling out of 5 here",

The first part is pretty lame, slow, and would have caused me to drop JoJo's if I wasn't already dead-set on watching it in full. As a warning, don't drop this anime thinking it won't get better. It does. It gets so much better. This is now my favorite anime.\r\nEverything becomes godly in part 2. The art isbeautiful, colorful, unconfined. The OP is supremely catchy- but Pillar Men... dear god. The characters are charming and charismatic- almost never do they break character for the sake of the plot.

            "content": "Overview:\r\nNearly every review of JoJo 2012 praises it as a MASTERPIECE, because it represents a triumphant return for the macho manly anime of the past. I have a slightly different perspective than most critics on MAL, so unsurprisingly my conclusion was a little different as well. If I was born between 1995 and 2000 and grew up during the \"sparkling kawaii desu moe\" era of anime where every male protagonist is a whiny pussy, I too would be inclined to give Jojo a 10/10 out of sheer novelty alone. However, I was born in the 1980s and I actually remember the GAR days of manlyanime. In the 1990s, you watched anime largely by going to the video store and renting whatever anime was available. Almost ALL of it was cheaply licensed, ultraviolent OVAs from the late 80s and early 90s. Were those anime better? Well believe it or not...no, not really. There were indeed some awesome anime like Fist of the North Star (Hokuto no Ken), but for every Fist of the North Star there was absolute garbage like: Genocyber, Violence Jack, MD Geist, Mad Bull 34, Angel Cop, etc. Simply being macho didn't make an anime good by default back in the 1990s, and that shouldn't be any different today! I am going to look at Jojo from a fair and objective view rather then simply heap praise on it based on principle alone.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS!)\\n\\n\r\nThe 2012 JoJo anime adapts the first 2 arcs of the manga, so this is the JoJo series you should watch first sequentially! JoJo is about the Joestar family and their epic feats of badassery over the generations. The first generation of Joestar asskicking takes place in Victorian England with Jonathan Joestar, whom I will call Johnny JoJo. The dumbass father of Johnny JoJo decides to adopt the blatantly evil son of a man who \"saved his life\" when he had a carriage accident. Even though it is later revealed that papa Joestar knew that Brando was a dishonest man and wasn't actually trying to save him, he adopts Dio anyway and continuously believes Dio over his own son despite the fact that Dio may as well have \"evil\" tattooed on his forehead. Dio is a 1 dimensional bully who exists to make Johnny JoJo miserable, steal his father's affection, and ultimately try steal his inheritance. Dio will perform some act of over the top evil like brutally murder Johnny's dog, and papa Joestar will instantly believe Dio's side of the story, simply to frustrate the viewers. This is like that Spongebob episode where Spongebob adopts an evil lamprey as a pet and keeps blaming the obviously innocent Gary the snail whenever anything goes wrong. The difference is that JoJo isn't a comedy cartoon for small children. It is a Shonen demographic anime that actually expects us to take this seriously! Johnny JoJo discovers that Dio is attempting to poison his father and inherit the fortune, so he goes to find the poison shop where Dio has been purchasing his product. Johnny JoJo proves Dio is guilty, but Dio uses a mystical artifact Johnny has been studying to transform himself into a vampire and start wrecking shit. Dio kills papa Joestar and seemingly gets killed in turn by Johnny, but it turns out Dio survived and wants to create a vampire army to take over the world. Johnny takes some mystical martial arts training to unleash sunlight with punches (just go with it) and goes on a crusade to take out Dio. Unfortunately, that son of a bitch simply won't stay down and eventually Johnny must sacrifice his own life in manly fashion to save his wife and unborn child.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to come right out and say it, Dio is a SHIT excuse for a villain. There are many things that can make a great villain: complex motivations, based on a historical figure, or even being extremely evil in an interesting fashion that is fun and frightening to watch. Dio is a cliche bully archetype that gets turned into a vampire, then decides to take over the world because he wasn't already cliche enough. In a way, Dio does remind me of the villains from oldschool GAR anime like: the bullies in Genocyber that randomly decide to rape a homeless child, or the bully in Devilman who decides to butcher the class bunnies for no reason. However, those bullies were quickly and brutally dispatched because that kind of character isn't very interesting. They exist to piss off the audience and grant a cathartic revenge fantasy when they get killed. Dio just lingers on and on like a sulfurous fart that won't go away. Johnny JoJo is a gentlemen and a badass, but his character depth never goes beyond that. He doesn't have a strong internal struggle or ambiguous goals or anything that makes complex character. I know that isn't the point of JoJo, but a show aimed at older audiences should probably try to have SOME level of complexity unless the action is so awesome it doesn't matter. However, JoJo isn't a non-step action violence fest like Hellsing Ultimate. JoJo actually does take a LOT of time to focus on plot and characters, which is why it is disappointing that the plot isn't very good and the characters are paper thin archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a decent but certainly not masterful arc 1, we get to see the adventures of Johnny JoJo's grandson: Joey JoJo. Joey JoJo must go to Mexico to fight against the evil vampires that created the mystical mask from part 1. He teams up with the grandson of one his grandfather's old allies along with a surprisingly friendly Nazi dude named Rudol Von Stroheim. I guess the writer of JoJo meant to use the name \"Rudolph\" because \"Rudol\" isn't even a real German name. Rudol's catchphrase is German (insert whatever) is the best! Characters with goofy catchphrases can work like Korbowitz in Berserk or Armstrong in FMA, but I wasn't really feeling this one. Honestly I just found myself wishing this guy would be replaced with Captain Germany the manly werewolf from Hellsing. This second arc does have some pretty awesome action scenes including Joey JoJo punching the vampire leader into Outer fucking SPACE! However, the plot and characters still come WAY short of being called a masterpiece or anything approaching a masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is heavily stylized and admittedly does a good job creating the look and feel of anime from yesteryear. There are lots of still-shots to recreate the look of cheap animation from the days where anime had extremely limited budgets. There are plenty of \"action lines\" that the old anime had in abundance especially pre-1990. I think my favorite part of JoJo might actually be the art because it really does recapture and recreate what anime used to look like and now no longer even resembles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381Di8Cw0-I  A speech from the director of JoJo from  0:43 - 1:11\\n\\n\r\nDoes JoJo do a decent job capturing what old school anime used to look and feel like? Yeah, and that is why it isn't a bad show. Does being retro make it a masterpiece by default? Absolutely not. The story may not suffer from pointless \"tournament arcs\" like so many shonen anime, but the plot isn't honestly very good. Like the characters, the plot is very simplistic and doesn't exactly carry JoJo into the realms of truly great anime. The male characters are actually manly and don't resemble either Keitaro Urashima from Love Hina or Shinji Ikari from NGE, the 2 characters that basically convinced anime executives that Otaku identify more with Beta males and completely neutered anime. However, JoJo's mediocre action and old school animation doesn't quite make up for its simplistic and overall  lackluster story and characters. At the end of the day, JoJo 2012 is a good anime, but is JUST a good anime. It doesn't nearly deserve the ratings it has received on MAL, or the praise it receives on 4chan. I WOULD recommend it to younger viewers who want to see what old anime was like, but I caution against the kind of blind praise that has already made this anime absurdly overrated.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my favorite series ever, and it finally got a real weekly anime adaptation after 25 years\u2014the \u201894 and \u201800 OVAs and the Phantom Blood movie, which never saw DVD/home video release do not count\u2014there is definitely some bias in this review. That said, there\u2019s a reason I still didn\u2019t give it a perfect score, and it\u2019s because I\u2019m still trying to keep a hint of objectivity in here.\r\nArt - 8/10\r\nI suppose I\u2019ll start off with how it adapted the source material. Unlike the OVAs and Phantom Blood movie, there were no cuts in content, and it actually adapted parts 1 and 2 ofthe manga: Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. The studio, David Production, did what I would consider a masterful job in terms of bringing out Araki Hirohiko\u2019s style into the manga. He is an artist, and you can see his art evolve throughout the long-running JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure franchise. DP hired multiple art directors and tried to incorporate the different faces and builds in body throughout the series. Also, because there is no such thing as \u201ccanon\u201d colors for characters, DP, in an unexpected but very innovative manner, used their poor budget to their advantage\u2014by changing color schemes and using colorful abstract backgrounds during monologues and still-frames. I\u2019ll give the art by itself a 10/10, even though sometimes Jonathan and Joseph, the titular JoJos in this series, suffer from Gorilla Face Syndrome, since the BD/DVDs are doing a great job of fixing it.\\n\\n\r\nOn still-frames, this is one of TWO flaws I found throughout the whole series. DP was contracted by Warner Bros. and they were given a pretty weak budget to work with. As a result, some might say that there are lots of times where this show is more of a \u201clive-manga\u201d or stream of the manga. The \u201canimated\u201d SFX from the source material, plentiful still-frames, and lack of actual animation at times are what add to this idea. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, it\u2019s not like every episode is a slideshow; however, there are DEFINITELY times when it feels that way\u2014I\u2019m looking at you, episode 16. Honestly, I feel like DP made it up to us with some episodes that were battle-heavy, like episode 20 and most definitely the final 3 or so episodes. Especially the last one. For this I will have to give the animation itself a 7/10. The distinct art style and use of colors  boost it up to an 8 for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSo-no Chi no Sa-da-me, JOOOOOOOOO~JO! There are two opening themes, JOJO~Sono Chi no Sadame~ by Hiroaki \u201cTOMMY\u201d Tominaga , and BLOODY STREAM by Coda. Both were tailored for their respective Part in JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, in both lyrics, atmosphere, and animation itself\u2014we actually get some pretty good CG depicting events in Parts 1 and 2. They were extremely catchy, and I never skipped them. The ending theme was Roundabout by progressive rock band YES, which actually came out in the 70s\u2014and influenced the original manga! and I applaud DP for that choice. The song\u2019s lyrics fit extremely well and it is actually one of Araki Hirohiko\u2019s favorite bands! Also, because it is an 8 minute song, they used different snippets, some soft, some more intense, depending on what kind of note the episode ended on. That was genius and definitely made the watching experience better. If it were up to the OP and ED alone I'd give the sound a 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual soundtrack, because of the difference in atmosphere between Parts 1 and 2, or at least I assume it\u2019s for that reason, DP hired two composers and gave us two soundtracks per part. Phantom Blood was mostly orchestral, very fitting with the late Victorian feel we get when we think of England in the 1880s. It fit extremely well and I applaud Matsuo Hayato for his beautiful soundtrack. Part 2, being much more dynamic and quite literally \u201call over the place\u201d, has Iwasaki Taku, who worked with his friends Lotus Juice. The soundtrack he made has soft, orchestral pieces and, well, everything. He has rap/hip-hop, rock, metal, DUBSTEP, and even flutes and drums that bring a middle-eastern feel. Personally, I thought the dubstep was actually very good and tamer than most, and that it fit well the middle-eastern sounds he composed for with the Pillar Men, the main antagonists of Part 2. The sound direction, however, was not as amazing. Iwasaki Taku complained himself, over Twitter, that his songs were not being used correctly, and, after paying close attention to episodes 22 and 23, I can\u2019t say I disagree. David Productions flubbed it when it came to transitioning the music and providing an appropriate atmosphere with the songs in those two episodes. For that reason, although the music itself was superb, I will have to give it an 8 total.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nStory is pretty simple, to say the least. The original story came out in 1987, in Shueisha\u2019s Weekly Shonen Jump. Phantom Blood can be pretty much summed up as Castlevania with Hokuto no Ken elements, which shouldn\u2019t be seen as bad in any way. Araki Hirohiko wanted to make a solid base so that he could evolve his work throughout time, and I think he did a pretty good job, taking in the work of contemporaries around him. The first part is hot-blooded, fast-paced, and the definition of \u201ccamp\u201d. Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando are probably the most one-dimensional characters you will ever find, but it is because they were so static, they polarized each other and made the fight between them so interesting. Dio Part 1's main antagonist, from the first episode, is depicted to us as the very definition of EVIL at the age of 12! Although the story is simple, the characters are definitely what make the sure. In Battle Tendency, the story takes a more adventurous route and we see our new JoJo, Joseph Joestar, go from New York, to Mexico, to Italy, to Sweden, and it\u2019s amazing. The main antagonists of this part are a powerful trio of \u201cPillar Men\u201d called Wham, ACDC, and Cars, responsible for the creation of the stone mask that set the events in Part 1. The continuity is great and you definitely feel time passing as you watch the series, characters like Speedwagon and Erina are shown old, and with every major timeskip you see differences in character design. Story, when it boils down to it, just has to be interesting. I was definitely interested in the stories for Parts 1 and 2 of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. They were simple, straight, and to the point, which made it possible to expand more on the character dynamics, arguably the strongest part of this series. There were no long and obnoxious training arcs, the fights are NOT dragged out\u2014probably the most common flaw in shonen battle series\u2014and if there are cliches, they are exaggerated to their extremes. This series does not take itself that seriously, and when it does, you can bet that you\u2019ll be on the edge of your seat. Story gets a 9/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters. Araki sure knows how to get you attached to characters. And then rip them away from you. There are definitely deaths in this series and they are dramatic and will definitely tug at your heart. Also, the voice actors are passionate and work admirably together. Takehito Koyasu, with his smooth, deep voice will send chills down your spine whenever Dio is formulating a plot or mocking JoJo. Okitsu Kazuyuki may be a newbie, unlike the slew of veterans in the rest of the cast, but he makes Jonathan Joestar so damn LIKABLE with his passionate screams, calm reassurance, and definitely makes the heart of gold in this character shine brightly. Sugita Tomokazu, probably best known for his characteristic shonen gag voice as Gintoki (Gintama) and serious/apathetic voice as Kyon (Haruhi Suzumiya series), makes a perfect Joseph Joestar, because Joseph embodies the ideal shonen protagonist\u2014smart, strong, funny, and extremely expressive. Basically, where the animation fell short, I believe that the voice actors definitely picked up the slack. Everyone has fun, because this is supposed to be a fun series. I love it. Characters get 5/5 from me. Both as they were written and how they were acted, you can definitely feel the chemistry between all the voices and that made it way more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. I keep on mentioning this when I score each aspect of the show for this review. Ultimately, when you watch an anime, or any show, movie, etc; you do so because you want to enjoy and be entertained. I can almost guarantee that if you go and watch this show with a blank slate and just a pure, unadulterated desire to be entertained, you will not come out disappointed. Just keep in mind that JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure is a series that is 25 years in the making, and this is but the beginning. It is without a doubt my favorite manga series, and this long-awaited anime adaption gives it the justice that it deserves. If you watch it, and enjoy it, like I said you probably will, then I implore to take up the manga. You can skip right to Part 3, the most popular arc in the franchise, but I recommend reading from the beginning, you\u2019ll pick out some tiny things left out that couldn\u2019t be conveyed through the anime, and you\u2019ll see the evolution of Araki Hirohiko\u2019s art throughout the ages.\\n\\n\r\nBut first, if you watch the anime, I recommend Muda Muda Muda Subs  [MMM] subs or CommieSubs [Commie]. They are the most accurate subs and if you prefer a better script, go with MMM, if you want better typesetting and subtitled SFX, go with Commie. Personally, I used MMM because they are a group that got together solely for this series, released in a timely schedule with accurate subs, took advice/criticism well, and also have better encoding. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that after this review some of you watch this show and develop the same love I have for it!",

            "content": "The keyword \"Bizarre\" in it's title is more then appropriate.\r\nAnd considering the many details the show has it's difficult to find a point to start talking about it to explain everything, but I'm going to give an attempt.\r\nThe First thing to address is probably the story and the storytelling of JoJo.\r\nwhere it basically does everything wrong in such a way that it becomes hysterical to watch and not to mention the big layer of 80's cheese that covers it all.\r\nJoJo tells it's story through the worst way possible \"exposition\". and not just a little bit. The characters will explain literally EVERYTHING that is happening infront of you, and it's not just done in your typical anime fashion. No, Every Character will explain things as if they are pooping out the biggest turd of their life that was been clogging their bowels for weeks. making it hysterical to hear them do so. Jojo's story itself is very simplistic in each arc. protagonist faces an evil that is bent on world domination. and that's about it. however This is the first series I've ever seen that has multiple shifting protagonists. without spoiling to much, I can say that each story arc headlines the offspring of the previous protagonist. which keeps the show very fresh, because of the shift in characters.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on the the art and animation. \\n\r\nOne of the things I absolutely loathe is talking during battle scene's.\\n\r\n(Looking at you Bleach!)\\n\r\nbecause it kills the pacing and tension of the combat. As I explained above Jojo likes to explain A LOT but they manage to keep the pace up despite lengthy dialogues and maintain intense visuals to keep you on your toes during the fights. The visuals are very clean, sharp, and use some very unique color pallets to address dire situations. suddenly placing characters in a complete green pallet against a dark/pink background.\\n\r\nThe animation to be fair is very limited and makes use of clever tricks to make a \"less is more\" kind of effect. flashy backgrounds, shaky cam, etc. which works very well for shows like this to maintain the high detail of characters, yet it makes the fights less dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music is phenomenal, very catchy and colorful, which matches the overall feel for the show. and a lot of different styles come to play, jazz, rock, even dub step. And choosing Roundabout by Yes as a title track!? is to me a strange choice but it works.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair the Characters in the show come across rather weak.\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, because of the shifting protagonists we're also time skipping every arc. which only allows 1 or 2 characters from the previous arc to reappear. this makes it very hard to latch on to a character because the time spent with them is so limited. and the expositional nature of the series also pushes you away from a character. we are not allowed to get under their skin and get a chance to feel like they feel. because they will address their emotions the moment they bother them.\\n\r\nThis is probably why the protagonist of the sequel, (Stardust Crusaders) Jotaro is one of the most popular protagonists of this series. because he hardly talks at all, he's mysterious, silent, you don't know everything about him and that is what makes you curious about a character. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, in overall the show was still an enjoyable ride, the combat scene's are every enjoyable and varied, the character designs are incredibly flamboyant and unique. it's all around 80's cheesy fun. that deserves a decent 7. \\n",

            "content": "First, a premise: I am NOT a Jojo fan from any previous series, nor I ever read the manga. When I approached this new anime, I did it only out of advice from an online friend, knowing that Jojo's Bizarre Adventure was... kind of a milestone and a very famous manga? Really, that's it. I had no idea what was expecting me. Which actually made it all the more enjoyable.\r\nNow, TO THE REVIEWMOBILE!\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story so far, if not complex or especially well written, is fun, thrilling, and chock-full of action and awesomeness. The first impression I got from Jojo's Bizzare Adventure was that thiswas going to be a completely over-the-top experience. No subtle psychological games here. This is all about big brawny men facing each other in large-hamming contests not less grand than their mano-a-mano fights. The premise quickly gets so outrageous that it can only be fun - as long as it doesn't take itself too seriously, which luckily is not a mistake this adaptation makes. To sum it up, this is the kind of plot that I could expect Charles Dickens to write after he got stoned on some heavy stuff and watched Hokuto no Ken, Hellsing and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, AT THE SAME TIME. Make of that whatever you want to.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing short of awesome to me. The colour are straight out of some hippie's acid trip. It's a compliment, actually! They're gorgeous and out of this world, giving an unreal feeling to the entire anime. The graphic representation of sounds makes this anime into some sort of moving comic. The animation in itself is not extra smooth, but I feel like this is not really important here. The only thing that really annoys me is the censorship, but that's not the animators' fault. The OP, on the other hand, must be the most amazing one in YEARS.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nForget the soundtrack, which is still excellent. When you have a great rock song like \"Roundabout\" (by English band YES, no less) for an anime's ED, you know you're dealing with people who has real taste. The song wins the prize for best anime OST this year alone, hands down.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the fun really lies. Jojo is a World of Ham where every. Single. Character. Is out there to chew the scenery in unbelievable ways. The villain is the most... villainous I've seen as of late. Even secondary characters pull off outrageous, ludicrous stunts, both in action scenes but more often in dialogues. Everyone will just scream all the time in the most hot-blooded possible way. It sounds ludicrous? It is. But it's so exaggerated that it works perfectly! Again, the magic element is that the anime doesn't take itself seriously. It's aware of the ridiculous levels of testosterone that are flying around and does nothing to tone them down, with everyone screaming at the top of their lungs in an almost Kamina-esque way. As a result, all main characters and a good deal of the secondary ones pass through as a single troupe of uncomparable badasses; and whenever someone loses a fight, it's only because someone managed to top his badassery with EVEN MORE badassery. And Dio Brando, is the most badass of them all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't give less than a 10 to the enjoyment of this series. To me, every episode is 25 minutes of hysterical, orgasmic fun. It just boils down to that: if you like people acting outrageously, exaggerate exclamations, fights to the last broken bone and the last drop of blood, martial arts and supernatural powers in an unlikely setting, all finely crafted and delivered in an ultra-dense form, this anime is for you. If you don't, well, why do you watch anime?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nA must watch, and possibly the best show of this season!",

            "content": "It's time to take a trip back to the 1800s, an age of time when the Napoleonic era and the rise of many colonies took place among various empires. History isn't easy to trace with certain origins but Jojo's Bizarre Adventure has its origins traced back with its original series. The fantastic journey finally begins! Yup, it's here and and this series suddenly is one hell of an anime that will not only bring some nostologia but excitement to you. Join Jojo Joestar and his many bizarre adventures as he embarges on a journey and learn about the wonders of the world.\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure (2012)is a reboot in the title of the same name based on a collection of manga written by Hirohiko Araki. He has also collaborated in other works but Jojo is his most famous presentation. The series picks up its way from the 19th century focused on Jojo Joestar and...his bizarre adventures as he fights equally bizarre adversaries. \\n\\n\r\nI have not read or seen the original series but this reboot has made a strong impression on me. The premise of the series is based the Joestar family. He is the titular character and judging by the title, the adventures are based on his experiences. To me, I consider this series to be a classic, nostalgic, and exhilarating tale. It is nostalgic because the period of time the series takes place. Think about it: the 19th century. It's a time when technology is nothing compared to what we have today. Everything is realistic, artistic, and presented in a natural form. This setup is quite lucid and easy to understand with even new viewers to anime. Hell, if I could understand it, anyone probably can.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off well and immediately wastes no time getting to the drama. In fact, we are already introduced some intense rivalry between Jonathan Joestar (Jojo) and Dio. It gets to the point and doesn't push itself to make any surprises. Well, I for one was surprised by how well the series executed its starting points and made a strong impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, viewers can clearly see that Jonathan Joestar (Jojo) is a nobleman with a heart of gold and cares others above his well-being. This is proved through his actions, words, and his way of helping out others. He is also seen as a tough fellow who doesn't let anyone push him around, especially Dio. This clearly sets up the rivalry between Jojo and Dio as the two seems to be on the opposite side of things. We already know that Jojo is a noble man. However, Dio is far from that as viewers can see him as a selfish, impure, and ill-mannered individual. His behavior, dialogue, and actions makes him a dangerous adversary as he not only has the physical prowess but aptitude and brilliance to match his capacity. This combination makes the rivalry that more exciting. To add onto to the drama, we also have a love interest. Unfortunately, events becomes inevitable as a seemingly potential romance is ruined by Dio. Talk about being a spoiled brat. It is quite intense to watch the drama between the duo especially when we see the clear gap between the the two. It's almost like David vs. Goliath as Jojo plays the role of the underdog.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the rivalry, there also exists a mysterious object that can seemingly turn the tide. It is a mysterious mask that seems to have ancient powers. These powers manifests by the spills of blood which leads to devastating results. It's definitely fun and exciting to see how far the rivalry will take now given that lives are also at stake.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on this mysterious object and among other artifacts later on. In fact, the story itself is actually divided into two separate arcs that follows a different generations of Jojo Joestar. The first arc known as Phantom Blood details on the rivalry between the duo. The second arc marks a glorious adventure starring Joseph Joestar (a descendent from the previous storyline) along with a new friend. Together, they embark on an adventure like never before taking on adversaries, improving themselves, and learning about the world and its wonders.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the story, I found both arcs presented quite well. The first arc, also known as Phantom Blood, starts off in an explosive and dramatic action detailing the intense rivalry between Jojo and Dio. On the other hand, the second arc (known as Battle Tendency) follows on a more adventurous tale in contrast to Phantom Blood. We meet the next descendent of the Jojo generation. He meets Caesar and although their relationship starts off like oil and water, over time, the duo gains mutual respect for one and the other. Unfortunately though, there is more conflict than just that as a trio of powerful antagonists are introduced in the latter half. This threat puts Jojo and Caesar in jeopardy and forces them to train themselves like never before. Ultimately, the two arcs are separate entities but are quite an entertaining watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I probably haven't touched much on the topic of this as much as I should have been but perhaps the characters of the series are the most interesting aspects that connects the show together. Jojo is the dynamic titular character of the series which follows a generation pattern. I've already talked about the first generation but both Jonathan and Joseph Joestar shares many aspects in terms of personality. Both characters are fiercely loyal, passionate, courageous, loving, and always looks after other people's well-being above their own. Although lacking in depth initution or acumen, they both are often able to come up with strategies that catches their adversaries off on guard. In particular, it is their determination to protect what they hold dear that pushes them to be their best. \\n\\n\r\nLet's not get too attached though because the Jojo franchise also offers many other fascinating characters from its collection. Previous characters such as Erina and Speedweagon makes their returns to provide valuable assistance. More importantly though are the new characters that really makes this show shine. We have Caesar who viewers may see as a polar opposite of Joseph Joestar. Caesar is a man that is confident, casual, and often likes to hang around the ladies. In sharp contrast, he is a man that Jojo loathes at first. Yet later on, we can see that they get along quite well and even risks lives for one and the other. On a more mature side, there is also Lisa Lisa, a deadly beauty to the eye who provides invaluable aid to Jojo and Caesar. Like most battle shounens, there are the antagonists. In the first arc, there's Dio. The second half introduces a trio of antagonists known as the Pillar Men. Their elemental powers pushes the duo of Jojo and Caesar over the edge and presents an intense challenge like they never faced before. It's also humorous to watch some of their random gags sometimes even if they are randomly peculiar; i.e. Wham's tendency to reflexively attack others when someone steps on his shadow, AC/DC's crying, and Cars' passion to protect living things (other than humans of course).\\n\\n\r\nThe action of the series is ridiculous. However, I mean 'ridiculous' in a good way because the over exaggerated way it is being portrayed. Every attack is spoken directly with dialogue and a stamp of dynamic that is humorous, entertaining, delightful, and grabs interest to viewers. Who wants to just watch characters shouting resolves like \u201cI'm going to save you, I swear!\u201d all the time? In this series, the characters presents their attacks in an enthralling way that stimulates attention while often making jokes about the dialogues themselves. Some of the characters' names are parodies as well such as AC/DC that is based off the Australia band of the same name. Most of the male characters also are manly with their flexed biceps and strong attitudes. It contrasts some of the shows I've seen and presented in a more old school way. The female characters in the show are also well portrayed with their maturity rather than being a stubborn, jealous, or tsundere as of many today's anime series. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, the series has a edgy way of production. The artwork might not be what people see nowadays. In fact, it's more classic, nostalgic, and holds that old 1900's style. David Production (Level E, Inu x Boku SS, Dogs: Bullets & Carnage) handles the artwork and they did a beautifully good job in my opinion. It protrays the old 1800s well with the old school vehicles, Victorian style architectures, and some of the ancient artifacts. It's like going back in time and relieving those old school memories.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is also well performed. The first and second OP songs are very well orchestrated that is classic to the ears. Hell, I could set \"BLOODY STREAM\" by Coda on repeat all night long. It's not only entertaining to watch but also artistic with those manly poses from the main characters. Its definite old school theme sticks well is adapted. Likely wise, the ED song produces a similar feeling of that nostologia of the 1800's where adventures and collecting treasures are a source of many people's inspirations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series gets a score of \u201c9\u201d from me. It has gar characters, that old school feeling, and very entertaining dialogues. It doesn't force itself either because all of them are spoken with humor as opposed for a purpose. The characters are appealing with their personalities and their interactions. From what I see, they are natural and falls in the case of a glorious presentation. The nostalgic music and artwork also gives fresh breath of cool air. No random fan service, no confusing plot twists, no cheap humor, no regrets. This series is definitely one hell of an adventure and worth your time.",

            "content": "This adaptation of JoJo covers Part 1: Phantom Blood & Part 2:Battle Tendency. Both parts are unique 80's horror shonen filled with MANLINESS! The following will be split into two reviews per part below. The reason for this is that every JoJo part should NOT be skipped as each have their own tone. Examples include: Phantom Blood being a classical vampire hunter story while Battle Tendency feels very much like an Indiana Jones film. However, both animes are filled with stylish colors, great characters & outstanding music!!\r\nPART 1: PHANTOM BLOOD (EPS 1-9)\r\nThe beginning of JoJo seems a bit rough at first but manages to givethe outline for its primary themes of the series. Taking place in the late 1880's in England, we are introduced to the Joestar family & the Brando Family. The story starts to move when Dio Brando is adopted into the Joestar family as Dio is an ambitious jerk who wishes to rob the family of its fortune & would resort to murder. \\n\\n\r\nJonathan Joestar is our JoJo for the series whose life changes once Dio discovers the stone mask using it to make himself a vampire. The rest of the series involves Jonathan learning the Ripple martial art to battle against Dio & his vampire army & going on an adventure involving zombies, Jack The Ripper, martial artists, bizarre super powers, over the top dialogue & manly tears.\\n\\n\r\nBeing inspired by Fist Of The North Star & possibly Bram Stroker's Dracula, Phantom Blood is a blend of manly characters & horror elements making it a unique short tale. To some people, Jonathan comes off a rather too \"good hearted\", however having experiencing Fist Of The North Star (specifically The Shin Arc chapters 1-10/episodes 1-22) the \"corny moments\" come off as very tragic to me.\\n\\n\r\nPart 1 feels more like a classical tale of vampire hunters especially with its location & time period as we have normal humans battling against the forces of darkness. This is further aided with its music as it has the feel of an epic tale & often resorts to something akin to immediate music.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the concepts of Stands & its much later \"Bizarre\" quality weren't developed yet, this story almost works as a stand alone with its tragic finale giving much highlight to fans of Manly series such as Sakigake Otokojuku, Riki-Oh, Cyber Blue, Kongo Bancho & Fist Of The North Star respectively. \\n\\n\r\nPhantom Blood may not be the best part of JoJo but serves as a teaser of what the series can become as it expresses the original themes Hirohiko Araki thought of: The struggle of humanity, the temptation of evil, the strive for perfection & the importance of family. \\n\\n\r\nPART 2: BATTLE TENDENCY (EPS 10-26)\\n\\n\r\n50 years after the events of Phantom Blood, Joseph Joestar makes his debut as the grandson of Jonathan Joestar. The story begins once Straights uses the stone mask battling Joseph who then later encounters The Wermacht & the series villains; The Pillar Men who created The Stone Masks of Part 1.\\n\\n\r\nThis story continues the original message of the importance of family as history repeats itself with the descendants of The Joestars & The Zeppelis having to face Aztec Vampires. Battle Tendency succeeds as a sequel as it vastly improves The Ripple technique along with having 3 major enemies this time around. Much like part 1, this sequel contains over the top dialogue, manly battles, creative abilities & flourishes more into comedy while still retaining its signature horror.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph Joestar is vastly different from his grandfather, as he comes off as more rebellious & comedic which more fans seem to like as a leading JoJo. Other differences in Part 2 is being more expressive in flamboyancy in ways serving as a contrast to the more masculine tone of part 1. This is aided by its opening & villains The Pillarmen as the fabulous colors pay homage to Araki's coloring style & foreshadows its future in Part 5. While it may deter to some viewers, this part does retain its masculine audience as the characters continue to carry various warrior ideologies. The tone for this series is more adventurous as it contains more locations than the 1st series as well as a bigger roster of leading characters. Aiding these characters are various theme music used in this anime as it ranges from 90's rap, upbeat pop, german lyrics, dubstep, electro, rock, classical & even Italian singing. Note the anime uses mostly instrumental tracks while the OST contain lyrics within their songs.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2 is about breaking The Joestar family curse & the passing of lineage as it displays how men learn to accept their pasts & discover the value of the next generation. Most of the content in Battle Tendency is greatly appreciated due to the tragic events that occurred in part 1 as it helps the viewer see the progress of not just a family but the author's writing style. \\n\\n\r\nLook forward to Part 3 Stardust Crusaders as it focuses more on horror & introduces its iconic STANDS creating the structure of the following parts of JoJo.",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure isn't just about silly glitz and glamour that some people seem to assume upon viewing. When watching it, \r\nIt almost gave me that first impression, but to my curiosity and interest it became something more than just this being a generic show.\r\nIt is an undeniably fun series first of all. \r\nSecondly, it is a shounen that is unique and different to a hell of a lot of shounen animes out there today that I feel bring an interesting blend of Dark comical yet a wacky and serious tone to viewing and the thing I love the most about this show is thatits able to shift really well in between those elements where other shows seemingly get lost within those transition and after just give up its own originality of what it was and what it wanted it to be in the process. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a show that never loses its own identity or what its trying to be which is why its one of my favourite animes\\n\r\nIts like to entertain in style which is why I appreciate this a lot.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga is something ongoing from this point on in its entirety to the story stretching back to 1986 when other well known shows like Hokuto no ken, Dragon ball, Sakigake!! Otokojuku etc so yeah it goes back a long time to the grand daddies of the shounen genres of the past.\\n\\n\r\nAs I give my review of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) without spoilers please be aware that this anime only covers the events of 2 timeline within the story first being\\n\r\nPart 1 Phantom Blood containing episodes from 1 - 9 and Part 2 Battle Tendency containing episodes from 10 - 26 showing the main characters each being a member of the Joestar family in different timelines along with a different story from the manga as you see the family tree starts to keep going and going embracing a previous heritage notion from their own.\\n\\n\r\nNow to get a look into about the main characters\\n\\n\r\nwe begin our focus on the life of the very first Joestar of the bloodline and of course in the story of Part 1 in the year of 1887.\\n\\n\r\nJohnathan Joestar: The main protagonist of part 1 hes a decent physically strong british nobleman as well being a Manly son of a gun, he is always thinking positive about those around him and is very polite, he seems like an ordinary gentleman.\\n\r\nBut he has a dark cloud looming around him in the form of his step brother Dio who turns his world upside down and for the most part are always against one another forming a rocky yet typical rivalry between the 2 that later on becomes the very battle between good versus evil where johnathan has to match his demonic and vastly cunning step brother by learning about a power source known as \\n\r\nThe ripple which allows him to use a mystical ancient martial art that mixes in naturalistic elements to combat against Dio's power \\n\r\nand speaking of Dio..\\n\\n\r\nDio Brando: The main antagonist of part 1 (as well as a my favourite character) He is not only a sinister human being at heart but also has a deep seeded hate towards his step brother Jonathan due to his social standing at the beginning of his childhood being raised by a poor Englishmen Dario Brando with a deceitful, uncaring personality who then became Dio's father after finding him in a wreckage of a carriage crash that had involve the father and mother of Jonathan. \\n\r\nDario raises Dio due to the circumstance that he did so only to gain profit off the joestar of some of their possessions resounding into a horrible upbringing of Dio in his childhood that grew with a passion to hate step father Dario and than later turns his attention to becoming part of the joestar family and tearing them apart from the inside.\\n\r\nDio is not only a constant threat to the joestar family in the series and within the manga itself but that he also later on is possessed by a strange stone mask that resides in the joestar's household that he later takes giving him deadly mysterious powers of a vampire.\\n\r\nOn top of that he has an unquenchable appetite for being ambitious and dangerous. what I like is how crafty his personality seems to be, he might seem like a stereotypical villain but he's someone I feel keeps part 1 very engaging to watch along with other characters in part 1 that also play a major key role for Johnathan Joestar and Dio Brando's progression and development.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2 Battle Tendency is the time skip way after the events that took place 50 years ago. The year is 1938 around the era of World War 2 we now are introduced to the other main character of the story at this time \\n\\n\r\nJoseph Joestar: He is the grandson of Jonathan Joestar, A very entertaining, funny and charming character to say the least, his mission becomes more similar to his grandfather where his actions take root to put a stop to the evil curse of the stone mask's own power that now has its creators resurrected to threaten all of humanity they are known as the pillar men, the 3 pillar men that go by the name of Esidisi (ACDC), Wamuu (Wham) and their Leader Cars (kars), they are pretty much the antagonists at this point of the story and are very dedicated and dangerous threat to anyone that tries to stop them which make the trio powerful villains also in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters are really well done in this anime that becomes to the point where it feels so natural with a lot of the characters they have their strengths and weakness through the show as you see. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while the story and characters are engaging they are by no means picture perfect and what I mean by that is the way certain character's aspiration and motives sometimes look like they are trying too hard to amuse us the viewers, which might seem like the case or so? they either are represented just purposefully that way because the writing tries to portray the characters to be so in this manner of being either on the outrageous end of the spectrum or just trying to be forcefully entertaining in or both?  \\n\r\nand for me with some scenarios in the anime it doesn't seem that well balanced on those terms, which might indicate some certain scenes of being unbalanced due to its stylistic nature here and there in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nIt could also feel like a hit or miss to others while experiencing this since at times they can be some annoying sarcasms and while I do applaud them trying to explore these facets of the characters, it kinda gives me those in between moods of ''should I be taking this seriously or not?''\\n\\n\r\nWhen I really want to know and understand about something in the series or just to decipher what certain characters have mentioned it leaves out certain explanation for logical understanding on some of the mad stuff that are going on in this anime that you will see while watching it which might not make a lot of sense, it is kinda hard to unravel some things that happen within those moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nicely handled by the studio behind this and for the most part its pretty colourful along with the art style of MANime!!\ufeff that shows it clear as day which can be said the same of the manga that it carries itself from.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is clearly based of western music that is heard in the Opening and the Closings and it fits brilliantly which gives me that charismatic impression that Hirohiko Araki gets from his influence on these types of music artist and scores and funny enough its even shows with the names of the characters having an inspiration from these certain music artist or other establishments.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also dramatically over the top which adds to the theme\\n\r\nthat JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has this in abundance of manly troupes the anime goes along with, I really loved Koyasu Takehito performance as Dio.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is enjoyable to say the least and feels really dynamic and worth your time if you want to be entertained in some ways depending on your preference of course and for me its no secret that its one of my favourite of all time simply put it deserves an overall score of 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "For veteran viewers that's been around long enough to notice it, the manly man protagonist has become something of a dying breed. A relic of anime's past that has been dwindling away year after year with no signs of slowing down. Many saw the change as a product of the times. Something that should simply be accepted as a predestined occurrence. The manly man was no longer marketable. Their role as a protagonist was brought to retirement, reduced to being a part of the growing collection of side character archetypes, stockpiled for future use as high school delinquents and muscle-bound uncles with far too muchgusto. \\n\r\nSure, we've seen a few cases of deviance with shows like Kaiji, Cromartie High School, and to a lesser degree, Gurren Lagann, but there was never truly something that represented the MANLY MAN in its purest form..., until 2012. Almost like divine providence, or an act of public backlash, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure announced its TV debut. An anime that stood as an embodiment of this dying breed, completely packaged with macho-man poses, testosterone-fueled rants, and a whole lot of physical smack-downs. GAR resurrected in all its glory!\\n\\n\r\nSelf-aware in execution and oozing with machismo, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is an unapologetic slug-fest that marches to the beat of its own drum. It doesn't waste its time trying to pander to modern day expectations but simply demands the viewer to accept it for what it is. It's a bully to the uninitiated but a celebratory return to those still nostalgic for the beef heads of 80-90s action-hero Americana. \\n\\n\r\nIn an industry that has become pro beta-male for over a decade, JoJo requires you to forget all common notions built up during that time period. It requires you to draw back to an era where chivalry wasn't there to simply admire your enemy but to swiftly kick their asses as well. To a time where protagonists weren't written to be afraid of a woman's touch, but fully embraced it. A time where conflict and friendships alike were solved over the neanderthal \"punch first, ask questions later\" logic; bonds formed by fists just as quickly as they end them. It's MANLY MAN shit! Stupid, illogical, exaggerated, hammy, so heterosexual that it borderlines on homoerotic..., but still AWESOME MANLY MAN SHIT! \\n\\n\r\nTo help facilitate this testosterone-driven nonsense, we're introduced to the Joestar family.\\n\\n\r\nFrom one generation to the next, the Joestars' battle against the supernatural has been a long and arduous one. The 1st arc, consisting of episode 1-9, serves as our jumping off point for this journey to come. Because this arc has been set aside to perform all the necessary world-building required for the series, it could feel slow for those expecting all the crazy fights and epic poses that the internet has turned into full-time memes at this point. And while we certainly do get a serving of that early on, the focus for these 9-episodes are far tamer than what the rest of the series would eventually come to offer. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where we're first introduced to the Joestars and Brandos, two families with faiths intertwined by a red thread of ill-faith and bad-blood. Through a series of unfortunate events, the son of the Brando family, Dio, finds himself abducted into the Joestar family after his father dies of an unknown illness. It doesn't take long before the son of the Joestars, Jonathan, and Dio to develop a bitter rivalry; one that went from petty squabbles to a full-fledged vendetta after Dio's devilish schemes are unveiled.\\n\\n\r\nThrough that turmoil, we are introduced to the MacGuffin that would go on to become the source of all conflict in the series, and many other follow-up installments yet to come. The object in question is an ancient mask. The wearer of this mask is granted the rebirth abilities and supernatural power of a vampire. And as I'm sure you've guessed by now, Dio gets his hands on this mask and makes quick use of it. And so begins the conflict that would last for generations. To stand a fighting chance against Dio and his newly gained powers, Jonathan came to learn of a mysterious force known as the Ripple technique. With both sides armed with their respective abilities, the only thing left is to kick some ass!\\n\\n\r\nThis 1st arc doesn't truly pay off until viewed in conjunction with the 2nd half of the series (episode 10-26). Taking place 50 years after the events that occurred in the 1st half, we're introduced to Joseph, the grandson of the Joestar lineage, a kid that's an arbitrator of jokes and a whole lot of ass whippings. While he found himself confronting the same problems as his British ancestors, his methods of dealing with them are far less aristocratic. This is where Jojo truly becomes JOJO, as we're thrown into an adrenaline-driven narrative that takes the inklings of manliness only hinted at in the 1st half and amplifies it to insurmountable heights. With more battles, more poses, more manly moments, more epic face-offs, more white-knuckled encounters, and more bravado pumped into every scene; the 2nd half was pure awesomesauce! Action-packed and borderline nonsensical, for those only wanting a fix of GAR in their lives, look no further!\\n\\n\r\nBringing this work to life, David Production made sure that every frame was oozing with personality. One noteworthy example of this was how they manage to juxtapose flamboyancy with manliness in a way that felt domestic to the show. On paper, the thought of these two worlds intermixing would seem like a disaster, but with the right amount of care and effort, David Production proved that the integration of these two opposing elements was not only possible but worth the effort, as the end result was impressive to look at. It was like high-end fashion meet the robustness of Mad Max. As odd as that sounds, the self-awareness in which the creators treated the project made every bit of it easy to buy into.\\n\r\nThis was further exemplified with a comic-book inspired art-style that they choose to incorporate, which used a mixture of pop art and bold graphic designs. This mixture of gusto and sass also bled into the characters. Every random pose highlighted with gonzo wall-texts and neon-color splashed everywhere. Outfits that looked like the illegitimate offspring of steroids and glitter dust. This weird hybrid of husky-man GAR and metrosexuality is a style that will become synonymous with the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe music choice was also a mix-bag, ranging from new-school EDM, synth-pop, orchestral ballads, and old-school J-rock. There was never a dull moment with this constant rotation of musical styles. The soundtrack added an extra punch to a show that's already dripping with style. It's sensory overload in the best way possible. Another thing worth noting was the opening song, a style that's deep-rooted in the machismo crooning commonly found in the 80s and early 90s with a graphic visual style adopted from contemporary art. And as if all this greatness wasn't enough, we're even blessed with a 70s prog-rock classic for an ending, \"Roundabout\" by YES. In a way, the opening and ending themes were a great reflection of Jojo itself: old-school meet new-school. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's ultimately the secret ingredient that makes JoJo so beloved by many. It's a love-letter to the past in an envelope from today. \\n\\n\r\nA title that's full of style, charisma, and self-awareness, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure proves that you don't always need complexity to tell a compelling story, as long as you're fully committed and there's an undeniable passion behind it, even simple stories can become crowd-pleasers. And in that regard, JoJo was a success. It never tried to be more than what it was. It's an anime comfortable in its own skin. It just so happen that that \"skin\" is a muscle-bound brute with an odd obsession for fashion. If you're tired of seeing pushover beta-males and stories that take themselves way too seriously, then this title is for you. A title that has not only proven that GAR isn't a lost cause but also a missed part of the medium worth bringing back out of retirement.",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is popular for it's manga and I had no idea what to expect when picking up this anime. Manga is not my means of entertainment but the anime as it was presented to me intrigued me to watch it. It was recommended to me as a masterpiece, a must watch and as one of the best shounen with intelligent fights. So is it a masterpiece? To put it objectively, yes and no.Please evaluate the review after you have read it, thank you. Keep reading.\r\nFirst of all for those who have no idea what this is about let me clear this up foryou. It's about the rivalry between good and evil,mortal and immortal, between men of courage and those who succumbed to their fear of death and their mortality, those who find love and happiness in a family and those who believe happiness is in power and immortality. It's about men doing manly things and accepting their role and fate it is as gar as something can be. Sounds simple right? Well that's because it is. The story is in no way complex and one might say it's cliche and we have seen this before but the selling point of this show is it's over the top execution and exaggeration in everything it does. Characters who seem like they can't speak in a normal way and just yell all the time on top of their lungs, ridiculous over the top situations, exaggerated statements of obvious things(eg. sky is blue, he punched him, he is falling OMG!!! etc), ludicrous fight scenes where the mc's stop in the middle of the fight to take a great pose just to seem cool or say something awesome, over the top moments and unrealistic conclusions of fight scenes or storyline. Here arises a question of whether is this good or bad, is it enjoyable or not, does this fit the anime or falls flat on their faces? It does and it doesn't.Let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nThe story consists of two parts or more accurately of two arcs. The first nine episodes are the 1st arc and the remaining episodes are the 2nd arc. Each arc has different main male character, different villains and stories but they are nicely connected together and to the main premise of the story. There are two magic elements that make this whole over the top approach work. The first is the fact that this show doesn't take itself too seriously like ever. The second and most crucial part in my opinion is the pace in which the story is developed. This is where the problem in the first arc lies for me. It was so horrible that I actually wanted to drop the show but glad that didn't. In the first part the pace is so fast that it overwhelms you with it ridiculousness, exaggeration and unrealism. Character development and story progression feels rushed. The motives for some characters to become close friends with mc are questionable and unrealistic. The main villain is bad just to be bad at least some of his actions indicate this or they are just plain stupid and pointless not to mention that some of his motives are not believable. So much stuff is unexplained or seems ridiculous that it falls literally flat on your face. Some people might like this but this is actually the main reason why someone might drop this show not giving it a chance which it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that the second part comes and here is where the magic starts to happen.The pace slows down dramatically and becomes incredibly fitting to the show. The main character changes, the story gets a lot better and the villains are just incredible. The development and progression of the story and characters becomes perfect. Suddenly the intervals between the yelling, the over the top fights, the posing, the exaggerated claims, the ridiculous moments and the unrealistic elements fall in perfect equivalence and if before they were overwhelming now they start to entertain you. The enjoyment skyrockets. The dialogues are funny and even the statements of obvious facts start to be enjoyable.One last thing to mention about the story is that the fighting system is fairly simple although individual elements can be complex and on top of that some strategical thinking takes place in most of the battles fought.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack in this anime is top notch. From your typical action and tension scenes to your melodramatic moments ost's are in perfect synch and fit incredibly well to every scene. Voice actors are just insanely good and bring out the manliness and badassness of the characters in the right fashion not to mention how well they fit to every character with no exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is amazing.Bright and intense colors are very pleasing to the eye and they enhance the over the top effect of the anime awesomely well. The facial expressions are distinct and the surrounding backgrounds are well portrayed which accomplishes the atmosphere and the mood of every scene. The battle scenes are very well depicted although the details of the background are left out it's in no way at the expense of the enjoyment overall. The only flaw that could be noticed is that at some moments it felt like I was watching a series of still frames but other than that it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect where this show exceeds is it's characters. The writer knows how to create enjoyable and memorable characters. Mostly this is true in the second arc because the pace is what determines the development of the characters as well. That doesn't mean that we don't come across with likeable characters in the first part. The second part has the most perfect male lead ever. Masculinity level over 9000. He is funny,smart,strong,charming and generally a badass. Side characters are very likable and memorable as well and almost none of them is pointless to the story. Villains are well developed and have their own personalities and ethics, some of them are real warriors and men with a capital \"M\". You will definitely feel attached to some characters in a minor or a major way. They pose, they scream on top of their lungs, they have their own code and morals in life which they follow,they chase their goals and accept their fate like true warriors, they spout exaggerated claims and they are really enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment factor is over the roof. If you are like me than you might find the first 9 episodes horrible but I strongly recommend to stick with it until episode 11 and then decide if you want to drop this show or not. If you want an easy fun ride where real men embroil themselves in epic fights for their honor, pride, their code in life or to protect their loved ones and humanity and they do it in an exaggerated, over the top, ridiculous way than this show is for you. Stop everything you are doing and go watch this but leave your critical self out the door and don't expect realism in a show where its primal goal is to amuse its viewers. Although you will find your fair share of intelligence,drama,action and comedy. I would have scored this a 9 if it wasn't for the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\n*Every feedback is appreciated, thank you.*\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: MOST WILL NOT AGREE WITH ME. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE A BABY BECAUSE I DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINION, DON'T READ.\r\nLife occasionally gives you things that you don't understand. Sometimes its people, or school work, and sometimes, its why something is popular. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure was recommended to me by so many people who regarded it as one of the best series ever. Upon watching it, I realized that to enjoy the show, you must turn your brain off and just take it in. As such, I did, yet I still ask the question: WHY THE HELL IS THIS SERIES SO POPULAR!!!????????? That'san exaggeration of course, as I do understand the appeal of a show like this, but it certainly does baffle me to know that this show has so many deeply devoted fans who consider it their favorite anime. In my honest opinion, Jojo is one of the worst series I have ever seen so far, and I promise this isn't a troll and I know that I am in a minority.  Usually, I am a completionist who must finish every series I watch all the way through. I just couldn't do that with this one, and its the first series I ever dropped. Personally, I found every scenario really stupid, with dumb characters, and surprisingly good music. I'll do my best to explain why I hate this series so much and though I know most will disagree with me, at least try to understand where I am coming from. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation- My god does this anime look like shit. I get what they were going for: a very stylized, comic book style art style. I don't have a problem with that, and I feel that it could have added to the story. However, it just looks so unpolished. I give points for the interesting style and occasionally decent animation, but the art makes this anime look like it's from the early 2000's. Hell, I saw footage of the 1993 adaptation of Jojo and at some parts, it barely looks better. I will also say that character designs are very uninspired and I found many of them to look remarkably similar, but with some different colors on them. Overall, the art was pretty bad on this one, and the solid animation doesn't make up for it. \\n\\n\r\nStory- Art style doesn't prevent a story from being good. Like I said, I figured out to watch this show with my critical brain turned off, but here is what I noticed even without it. First, SO MANY PLOT CONVENIENCES!!! Occasionally they are fine, but I found most of the show's scenarios were that there was an item in the exact right place at the exact right time, or that a character was holding something that was never shown or alluded to. One of the worst examples was when fighting a monster weak to sunlight in part 2. Once the monster was lured outside, it just so happened to be exactly noon, and there was a well in the exact spot where the sun was shining brightest, which was used to reflect light to the monster on both sides. Even with no critical mind, I noticed that and it bothered me, and I can name plenty of other similar scenarios. Also, Part 1 was incredibly boring to me. The 7 year time skip from episode 1 to 2 was really stupid and we got no sense of what the characters involved went through. It was jarring. On top of that, scenarios that weren't plot conveniences, which were few and far between, were just too stupid to be entertaining, and too cringy to be funny. I know that they were trying to be \"bizarre\", but they took it way to far. It wasn't even stupid funny, just stupid. The premise was somewhat interesting with the idea of a multi-generational epic, and there were a few episodes that were actually kind of entertaining, but overall, the story was just really bad in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- I wish that the characters helped, but unfortunately, they don't. I'll name most of them. Jonothan Joestar was bland. The seven year time skip changed his personality totally and we got no idea of what happened during that time. He was supposed to be a gentleman, but he did some rather rude things to Dio (though he deserved them). He was supposed to be a weakling who can't win a fight, but he suddenly transformed to a monster who can win with a broken arm. All of that is just stupid, though he was entertaining sometimes. Dio was a decent villain, but only because he was so easy to hate. He had little motive, and was simply an asshole for no good reason. He also went from wanting money, to wanting to take over the world in literally one episode. I just found that jarring. Speedwagon was interesting, but my problem with him is that in less than an episode, he went from fighting Jojo, to becoming his best friend and biggest supporter. Thankfully, I was somewhat interested in his character. Zepelli was by far the most interesting character, but we didn't find out much about him at all. Joseph Joestar was mostly an annoying, arrogant brat whose presence on screen usually made me want to tear my eyes and ears out. Caesar was also annoying as fuck. Finally, Lisa Lisa was intriguing, but not enough for me to want to finish the show for her story. Overall, the characters were along a normal curve, with some being rather good, some being rather bad, and most being meh. \\n\\n\r\nSound- I will however, give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack for Jojo was actually really nice. It always fit the mood and added to the scenes (as much as it could). It was mostly epic fight songs, but that works for a series like this one. Also, there were some nice atmospheric songs that added to the mystery aspects of the show. Also of note, was the second OP, as it is absolutely fantastic and one of my personal favorites. The ED theme is also great, not only for it being a giant meme, but just for being a great revival of an awesome old song. Finally, I have to admit that sound effects were pretty nice. While none of it blew me away or anything, it was definitely very good. Jojo's sound is by far its best quality. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- As I said, I am usually a completionist, so when I drop a show, that means that I really don't like it. Needless to say, I did not get much enjoyment out of this show at all. Every episode was a drag to watch, and no matter how much I would pray for something to be entertaining, it rarely ever was, even with my brain turned off. It just wasn't interesting or fun enough for me to want to finish it to the end. I honestly can't force myself to watch the next 9 episodes because that would be torture for me. I did get some enjoyment out of certain parts, which is why I can't give a 1 there, but I really don't understand why people love this show so much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- I'm usually a pretty generous reviewer. The fact that I score anything below a five means its really bad to me. I just can't get myself to finish this show because I can find barely any redeeming factors. With brain on or off, I don't understand how this show could have such a huge following of deeply devoted followers. It honestly baffles me. I've probably pissed off a lot of people right now, so I won't say more because I like my life. All i'll say is that if you are reading this and haven't seen the show and are on the edge, and if you have seen my other reviews and have similar tastes, don't waste your time on this one. \\n\\n",

            "content": "If I had to describe JoJo's Bizarre Adventures with one word, that word would be, without a doubt, passion. A story of young and righteous men and their fight to secure a safe future for their families, friends, and ultimately, the world. A record of a fierce rivalry between the ultimate evil and a man who serves the side of justice, and the legacy they leave behind. A tale of fleeting romance, brotherly bonds, and, of course, hot blooded battles. This is the epitome of JoJo, one of the most unconventional, interesting, and captivating shows I have had the pleasure of watching thus far.\r\nJoJo's BizarreAdventures' 26 episodes are split into two arcs, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. Phantom Blood tells the story of Jonathan Joestar, better known as JoJo, heir to the wealthy Joestar family fortune, and his fated encounter with Dio Brando, the son of a lowly con man, and how one ancient stone mask forever changed the fates of not only JoJo and Dio, but those who would eventually follow in their footsteps. Battle Tendency follows the life of Joseph Joestar, Jonathan's grandson and also known as JoJo, and how his grandfather's legacy ultimately involves him in a struggle to save the world from certain doom. Through larger than life battles, passionate characters, and, for lack of a more appropriate word, bizarre situations, JoJo's unique definition of the word \"epic\" certainly makes this show entertaining and addicting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEven in the face of insane and unconventional battle scenes along with plot that was so over the top that it could have been considered silly, the aspect of JoJo that stood out the most, that was the most memorable, and that was the show's strongest selling point was its cast of characters, heroes and villains alike. Each important character has a unique personality along with their own strengths and weaknesses, and they all give you a good reason to either cheer for them or to absolutely hate their guts. You would be hard pressed to find another cast of characters that drew you to them quite like JoJo's cast of characters. \\n\\n\r\nJonathan Joestar epitomizes the image of a true hero. He fights for the honor of his family, radiates an aura of kindness and gentleness, and protects those who are powerless. While mild mannered, he fights with the tenacity of a true warrior, and never gives up as long as he draws breath. His grandson, Joseph Joestar, while not as good-willed and honest as his grandfather, still shows genuine empathy towards his loved ones and respect towards his enemies. A fighter who relies more on his quick wits and brilliant battle strategy creating abilities rather than overwhelming his opponents through feats of strength; he utilizes the weaknesses of his adversaries and manipulates them to his advantage.\\n\\n\r\nIt is rare these days to find a villain that truly embraces the meaning of evil, and one such villain that pulls it off excellently is Dio Brando. A man who will kill your dog because you angered him, steal the first kiss of the girl you're in love with, and simply physically beat you up from time to time can't be described with any other word other than evil. Treating the family that took him in after he is left penniless and alone in the world as a stepping stone to wealth and power, and taking every opportunity to trample upon JoJo's kindness and goodwill, he makes one believe that some people are simply born bad. A good villain should make your blood boil, send chills down your spine, or give you a sense of odd respect every time you see him, and Dio Brando is precisely the kind of man that will evoke all of the said reactions at the same time. The Pillar Men are the kind of villains that don't seem like evil incarnate, but their lack of empathy and desire to attain absolute power make them fine antagonists in their own right. I will refrain from describing them in greater detail due to spoilers, but they themselves will tell you exactly what kind of personalities they have; you can be sure of that.\\n\\n\r\nWatching JoJo was like reading an antique comic book from the turn of the century, both in art style and literal sense. The end of each episode made me immediately load the next episode, akin to eagerly turning the page of an action comic book to see what comes next. The age old sound effects of BAM!, or POW!, or ORAORAORA! (okay maybe not that last one), make the battle scenes much more entertaining, and I found my eyes glued to the screen for the whole 25 minutes of each episode. The story is fairly well written and fluid, and they take the time to explain any inconsistencies when they arise. While the action or story can become a bit overwhelming to the point where it seems silly, or ridiculous, or unnecessary, that is simply part of the experience of watching JoJo. When you take a show for what it is, you are then able to appreciate it more; JoJo is no different. \\n\\n\r\nThe art seems to be, as stated before, straight out of a vintage comic book. Bold lines, action sounds, and muscular men make up 90% of JoJo's art, with the occasional beautiful woman. The animation is quite graphic, and is not for the faint of heart. There are bloody battle scenes, grotesque zombies and vampires, along with a whole plethora of other strange and insane scenes. The soundtrack is another one of JoJo's strong points. The OP for both arcs are catchy and will stay with you for awhile; the ED is \"Roundabout\" from an English progressive band called Yes, and suits the show very well (there are many allusions to famous music bands and icons throughout the show). \\n\\n\r\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventures is not a show for everyone. If you're the more logical or rational type who dislikes anything over the top and/or unnecessary/pointless, JoJo won't be your cup of tea. However, it is definitely a show worth checking out if you enjoy action, passion, and, of course, the age old fight between heroes trying to save the world and villains who are trying to either destroy or rule it. And remember, any resistance in enjoying the show is, in Dio's words, MUDAMUDAMUDA!",

            "content": "Quick Disclaimer. I have a ton to say about Jojo's, so this review will be very long, which is saying a lot since my other reviews are crazy long to begin with, so read with your own discretion.\r\nBattle shounen have a bad rap in the anime community, and in my opinion, it is mainly for good reason. They are overly repetitive, extremely long in running time, and have extremely archetypal characters that develop very slowly because of said running time. However, this is only because the shows of the genre that are like this are by far the most popular (The Big 3, Fairy Tail,etc.). This creates a stigma that says that all battle shounen are shit, which I believe isn't true. Don't get me wrong, most of them are very bad, but there are a select few that rise above the failings that plague most battle shounen, and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is one of them, even if it still isn't perfect (I hear Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a good example as well, but I haven't watched it yet :P).\\n\\n\r\nSince this show is split into two parts (the first 9 episodes adapts the first part of the manga series, Phantom Blood, whilst the remaining episodes adapt the second, Battle Tendency), I will talk about some things that help and hinder the show across both parts, and then delve into the pros and cons that concern each respective part after that.\\n\\n\r\nThe main way this show decides to stray away from it's other battle shounen brethren is basically be as stupid as possible. There are so many logic flaws and asspulls littered throughout Jojo's Bizzare Adventure that you can find yourself facepalming at some points. On the other hand, however, the show wouldn't be nearly as fun without some of the silly shit it pulls. What it lacks in logic it makes up for with extreme passion and energy, and it's hard not to get caught up in the spectacle of it all. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there was one thing that appeared readily throughout the runtime of the series that really tried to hamper the fun atmosphere it's sheer stupidity had set up. Every time a character tries to pull any sort of move or tactic, accompanying dialogue is there to spell it out for us. Granted, some explanation is needed for some of the more complicated plots the characters pull off, but it goes too far when a character screams something along the line of \"I'm going to deliver a Hamon Kick straight to your face!\". It's like the show assumes the audience is just as stupid as it is, and this dialogue can really take you out of the experience at times with it's excessive amounts of hand-holding. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I will talk about with this show as a whole (except for art and sound, which will come later) is how much the spotlight is put on the two main characters of each respective parts. It really seems like the main characters are the only ones capable of moving the plot forward in this show. This doesn't mean that there aren't any other good characters in the show besides the mains, because there are. Hell, one of the mains is actually very bland. There are some very interesting and extremely likeable characters, but most of them have very little power with the plot, especially during fight scenes, where the main leads are always the ones to beat the bad guys, even when some characters are clearly stronger than them to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the two arcs separately, starting with Phantom Blood. For me, Phantom Blood is easily the weakest of the two parts, and it's easy to see why. With only 9 episodes dedicated to it, many elements of the plot feel extremely rushed, and we have no time to form bonds with most of the characters because of this. There are a decent number of characters for 9 episodes, and other than 3, none of them really get proper time to flesh out. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character for this part, Jonathan Joestar, is the bland MC I was talking about earlier. There isn't much to him other than very basic motivations. He doesn't even have much of a personality to him. The only good thing about his character was his relation to the antagonist, Dio Brando, who is by far the best part of Phantom Blood, and possibly the only thing Phantom Blood does better than Battle Tendency. While yes, Dio's motivations are as cliche as they come (basically just become more powerful), it's the immense amount of pressure and pain he puts on Jonathan throughout Phantom Blood's length. He becomes such a menacing presence because he is with JoJo for all of his adolescence and young adult years, and we witness the physical and psychological torture he puts on JoJo.\\n\\n\r\nAs for any other characters, the only character that I even sort of liked would be JoJo's mentor, Will. A. Zeppeli. He was very cool and a pretty decent mentor character, but he failed to really captivate me. Robert E. O. Speedwagon, Jojo's travelling companion, was basically just a commentator for this part, saying what happens during a fight, which as you already know, I very much disliked, so it goes without saying that I also dislike this character. Erina and Straizo are better in the second part, but fail to make much of an impact in this one, due to lack of focus mainly. \\n\\n\r\nIf Phantom Blood was the only thing to this anime, I would leave this show with mediocre memories of JoJo as a whole. However, Battle Tendency had so much more to offer. Since there was many more episodes for Battle Tendency to make use of, everything benefited as a result. The plot, while probably more silly than the last, is a lot more fleshed out. Also, Jonathans grandson, Joseph Joestar, is a way better protagonist. While he comes off annoying and cocky at times, his energy and his tactics in battle make him much more of an interesting character. He embodies what makes JoJo's Bizzare Adventure good, and that is it's wacky yet passionate tone it takes. \\n\\n\r\nAs for other characters, whilst they don't have much effect on the plot as said, they have such better personalities and backstories than Phantom Blood could ever dream of. Ceasar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, was a good foil to Joseph, with his more gentlemanly and suave personality initially clashing with Joseph's more brash attitude, and he also had a great backstory. The same can be said about the mentor character  this time around, Lisa Lisa. With a show that is teeming with overly muscular men, it is nice to see a woman who is just as, if not more powerful than most of the other characters. I just think the show didn't really respect her as much as they should've. She get's used for fanservice purposes quite a lot, and whilst most other characters get this as well, she almost immediately gets sidelined for Joseph in fights. Still, she gets enough respect still be a good addition to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains of the show, save for Kars, are the weakest part of Battle Tendency for me. Whilst Kars is shown to be a very menacing presence much like Dio is, the other three, Santana, Esidisi, and Wamuu failed to capture that. Wamuu was the best out of those three, since he strayed a lot from the villain formula used mainly in this show. Although he was an antagonist, he was very honorable in comparison to his brethren, which was a nice breath of fresh air, even though he was fairly weak. Santana and Esidisi, however, didn't do much for me. \\n\\n\r\nBefore going into art and sound, I saved my favourite character in this entire show for last. Rudol Von Stroheim, a militaristic and proud Nazi Commander, is the last guy you would think as the best character in an anime. He was just so badass and surprisingly selfless whenever he was on screen, and although there is a lot of screaming in Jojo's, his screams are the ones that are the most impactful to me. God he is just so awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Jojo's certainly isn't the best there is to offer when talking about newer anime. This isn't really surprising considering that the production studio, David Production, was founded by the former head of Gonzo, which is pretty notorious for less than stellar animation quality. However, unlike Gonzo, Jojo's is very consistent with it's artstyle, even if it the quality isn't the best. It is still effective when it comes to fightscenes, and is flashy and flamboyant enough when it needs to be, which is almost necessary for a show such as this one. The character designs are fantastic though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a bit of a mixed bag. The OST has some decent tracks, but many are filled to the brim with extremely out of place dubstep, which really can hamper the mood of the show, especially when you realize the show is set in the late 1800's to early 1900's. However, the two OP's and ED are fantastic for the show. With a show that has classic rock references everywhere, it is only fitting to have the ending theme be Roundabout by Yes, a classic rock single from 1972. Lastly, we have the voice acting. It's just so good. The screams are just so great. I can't get enough of them. SEKAI ICHI!\\n\\n\r\nWhilst Jojo's Bizzare Adventure (2012) is by no means a perfect entry into the battle shounen genre (not like there really is ever, but still), it manages to break away from the many tropes that hinder many of it's counterparts to give us a show with so much energy that you can't help but love it, even with so many flaws. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is enjoyment in the purest sense of the word. It's something you can watch to just have a good time and not think about anything. Hell, it's probably better that way, or else you would probably end up hating it! If you want to watch something that is just mindless fun with a couple heartfelt moments sprinkled in, there isn't much of a better recommendation. It certainly looks like Jojo's is going to become one of those long running shounen, but this is one I can get behind.\\n",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is probably right now one of the most praised titles on this database, but is this actually deserved?\r\nWell, after an era where moe has overtake the industry, with shows trying too hard to be cute that ended up being annoying, plus the overexpose of those titles, it's no wonder a show that pander to old school anime fans, when the anime was good, and was full of GAR male and manly protagonist and not loser and pussies. But nostalgia is one of the best liars, and actually, the old school anime is, most of the times, ultraviolent OVAs without any substance, withidiot plot and unidimensional characters that were just wish fullfillment to people wo dreamed to be real men. Real men, according to sexist ideas.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure is one of the most well-remenbered Shonen Jump's titles, along with Fist of the North Star, another GAR manga. Those days, studios made animes they'll know are gonna be successful, because making psychological cyberpunk thrillers with deep plot and though-provoking dialog is fine, but it's even finder made an anime that will sell after the bankrupt many studios had suffered. So, JoJo's was a sure value, it was gonna be successful. And it was, but not only in Japan, where is a loved classic, also here in the Western fandom, reaching really unexpected levels, with fanboys praising it, no one to contradict them and memes everywhere. (Who doesn't know the \"It was me, Dio\"?)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot it's more a collection of sagas, with different protagonists, the mangaka improvises to make sure the fans get hooked up. It's always the same, there's a Joestar male family menber who can control a tecnique named Hamon, which it's actually a superpower working according the plot conveniences in every fight, and has to fight evil immortal vampires. The first anime season is based on the two first anime sagas.\\n\\n\r\nThe first one is more idiotic, with characters completely undimensional and a  story so clich\u00e9 you wouldn't believe it: our hero has a friend who turned out to be the villain and join the evil forces because he has a serious big ego issues, and after his fiend betrayed him and kill his family, he's now the chosen one to defeat this evil forces learning and training an ancient tecnique (Hamon). But before fight his archnemesis, he must fight tons of evil minions. Oh, and there's a damsel in distress love interest. Everything is as cliched as i told you.\\n\\n\r\nThe second one is less cliched, but more narmy. Appears new villains, and some characters from the previous arc suddenly turned into ones despite they didn't showed any signs in the past. It looks like they're gonna have more badass female characters, but at the end of the day that's just a false promise. Female characters are still as passive as always. But what made this second half really awful is the over the top scenes like the killer squirrell, or the way the big bad is defeated. It's not so bad is good. It's so bad it's impossibly stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty frustrating. The hero from the first-half, Jonathan, fits more the traditional hero role, and it's eassier to root from him because he's more sympathetic, but he's so undimensional he becomes bland. The hero from the second-half, his grandson Joseph, he's a less tradiotional hero, and less undimensional, but less sympathetic too, and despite all the chances to develop him, actually he just become stronger, but at the end of the day you don't feel he changed that much.\\n\r\nThe secondaries go from idiots for pure plot convenience (Jonathan's father, trusting always people he musn't despite being obviously evil) to just so plain useful you need to pity them (Speedwagon, whose only purpose is commenting the obvious, or Smokey, only there to be The scream by Edvard Munch). But the worst is the first arc's main antagonist, Dio Brando, that' so pure evil, so campy, so succesful in his plans because all the Joestars are so dense, with lots of wasted opportunities to have depth, but no, he just born evil. Just that. And he's obnoxiously egocentric.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pure cringe, defying anathomy and physics. And the so called fabulous posses are just ridiculous, making the sequences laugh-worthy. So, after all the crap i said, you must woonder, why is JoJo's so popular? So acclaimed? My answer is simple. Pandering. It panders to the ones who miss the \"good old days\", who decide which animes are good or bad. At the end of the day, it's just wish fullfillment, like the harem based on light novels.",

It has a lot of comedy than drama but with SpeedWagon in both parts everything gets more dramatic x10, it was funny even tho the scenes weren't funny, it was the exaggeration of him. I liked that they didn't put filler eps. with their training. The key of the story is the characters, the characters makes the story so amazing and enjoyable, filled with exaggeration and the vogue poses were hilarious, if you pay attention you will see a couple of background characters making poses, and how can i forget the crying machos full of testosterone, nothing manlier than a big muscular man crying for his Bro.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style is something that i liked a lot instantly, it has a manga like art style, i really enjoyed seeing that kind of animation, and sometimes the colors changed in some dialogues, i can point out a lot more, but is as simple as that, the animation was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music was almost perfect, you can enjoy the really amazing VA to both great OP and the great ED just like the sound effects and the almost outstanding background music, but there was something that i couldn't stand, the thing is i like Electronica and its ramifications except aggrotech and the awful dubstep, and this anime has dubstep in some fights and not because i hate that ''music'', i can't see dubstep fitting in an anime that has a lot of references of Rock, so it dropped the quality for me, but taking out that negative disgrace and put in everything else the sound in general was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are really important in this anime, without the amazing characters everything else would drop in quality, the story wouldn't be the same if they weren't made like they actually are, so much character development and that's something important, i wouldn't thought this would made me shed tears, but it did, 3 times. It's important to point out that almost every characters has a name of a rock band or a rock band member, i spotted every single one and i laughed at how little time Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham were on screen.\\n\r\n-Jonathan Joestar is a great character, seeing how much he grew from a boy who couldn't fight and was beaten by Dio in everything until he snapped and made a killer combo on him, it was wow, and then to a very mature and kind person, too much kind for his own good, but he can't be blame, it was his nature.\\n\r\n-Dio Brando is one evil dude, that wanted to get rid of the Joestar's so he could take their fortune, he is one though hard to kill bastard who hates and respects Jonathan.\\n\r\n-Will Zeppelli is a great character, is a shame that he wasn't that much on screen.\\n\r\n-SpeedWagon is a unique character, he lived as a thug until he met Jonathan and his kindness, after that he followed him and considered him as a friend; But how can one character make everything more dramatic, the character that relates everything and explains attacks, happenings, he explains everything even the little details and the obvious things, if only he had a kid to pass that greatness.\\n\r\n-Joseph Joestar is more of a goof, always taunting at his enemies, and staying cool and having an Ace out of his sleeve everytime for any situation, he is much less serious than Jonathan but is a kind person like him in his own way.\\n\r\n-Ceasar Zeppeli is Will's niece, he is a casanova with a dark past to him, he has a competitive relation with JoJo, competing to outbest eachother and later on both developing a Bromance.\\n\r\nAnd then there are other great characters like Wham, Strotheim and a bunch more that are great, there are a lot of characters for me to write about them, but it would be too long, i only have to point out that the VA on everyone was really amazing, even the support characters have the same engage as the main characters, that's why the characters are outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWhat else can i write, with the combination of everything that i wrote already, you have an outstanding enjoyment.",

            "content": "Many people suggested JoJo to me and I probably came to watch it expecting too much.  This is a very generic shounen anime, with cool masculine elements added to it. Art is cool (even if I prefer the illustrations made by the author much more than their anime counterpart) and sound too. Story however is poor and the main reason is that characters are poorly written. The first arc features a bland protagonist with absolutely no depth behind his sense of justice and an even less deep villain who has at least a nice character design, but is just evil for the sake ofevil. Other characters in the first half, expecially the mc's father, are just outright stupid. Other than characters, there isn't really much else for the story. A villain appears and main characters aquire poorly-introduced-super-powers to punch their way to the final fight. Oh and those super powers can do basically whatever according to the plot needs, with no consistency whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSecond half is a little better than the first, as characters at least use some tactic in the fight, even if that is usually just a decently written @$$pull. Weapons materializing out of thin air because who cares are to be expected. Plot is still a mess but I enjoyed this part more, probably because by this time all my hype and expectations had already been shuttered. As soon as I turned my brain off and accepted the show as it is, it became less dreadful to watch.\\n\r\nDo not come to jojo expecting a masterpiece\\n\r\nCome here for a poorly written plot, dumb characters that explain their tactic to the enemy, a few punches and a lot of random moments. Come here for juvenile humor, muscles and the most linear story a shounen could tell you. Come here for a generic anime that's probably iconic for the sole reason that it was one of the first modern shounens and so ended up being influential.\\n\r\nStill, I have to admit it has a certain style to it, with the manly feel, the cool poses and a few interesting character designs. That's probably its saving grace. And it \"could\" be enjoyable if you shut your brain off. I'll give the show a 5.",

            "content": "This first series of recent Jojo adaptations adapted two story arcs from the manga, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. With that being said, I will be reviewing both arcs to the series separately since their quality varies between both.\r\nPhantom Blood's role is to introduce Dio Brando and how he would become entangled with the Joestar family bloodline for later installments of the franchise. The storytelling here is rather bland to a good extent as it lacks the energy found with later story arcs of the series and our lead protagonist, Jonathan Joestar, is rather cliched with his typical pure-hearted personality. Ruthless parenting and strained siblingrelationships are nothing new in anime, with these storytelling elements making Phantom Blood feel rather dated in terms of plot. On the plus side, later developments in Phantom Blood do redeem the arc somewhat when Dio's transformation into a vampire, the over-the-top action scenes and the title's penchant for naming characters after American rock musicians pop up.\\n\\n\r\nBattle Tendency is where Jojo's trademark energetic and over-the-top characters and battles are fully shown off when Jonathan's grandson, Joseph, is our new protagonist when he clashes with the Pillar Men. Unlike his grandfather, Joseph is a more fun protagonist here as he is more impulsive, loves to toy with his foes regardless of how heated things get and is known to improvise quite a bit to get himself out of heated situations. The Pillar Men are just as eccentric as Joseph with their personality quirks and being named after American music bands, yet are still formidable enough with their abilities to be legitimate threats to Joseph and his allies that test their abilities for combat and show off Joseph improvising whatever means he can think up of overcoming them. The substance of the series in terms of plot and characters is rather typical of shounen titles in its haphazard revelations and developments, but the style it milks is what allows Jojo to stick out from most franchises appealing to the demographic.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, this animated spin on Jojo does well for the most part with showing off the title's trademark energetic and over-the-top look. Details drawn on characters are exaggerated with the large, muscular bodies of the male cast and the series has fun milking use of bright color tones to compliment the energetic mood of the series. Stylistic approaches to the series such as some of the ridiculous poses struck by characters and sound effect texts displayed onscreen add to the title's fun approach. The soundtrack is energetic and diverse with musical selections such as militaristic themes, opera pieces and mysterious beats that help to enhance the exaggerated feel of scenes played out throughout the series. The only low point of the title's presentation comes from its rather subpar animation as shortcuts are employed at a number of points throughout the title's run such as still shots, jump shots and speed stripes.\\n\\n\r\nIssues aside, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure was still a fun romp for the most part thanks to its stylish approach with its characters and battles and shows that there are occasions where style can prevail over substance as Hellsing Ultimate proved. Might consider giving later titles in the franchise a look whenever the opportunity arises.",

            "content": "[6.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nStarting reviews with a quote is often cheesy and forced, however, I figure i'd fall in line with the series if I do, so...\r\n\"Mama Mia!\" \r\nThat was Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's first season and it was indeed bizarre and quite the adventure, with a sprawling cast of characters and two massive arcs that end up giving more than they take. What felt like a generic action shounen, which I am strictly not a fan of, ended up transitioning into something just a little bit more... bizarre. Perhaps not quick enough, though, but the end result here is undeniably fun. I think that's the easiest way tocharacterize this series as a whole at the moment. Fun. It is a fun show. It has fun characters. It has wacky fun twists. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nFun/10\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nJust joking! I wouldn't be myself if I didn't criticize everything and hate on things that are hardly even made for me. Onto the animation, or, as I could put it more accurately, the moments that are actually animated. In classic action shounen fashion, this series has the air of a slap-dash production. A lot of it feels rushed, as most anime does, and that shows the most in the animation quality. \\n\\n\r\nIt is sparingly good with a deeper pang of mediocrity to downright ugliness. That being said, it has some smart tactics up its sleeve to cover up said ugly animation with what can only be called \"signature Jojo-isms\", which is how i'll be referring to them from now on. Signature Jojo-isms are the parts of the series that we, and to a certain extent, I, recognized immediately as unique to this product. The moments and artistic choices that I was aware of coming into the series because they span seemingly throughout all of culture. \\n\\n\r\nShoddy animation is hidden behind posing, rumbling text on screen, awesome use of color and ultimately an appealing visual style. I feel like a series like this can actually be consumed frame-by-frame and the end result wouldn't actually be any worse than what we have here. The animation feels like a transition from one pose to another, rather than just something fluidly paced. If anything, it is a clever use of budget. It feels natural to have these characters move less when they're so focused around standing still and looking good. This isn't me excusing the poor animation in some areas, but it is me complementing the series in understanding its strengths and not trying to amend impossible weaknesses. This is undoubtedly the smart way to go about presenting a series. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also standout. What effort and time they didn't have for the animation they clearly outsourced well for the sound. Both the music and the sound effects have a great cheese to them that really brings the series to life. The opening to the second arc is a total ear-worm that I don't see myself forgetting anytime soon. But this design goes past just sound-effects and the opening, the backing music even has personality to it. Each character ends up having a somewhat memorable theme. In the shows superior second arc, we get plenty of recognizable stingers and bombastic techno-anthems that seriously pound your eardrums in the best possible way.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the Pillar Men to our favorite Nazi, everyone gets a time to shine, musically. Once again, I feel like this show could've easily been consumed in some kind of less movement focused visual medium, like a Visual Novel. Especially since it is so focused around the music. What you'd be losing, however, is the grandiose voice acting. Don't get me wrong, everything here is over-acted to shit but I think that's how it was meant to be. It is all silly, and the actors are clearly having a hoot yelling just about every line they read. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters & Story] \\n\\n\r\nThe series really ramps up in quality as it progresses, not necessarily in the art department but in the overall enjoyment of what is transpiring in front of you. We start with a mildly generic battle-arc that has sparring moments of entertainment mixed in with a jambalaya of boring nothingness. The first arc really leaves a lot to be desired. Both the settings and our protagonist feel incredibly weak in comparison to the second arc, where the series really decides to take off. \\n\\n\r\nWhen we meet the second JoJo, Joseph, you end up seeing exactly what direction this show is going and understanding exactly why this is positive. It went from a slightly wacky battle Shounen to an off-the-wall batshit insane battle Shounen, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. I find that most battle shounen in anime tend to go down the same path and I rather not harp on the entire genres problems this review since I do that so often in my other outings. All that needs to be said is that JoJo is bizarre enough to stand out from the already bizarre selection of battle shounen that end up getting mushed together into one lump of over-moralizing strung-out garbage. \\n\\n\r\nOf course we get plenty of the cliches that come with the genre, though. From the over-abundance of still images with a few action lines thrown in to training arcs and jobbing that act like the cherry on top of the action shounen pudding. We have side-characters that do nothing but gawk at the action, and the general illogic of battle, where every moment feels like decades and characters just stand around chatting and explaining rather than actually fighting. We also have one of my least favorite cliches, as a character watches their friends get decimated before doing something, instead of helping them right away. Because of course they have to monologue and let the story unfold as dramatically as possible. For example, Joseph battles one of the three main baddies in this chariot race. Joseph cheats by piling rocks at the starting line and makes the baddies chariot unable to begin the race, while he flies by. Moments later, however, it is revealed that the baddy actually wanted this to happen and needed to be behind Jojo all-along. Yet his reaction to the initial rock pile-up, even when Joseph was hundreds of meters ahead of him, was that of shock. Why? Who was he playing to? The viewers? \\n\\n\r\nThese are issues that even Jojo can't overcome. That being said, what it does within this genre it does well. The villains were both memorable and the unfolding battles, during their peaks, were solid. Even if the barrage of episodes leading up to the final climax, or what I call \"battle build-up\", where the characters fight through seeming gauntlets of nothingness is just tedious to sit through. What's great about Jojo is that it does its best to even make those moments funny, and I think at its best, Jojo's is hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nAs something that can be defined as the pulpiest possible anime, which is already an insane sentence to write since most anime is pulpy. Jojo's embraces that title and really runs the miles with it. You have man-eating squirrels, bubble-blowing Italian men, and every character death, major or not, treated as the worlds greatest tragedy. It is so unabashedly corny that you can't help but laugh. And maybe that's not the emotion I should be feeling during the sad moments, but the fact that the show so willingly plays every one of these bizarre and silly scenes as totally straight makes it so endearing and comical. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to analyze here, though. The thematic elements are blunt and childish, as they are supposed to be. Every piece of symbolism is so hammy and funny that it really doesn't hold any weight. But it really shouldn't in a series like this. You should understand exactly what kind of show this is and revel in the mawkish glory. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nWhat I can't help but think about is how this series does just about everything a parody should do, yet can't really be classified as a parody. Everything is definitely exaggerated, but I wouldn't even say it was deliberately exaggerated for comedy. The author, I feel, just wanted to make something bizarre and indulge in that quality. Comparing it to something like an earlier series I ended up dropping, Food Wars, the differences are palpable. Food Wars can be classified as a parody of action shounen, yet it was both less funny and less creative than Jojo. It was even less bizarre! A parody is supposed to over-exaggerated elements, but when non-parodies like Jojo's are already so absurd I can't help but feel like this entire genre is beyond parody at this point. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is interesting. Maybe I just haven't thought of a proper approach to parodying a genre that already comes off as way over-the-top. Maybe Jojo's really is a parody of sorts. But it plays like the kind of B-movie you end up really attached to because of how seriously it commits to the role of being that crappy B-movie. At the end of the day, that's all you can really ask for. A fun, campy series that embraces the cliches of its brethren with enough vigor and prowess that you end up with a product that not only exceeds your expectations, but completely surpasses them, for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nStill weighed down by the genre trappings, much like any above-average Shounen action series that I've seen, Jojo's crafts its own visual style and personal identity, while also  wearing its faults and scars like a cloak. Don the mask, become a supreme being, indulge in the inanity. Get in on the campy fun.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nNothing on this planet exists quite like the notion of family. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents; everyone has or has had them. And while we may not always get along over the dinner table, deep down the connections we share with our family are unlike anything else we know. Many times, these bonds are tested, often verging on the point of breaking. But with a careful hand (and maybe a bit of Hamon), the ties that bind us can truly never be broken. Such is the tale of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and what a taleit is.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with Jonathon Joestar, a young boy who earns himself a new brother, Dio Brando. After many altercations, the two find themselves at a crossroad.\\n\\n\r\nImmediately when the anime begins, it gives off an enticing presence. It's not overpowering, but you know right from the get-go that this one behaves completely different from anything before it. The overly detailed characters, the verbose explanations, and the over-the-top outcomes of anything that goes on culminate in this amazing vibe the show gives off. It might be somewhat unfair to say, but it's better to experience it than to have it described to you. That's how unmistakable and unique the show feels.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, getting slightly spoiler-y, spans multiple generations of the Jojo family tree. It's actually quite fascinating for two reasons: it shifts the focus from one main character to the next and allows for complete and fulfilling story arcs. Time skips in any show are always a tricky thing to pull off, because it requires the audience to reinvest themselves in characters that either had rushed/skipped character development or in ones that are brand new.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure opts for a mix of the two. It utilizes both old and new characters to make the transition easier. By providing the old ones, we as an audience already understand and know their background. Their purpose, then, was to serve as catalysts for the new. In this way, the new characters never feel distant, since their literal familial history gives them the needed personality and character traits. Now, obviously, the later characters stand apart from their ancestors in one form or another, but the way in which everything tied together so nicely was great to see.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was an award in \"Explaining the Current Predicament,\" Jojo's Bizarre Adventure would win with flying colors. No matter the situation, no matter how dire things may seem, the show will, without fail, explain exactly what is going on. Interestingly enough, this never gets old. This is most likely due to the nature of the show itself being incredibly over-the-top and crazy in the first place. The overall goals during each arc are simple, and are not the focus. Instead, it's what is happening then and now. Whether Jojo is running with a football or holding a glass of water, every detail is looked at. This further adds to the already awesome presence the show gives off.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note. Being completely honest, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is the same from beginning to end. It doesn't explore any themes, it's not trying to enlighten you, and it never provides a new insight on life. It's a wacky ride from start to finish. And while in context it is coherent in the story it tells, there is really nothing here to analyze. It's tough men and women fighting to save the world.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAnother standout feature in this adventure is the art style that the anime adopts.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost come the character designs themselves. Gone are the days of huge eyes and scraggly teenagers late into high school. No, the characters here are \"real\" men and women. Taking place in areas outside of Japan, the characters fit the part, both in aesthetic and physical appearance. Furthermore, everyone is heavily detailed. Contours on their faces, sharp lines for their muscles, and varying outfit choices make them stand out not only from among different shows but from one another as well.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the style. Style here isn't so much the art but in how it is presented. In this case, it is done in \"comic book\" fashion. Actions sometimes get accompanying onomatopoeia, facial close-ups, frame breaks; it really feels like a comic book has come to life right before your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is in the art itself. The show essentially takes all the colors of the rainbow, puts them in a bucket, grabs a handful of this paint, and chucks it at the drawings. What we get are a flurry and amalgamation of colors that are constantly changing. It not only makes the scenes contain varying and interesting color palettes, but makes the different scenarios refreshing to look at since they morph every few minutes or so. It's a really cool effect that the show employs masterfully.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the show's faults comes in its actual animation. For the most part, it is quite minimal. The massive amount of character details, the cool presentation, and the revolving art are the portions of the show that saw the majority of the resources, leaving little for this section.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure has a slew of characters, but I'll talk about some of the more important ones: Baron and Caesar Zeppeli, Speedwagon, Jojo, and of course, Dio.\\n\\n\r\nBaron and Caesar are what most men aspire to be: charming with the ladies, strong both physically and mentally, and stalwart in their convictions. But above all else, they have the innate ability to do whatever it takes to turn the situation in their favor. If anything, their characters serve to demonstrate that sometimes we can't always do things on our own. Sometimes, we require a little outside influence.\\n\\n\r\nSpeedwagon is that guy you wish you had as a friend. It doesn't matter what you may be doing, he always has your back through thick and thin. And if we had to give that explanatory award to one individual, Speedwagon earns it without a doubt. Almost exclusively there to give us the rundown of what is going on at that very second, his \"power\" isn't demonstrated until much later, and even then it is only alluded to. Constantly in the shadows of the more vocal and obtuse men of the show, he may seem like a side character, but there is no Jojo without Speedwagon.\\n\\n\r\nJojo is definitely a good protagonist. Smart, strong, and skilled in many arts, his ability to turn a situation in his favor is rivaled by no one. His success as a \"Hamon\" user makes him a force to be reckoned with, and his chivalrous ways allow him to be the true gentleman that he's always been. Right alongside Speedwagon and the others, you'll be calling out \"Jojo!\" right up until the finish. At this point, you may be asking yourself, \"Yea, but which one?\" To which I respond, \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n\r\nArguably the best character from the show is Dio Brando. His characterization is interesting because of how well it plays with the family idea. Driven by hate towards his own father and the Joestar name, he makes it his mission to thwart Jojo whenever he can. He's not necessarily wrong, just completely misguided. He's intelligent and honorable as a warrior, and his ideals about obtaining power and ruling over all are evil. But these goals mirror his true feelings; he's extremely lonely. Pushing Jojo and Jojo's father away was more instinctual than intentional. He never really experienced true love, in any form, in order to allow him to realize that what he always really wanted was right next to him all along.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP sort of \"sets the stage\" for what the show is all about. It's not so much a song as it is a small poem. The best part is actually the \"Jojo\" part that happens a select view times; it sort of sounds like the beating of a heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP is more artistic in its lyrics and presentation. The trumpets, vocals, and continuous drum/cymbal beat make it a bit more lively, coinciding with the more lively atmosphere and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is obviously the most interesting. Not only because it is a Western song, but why it was chosen in the first place. My interpretation is not so much in the lyrics themselves but in just the title alone: \"Roundabout.\" That is, as is demonstrated by Jojo time and again, the solution to the problem at hand is almost always quite roundabout.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack does have some good pieces, such as the triumphant score that plays when Jojo is going to win or the Pillar Men's more Aztec sounding piece. Also of note here is the sound effect, used to great effect, when the camera is zooming in or moving from one scene to the next.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, I found everyone did fine work in the roles they represented. This is especially true for characters like Speedwagon or Von Stroheim who consistently had to scream or elevate their voices to match the scenarios at hand.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI can't recall not laughing during any single episode for this one. There was always something ridiculous happening on screen, from the comedic writing to the crazy yet \"realistic\" answers for the zany holes that the characters found themselves in. Even just Speedwagon saying, \"What?!\" or the bad guy at the time going, \"Impossible!\" would always give me the biggest grin imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not afraid of showing some rather gruesome material. Things such as accordian'd fingers, heads chopped horizontally at nose-level, and melting flesh are the norm. If someone gets unsettled by such content, the anime might not be for them. But if you can handle such brutality, it just makes the entire experience that much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is just straight up fun. It's presentation, the story, and the writing make it supremely different from almost any other show out there. On enjoyment alone the show could be considered perfection. It honestly is that much of a great time. But considering the whole package, the final product doesn't quite reach that status. Yet it goes without saying there isn't and probably will never be anything quite like Jojo.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, Jojo makes its mark\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, unique art style with little actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Jojo, Dio, Speedwagon, and the rest play their parts\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OPs, good ED, nice soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, really nothing else like it\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Imagine if Dragon Ball Z was actually good, or if Kill la Kill wasn\u2019t so weird.\r\nI feel sorry for this anime. It takes a stupid, pointless idea and makes the best of it. The world has dozens of stories about macho dudes beating up other macho dudes because they don\u2019t agree with their morals. In the worst cases, these stories are filled with overcomplicated fight systems nobody cares about, and silly monologues.\r\nThe world of macho dudes who never really die, where time doesn\u2019t exist is a bit tired now. Franchises like Naruto, One Piece and Dragon Ball will outlast the heat death of the universe.It\u2019s bizarre how no author of these mangas pulled a Robert Jordan, but nothing is as bizarre as this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMacho-ness, like most tropes, is bad because it\u2019s boring. The problem with using tropes has nothing to do with sophistication. It\u2019s just that after seeing the same technique for 100 stories, you get bored. You become like JoJo and can predict their next sentences. Bad cliches are used by storytellers who don\u2019t know what kind of story they want to tell. Is it an epic adventure? A silly show about silly people beating each other? An examination of good an evil?\\n\\n\r\nJoJo\u2018s strength is the focus, unlike all these shows. The anime makes it clear what it wants to be early in the beginning. Then, every single thing that happens connects to that. JoJo wants to deliver a simple story of good and evil. The bad guys are really, really bad. The good guys are really good and charming. If the fate of the world was really in the hands of a macho dude, we\u2019d all be filled with adrenaline. When it\u2019s a bunch of colors on the screen, you need more than this.\\n\\n\r\nSince JoJo knows its purpose is to deliver excitement, it will do everything it can to raise the stakes. Bad guys don\u2019t come back after being defeated just because you can milk the show a little more. They come back because it raises the stakes, makes us wonder how they can be defeated. The anime establishes that everyone knows what everyone\u2019s next move is, which is exciting because we wonder when will one of these will fail.\\n\\n\r\nBattles in anime always have pre-determined results. Every battle in anime is a man playing chess against himself. So a battle is only as exciting when the writers can challenge themselves, when they find ways to overturn their own schemes. The set-pieces drive the battles, not just meaningless shots of people using fists. Each battle is a progression of moves. It\u2019s an odd way to describe a fight but they\u2019re like a chess game in how every move has a clear influence on what happens next. There\u2019s something thrilling in seeing a person trying hard to beat himself up in chess.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not the animation that sparks up the battle, which is weird. Most of the time, exciting fights are well animated. They have fluid movements that create a kinetic energy. JoJo opts for more still shots, but its set-pieces and beautiful progression saves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style itself is very old school and gloriously macho. It\u2019s so old-school it\u2019s jarring at first. Everyone has a Schwarznegger build and dangerously low amounts of fat. Even characters who don\u2019t fight look muscular, with square faces and bodies of an endomorph. This style can be ugly. It does suffer from Same Face Syndrome, but they make up for it in other ways. Where it fails to dazzle in character shapes, it succeeds in customes and hairstyle. Every important character has a unique, often elaborate dress style.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, beyond the endomorph build, JoJo\u2018s version of macho is unique. Perhaps it was common in old times, but today it\u2019s rarer. We now love our heroes rebellious, slightly selfish and enforcing their morality in brutal ways. We want Deadpool and Iron Man, heroes who are only good because the plot requires it. The macho-ness of JoJo is the \u2018respectable gentleman\u2019, a man who respects even his enemies. The first part drills this the most, but even the second arc with the rowdy second JoJo has it. Wham is an honorable villain. JoJo duels him fairly and with respect, rather than with malice.\\n\\n\r\nSo the characters don\u2019t look gritty and tough. Rather, in the language of 12-year-old kids, they look gay. Their customes are elaborate and decorative. They look like men who are so sure of their macho-ness that they don\u2019t mind looking so ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThe female design also enforces this weird form of macho-ness. JoJo doesn\u2019t downplay the female\u2019s femininity. In fact, it shows it with all the glory. Although there are no ecchi moments, the female characters look distinctly feminine \u2013 lipstick, eyelashes, gentle features. A common problem in battle shounen is that everyone is so macho, the show is afraid of femininity. So besides having longer hair and breasts, the females look like men. JoJo doesn\u2019t need sexuality to remember its female characters are female. It\u2019s a macho series that doesn\u2019t view femininity as a weakness.\\n\\n\r\nFor all its fun (and it\u2019s a lot of fun), there\u2019s a glass ceiling it cannot break. It\u2019s a great macho adventure about saving the world, but that\u2019s all there is. It does a lot with its style, but it\u2019s always limited by it. Dragon Ball Z looks pathetic next to it, but JoJo is overshadowed by Kill la Kill. For all of its weirdness and energy, it never becomes as absurd Kill la Kill. It aims there and it succeeds enough to not become useless. I\u2019ll definitely check out the sequels, but Imaishi\u2019s cartoon prove there is so much more you can do with macho bullshit and saving the world. The fact JoJo keeps up with it and and is still worthwhile is a point for it.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo is excellent at what it does. There are plenty of silly people who think there\u2019s no value in adventure stories about saving the world. It may not be Kill la Kill, but it gets everything else right \u2013 the pacing is focused, the art is beautiful, the fights are coherent. It\u2019s the sort of thing that inspires a lot of anime that can\u2019t measure up to it.\\n\\n\r\n6 skedaddling out of 5 here",

For the first time, the crowd is right. This anime is a fucking masterpiece. Holy shit.\r\nThis anime starts off on the wrong foot. The first part is pretty lame, slow, and would have caused me to drop JoJo's if I wasn't already dead-set on watching it in full. As a warning, don't drop this anime thinking it won't get better. It does. It gets so much better. This is now my favorite anime.\r\nEverything becomes godly in part 2. The art isbeautiful, colorful, unconfined. The OP is supremely catchy- but Pillar Men... dear god. The characters are charming and charismatic- almost never do they break character for the sake of the plot. Thoroughly amazing story.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gets a solid 100/10 from me.",

            "content": "How to describe JoJo's Bizarre Adventure... Imagine Johnny Bravo and Zoolander fighting the Ginyu Force in a anime funded by Old Spice. Yes, I said it. It is a cavalcade of over-the-top manliness camp that couldn't bore you if it even tried. And that is what I will review JoJo for what it is, leaving any expectations of a deep, well written story at the door. \r\nStory: 7\r\nJoJo's story takes place in several different time eras, from 19th century Britain to pre-World War 2 Europe (and Mexico, surprisingly). The accuracy of how it captures the essence of those eras is up to debate. A lotof things about the Hamon/Ripple tend to not make sense and even seem improvised, which adds to some humor about the science in JJBA. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe men are grotesquely muscular to the point of looking like caricatures of body builders, and yet somehow it all works in the context of JJBA. The series' use of colors, regardless of how bright and garish they are, is a surprising contrast to the gory, over-the-top action the series is known for.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nA reviewer once remarked that the sound effects and music in JJBA is just as over-the-top and irresponsibly loud as its artwork. Imagine a scene where you're in a Roman colloseum with loud dubstep music playing as the combat takes place. And this is an anime that takes place in 19th and early 20th century Europe, adapted from a manga that was made in the 80s. And yet.... it all works. Don't ask me how, it just does! \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme songs definitely highlight the characters in a big way, and are just as fun to watch as the rest of the series. Big props for the series using \"Roundabout\" as the ending theme by the way, as it was the manga author's choice of music while writing JJBA.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nPhantom Blood was pretty straightforward with its characterization. Jonathan Joestar is your usual average good guy fighting the cliched bad guy Dio. The second half, Battle Tendency, has much better characterization. Joseph Joestar is infinitely more entertaining than his grandfather Jon, and he has quite an interesting relationship with his partner slash rival Caesar Zeppeli, and their trainer slash mother figure Lisa Lisa. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 15\\n\r\nJJBA is just one hilarious and exciting episode after another, even if the science of Hamon doesn't make sense. You'll need to cast your brain aside to enjoy it, however, or you'll find yourself rating this much lower than I did. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nYou either love or hate JJBA (not surprisingly, many women including my girlfriend dislike it). It definitely feels like a \"bro\" type of anime, so you'll have a lot of fun watching this with your buddies.",

            "content": "If you don't feel like reading a full review of Jojo, all you have to know is this: This is the most fun you'll ever have watching a show. It sounds like hyperbole, and most of the time it would be, but this show is truly that fantastic. Let's skip the summary (which you can find above) and jump right into what makes this show so great.\r\nFirst of all, it is utterly absurd in the best ways possible. The evil villains are super evil, the good guys are super good, and everyone is SUPER MANLY! This is without a doubt the most gar show outthere (if you don't know the term gar, urban dictionary will help). Every single character is a super macho man who does super awesome macho man things. Not much stoicism in this show, as almost every single male character in this show cries manly tears on more than one occasion, shit, even our villains cry manly tears. It's super over the top emotions and reactions and faces and POSES! These characters strike so many ridiculous poses at any possible time they can. Exposition? They're doing poses. Emotional moment? They're doing poses. Confronting the bad guy? Everyone's doing poses. In the middle of a huge ass fight to decide whether you live or die? THEY'RE DOING POSES!! (I think you get the point)\\n\\n\r\nNext is the action, and holy shit is it over the top. Throughout the show, Jojo fights just about anything you can think of, zombies, vampires, Nazis, monks, and cops to name a few. Jojo and his enemies are constantly blowing up shit, most of the time each other. This is easily one of the more violent shows up there, but it all really goes to enhance the world that these characters are in. What really makes these fights so fantastic, apart from all of the wonderful poses, is the extreme level of over the top they achieve. I would list some of them out right now, but i feel like that would ruin the originality of the moments when they occur. Safe to say that tons of shit happens that you will never see coming.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, on a more serious note, the art and sound are just dynamite. Both do a fantastic job to enhance the show. The art especially. Oftentimes, you'll be watching a scene and the color scheme will change entirely. Blue hair becomes green, yellow becomes purple, shirts and backgrounds and faces, EVERYTHING'S NOW A DIFFERENT COLOR! There's no reason for it, it's just cool! \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty dumb, it's just basic action movie shit, but it's fine because, like everything else in this show, the story does not take itself seriously. It knows how absurd it gets at times and it embraces that absurdity. Easily the show's weakest point, but Jojo is not a show you watch for story, you watch it for hilarious over the top dialogue and action and colors. I give it an 8/10 simply because I don't think it's right to give this show anything higher without it exploring some sort of theme or having a point other than fun. But, fun is pretty great, and it's what the show cares about, and it's what the show excels at. If you're the kind of person that can enjoy something for the pure fun of it, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a must watch, and a personal top 10.",

            "content": "When I heard there was going to be a 2012 adaptation of Jojo, I expected the focus to be on just Stardust Crusaders. What I didn't expect was that it would adapt all parts up to Stone Ocean, which makes me a happy panda.\r\nNow, onto the review:\r\nStory: The story is split into different segments due to there being parts in the story and so far we only have Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency so its not finished, but I'll try not to spoil anything, but it all ties to the Joestar's conflict with Dio.\r\nThe story starts with George Joestar being found near death and owinga debt to the man who found him, Dario Brando. They both had two sons, Jonathan and Dio,each of them living in parallel lives until Dario dies and sends Dio to live with the Joestar's due to George's debt to him. When they met, Dio is instantly primed to make Jonathan's life a living hell going as far to ruin his love life and burn his dog alive. Seven years pass, and George has taken ill, and while Jonathon is out looking for a cure, Dio conducts experiments on a mysterious artifact known as the Stone Mask. The rest of the first part follows the effects of the mask on Dio and Jonathon's journey of stopping it. \\n\r\nBattle tendency just started so I can't make much of it so far, but Joseph has  knowledge of the Ripple, a technique Jonathon used to defeat Dio. I can't say anything more without spoiling anything, but it all centers around the Joestar's feud with Dio.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is very detailed, especially on the faces and bodies, almost too detailed. Jonathon and Dio looked over 18 when their supposed to be 12 and their bodies are very muscular, though thats due to physical training. Overall the animation and backgrounds look great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OPs \"That Blood's Destiny\" and \"Bloody Stream\" are excellent, and the music played throughout the anime, especially \"Roundabout\" is awesome as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime, and anyone who wants a good shounen should do aswel. The only criticism I can give it is that its targeted mostly to ation fans, anyone wanting a psychological thriller would do better looking elsewhere. But don't pass up the chance to look at this beautiful \"DUWANG\" of an anime!\\n\\n",

            "content": "When an anime is pigeonholed based on its most popular or well-known feature, it does a great disservice to the anime. People only see the show as a part of what makes it unique. \r\nShould you watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure *only* because it is \"GAR\" or super-manly-moe-stomping-fun? Absolutely not.\r\nShould you watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure because it has an interesting premise, great art, amazing music and voice acting performances, and some fascinating characters? Absolutely YES.\r\nStory: The show is divided into 2 parts, with different feels. The first is a Victorian-era action-adventure, with our hero learning to master a supernatural power, and fighting supernatural enemies. The secondis a globe-trotting comedy adventure with our hero learning to master a supernatural power, and fighting supernatural enemies. The shift from more action oriented to more comedy oriented is mostly due to the main character in each part, discussed below.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's pacing is very fast, and is probably the show's weakest point. So much material is covered in such a short time, that the viewer doesn't often have time to relax. The viewer has to keep up to speed, or else you're left behind. Not that it's a 100% bad thing; keeping the show moving leaves no room for fillers.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The stylized manga has been adapted as a stylized anime. The use of freeze-frames and color-shifts are used liberally, as well as on-screen \"sound effects\". Overall, the show feels like a comic book brought to life. The use of color (not just in the color shifts) really adds a light-hearted feel to the show, especially in tense fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nAs for quality, the show has consistent quality for both characters and backgrounds. The action and fight scenes are fluid, and don't suffer from any frame drops.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Japanese dub is very good: if your native language is not Japanese, it can sometimes be hard picking up on the subtle things actors can do with their voices to convey a message. The actors all do this perfectly, and each role sounds natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs are upbeat and interesting. The ending song is \"Roundabout\", by Yes, which the manga author stated was influential when he was creating the manga. It not only has a great sound, and drives home the fact that so many characters' names are based on Western musicians, but it is often used in the final minutes in certain episodes as part of the soundtrack. The plucking of guitar strings adds a serious, melancholy note to depressing scenes, and adds a sense of mystery to cliffhanger endings. It's not often that music is used to complement the most climactic part of an episode this way, but it is used perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the OST is great, as well. The first part features Victorian-style music, with organs and harpsichords in minor keys. It fits the calm and collected demeanor of the main character, and the classical horror of the villain.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is where the OST really shines. The second half, which is set in the 1930s and featuring a brash, over-the-top man, heavily features electronic and dubstep music. It's off-putting at first, but it's such a perfect compliment to the action on the screen that it simply feels right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The first part's hero, Jonathan, suffers from a minor lack of development. He is and always will be the perfect gentleman, fighting for good simply because it is good and righteous.\\n\\n\r\nThe villain, Dio, gets a little more characterization. You quickly realize that he wasn't born evil, but became evil due to his lust for power. He wanted to become powerful so that he would not have to live the cursed, poor life he was born into because of his father. Once he sees that his psychotic plans are thwarted, he sacrifices his humanity in exchange for unimaginable power. His pride would not allow him to accept defeat.\\n\\n\r\nThe hero of the second act, Joseph, is a polar opposite to Jonathan. Joseph is a smart-ass, quick-thinking punk. His sense of humor, especially during intense fights, is what makes Joseph so charming. That, and he's not afraid to run from a fight if he knows he's not going to win. He also goes through some development when he meets a man who is almost as arrogant as he is. Through tough trials, the two men become friends, and it's genuinely satisfying to see emotional development like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of side and minor characters is immense, and varied. Some are powerful, and meant to be feared and respected; others are goofy and are there for comic relief. The designs and personalities of the characters are a great mix, and add a great deal of variety to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a great show because all of its different parts work together perfectly. It feels like each facet of the show inspired each other, and it has an innate flow that ties it all together. The fact that it's so over-the-top and fun is simply a side effect.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR 5 words/phrases to describe Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\\n\r\ngreat art, great music, fast paced, fun, Joseph is best Jojo",

            "content": "JOJO!!! \r\nSPEEEEEEEEDWAGON-SAN!!\r\nDIO!\r\nCAESAR!\r\nSTROOOOOOOOHEEEIM!\r\nGet ready for some shouty, shonen insanity, slap full of 70s and 80s rock band references, over the top 80s anime action, and matching music to keep you groovin'. \r\nOverview: \r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is a psychedelic jaunt back in time, back into a time when action was more brutal, characters were ultra macho, the story was as straight as they come, and a general air of kickass cheese surrounded everything- the 80's.\r\nWithout getting too much into story particulars, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure could be reviewed in separate parts, as the break between episodes 9 and 10 jumps us up in time and gives us theantics of another Jojo to be a(be)mused by. So, that said, I'm going to split my story and character ratings and try to get into the differences between the two. \\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the categories common to both parts, and then get into that stuff people seem to care about.. story and characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nCombining trippy psychedelic still frame complete with a swirling miasma of neon yellow, blue, green, and purple lights, flowers, zigzags, and whatever other random crap those hippies smoked with art made to look like a comic book (not cel shaded, unfortunately), and you have a formula for a rather refreshing art style. Character designs are very consistent, not always the most interesting settings, but well drawn- Venice in particular struck me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nWell, our opening themes are written for the show, and are fine. The ending theme, however, is a hack fraud rip off of the seminal 70s English progressive band YES... wait, what's that? They licensed \"Roundabout\"? Yes, \"Roundabout\" is the closing theme (pun intended), in several different cuts, and it fits VERY well with the show, particularly with all of its references to 70s and 80s bands. Keyboard solo intact, it grooves you right into the next episode, and never got stale. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI probably beat this horse to death a couple of miles ago, but I'm going to drag it all the way- I grew up on 70s and 80s classic rock, and the umpteen million references in the show really entertained me. I read that the manga writer was listening to these bands at the time of writing (1989, whew) and they influenced the show, naturally. The character names coupled with a famous song from that era (that was no doubt not a cheap license) made it more fun.  What does the dead horse mind anyway?\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 (2 pts part 1, 5 pts part 2 [not to MAL overall scale])\\n\r\nHere's where we branch off, and somebody will have to tell me to shut up. \\n\\n\r\nPart 1: Phantom Blood\\n\\n\r\nWe begin our Bizarre Adventure (TM) in the late 1800's with big sissy Jonathan Joestar and his newly minted emo boy vampiric rival Dio (Ronnie James). Jojo the First's arc sort of follows the typical MORE POWER shonen trope- the seemingly unbeatable villain gains this unholy power and lords it over Jojo, meanwhile Jojo goes out and gets a power of his own, Hamon, a strange Force-like ability that operates on natural bodily flows of blood and breathing. Commence ever over the top battles that leave the characters in near death states while narrowly escaping to fight another shonen, another day. The Hamon abilities are expounded upon in much greater detail later. (think a little bit like Spiral Power from Gurren Lagann) The first section serves as necessary backstory and shouldn't be skipped, though it's definitely the weaker part.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2: Battle Tendency\\n\\n\r\nSkip ahead a number of years, and the next heir to the Jojo title, Joseph Joestar steps up. Being of a more rough cut than his predecessor, he has a tendency to get scrappy. Hence, the title of this segment. *boo*\\n\r\nAgain, we have the More Power arc, but this time it's much more subtle. This Jojo already has Hamon, but actually learns how to harness it to a much fuller extent than Jojo1.. Fitting, as he ends up with three times the ridiculously overpowered enemies to fight. We have steampunk/mecha Nazis, we have zombie hordes, and the aforementioned trio of ancient godlike beings. \\n\\n\r\nWe get introduced to some new, but ambiguously familiar friends, and some recurring characters from part 1 who are welcome sights. Everyone plays a part, and there's even a real shocker of a scene pretty late in the show.  (all i'm gonna say is \"Darth Vader\").\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 (3 pts part 1, 3.5 pts part 2 [not to MAL overall scale])\\n\\n\r\nPart 1: Phantom Blood\\n\\n\r\nOur first Jojo is sort of all over the place. In the beginning he's an insecure, spoiled brat who can't stand up for himself, then progresses over the 9 episodes into a Dragonball Z type fighter. He is rather goal driven, that being to defeat his archnemesis and get the girl. \\n\\n\r\nVillain numero uno is Dio. Dio is the antithesis to Jojo, naturally. Self assured, driven, and very, very angry at his perceived injustice. His character is a much more interesting villain than those present in part 2, due to the fact that he's not just a generic superpowered villain. His backstory is explored, and he has a clear motive for his world domination ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2: Battle Tendency\\n\\n\r\nJojo 2 is a bit differentiated from his predecessor, and is a lot more entertaining to watch. He relies on trickery and last-ditch headlong rush tactics vs the brute strength of Jojo 1, which makes for unexpected and often humorous conclusions to conflicts against the beatup, knockdown, dragout fights in the first section. His dialogue and relationship to the supporting characters is also deeper and more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains lose some points this time around, as they're all essentially the same thing- three ancient, godlike supervillains. Their histories are practically irrelevant, all that anyone needs to know is that they're here, they want to rule the world, and this Jojo moron is in their way. Pretty bland as far as interesting bad guys go.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI would give this series an 8 if it weren't for the first part of the show (1-9). It was too slow, and I really disliked the characters to the point where it became a chore to watch and I almost quit. Not to scare anyone off, but the second part is much improved, with better characters that are fun to watch, and a generally more interesting plot. If battle shonen are your thing, along with a healthy dose of goofy, 70s music, and a sprinkle of deus ex machina, give it a whirl.\\n",

            "content": "After a decidedly mixed adaption of Part 3, and a critically panned feature movie of Part 1, it took until 2012 until we got the definitive adaption of Araki's magnum opus; Jojo's Bizzare Adventure, the anime now famous for it huge, muscular men and overall crazy adventures.\r\nStory:\r\nThe first 'season' of Jojo covers the first two arcs of Araki's manga; Part 1: Phantom Blood and Part 2: Battle Tendency. Phantom Blood features primarilly Jonathon Joestar, a wealthy astroicrat living with his father George Joestar, with the addition of Dio Brando, who has come to stay due to a promise from George. However, things take a decidedlydark and insane turn when Dio, in his lust for power, seeks the power of an ancient stone mask.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Battle Tendency features the grandson of Jonathon, Joseph, who must take up battle against the legendary Pillar Men, the creators of the stone mask Dio was involved in. Part 2 takes a slightly more comedic tone to it's story, while holding the same tension that Part 1 did; this is mostly due to the voice talents of Tomokazu Sugita, who voices Joseph. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the plot for Part 1 is not that in-depth. It's most Jonathon fighting a couple of villains, but his motivations, his character interactions, and the inclusion of Speedwagon makes up for the plot in this part, and is honestly much, much better then it's manga counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2 has a much more engaging storyline, but upping the stakes much higher, with Joseph literally facing death every couple of episodes. The story is also notably much more often emotionally satisfying - this isn't to say Part 1 isn't at times emotionally satisfying, it's just that Part 2 does it far more often.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure features a wide cast of characters, but focuses on a select few each part. Part 1 mostly focuses on Jonathon and Dio, with added roles from Zepelli and Speedwagon. Jonathon, whilst admittedly not the most interesting of the Jojos, is great fun, and Dio will always go down as one of the morally worst people in the series - and anime in general. And of course, Speedwagon is a fan favorite, due to his overreacting attitude, and overall strange uses, such as the infamous \"seal abilities\".\\n\\n\r\nPart 2's cast is much bigger, and ultimately much more entertaining. Joseph is a blast, arguably one of the funniest Jojos (that I've seen so far), and his companion Ceasar Zepelli is a bit of a badass, despite his...less then intimidating abilities. The banter between the two is fantastic. Speedwagon is just as great int his part as well, and new additions like Lisa Lisa and Stroheim (one of my personal unexpected favorites) are really great additions too.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, for the longest time, I was turned off by Jojo, even the anime, due to it's slightly less-then-conventional art. By chance I saw the anime on a TV, and then I decided to give it a shot. No regrets. The art perfectly compliments the insane proportions of Araki's creation, and even beyond it's really great. I still have issues with it from time to time, but for the most part the art is really good, and compliments this anime perfectly. The animation is of a consistent quality throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings to both the Parts,  for Phantom Blood; \"JoJo (Sono Chi no Sadame)\" and Battle Tendency \"Bloody Stream\" are an absolute blast, and some of the best openings released in 2012. The ending theme, \"Roundabout\" perfectly compliments the style of Araki's writing, which names many characters after famous Western singers and bands, such as Dio and R.E.O Speedwagon. The music within the show is generally pretty good, but beyond the openings, and the insert song employed in the final episode, it isn't anything that really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is a standout anime; not just because it's a damn good anime, but because it's unique in it's character design, which David Production has recreated Araki's style perfectly, and produced what is more or less a pseudo cult anime. Jojo is absolute blast, and any minor issues I have with the show are blown away due to the fact that it's really just an absolute ton of fun. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was one of my favorite anime of 2012, behind maybe just Psycho-ass, but it will go down as one of the most unique and acclaimed anime in a while, and just like it's original manga, will maintain a healthy a devoted fan base.",

The first story starts off interesting but right in the middle it kinda looses interest to regain it with its last episodes. The second part was way better  it had a lot more amounts of action and a little better chracter development than the first part. Generally speaking this anime is full of exaggerations but you will not watch this anime for its realism anywaybut for it's awesome battles and hillarius dialogues. Don't be discouraged by the first story the second one will pay off for whatever complaints you had with the first one.\\n\\n\r\nArt; The animation was soooo good. It changed from light to dark and grotesque. The fights were animated so beutifully you actually believe you are reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSound: SONO CHI NO SADAMEE JOOOOOOJOOOO!!! The first opening was the manliest I have ever heard. The second one was good but kinda boring from some point on. I didn't hear the ending not even once though :p. The voice actors did an excelet job from the good guy Jonathan and the random Speedwagon to vicious Dio and clever Joseph every character was palyed out really good by their seiyuus.\\n\\n\r\nCharater: Now there was a huge difference between those two parts. The first part had a boring main character but an awesome villain. The second had an awesome protagonist but kinda boring antagonists. Generally all the characters in this anime especially in the first part are very one-sided. Normally I would have a problm with that but no in this anime. It's story is so ridiculous that the characters had to be ridiculous to. It also had the most badass Nazi soldier that we had to see since the Major from Hellsing XD.\\n\r\nEnjoyments; I really enjoyed this anime. Especially the second part was very good full of action and exagerations. The first was also good. I had a great time watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; Don't get me wrong the first part is also good and necessary in order to understand some things in the second part. Don't get discouraged if you get bored of the first part I guarantee that you will love the second part.\\n\\n",

            "content": "JoJo is one of those generic anime--\r\n\"Well, I let you know that before your Naruto, Fairy Tail  came in, we had JoJo. JoJo is the root of all Shonen (Now Seinen).\"\r\nWell... Umm... Okay. The show is indeed Bizarre so even though it had its generic moments it's fine, but there are things that I dislike about this show.\r\nSTORY:\r\nIf you're still clueless about the story, we follow this guy named JoJo and we follow him through his bizarre adventures. For more information, read the synopsis. written by MAL.\r\nIf you love Shonen anime, you'll get easily hook by the show, which Idid got hook. This season didn't answer a lot of questions from its plot, but hey, we already got Stardust Crusaders and Diamond is Unbreakable (Which I'll watch soon). \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story's biggest downfall is its pacing. The first part (first half) of JoJo has a very fast pacing. They didn't took time developing Erina and JoJo and they didn't took time on JoJo's training with the two characters at the second half which I even forgot their names because they're forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nFast-pacing leads to forgettable...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nNot the main characters of course. The JoJo(s. Let's leave that letter there.) aren't forgettable. However, this anime doesn't really take time to develop some of its minor characters because of its horrible pacing.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some forgettable characters, JoJo, JoJo, and the villains of this show are actually entertaining to watch despite the show being kind of generic. I guess it's generic, because it is bizarre. We'll get onto that part later.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\r\nThe colors and shadings of this show is really impressive and I like how it switches its colors on moments that are intense and bizarre. Though, the animation doesn't really have smooth or \"sakuga\" moments unlike other action shows that I've watch. For the soundtrack, it's something that I have to get used to. I didn't really get in with its OP themes, but they actually get catchy once you listen to them all over again. For the OSTs, there are good ones, but then there are okay ones.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI did say that it shows some generic moments, but what makes this different from other shows is that this show is aware of its generic moments because heck, it is bizarre. However, what turns me off is its fast-pacing story (at some parts) and some of its minor characters are completely forgettable. The show didn't really do a good job on making them shine.\\n\\n\r\nI heard Stardust Crusaders is good, so I hope that lives up to the hype as I'm going to watch it soon.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 6/10",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is one of those anime that I hear about a lot, but haven't seen. The manga was written by Araki Hirohiko and has been adapted into several OVAs and a longer tv anime. We'll be looking at the longer series from David Production, a studio that has rendered assistance for some anime I've seen like Code Geass R2, Soul Eater and Black Butler, but has never been the main force behind any anime I've seen. Let's take a look at Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and try and find out what the fuss is about. \r\nThe story begins when a young aristocrat named JonathanJoestar aka Jojo meets another young man named Dio Brando whose going to live with him and his family. Dio is a comically over the top evil character and this leads to him and Jojo coming into conflict. Meanwhile, the Joestar's have a strange stone mask that Jonathan is trying to find the secret of. The first half of the anime covers Jonathan's conflict with Dio and the secret of the stone mask. The second half covers an adventure with Jonathan's grandson, Joseph, also called Jojo, and the origin of the mask. The story in this is pretty weak. A lot of what happens is incredibly predictable and they also explain it through exposition, in a very over the top way, just to make it very obvious. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have our characters. The cast of this is pretty cliche. The female characters kind of get a raw deal, most of them not getting to say or do much. The villains especially tend to be one-dimensional evil for the evils types of characters. To give an example, one of the first things Dio does is kick a puppy for no reason except that kicking a puppy is evil and he's working on being one of the most unsubtle villains ever. Most of the characters are named after rock bands from the 70s and 80s, Dio, ACDC, Wham, Cars, Robert E.O. Speedwagon and so on. It's not the worst naming scheme I've ever seen in an anime, but it is pretty ridiculous. The only character in this I really like is Joseph. He's kind of a cliche cunning protagonist, but he's a lot of fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style in this oozes machismo. The characters are large and heavily muscled, some to the point where they don't even have human proportions. It's not as bad as your average 90s superhero comic, but it is pretty noticeable. The action sequences tend to be interrupted pretty frequently by posing and reaction shots because posing while in a fight for your life is the best possible plan. \\n\\n\r\nThis series got some really good voice actors like Koyasu Takehito, Sugita Tomokazu, and Tanaka Atsuko. But the acting in this is really over the top and exaggerated. The music is pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. There's no yuri in this. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is actually pretty enjoyable. It shouldn't be. The story is weak, the characters are weak, but the exaggerated execution makes it pretty amusing in the same way that Adam West's Batman is enjoyable. It's over the top and cheesy and that makes it fun. Honestly, a lot of shows like this end up being over the top and goofy because of incompetence, but I think it's deliberate here and it's pretty glorious. I have to give the series a 7/10 just for the exaggerated goofiness that's so entertaining and Joseph. If you're looking for a serious series with a compelling story and developed characters, this isn't going to be for you. If you want something so exaggerated and over the top that it's hilarious, this series is sure to entertain you.",

            "content": "So here I am with my second review, this time about Jojo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventure.\r\nAs with my last review, feedback will be very appreciated. Well then let\u00b4s begin\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nThe story of Jojo\u00b4s is quite simple and straightforward, we have our villain that wants to take over the world and our protagonist that wants to defeat the villain and save humanity.\r\nThe thing about this series is that it doesn\u00b4t take itself too seriously, I mean at all,\r\nbecause not much of what happens has any sense or logic, everything is over the top and they like to explain everything with our protagonist special power \"The Hamon\" (or Ripplein the dubbed version) that would be Jojo\u00b4s equivalent of other powers like the Ki from DBZ.\\n\r\nSo, in the end, they do all kind of things that defies logic and the laws of Physics and the only explanation that we get is \"Because Hamon can do it\".\\n\r\nBut, as I said before, this series doesn\u00b4t take itself too seriously, it is one of those series in which you have to turn your brain off in order to watch and enjoy.\\n\r\nAnother thing about this series is that it has two stories in it, because it addapts parts 1 and 2 from the manga, being the first arc Phantom Blood, that lasts 9 episodes, and the second arc, which I found more enjoyable than the first, Battle Tendency that lasts the remaining 17 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nThe character design was quite strange for me because every man in this series was so big and muscular and, until now, I wasn\u00b4t really accustomed to this so it was kinda weird to watch the series at first, but once once I got used to it, i ended up liking the artstyle. Another strange thing about the artstyle were the colours that were used because they were shiny and vibrant they changed very often, for example in one second you have a red house and the in the other one you have a blue house, although this kind of change was often seen in the battle scenes, and was made to match the over the top nature of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nThe background music for the first part is rather orchestral and it fits to the tone and ambientation of this arc so it does it\u00b4s job quite well. But in the second arc ,when the ambientation changes, this background music gets replaced by jazz, funk and, most of the time, dubstep. \\n\r\nI\u00b4m not joking, we have dubstep in this show. So, while it matches the tone of the arc well, it can be quite weird watching a battle, for example, and hearing dubstep on the background sometimes.\\n\r\nNow as for the voice acting, while most of the characters are well done, the real stars for me are Sugita Tomokazu (the voice of Sakata Gintoki of Gintama and Kyon from Haruhi Suzumiya) as Joseph Joestar and Koyasu Takehito (the voice of Katasugi Shinsuke in Gintama) as Dio Brando, they really make a great representation of their characters.\\n\r\nAs for the openings and endings, the first opening is JoJo ~Sono Chi no Sadame~ by Hiroaki TOMMY Tominaga, and the second one is Bloody stream by Coda, and both are very catchy and fit the show very well.\\n\r\nThe ending is Roundabout by the legendary band YES, and it was a damn good ending, plus because it is a song of 8:29 minutes long they were able to change the part of the song in the ending from chapter to chapter, which was quite awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nMost of the characters in this series were quite simple and, during the first arc, even cliche.\\n\r\nJonathan Joestar is the typical shonen protagonist, he is kind, strong, always tries to protect everyone and is a true gentleman. Then we\u00b4ve got Dio Brando, the villain that is evil just because he likes to be evil and Speedwagon, Jonathan\u00b4s sidekick, that is useless in battle but is still loyal as a dog.\\n\r\nThen in the second arc the characters become more complex and more likeable than in the first arc, even the villains are more entertaining to watch.\\n\r\nIn this part the protagonist Joseph Joestar, Jonathan\u00b4s grandson, is more impulsive and rude than Jonathan but this is actually what makes him more likeable.\\n\r\nThen the sidekick, Caesar A. Zeppeli, a character that is the complete opposite of Joseph and is actually useful in battle.\\n\r\nthis is actually what made Battle Tendency far more enjoyable than Phantom Blood for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nIn the end what matters most while watching a show like Jojo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventure is the enjoyment.\\n\r\nSo did I enjoy it?\\n\r\nAbsolutely yes!\\n\r\nThis show is just mindless fun and if you don\u00b4t try to explain everything with logic and go with the flow of the series, is a very entertaining show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nWether you like this show or not will be decided by your ability to turn your brain off so if you enjoy over the top series like Gurren Laggan and you are looking for a show that is just to have a good time, you will probably love Jojo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventure.",

            "content": "Jojo's is a wild, bizarre, eccentric, extravagant and manly anime. The art is very well-done, very well animated and colorful throughout the show. It makes it beautiful but it can also show emphasis during a scene, like when the colors get inverted for example. The music is also pretty good, especially the opening during Part 1. The voice acting is pretty decent too (I've watched the english dub) and the actors are good at screaming when their characters are screaming, and they scream rather often. It doesn't sound like they are just speaking loudly.\r\nThe show loves exposition and obviousness, I can't tell you enough. Literallyalmost everything that happens will be repeated. While I found it annoying af in other anime, it's sort of ok and even funny here. The anime remains fast-paced anyway, so they just make sure you're never lost on what's happening, no biggie here. The battles are rather interesting and are filled with twists and strategies.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode sucks ass, I'll be honest. The second episode too, mostly. I know they are set-ups for bigger things but they were terrible. People shouldn't have to tolerate something until it gets better. The characters have good designs but their personalities are weak. The struggles of Jonathan and Dio can be summed up as good gentleman vs evil gentleman and they are perhaps the most fleshed out characters of part 1.\\n\\n\r\nJonathan is a super good guy but first and foremost he's a gentleman. But he's not only nice, he's also fierce, hard to topple and he will never give up. It's better than triumphing simply because you are a goodie-goodie nice guy. Dio is pretty much a bully for no reason. He hates his dad so he wants to be rich and powerful and steal that status from Jonathan. Then he becomes a vampire and want to rule the world, for some reason. I think a good villain is important and that is rather weak villain. But I found him ok still, because his immense power and badassery is a good opponent to test out how resilient and fierce Jojo is.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2 is... kind of good but not really.The villains were pretty pathetic and uninteresting, except for Wamuu who had a certain sense of warrior honor. The \"good\" characters weren't much more interesting either. Other than Stroheim, characters were rather lame and forgettable, although Stroheim was extremely redundant, I still liked him because I liked everything that came out of his mouth (especially with that accent). Joseph gets old fast, even if his strategies and unpredictability make good fights. I found it funny that an anime with a main character being able to predict what his opponents are going to say and do, was predictable in itself. I couldn't tell how stuff was going to happen, but I could tell what was going to happen, I am not boasting, it is just really obvious that X character is going to win, or would draw out from the fight and have a rematch later, or that a character would lose because it was someone else who was meant to defeat that particular opponent.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this anime is the plot holes and ass pulls. This is going into the spoiler territory so I will not mention anything, but it is just extremely jarring. Remember when I said the anime loves exposition and obviousness? How it is predictable? Can you imagine if something happened and it was badly or never explained? It pissed me off. Especially near the final episodes, where there is a bunch of of ass pulls and plot holes in a short lapse of about 10 minutes. One is even lamp-shaded. Let that sink in. I found that disappointing. Maybe I am thinking too hard about it and worrying too much about the story while *maybe* it's the magnificience and manliness I should be focusing on, but I've read and been told it was flawless and a masterpiece, so my expectations were set as such. This is no masterpiece in my opinion. It shines in other aspects and is good entertainment, but it has room for improvement.",

            "content": "Yes, I am a jojo fan. I read all the manga (on 8). I'll try to keep the baised opinions to a minimum.\r\nStory: Very easy to pick up, as you would expect with any shonen. But as a shonen, it is quite generic. Well, Phantom Blood was written around the time of Dragonball, so I'm not too surprised. I do like the concept of ripple energy though. Also, every character has a habit of explaining everything, every move, every object, every attack in detail, so it might get a tad annoying (though I don't mind it).\r\nArt: Araki's stronest point. JoJo is beyond famous for itsunique art style and fabulous extravagent poses. After watching this show you will be gay for Dio, just like everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Opening and ending are godlike. Soundtrack is not great, but not too bad either. It doesn't stand out like Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere, soul soothing like Yosuga no Sora or hype like Gurren Lagann. Okitsu does a pretty good job of playing Johnathan considering he mainly did supporting roles in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Generic. Villan is evil because 'I am evil'. Main character is gentleman. Sidekick is mr. explanation. But like I said earlier, this was written during the time of dragonball hype.",

            "content": "Warning This Review Contains Spoilers \r\nI apologize in Advance for any spelling or grammatical errors.  If I make any feel free to point them out on my profile page  \r\nIntoduction \r\nJoJo,JoJo,JoJo,JoJo.  You have probably heard about this show or have seen a meme from this show without knowing it (like \"Even Speedwagon is afraid\", or \"It was me Dio\").  I heard about this show from Gigguk, The Quater Guy, and ThatAnimeSnob and they got me  interested.  After marathoning the series for a couple nights, I realized why this show was awesome and hopefully my review will tell you too.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one defining characteristic of JoJo it would be the GAR, manly men doing manly things.  What do these men do? They fight, pose, and act dramatically.  The show is aware of what it wants to be and executes that brilliantly.  Also, alot of the characters are named after old western musicians and groups so there is that(except for Stroheim who is named after an actor and that is the only one as far as I know).  \\n\\n\r\nNow on to the premise, JoJo tells the story of generations of the Joestar family fighting against the forces of evil.  As a side note, this is the perfect way to do long running Shonen.  With this formula the author can can tell different types of stories without the story, character, and setting ever growing stale.  This anime adapts the first 2 parts of the Jojo manga Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency.  Which will be described bellow.  \\n\\n\r\nPhantom Blood (episodes 1-9):  The story that started it all and the cause of mostly everything happens later in the other parts.  The main character, Johnathan Joestar (the alliteration is where the nickname Jojo comes from), is forced to deal with Dio Brando, his adopted brother, who quickly becomes his archenemy.  Along the way a Stone Mask within the Joestar's possession is found with the weird ability to sprout spike whenever blood is put on it (we will get back to this later).  The hatred of the two characters grows, culminating in Dio poisoning Johnathan's father and as Johnathan finds the cure (along the way meeting Robert Edward O. Speedwagon who also has a major role over the other parts) Dio realizes the Stone Mask has the ability to transform anyone who wears it with blood on it  becomes a vampire.  This climaxes when Dio puts on the mask (becoming a vampire), kills Johnathan's father, destroys the Joestar house, and nearly dies.  Following the incident, Johnathan meets Will A. Zeppeli who teaches him the ancient art of Hamon, the ability to connect ones energy to the sun by controlled breathing and both of them along with Speedwagon goes after Dio and his newly created zombie army.  This entire part has an epic feel to it and I mean literal ancient poem epicness (like Beowulf).  Two men who have their destines intertwined and fight locking the protagonist's ancestors to fight against similar evils.  I mean how does not that not sound like something the ancient storytellers would come up with. The only flaw with this story that it is rushed, sometimes even narrating over events that happen.\\n\\n\r\nBattle Tendency (episodes 10-26):  This takes place 50 years after Phantom Blood and picks up with Johnathan's ancestor, Joseph, who stills has the ability to use Hamon.  After a discovery by The Speedwagon Foundation (an organization created because Speedwagon struck oil and got rich) a former ally of Johnathan attacks Joseph and after that Joseph goes to save Speedwagon from the Nazis (since it the 1940s and World War II had started).  The Nazis found an ancient humanoid who they intend to use to win the war, but it goes rouge and Joseph kills it.  The head Nazi commander, Rudol von Stroheim, tells of three more of the ancient humanoids (called the Pillar Men) and Joseph goes after them.  He meets Will's ancestor, Caesar, and they both go after the Pillar Men, but they awaken.  The Pillar Men are looking for the Red Stone of Aja, a perfect gemstone which when combined with the stone mask can turn the pillar men into ultimate lifeforms.  On top of that, two of the Pillar Men place rings in Joseph's body that will poison him if he does not beat them and take the respective antidotes.  Joseph and Caesar vow to kill the Pillar Men and avenge their fallen comrades.  With the help of their new teacher, Lisa Lisa, they will train to further master Hamon and take out the pillar men.  This ramps up everything in Phantom Blood; even more fights, more poses, and more GAR.  On top of that it expands on the mythology present in the Phantom Blood.  Like Phantom Blood however it does narrate over the story which is even worse now since their were parts I wanted to see (like cyborg Stroheim fighting the leader of the Pillar Men, Kars).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nPhantom Blood:  Johnathan is the archetypal hero. He has kind heart, helps those in need, and is a true gentleman.  He is the perfect hero for these episodes, fitting the epic theme.  As a side note, Johnathan was interesting since he was of the only foreign main characters created during the time the manga was running in the late 80s (Johnathan was British) and also died at the end.  Dio is also the archetypal villain a jerk and a bully who grows more cruel as he gets older.  He is a great foil for Johnathan and does get a small bit of character development in the end when he grows to respect Johnathan after he beats him and tries to take over Johnathan's body (he was just a severed head at the time).  The thing that makes these characters stand out is how GAR they are as stated before.\\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters we have Speedwagon is weird (not the character himself, but his place in the story).  He doesn't really do anything except for helping Johnathan in the beginning, but I really like him.  I guess he is a useless character done right just a guy who supports Johnathan after seeing how good he was.  Will is interesting being a good mentor figure and helping Johnathan.  Johnathan also has a love interest, Erina Pendleton, who I would criticize for being a simple love interest, but it actually has a contextual reason for being that way  (that reason is because it was the 1800s and women had no rights during the time period), but she does have a bit of impudence and a temper.  The final side character I will mention is Bruford, a knight Dio revived as a zombie, who also grew to respect Johnathan after he beat him and gave Johnathan his sword which played a major role in the fight with Dio.  The rest are not important, except for Johnathan's father George who was the main catalyst for this plot (for bringing Dio into the Joestar family and dying, giving Johnathan his main motivation). \\n\\n\r\nBattle Tendency:  Joseph stands in contrast to Johnathan by being his opposite.  He is playful and aggressive.  His fighting style also contrasts with Johnathan; whereas Johnathan used Hamon to power up his physical attacks, Joseph uses Hamon in more of a subtle way, utilizing tons of objects and tricks to outsmart his opponents.  He still has the good heat, but isn't afraid to violently attack his enemies.  He also has this weird ability to predict what his opponents will say and shock them with it.  He also invented the ultimate technique, running away when the opportunity present it. The antagonists are not as good as Dio, but still good villains in their own right.  Wamuu is an honorable warrior and extends his honor to his enemies (going so far as to give Joseph time to train and beat him and respecting Joseph and Caesar).  Esidisi is sly and cunning, using these traits to help Kars.  Kars is ruthless and intelligent, doing whatever it takes to complete his goals.  He also has a weird respect for nature, except when he becomes the ultimate lifeform and hurts a squirrel (jerk).\\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters, Caesar is a good companion for Joseph and they play off of each other very well.  For example, they contrast when Caesar  tries to carry on his ancestry, despite putting himself at risk and, Joseph who doesn't give a damn, stops his recklessness.  Lisa Lisa is also a good mentor, keeping a strict and calm composure in her teaching, except when Caesar dies when she loses it.  Stroheim is a weird case like Speedwagon because he is the one of the few Nazis in fiction I like legitimately (and I am Jewish).  He has all the characteristics of the Nazis (except the hatred of Jews), but he doesn't take them to fascist extremes.  He is nationalistic, but more in a \"fuck yeah America\" way and actually tries to help Joseph and his allies defeat the Pillar Men.  His motivation comes from pride in his country, not from hatred of anyone.  Just a good guy with a horrible group of people.  Speedwagon is also there, but not for long and Erina played the brief role of the strict grandmother expanding on her inner impudence and a kid named Smokey who Joseph saves.  There is also another love interest, Suzie Q, who is more of a ditz, but also still caring and nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art is luscious and beautiful.  While some fans (from what I heard) complained about how it lacked the detail of Hirohiko Araki's, the author, artwork  I personally liked it.  It amplifies the GAR of this show and married it to flamboyancy which sounds like it would clash, but works extremely well together.  There is also cool visual tricks like the Japanese word for menacing appearing in dark letters whenever danger approached or everyone's color changing for dramatic effect.  On top of that great cgi is used for the openings. The ending animation is good, but not outstanding although the second ending does continue where the first left off animation wise(the first ended with blood reaching the stone mask and the second ending starts with stone mask breaking). \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nJoJo's soundtrack is incredibly varied ranging from dramatic pieces with symphonies (I think), to dubstep, synthpop, and rock.  The music fits the tone of the story and like the art amplifies it.  Some of my favorites include Awaken my Masters and both Theme songs (since there are 2).  The first theme is Sono Chi no Sadame which fits the serious, but over the top tone of Phantom Bloodand bloody stream which fits the playful, but in the end serious (along with over the top) tone of battle Tendency.  As for the ending its Roundabout.  Yes that Roundabout by Yes. Araki as I recall actually requested for this song to be the ending.  It fits with JoJo's tie to classic rock music and is one of the only anime to use western music as an ending theme. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nJojo is a breath of fresh air and a great show.  With its GAR, beautiful animation, and great music I enjoyed 99% of this show (the other 1% not enjoyed is the narration over some of the story).   I definitely recommend JoJo's Bizarre Adventure to all lovers of action and GAR.  If you liked this show I would recommend Tengen Toppan Gurren Lagann for its  GAR and over the top action.",

            "content": "JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure is perhaps one of the most genuinely honest titles I\u2019ve ever seen for a series. Born from Hirohiko Araki\u2019s long-running love child, JoJo earns its multitudes of fans, both Western and Eastern alike, through its compelling lore, inventive aesthetics, unconventional soundtrack, and authentic characters.\r\nNext, you\u2019re going to say, \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re talking it up a bit. Why would I like it?\u201d Well\u2026\r\nWill you like it?\r\nYou may enjoy JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure if you\u2026\r\n-- thrive in series with rich, interesting characters and lores\r\n-- enjoy historical themes and settings\r\n-- have a taste for classic and alternative rock music\r\n-- appreciate shows that try to pursuemore of a Western tone\\n\\n\r\nYou may not enjoy JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure if you\u2026\\n\r\n-- generally avoid action-themed or combat heavy series\\n\r\n-- dislike anime that are heavy in dialogue\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure adapts the first two \u201cparts\u201d from the eponymous manga series, \u201cPhantom Blood\u201d (ep. 1-9) and \u201cBattle Tendency\u201d (ep. 10-26). Each respective part features a new primary protagonist and antagonist, with some supporting characters persisting between parts. As I have yet to experience the manga, I cannot attest to the legitimacy of the adaptation, and this review is solely for the 2012 anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cPhantom Blood\u201d is set in 19th century Great Britain and concerns itself with the conflict between wealthy nobleman Johnathan Joestar and spiteful youth Dio Brando. Dio\u2019s father, Dario, had saved Johnathan\u2019s father years before from a tragic death. Though he was a rotten, selfish man, Dario\u2019s dying wish was that Dio be raised in the esteemed house of Joestar so that he may secure a life of wealth. Johnathan and Dio grow to be bitter rivals, as the latter seeks to take the fortunes of house Joestar for himself. With the power of a stone mask, Dio seeks to usurp what he believes rightfully his no matter the cost, even his own blood.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBattle Tendency\u201d situates itself in fifty years after the events of \u201cPhantom Blood\u201d and under a new member of the Joestar clan, Joseph. Though physically similar in their gargantuan statures, Joseph is nothing like the gentleman his father was. With the true nature of the previously mentioned stone mask revealed, Joseph is drawn into a conflict leashed to his destiny, forcing the shrewd young man to continue his grandfather\u2019s quest to save the world.\\n\\n\r\nYou would think with the awkward nine to seventeen episode spread between parts that the pacing proves awkward, but you more or less glide through each arc, and the transition between parts was a smooth one. JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure is inherently and stylistically fast-paced, and rarely (if at all) will you find yourself bored or disinterested. It helps too that Joseph Joestar, the protagonist of \u201cBattle Tendency\u201d, proves an extremely entertaining character, making up for what time was lost with the also enjoyable Johnathan Joestar of \u201cPhantom Blood\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, it\u2019s hard to call it a \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d story for either character, but it\u2019s somewhat similar to that in its origins as a \u2018shounen\u2019. The whole \u201cadventure\u201d aspect does provide an immense amount of growth for both characters, as both JoJos were ripped from their comfort zones and forced into a destiny with dire consequences. Perhaps a little more.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nAt it\u2019s manly core, JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure is a series centered around action, and boy does it seriously impress with its intricate fighting scenes. The impact of blows are felt considerably as they\u2019re accompanied by proper visual and auditory queues that really add another dimension to them. A lot of thought and strategy also goes into each fight, as the protagonists (and antagonists, even) prove to be more than just walking sacks of muscle. Joseph, notably, retains a knack for trapping and fooling his enemies, laying them super quick while he distracts them with his dialogue. Combat, this way, becomes more of a game of wits, not just measure of strength, bringing a marriage of both brain and brawn to the table.\\n\\n\r\nThough most characters are seriously ripped, mere mortal strength is hardly a proper tool to combat beings of supernatural power. Rather than making use of weapons or some form of magic, the protagonists assume the mystical art of \u201cHamon\u201d, a source of energy born from controlled breathing. This magical power allows an ordinary man to unlock his mortal shell, promoting himself to superhuman levels of ability. Various techniques are learned and mastered under the art of Hamon, known frequently as \u201coverdrives\u201d, that perform specific effects depending on the nature of the Hamon utilized and intended target. I consider this battle art to be a creative way to empower the characters, especially since I\u2019d never heard anything like it before. It has its clear weaknesses and doesn\u2019t lead any one user to become overpowered or immune to threat, granting even the most minute sense of realism in an otherwise irrational world.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the lore of the series is grounded in the supernatural, notably inspired from South American tribal and European vampiric mythologies. The catalyst of action in JoJo stems from a Joestar family heirloom, a stone mask of Aztec origin that reacts violently to contact with blood. It\u2019s far more nefarious purpose is explained a few episodes into \u201cPhantom Blood\u201d, and it retains relevance all the way through the series, permanently impacting the characters and their futures yet to come. Without revealing too much, in addition to the mysterious mask, creatures such as vampires, zombies, and ghouls exist as combatants that each JoJo must face in their respective adventures. Though they\u2019re generally interesting, a few enemies seem to have inconsistent power levels, and some felt boring in their design, but I emphasize that this is a minority.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, there is a considerable Western influence to the world of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. Spanning settings such as rural England, urban London, arid Mexico, and scenic Italy, Westerners will find themselves comfortable with far more familiar environments and cultures that helps to engage viewers in the world\u2019s expansive lore. Not only does it bridge cultural gaps, but it also helps set it apart from other fighting anime in this respect, most of which are seemingly centered in Japanese settings.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the single thing that truly holds the series back for me is that there is an overwhelming amount of character narration, where the \u201cshow-don\u2019t-tell\u201d rule is often violated in favor of dialogue-driven exposition. While in a lesser series I would view this with more scrutiny, JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure at least succeeds in having brilliantly entertaining characters to deliver said narration, notably with Robert E.O. Speedwagon. I can\u2019t say it hasn\u2019t bothered me at several points throughout the series having to sit through dialogue explaining what is easily visible.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure offers a one-of-a-kind animating style that\u2019s a experience in and of itself. Studio David Production really outdid themselves with creating perhaps one of the most aesthetically inventive series in recent years. Few anime have a look in which you can look at a singular frame and tell instantly where it\u2019s from just based on looks. Rather than a specific element making the animation shine, several unique elements function together to create the visual medley that is the animation.\\n\\n\r\nManliness is not only expressed in each character\u2019s personalities and voices. Any artist would be considerably impressed with the plethora of ways muscular compositions have not only been drawn but exaggerated. Further, the various poses stand out as one of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure\u2019s characteristic trademarks, with each unique stance oozing in personality and individuality.\\n\\n\r\nOnomatopoeia are quite often visually describe in the form of their respective Japanese character representations, notably shown in the iconic \u300c\u30b4\u30b4\u30b4 \u300d or \u2018menacing\u2019 text. These non-diegetic elements apply strong flavors to particular scenes that help to emphasize the intended effect, impact, or tone of a situation. They are never introduced ad nauseam, rather they\u2019re always implemented creatively and warrant appreciation when shown.\\n\\n\r\nFor perhaps the strangest artistic touch,  there\u2019s a distinct act of swapping color palettes throughout the series. These shifts generally reflect a sharp shift in tone or threat, visually representing that which is usually felt. It\u2019s a weird form of synthesia that helps enrich the quality of a given scene, further garnishing the overall experience of viewing.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe exceptionally diverse soundtrack proves to be one of the series\u2019 most outstanding qualities, as each part\u2019s respective OST offer music virtually anyone could enjoy. The various themes for characters or settings aptly fit the characters and play with fantastic timing.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal creator Hirohiko Araki\u2019s musical taste noticeably bled out into his writing, as an overwhelming amount of characters are named after noteworthy rock groups of years past. Honestly, it\u2019s hilarious to learn of a new character because you can quickly match them to the band/group for whom they were named (Dire/Straizo => Dire Straits, Robert E.O. Speedwagon => REO Speedwagon, and Esidisi => AC/DC to name a few).\\n\\n\r\nEach and every seiyuu managed to give amazingly convincing performances, with the main characters shining particularly. The stylistic performance of each voice actor could be akin to that of what you\u2019d expect from a professional play, in terms of emotion, impact, and presence.\\n\\n\r\nNoting even further home runs batted by the series, both openings are among the best throughout anime, both visually and audibly. The lyrics of the OPs match up well with the series, and as their purposes are to introduce and invest a viewer into a series, this is necessary of a proper opening. \u201cSono Chi No Sadame\u201d, the opening for \u201cPhantom Blood\u201d perfectly explains the conflict of the particular arc and the consequence of destiny in both young Johnathan and Dio\u2019s lives. \u201cBloody Stream\u201d, the opening of \u201cBattle Tendency\u201d serves as not only a visual treat but one that too understands the story in lyrical format. In regards to the ending, with only one present for all twenty-six episodes (though spliced differently per episode), British rock group Yes\u2019 \u201cRoundabout\u201d plays after the iconic \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d conclusion. Again, if you like rock music, you\u2019re going to find yourself at home with the anime\u2019s soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWe can talk all day about how good the series looks, sounds, and progresses, but what makes JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure is the characters. Few anime can claim to have such rich, heavily developed, personalized, and exciting characters.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the protagonists, Jonathan Joestar epitomizes what it means to be a 19th century English gentlemen: polite, studious, and robust. William A. Zeppeli introduces himself as a master of the Hamon technique, becoming the teacher to Johnathan. His status in the story is that of the wise teacher.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph Joestar proves a stark contrast to his grandfather in all aspects except the physical. Witty, sarcastic, and temperamental, Joseph makes a name for himself as a laissez-faire joker on the outside but a caring, shrewd hero on the inside. Of the two,  Joseph is my favorite JoJo, though not to discredit his grandfather in the slightest. Caesar Zeppeli exists as Joseph\u2019s foil and rival, though the two grow to develop a sort of bromance over time. His contrasting attitude helps cultivate a healthy rivalry for Joseph, much the opposite of what Johnathan endured with Dio.\\n\\n\r\nI always thought it was cool how the protagonists progressively change in the form of family, with the protagonists primarily encompassing the Joestar and Zeppeli family lines. It\u2019s certainly one of the more creative ways to say \u201cpass the torch\u201d between primary characters, and each successive generation shares enough traits while proving individual in their own rights.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the antagonists, Dio Brando initiates himself as quite the relatable individual. Though not without his inexcusable flaws, we understand that his lust for power and wealth stems heavily from his abusive, neglectful childhood. Going from having nothing at all to potentially the world at your finger-tips can shock a man, and Dio,  despite his calm, collected outer shell, proves one easily tempted by delusions of grandeur. As the story progresses, Dio develops more into a maniacal tyrant as he becomes consumed by his own ambition. He is perhaps one of my favorite anime villains.\\n\\n\r\nThe Pillar Men, without divulging too much information, exist as a group of warriors bound wholly to their code of honor, strength, and superiority,  utilizing any means to achieve their goal of becoming the perfect being. Their interactions with Joseph and the rest are very much analogous to series with alien characters, as the Pillar Men having been resting for so long made them completely disconnected with the human condition. Each individual had his own distinct perspectives and attitudes, allowing for a more dynamic \u201cantagonist\u201d than you\u2019d experience with just one character.\\n\\n\r\nA variety of notable secondary characters populate the world of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, most notably including Robert E.O. Speedwagon, vagrant-turned-tycoon and friend to the Joestars, Lisa Lisa, threatening yet poised Hamon instructor, Erina Pendleton, English noblewoman and love interest of Johnathan, and Rudol von Stroheim, borderline insane German officer. I could go on all day about each of the respective characters, and they truly are great, but it\u2019s best that you experience them at full value through watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure will forever stand as one of the most iconic Western-oriented series.. The various memes, references, and fans it\u2019s spawned over the last few years serve as proof for its massive cultural impact in the field of Japanese animation. If you consider yourself even remotely interested in the series, watch it. You wont regret it, and now you\u2019ll know where all those JoJo references came from.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s my fate, I accept it.\u201d - Joseph Joestar",

            "content": "I was told that this show was good, but I personally thought it sounded like a very bad show and I only gave a few episodes a shot because it had a vampire tag.  Even though it was only 5 episodes, I regret giving this show anytime after episode 1.  I kind of like the story with the mask, the incredible strength that Dio gets, and the super powers involved;unfortunately, none of these aspects seem to be executed in a good way.  The mask is cool and I like the supernatural powers it has, but there doesn't seem to be any majorexplanation concerning it and it only appears to cause trouble; I know 5 episodes out of 26 isn't much, but I wish they gave hints that there was going to be some cool information about the mask.  Even the super powers are boring.  It's good that a show is showing a strong protagonist rather than a wimp for a change, but the powers just aren't fun to watch and the way they're shown make it seem like the character is more overpowered than certain well-known over-powered characters in other animes, like Kirito, Saitama, etc. \\n\\n\r\n Besides being over-powered, both Dio, Jonathan,a and Jonathan's dad just seem to stupid.  I refuse to believe that someone rich like Jonathan's dad would mistake what was obviously a man stealing his watch or whatever for a man trying to make sure he was alive.  Jonathan wasn't any better since he actually thought someone who kicked his dog so forcefully for no good reason after stepping onto their property, actually became friends with him over 7 years.  Dio just seems to act without thinking things through, but unlike other characters with that type of rash behavior, his just doesn't seem justified and he's purely driven by money and power, but doesn't even seem to have as much fun with it as others do..  I don't understand why these characters are so well liked unless it's just because they act manly.   \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes aren't even good; they just sound awful and they're very off putting for me; they sound like extremely poorly written cartoon hero show songs.  Overall, I'm giving this a 3/10 just because it had more than 1 small thing that was interesting to me, but at the end of the day, it's just another macho-man show and it seems like a boring old time cursed item movie just with better graphics.",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. A 26 Episode series that is divided into two separate parts. The first 9 episodes make up Part 1, and the last 17 episodes make up Part 2. A series that is literally split, and my opinion of it is similarly split.\r\nThe show starts off pretty weak, crafting an unfocused, generic, and nonsensical story for the entirety of Part 1. Filled with mystical powers, crazy fighting, a boring setting, a generic anime villain, and a good chunk of forced drama with some characters that weren't developed and I didn't care about. It did little to pique my interest, but I enjoyed itenough to keep going.\\n\\n\r\nThe series didn't really pick up for me until I got to Episode 10, where Part 2 begins. The story remains nonsensical, but the setting and the characters both become much more interesting, making the second part of the series feel much more enjoyable. I also really like how in Part 2, the characters really drive the story, and turn the tale into something more interesting than it otherwise would have been. The pacing is somewhat inconsistent, but the whole thing kept my interest until the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show seems very accurate to the comic's art style, and I really love how they use stark, contrasting colors to evoke a certain tone in different scenes. However, the animation is inconsistent... sometimes things move smoothly, and other times, there's a lot of still frames and limited movement. This is probably due to the show's relatively small budget, but it still makes the art in the show seem like it could have been so much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is well done, even if it generally stays out of the way. There were a few times where I noticed the score, and thought it sounded nice, and really added to the tone of the scene, but none of it is very catchy. Well, that is, aside from the opening and closing themes, which are pretty great. The second opening in particular was really great, and super catchy. After a few episodes of listening to it, I would find myself singing along to it at the beginning of each episode. The soundtrack gets bonus points from me for that.\\n\r\nAs for the overall audio mix, it's got some high impact sound effects that are perfect for this kind of series, but they tended to repeat here and there, and the mix itself didn't blow my mind or anything. Still, quality work.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this series. It starts out weak, and even when it gets good, it's still a bit rough in a few spots, but the pros certainly outweigh the cons. Between the series' world, and it's characters, as well as the soundtrack, there's a lot to like here. By the end of it, it wrapped up the story nicely, and left a really good impression on me.",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, dear lord, what can I say about this anime other than that it definitely lives up to its name- it's bizarre. I'm going to say it flat out: the show is ridiculous in a good way. From the characters striking fabulous poses all over the place (you'll understand what I mean once you watch a few episodes) to the crazy battles, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is hype. In fact, it's even worth mentioning that Jojo's is so popular (or at least has enough cultural impact) in Japan that other anime airing during the same season directly reference it (OniAi and OreShura off thetop of my head).\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure spans multiple generations of the Joestar family and is split into two parts. Personally, I liked the second part better than the first part because the second is much more comedic (mostly due to Joseph's character) while the first part takes on a more serious tone. While the overarching story may not be that complex, the real draw isn't so much about the story as it is about the battles. Believe me when I say that, especially with some of the stuff that happens in the battles, you could never predict what happens unless you painstakingly took hours to consider everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. The battles are awesome and there were more than a few moments that made me go \"Holy crap!\" Something to mention about the anime is that it is campy, or extremely over-exaggerated, even until the very end. Relating to that, battles often have what I refer to as \"hype commentators\" that analyze what just happened or what is currently happening. While this isn't exactly unheard of, the way it happens in Jojo's often goes above and beyond what you might find in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the art and animation. The art style in Jojo's can be best described as clash of new and old, which is as it should be due to the fact that the manga was originally released in 1987. Even though I haven't read the manga, I can say based off simple observation that while the art style is indeed different, it definitely doesn't depart too drastically from the original. The character designs all have sharp and defined features, particularly in the face with most of the fighters being gigantic and ripped, the average person being, well, average, and the women's proportions are reasonable while still being able to look good and are never over-exaggerated. I never found the animation to be flat-out bad or too off in any aspect and, with some of the stunts that the characters pull off, that's impressive. It's worth mentioning that the anime animates the sound effects in certain scenes as if it were in a manga so you'll be seeing stuff like \u300c\u30b4\u30b4\u30b4\u30b4\u30b4\u30b4\u300dall over the place, which I found to be a cool touch and something that just added to the uniqueness of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure are a major draw to the series as well. The characters are varied and while some of them can fall into certain stereotypes, I never felt that they were bad characters. Take the two Jojos for example: Jonathan is a hulk of a man and the ideal gentleman while Joseph is a seemingly idiotic punk who is really a genius strategist. The eccentric cast of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is what truly brings the anime to life. All of the main cast are memorable and, in my eyes, all are irreplaceable. It is also worth mentioning that every character's name is based off songs or bands. This is most noticeable among the Pillar Men who are named Santana, ACDC, Wham, and Cars. While I don't think that the characters' personalities are meant to reflect the song or band they're based off of, I found it to be an interesting quirk nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure seems to be a mix of just about everything with its tracks ranging from jazz to flamenco to dubstep and often will mix these aspects into some interesting combinations. While there were times when the background music was a bit intrusive (the dubstep especially), the problem was minor overall and didn't take away very much from the experience as a whole. Both openings are wild and intense and I personally would be willing to consider the first opening, \"Jojo ~Sono Chi no Sadame~\", as the official anthem for the series. As for the ending, \"Roundabout\" by Yes, I was initially taken by surprise; I never expected an anime to ever have a song completely in English, let alone one from a legitimate English-speaking band who got its start in 1968. While I didn't really think the song fit the anime, I did appreciate the nod to old rock and the author's love of music.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is exactly as its name implies, bizarre. Everything is just so over-the-top that the anime quickly becomes ridiculous and with everything from ancient, half-clothed men to a blood-thirsty killer squirrel, the anime fully embraces its own ridiculousness and makes it its own. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a wild ride full of the delightfully unexpected and rightfully earns its place as one of the craziest anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\n9 out of 10",

            "content": "\"Nice catch!\" My favorite line of the whole anime describes the feelings I had when I found this one. \r\nJojo's bizarre adventure is the incarnation of what I expect from a shonen: Awesome fights that are appealing to the eye with a soundtrack that's supporting the scenery but not overwhelming it and Characters that surpass most of the ones we get to see from for example Naruto, Dbz etc. \r\nAnd would you believe it? This anime is based on a manga that was created in the late 80's and is still going. That must be one of the longest running shonen in history! ... Anywaysback to the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nWell, since the Myanimelist summary is pretty accurate, I don't need to go too deep into it. But a short explanation wouldn't be wrong, would it: \\n\r\nThe plot is divided into two parts: The first one is about Jonathan Joestar, the first JoJo, and his encounters with a mysterious mask that turns humans into vampires and his adopted brother Dio, who turns himself into one to rule over the world. On his way, Jojo1 encounters Speedwagon, a mobboss who joins JoJo1 on his journey after getting beat up but not killed by JoJo1 and zeppeli, who is a master of \"Hamon\" aka \"Ripple\" a force that equals the strength of light which was invented to defeat the vampires.\\n\r\nThe second one is about jojo2 (I forgot his name while writing this), who's the grandson of JoJo1. This is arch starts at I think episode 10 and goes all the way until episode 26, so it's pretty elaborate. \\n\r\nTo make it simple: JoJo2 has the power of Hamon aswell and needs to defeat the Pillarmen, a race of superhuman creatures which also want to achieve world domination. trust me, if I went deeper into the story it wouldn't have been spoilerfree.\\n\r\nI think it's a really interesting story with some things here and there that don't make any sense whatsoever but it's over all pretty well thought through.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nWell, the artstyle is simply put amazing. Every character looks beatiful, seriously, every single one. Backrounds are very detailed with great locations, the Minions look disgusting, as intended, but not in a bad way. They even put the SFX bubbles in there like for example when someone gets shot or punched really hard there's a huge (Japanese) logo saying \"BLAM\". I love that kind of thing. But what's most important is that the fights look amazing. You could stop at any frame during a fight and you'd have an awesome wallpaper. \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where this anime shines for me: The sound. Like I said, the openings look awesome, but they sound even better. I even bought the OST overseas just to listen to it all day long, especially the second OP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnHyj7G1kjI\\n\r\n....anyways. The soundtrack consists of Theatrical pieces, Jazz, Rock and....dubstep. Yeah, dubstep. But don't worry, the dubstep soundtracks used here sound awesome and underline the action that is happening pretty well. \\n\r\nThe voiceacting of the Japanese version is untouchable. You wanna know why? Because JoJo 2 is voiced by none other than Tomokazu Sugita, the voice of Gintoki from Gintama. His performance here is unbelievably good and should be heard by everyone. I'm being dead serious, especially because it fits so perfectly with the character. But not only his voice fits so good: Every character has a voice perfectly fitting. Especially the villains who always have an over the top \"I am better than you\" voice. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.....well.....Every character is unique, or I at least think they are because I have never seen characters like these before (I will only talk about the maincharacters because I'm lazy :D):\\n\r\nFirst arch: \\n\r\nJoJo1 is a gentleman with a lot of sympathy for basically everyone. He's not the smartest person I have ever seen but he's not your typical cardboard cutout maincharacter who eats a lot, makes silly decisions and basically acts like a retard (Looking at you Naruto, Luffy and SonGoku). His only fault is that he's too naive.\\n\\n\r\nDio: He's the first villain of this anime and damn, he's amazing. He's a lot smarter than JoJo1, always having his plan of first getting a powerful rich man and then being a superhuman world dominating being. Also, he's a dick, but a gentleman dick. You wanna know why? *Spoiler* at one point, Dio let's one of his minions handle the immobilized JoJo1. When the minion talks and acts disrespectful towards JoJo1, Dio threatens his minion not to talk like that since JoJo1 was the one who defeated him. I think his words were \"I am not going to let you talk about the man who nearly defeated the mighty Dio like that!\".\\n\\n\r\nZeppeli: He's the most important guy in this story: He teaches JoJo1 hamon since JoJo1 has strong potential. He's an awesome guy with an awesome hat and a master of Hamon, which he likes to show off sometimes. Plus, his *SPOILER* Death was the most emotional thing I have seen since Ace's death in One Piece, giving all his remaining power to JoJo1. Sadly, he doesn't get enough screentime.\\n\\n\r\nSecond Arch:\\n\\n\r\nJoJo2: joJo2 is nothing like JoJo1: He's an amazingly smart person being able to predict what people are going to do and say in the next few seconds and minutes. His catchphrase is \"You're going to say .... now\". AND THEY DO!\\n\r\nAnyways he's incredibly entertaining since he always acts like he's a retard simply to disguise his true thoughts. A mastermind at it's best, always having 7 more tricks up his sleeves.\\n\\n\r\nZeppeli2: Yeah, he's the grandson of the other Zeppeli, fighting with bubbles and shit. It sounds ridiculous but its actually a very interesting and effective fightingstyle. In the beginning, he's a women's magnet and doesn't hide it, who doesn't accept jojo2 at first, since they need to team up to save the world from the pillarmen. But as they undergo a special training, they grow together and become companions and friends alike. \\n\\n\r\nLisa Lisa: The strict but heartful tutor of jojo2 and Zeppeli2. She's a strong female character and the strongest ripple user so far. She seems to be untouchable for most of the time since she....well...never really fights at first. And when she finally does, she *SPOILER* gets fucked pretty hard since she couldn't see through the obvious trap of the mainvillain. I really liked her, though. She gets emotional but doesn't show it easily and can't help but to like Jojo2 and zeppeli2, even though they are, especially JoJo2, annoying the shit out of her.\\n\\n\r\nThe Pillarmen: There are a total of 4 Pillarmen, but only 3 of them really matter: Their names are (I'm not making this up) Santana, Wham, ACDC and Cars. Seriously. Someone must have been a fan of american music xD\\n\r\nAnyways, Santana is just an apprentice with nearly no screentime, Wham is an extremely respectful Soldier that nearly surpasses JoJo2's tactician skills and that JoJo2 even salutes to, ACDC is a real asshole and Cars, the strongest of them, is a mixed bag. He doesn't want to hurt living things like plants and stuff, but he wants to destory humanity. He has no respect towards anything at all and uses every trick in the book of traps to win fights. Sadly, he's up against jojo2 who's the juggernaut of tactics and tricks. \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, every single one of these characters constantly makes some strange poses while fighting. I mean, they look pretty cool but....kinda stupid at the same time. \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this. I don't think I need to say much more. It's an awesome anime, go watch it right now if you're into shonen, if not....well watch it simply to say that you've watched an anime called Jojo's bizarre adventure. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.2/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPs: Sorry I didn't highlight more characters, but I'm already writing this for an hour so far and don't wanna spend all evening telling you how awesome the characters are.",

            "content": "This thing a series that started mediocre just to end up being fantastically better than most shows out there!!!!\r\nWithout Spoilers I will be talking about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure(2012) adaptation which covers Parts Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency from the original manga.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThis Series is a series that never takes itself seriously its over the top ,its too ridiculous it is full of plot holes its the characters are freaking melodramatic but that is what makes it so good. Seriously I enjoyed the hell out of myself during part 2 but the same cannot be said in part 1 till the its last episodes.\r\nThe Series featurea lot of cliche troupes with a series so expected but using unexpected events even if it is over the top , The use of speed chess gambit in the series was pretty good considering its time (It's pretty pretty old btw)!!  even if things don't make sense ,Nice Factions appear It's really strong point is the variety of its fights. with every fight being completely different from before and memorable *Again not the phantom blood part*, So in short this series is too strong in part 2 but pretty weak in part 1 that I almost dropped it. I also like how it doesn't drag on the fights like most shounen do , and the danger feels real.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\n I used to hate the art style at first but then you get used to those Bulky art style and its pretty good in the series though, the fights are well executed and I absolutely loved the art later on the animation is quite good, I can't believe this is low budget animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe Soundtracks in the first part were bland and not memorable, the Second part however was EPIC!!!, especially the pillar men's theme and the lots of DubStep soundtracks used in part 2. The Voice acting is ridiculous but its exactly what the series need, the series is not serious and so should the Voice acting be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nWell again the same problem happens many characters that I used to hate got redeemed in part 2, in part 1 the main character is not cool , but that is changed for the better in part 2, the villains are wonderful and even the allies are , I also like how they don't ditch most characters just for the main character to do his job.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nExcluding part 1 that is a must watch that I nearly dropped the series because of it, The Enjoyment of part 2 was a 10/10 experience and I am now Thrilled with more Jojo that I am already watching Part 3 Stardust Crusaders by now. Now I can understand why the series is so hyped for\\n\\n\\n\r\nNote: Part 1 is 9 episodes long only and it episode 3 and 4 is why it was bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 8) /5 = 8.2\\n\r\nCeiling 8.2 gives a 9.\\n\r\nso its a 9/10 (Great)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Jojo\u2019s bizarre adventure; a show where abs heal wounds, testosterone is spirit, your inside voice is your outside voice your ability to pose is equal to your might. A show, which doesn\u2019t feature a complex plot or characters, but still manages to be one of the best shows I have ever seen. \r\nThis may sound like I am second-guessing myself but I am not, this is most likely because this show is aware (unlike SAO). It knows it\u2019s a show about manly, charismatic men and passion, it knows there are enough plot holes to cover a square kilometre (mile) of land and it knows itlooks bad. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if it were done any differently there would be no way I could have liked this as much. The campy story, literal rock-star characters, the over the top voice acting, the insanely amazing (almost shaft-esk) directing at points, the manga visuals, the beautiful bromanship (bro + showmanship) and the hundreds of other amazing things about this show that make it who it is. Now lets get on to the proper review shall we?\\n\\n\r\n~Story- \\n\r\nThe story of Jojo\u2019s bizarre adventure is about a group of five cute loli girls who talk about food and kissing and stuff\u2026 oops, I forgot, Jojo\u2019s bizarre adventure isn\u2019t apart of the large populace of anime now-a-days. \\n\\n\r\nJojo\u2019s bizarre adventure is separated into two halves. One half covers the story of jonasan (jonathan) Joestar and his bizarre adventure and the other half covers Joseph Joestar and his bizarre adventure.\\n\\n\r\nNow I should mention, when I type bizarre I don\u2019t mean bizarre along the lines of Kaiba, I mean bizarre because of how their bodies are built. I actually thought when I first saw the character designs that these were going to be the tanks in girl\u2019s und panzer, oh how I was wrong. \\n\\n\r\nGetting back on topic, the fights are brilliantly choreographed and never feel too rushed or too long and the story flows at a nice pace unlike other anime in its genre, which basically means \u201cno filler\u201d. The first half of this story is extremely generic and campy, but as I mentioned before, this will most likely not be a deterrent even for the most critical of us as it knows it\u2019s stupid and treats it\u2019s self as such.\\n\\n\r\n~ART- \\n\r\nI could feel my masculinity rise as I watched the bulging muscles. The scenes looked like they came straight from a manga sometimes which really added to the feeling of this show. However, this show sometimes suffered from being a slideshow instead of an actual fight (see kill la kill).\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND- \\n\r\nThis is the first anime I have seen with dubstep in the OST and quite frankly, it has made me a believer. Never again will I say there taste in music is donkey anus if they like dubstep, never again will I click my tongue at hipsters talking about how to shuffle (man that type of dance is old) and never again will I block my ears at skrillex. Maybe my view on this type of music is flawed as the time I loved it the most was when the pinnacle of manly men were beating the crap out of each-other, but never the less, it worked in the show. Speaking of things that work in this show\u2026that was a horrible segway \u2639\\n\\n\r\nThe openings are very catchy and have very memorable and fitting lyrics. Another thing to note is that they were done using only 3d animation, which was very hit and miss however, I loved both the openings and never skipped them once, and they just flick a switch in your brain and put you in \u201cJojo mode\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe endings were cuts of an eight minute song called \u201croundabout\u201d which is done by a band named \u201cYes\u201d A band which are now in the rock and roll hall of fame (pretty sure about this :P). The best part about this however, (besides the fact that it works REALLY well with the subject matter) is the fact that they used several different cuts for different episodes, for example, if someone dies in the show they use the slower part of the song and vice-versa.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER-\\n\r\nSantana, ACDC, Wham!, Led Zepplin, DIO and my personal favourite name Robert E.O Speedwagon (REO speedwagon).\\n\r\nThis is a small list of the rock-stars that had their name (sorta) plagiarised in this show, and my god was it brilliant. Now for an in-depth look at some main characters.\\n\\n\r\nDIO: \\n\r\nBasically the equivalent to Lucifer in anime, but in a good way. The man who made the manga tried so hard to make you hate him that you will probably end up loving him. His voice actor did an absolutely brilliant job bringing life to this character; whether it be the extremely loud screech\u2019s, occasional high voice, or the \u201cJOJO~O~O~O screams everything was made to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nRobert E.O Speedwagon:\\n\r\nThe ultimate \u201cbro\u201d in anime. He\u2019s that one guy who you would wanna screw around with (not sexually, you dirty minded fools :o) and also is our narrator for almost all the fights in the first half of the show. I always found his character funny considering that he started off as a street thug and ended up as an oil tycoon. He is practically useless, but fun none the less.\\n\\n\r\nJonathan Joestar:\\n\r\nGo and look at the meaning of GAR on the urban dictionary. That describes the first Jojo in a paragraph.\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT-10/10\\n\r\nI often found myself doing poses with the characters, yelling for the characters, crying with the characters, praying to Joseph, posting DIO memes on the interwebs, singing rock songs and crying at my own lack of testosterone and masculinity during this show.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nJojo\u2019s bizzare adventure is the pinnacle of manliness and is brilliant. However, as I have not brought it up in the review I will just put it here. This show, from one end, is absolute crap but is amazing at the same time (see Elfen lied). This is one of the few shows I can say I questioned whether to give it a 9 or a 6. You love it, or you hate it, that\u2019s the \u201cbottom line\u201d\\n\\n",

The mysteries surrounding the two main antagonists are interesting and captivating.\r\nArt: Jojo's is an 80's manga, so it's hard to say that art can currently be considered bad, since it's coherent for the time it was released, even so, I consider it a good art with a touch of brilliant originality .\r\nSound production: Sincerely? 10. Have great soundtracks, fit perfectly with the weather, and motivate the action scenes andsadness!\\n\r\nCharacters: This anime has one of the most charismatic and entertaining characters among all the anime I've seen or know: Joseph Joestar! A very charismatic and entertaining character that ends up holding us during the anime!\\n\r\nSpeaking of others, Dio Brando is a middle character in this part, the first Jojo hangs over the bad, is not very charismatic, and incorporates much the character \"shounen\" of the 80s. The main antagonist of part 2, is very striking in the work, but not for its qualities, since it is very empty, not totally, but for the dimension that it is, it should be more worked.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Inadequate, Part 1, after one or two episodes, ends up being boring to watch, and I say unfortunately, because that's the reason many people drop the anime. The end of part 1 ends up being shocking to a battle shounen, and quite sad (something good). With part 2 is different, although it is not accelerated like the first one, ends up being fun, since we have something new in the air.\\n\r\nOverall: Part 1: 6\\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part 2: 8\\n\r\nJojo's is a magnificent work, watching the anime can be a unique experience, for the great touch of originality and fun!

            "content": "I don't think I have ever seen an anime that was more ridiculous than this one.  I used to be able to tell people that I didn't do drugs.  But, I can't do that anymore, because episodes of this anime are actual drugs.  Specifically, hallucinogens and drugs popular in the 80s, like Quaaludes and LSD.  I'm literally high writing this review and all I did was binge watch this insane anime.  That's how loaded the creators were when they made this.  \r\nBoy, do I wish I had've not walked away from this anime back in 2012.  I onlydid so because the version I was watching was so heavily edited it was a turn off, so I figured I would wait until I came across an uncensored version and just never got back to it. (The anime is incredibly gory). Had I known this would've been the first anime since 2013 to crack my top 20 all time favorites, I would've gone back MUCH sooner.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to put into words what makes Jojo so incredible, because I've never really had an experience like this in anime before.  This is the first anime I have ever seen that is so flawed that it's flawless.  An anime that just glories in plot holes and deus ex machinas, with such revelry that you laugh along with what would normally frustrate you.  It's both a masterpiece and somehow \"so bad it's good\" at the same time and you can tell that generating that feeling was intentional.  It's like they were trolling you and entertaining you at the same time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is satire.  It's like it just makes fun of everything about macho animes from the 70's and 80's, but it tells a very entertaining tale while doing it, so it's not just a complete spoof comedy.  But, you can tell it's not trying to take itself seriously, with every other line being shouted in overdramatic fashion, extreme amounts of exposition right in the middle of events, ridiculous sound effects, (And damn was that funny. They used the same explosive sound effect for EVERYTHING.  A guy gets hit in the head with a metal ball and it sounds like a nuke went off.) Almost every character is named after a legendary rock band, people fight in ridiculous ways with veins and such. It's just nuts.      \\n\\n\r\nThe anime was funny as hell and almost all of the comedy was done in a way that seemed like it was unintentional.  Like they wanted you to take them seriously, but not really.  A good example would be the poses.  Characters would kill a man, just by walking into him, and then strike the gayest possible poses right after doing it.  They'd kill off a character in a serious and heartbreaking fashion and then make a cigarette joke right after.  Anything \"bizarre\" and unconventional about this anime, they did it.  From heroic Nazis to killer squirrels to airplanes that appear out of nowhere.  They just don't give a crap, they'll do it.  And do it seriously.  It's a work of art, where the artist's main goal is to just not give a damn.  \\n\\n\r\nBut, the highlight of all of this was not just the amazing fights, with like 20 swerves for each fight.  It wasn't the comedy that will have you in tears.  It wasn't even the amazing soundtrack that brought everything from 70's rock to Arabian hip-hop beats.  It's Joseph Joestar.  One of my new favorite characters of all time.  Basically, he's Sakata Gintoki thrown into an even crazier anime than Gintama.  Clever, nearly morally bankrupt (but not completely), and funny as hell, he took what was already an excellent anime and turned it into a masterpiece.   His appearance was a stroke of genius.    \\n\\n\r\nI have absolutely zero complaints about this anime, because everything I would normally complain about was done on purpose and somehow enhanced this absurd pile of drugs masquerading as an anime. I didn't even think something like that was possible.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is an anime that I had had on my \"to watch list\" for such a long time. I always heard it was good, but wen I saw the art from a few pictures and when I heard the premise I had no interest. So, I never watched it until I booted up my rickety computer one day and decided to see what the hype was about, and if I should have watched it sooner. I'm sure there will be minor spoilers in this review, but it should be ok.\r\nI sincerely regret not watching this masterpiece of an anime any sooner.\r\nAs a childwho had grown up with shows like DBZ and Fullmetal Alchemist, JJBA was the perfect show for me. The reason I finally even watched it was because I saw all these memes, and discussion and I knew this anime could only get bigger, so I wanted to watch it before it was too late,\\n\\n\r\nSo, JJBA is divided into parts, so I'll make each section two parts- one for each. Let's begin!\\n\\n\r\n/STORY- 7 STONE MASKS OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\n~PHANTOM'S BLOOD~\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it was because I didn't read the manga, but I felt JJBA began a bit rocky, for me at least. Despite being the first episode, I felt as if I was thrown into something in which I didn't know what was going on- obviously this is no longer the case, but I still feel I felt confused when I really shouldn't have. I don't know what it was, but I did. Just pointing this out.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the actual story. JJBA is about a family (The Joestars) that was launched into a centuries long battle with a man by the name of DIO (yes his name is in all caps on purpose), who is a vampire. He becomes a vampire after putting on a legendary Stone Mask (which gets explained in Battle Tendency). The story for this part is, if I recall, 8 episodes? I felt it worked well, as all the JJBA parts that are currently anime (as I'm typing this DIU (pt4) is on episode 25) are at least 20+ episodes. The story was NOT long enough to make 20 episodes from this, and I'm glad it didn't. This is one thing JJBA excels in that other shonen such as Bleach and Naruto absolutely flop in- filler. JJBA has none. Which means for me, every episode was just as good as the last.\\n\\n\r\nJJBA has got lots of fights. Did I mention GOOD fights? The Hamon technique was great- I also really liked the vampires too. (Maybe because I never thought anything of vampires other than Dracula and Twilight?) And with only 8 episodes it did it's job well- by the end of the part I was already attached to the characters and sad to see them go.\\n\\n\r\nNow you might be thinking, \"But Moa, I haven't seen JJBA, and I'm reading your review to see if I should. What do you mean, \"see them go?\" \"\\n\\n\r\nWell faithful reader I'll tell you! It isn't a spoiler, since it happens in every part. In every part, the new main character is another member of the Joestar family. So, this part started with Jonathan Joestar- the man who launches everything into play.\\n\\n\r\n~BATTLE TENDANCY~ \\n\\n\r\nOut of Jojo's Bizzare Adventure (and by that I mean just this season) this was the part I liked better. This part centers around Joseph Joestar, Jonathan's grandson. We aren't fighting DIO anymore, but I won't spoil it. This time around, the enemies are the Pillar Men, the creators of the Stone Masks. We also get plenty of new characters in this part, so that's good too.\\n\\n\r\nNow the first few episodes of this was another personal thing with me in which I kept thinking to myself, \"yo this is kewl but where r the stands\". Now, the fact that I wanted to go into this with no spoilers, I had already known about Stands, which are the staple of Jojo- they are the main thing about Parts 3- the current manga, and the author has shown no signs of stopping using them. But of course, I didn't know this. I was told, \"oh dude stands come in later on\" before I started the show. So, I assumed after part 1. As you can see, I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nBut in Part 2 the fights get even better, especially the final one with Kars (he's like the army leader of the Pillar Men). All in all, the series was even more engaging at this point.\\n\\n\r\n/ART- 9 HAMON OVERDIVES OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\n(I don't need to separate this into parts since it's the same for both.) Jojo's Bizarre Adventure has a very, well, bizarre art style. It's not your typical thing when you think of anime (idk, what do people think of, Naruto?) So it may take some getting used to at first. I've never been fickle with art style unless it looks horrendous (and that's probably another reason I like anime, it all looks relatively the same and I like it) BUT the art for Jojo is amazing. It has vibrant colors, and it suits the mood and feel of the show, without a nylon took me, like, one episode to get used to. If you want all your anime to look like Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online though, you've come to the wrong place.\\n\\n\r\n/SOUND- 10 OUTTA 10 SONO CHI NO SADAMES\\ \\n\\n\r\nDamn, JJBA's sound is good. One of the best. Not even much to say about it other than that. \\n\\n\r\n~PHANTOM BLOOD~ \\n\\n\r\nAmazing OP. I never skipped over it once, and like the art, really fits the show. Every OP revolves around a character to a certain extent, and this one certainly fit Jonathan. And not even just Jonathan- DIO too. Also, you can really see that this is the start of something big, with the manga characters flashing in the beginning and whatnot. \\n\\n\r\n~BATTLE TENDENCY~\\n\\n\r\nOriginally as I was watching this I had thought OP1 was superior, but I was wrong upon listening more and more times. I mean, with double the episodes, you listen to the second part more, eh? Still the better of the two. And, once again, it fits both Joseph, and the Pillar Men. The visuals even foreshadow Hermit Purple.\\n\\n\r\n/CHARACTER- 8 JOESTARS OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\n~PHANTOM BLOOD~\\n\\n\r\nJONATHAN JOESTAR: The man who started it all. I really like him, and I felt bad for him when DIO practically tortured him. Too bad he was only in around 9 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSPEEDWAGON: The Joestar's first \"companion\". At first, I thought I wasn't going to like him, but yeah, I did. \"Even Speedwagon is afraid!\"\\n\\n\r\nDIO BRANDO: Dio Brando is Jojo's adopted brother. He's an unlikeable jerk, but he's supposed to be like that. One of the few gripes I see people complain about with JJBA is that DIO had no motive, but I see it as that just being the man he was. And, a good guy like Jonathan got stuck with someone like him. So, about the unlikable stuff, double negative, I guess?\\n\\n\r\nAlso there was a kid who was there too to an extent but I found him kinda forgettable. Probably my only gripe for this part.\\n\\n\r\n~BATTLE TENDANCY~ \\n\\n\r\nJOSEPH JOESTAR- Probably my favorite Joestar out of the anime adapted ones. (Other option could be Josuke) He was funny, and was truly smart- there was many a time he outsmarted the Pillar Men. Which I liked.\\n\\n\r\nCAESAR ZEPPELI: Much more memorable than his father- who was a good character, sure, he just got too little screen time and I sort of forgot who he was for a bit. Now, Caesar is a great character. His attacks were definitely unique.\\n\\n\r\nVON STROHEIM: This guy was my most liked character design (I mean his robot form) in all of \"season 1\" of JJBA. His character was great too- but man, that design.\\n\\n\r\nKARS: He wasn't a great a villain as DIO and frankly, I sort of feel in the community he gets pushed to the side. I really liked his character too, though. Come on though, https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KgQ_OBiryrE/VhhRiOGUPMI/AAAAAAAAFqM/xB-HcL783pk/w500-h281/stroheim1.gif \\n\\n\r\n/ENJOYMENT: 8 CLACKER VOLLEY OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nJojo was a fun ride. I may have not watch it aired, but with no spoilers, it might as well have been. I also enjoyed watching it with those who had had seen it already, which made the experience 10x better. My only complaint is that I expected more of part 1- as in, I expected it to be longer lol.\\n\\n\r\n/OVERALL- 8 FINALLY-A-NOT-GENERIC-OR-PLAIN-TRASH-FIGHTING-ANIME\\\\n\\n\r\nJJBA was truly something different. It didn't feel like a generic fighter, but it also wasn't a battle harem or 'advertising' show either. It exists in its own world, and I'm glad it stayed like that. Maybe not this part specifically, but I highly suggest you check out JJBA. After all, it is now one of my favorite anime of all time. Even if this part looks like it won't appeal to you, just watch it for the sake of getting to the later stuff.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of this isn't even the best part of Jojo.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my review!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure will get your blood pumping like nothing else - if watching an episode doesn't make you want to punch dudes in the face afterwards, you don't have a fun bone in your body. JJBA is outstanding, and while it's not perfect, it's pretty damn close.\r\nOur story begins in England at the end of the 19th century, as a carriage accident kills a nobleman's wife and creates a debt of honor between him and a passing 'samaritan' by the name of Brando. Years later, the wealthy man, by the name of Joestar, takes in the dead Brando's son as his own. Thus thepure-hearted Jonathan Joestar and the cruel scheming Dio Brando become brothers, despite absolutely LOATHING each other with every fiber of their being. Their rivalry, and the presence of a mysterious stone mask, sets of a chain of events that leads to, well, a very bizarre adventure. AND IT IS AWESOME.\\n\\n\r\nThe key to JJBA is that it does NOT take itself too seriously. This is a world where men call their attacks, shout very loudly, and generally ham it up beyond belief. It's Fist of the North Star, only with more camp and pretty colors and less angst. The show's self-awareness allows it to have fun with the medium, mess with tropes, and generally rock out in the most spectacular ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real drawback to the show is its occasional pacing issues. The first 3 or so episodes are particularly slow, but do a great job of characterizing Jonathan and Dio. This issue pops up again in some later episodes, and while it never fully kills the mood, it's mildly frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a couple of minor contrivances (the appearance of a few allies near the end of the Phantom Blood arc stick out like a sore thumb), but overall the story is engaging and will keep you guessing. Honestly, if you haven't read the original manga or seen anything else about this show, just watch this show. From my point of view, a neonate to the series, I was blown away by the plot twists and fight scenes. Don't spoil yourself unless you really have to. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is phenomenal - the male leads are physically built very differently, but come off as quite attractive. Jonathan Joestar is built like a brick house, six and a half feet of rippling muscle, but he has an honest face and you can see genuine kindness in there - which makes his anger all that more powerful in contrast. Dio Brando is thinner and more athletic, agile rather than strong, and it suits his manipulative personality. They're like the polar opposite of Bishounen; attractive in a masculine sense rather than a feminine sense. The animation also captures their physical movements spectacularly, making them at once graceful and powerful.\\n\\n\r\nThe character models aside, the color and framing is basically perfect in every way - the one issue being the times where they shift the colors to something like a photo negative, which is sometimes jarring to the eyes. It's not going to make everyone uncomfortable, but it put me off just a little bit when I saw it. 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound design in the show is consistently great, the intro and outro music in particular are extremely catchy, and I found myself finding the extended versions online to listen to. The voice acting is superb, with Dio in particular standing out head and shoulders above the rest. You can almost hear the disdain dripping from his every word. 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is also quite exceptional. Jonathan and Dio are both extremely well written and deep characters - you understand their drives, their personalities, even their quirks, and that's just in the first episode. Their growing hatred of each other and then conflict is believable, and just as Jonathan is the kind of knight-in-shining-armor everyone roots for, Dio is also alluring in an almost villain-protagonist manner. You could see him actually being the 'hero' if the show was framed differently, and as much as you love to hate him, you might just root for him a little too (I know I did). The only drawback is that some of the side characters serve as little more than observers or archetypes. 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nWatching Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is definitely the most fun thing you could watch this season. You will get pumped up watching this show, you'll grin like an idiot, you'll want to punch a freaking brick wall in half. None of its flaws are large enough or recurring enough to make this any less of a blood-pumping ass-kicking thrill to watch. 10/10, and I do not give that score lightly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're still on the fence about watching this show, WATCH IT NOW. You will not regret it.",

He's not just some optimistic kid or someone who strives to become the best in the world, he's just a carefree dude who got dragged into the past of his grandfather (from season 1) and all of his hilarious quips get him into scenarios the audience can enjoy. all in all, just watch this, you won'tregret it.",

            "content": "I'll just get to the point. If you like anime watch this. I don't care if you don't like action anime, if you don't like anime based on big burly men fighting it out. If you enjoy story, comedy, drama and suspense then watch it. If you don't like those things, still watch it. The only people who wouldn't like this anime would be kind of people who see a cute kitten purr, get mad and  proceed to punch it in the fuckin' face cause they hate cute shit. Not to say this show is cute, far from it. The cutest part in theshow ended with a rabid vampire squirrel burrowing into a cybernetic Nazi's chest. Now lets get started. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nWhat's not to say about this show's story. Story is a definite masterpiece of well, storytelling. It's dramatic and grand but still manages to keep grounded and have bits of good comedy in between the intense moments and even get comedy into the middle of some intense scenes. I personally don't like drama too much, it wears too much my my fragile heart at times but when a show does it great, it's something I can get over and enjoy. I read the first 4 manga for this series and even though I forgot most about the show while waiting for something like this I still remembered the endings and despite knowing how things were going to turn out I still felt suspense throughout the story. Needless this show does an amazing job keeping you on your toes throughout, in all regards to all parts of the story. The side arcs, the character development, the settings and of course the main conflict none of it  disappoints. \\n\\n\r\nIf I have one complaint about the story it's that it sometimes pulls new reasons to keep it going out of its ass. I can't tell if its just to prolong the story or to be cheeky but it does open the story for more great action which is the main appeal of the show, more on that later. Still, at times it can get kinda ridiculous especially when you think a main story arc is over and feel satisfied with it's conclusion just to have it spring back. Several times this happened but not all of it's bad. It's even brought me around to some things. When you think characters are gone for whatever reason and they come back you feel happy that they are cause you grow to love them. And even if story lines keep un-ending they still manage to come up with a satisfying conclusion again, sometimes having the new conclusion be more of a satisfying one than the previous. Even when things are totally absurd and ridiculous you can't help but to be enthralled by the story and when it does a 'wait there's more' more kinda thing and something gets to be totally ridiculous in regards to how the story explains something it's done so over the top and tongue in cheek that you can't help love the show even more for doing it that way. And in the end it's that kinda thing that makes Jojo's Bizarre Adventure feel so different than other anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is a major part of why Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is one of the greatest anime out there. It's another thing that makes it different and sets it apart. Seeing the character designs at first can be jarring, at least for the male characters. Huge bodies and smaller heads and other absurd proportions are bountiful. It may be a turn off at first but it makes it stand out in your mind. What else is there to say? The action is done well with great style. The anime uses colors that I forgot existed and uses those colors on weird and amazing places. The characters clothing is outrageous, in such a good way. All it takes is one good look at a character design from a Google search to see how crazy it is and it works to the shows advantage in setting it apart. The characters designs and action is done so well that if you have time to notice the settings when the show isn't putting emphasis on them they can look kinda dull but only because everything else is done so well and it's not like that all the time. Most of the time the settings are unique and creative and battles take place in areas you don't think of when you think of battles to the death. The settings even tie in to the plot. For example a battle was fought in underwater which played to an enemy's advantage because the protagonist needed to breath in order to produce an energy to kill him and it provides a unique way to provide the protagonist a distinct challenge. Under water is not somewhere that you would normally think a hand to hand battle to the death would take place and it still fits in with story.\\n\\n\r\nAnime look unique to people not used to Japanese animation but to be honest  it isn't all that unique anymore. Characters in anime often the same type clothing, the show will the same settings,  and the animation is of similar art style and the only places where color is seen where it usually isn't is in the hair in an attempt to make it seem like characters are different but they all have been done 100 times. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is different in that regard and it makes it memorable for anyone with eyes to see.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nOkay this is something that Jojo's Bizarre Adventure doesn't do wrong, it's done pretty well in fact but when compared to other aspects of its own show it doesn't stack up. Compared to other anime the sound design is 10/10 at least. The voice acting is great, especially for Stroheim, the friendly neighborhood cybernetic Nazi. The sounds in battle hearken back to older anime fight sequences like with that sound that kinda sounds like the one that sounds like rope stretching out and usually happens when someone is grabbed hard. Yeah that one, though that particular sound  does well to hurt myfuckin' ears. There are other less ear rapey nostalgic sounds as well though.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors give 100% in this and even when they have to say silly things or make sounds to signify that a character is ready for an attack or something, they do it so well that you get drawn into the show even more. You buy into the world and that's no easy task considering how silly and zany the show can be. The VO is just as good when regarding character interaction, when they think  or talk to themselves, say or think something funny or even during romantic sequences in this show about men beating each other up, and it has a wide range of different emotions and texture when various situations. All of it is believable and done well. It even does well when a character says something differently than one normally would for a certain situation, cause this show is very silly sometimes but the voice actors are good enough to pull it off. \\n\\n\r\nIt's all great but it's almost standard fare for a show with this production quality, you expect it and with a show that does so well to set itself apart, going above and beyond, it's almost disappointing. Regardless it's done very well and helps keep the viewer engrossed. Definitely still a strength of the show.\\n\\n\r\nQuick side not I must mention the music in the show is amazing. It blends a lot of different styles of music from the standard orchestral score to Latin culture inspired acoustic guitar to American style pop/rap style music to fucking dubstep this show has it all and it does it all great. I already have a couple songs from the OST on my phone and it's definitely worth checking out after you finished the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters are the hardest to explain when trying to convince someone of why they are good or bad. The characters in this show are so unique. Their character designs are some never seen before and I can't think of a single archetype used in this show. Not one and as you probably know, in anime nowadays that's extremely rare. This is easily what sets this anime apart the most. There is literally too much to talk about why the characters are so amazing so I'll do my best to sum it up neatly.\\n\\n\r\n-The character's motivations are clear and they go about them in unique ways and when they change, they do so in believable and meaningful ways. \\n\\n\r\n-The characters, while not terribly complex, have their own reasons for certain acting certain ways throughout the show but the story remains focused throughout.\\n\\n\r\n-The characters are stray far from standard fare. This is great especially with the female characters because they stray the farthest from archetypes and don't fill familiar roles.\\n\\n\r\n-The characters remain in character. You won't see a character break character in order for a joke or fan service.\\n\\n\r\n-The characters interact well. This part is especially good because the characters personalities themselves are what make for good interaction, \\n\\n\r\n-The characters develop without the need of something unatural that only happens because the plot needs to advance. The development of these characters seem come naturally and reflective of their personalities as well.\\n\\n\r\n-Villainous characters seem realistically villainous. You can relate with a characters evil intentions if put in their shoes and even when it gets out of hand you can see their line of reasoning, even if you don't agree with it. It's not evil for the sake of being evil and you do get to see the antagonists good side now and then which puts everything into perspective.\\n\\n\r\n-Lastly the characters are fun. Whether protagonist or antagonist, a main character or side character and anything in between all the characters are fun in their own little way. How fun they can be depends mostly on their involvement, a character can seem fun but a little insignificant and then appear to be something more unique and interesting. The show does well to develop them and does well to keep them fun. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThe main enjoyment that comes from the show is the action. I've talked about the story, characters, art and sound already and while those things are definitely part of the reason why the show is enjoyable the main reason lies in its action and its the thing that's in the foreground for the show. All the story leads to action, all the characters are developed for action, the art lends itself to action and the sound, I already explained why I like that part in regards to action. For a show to be a truly great all parts must help support each other to elevate it but the show still needs focus and the focus for this show is the action. \\n\\n\r\nThe art helps punctuate combat on attacks, dodges, tricks and drama of the action. The art adnd sound helps emphasize the feel of the action with putting the \"oomph\" into action both visually and audibly. All parts help set up the story of the action sequences, the action isn't just mindless, it's all part of the story. The story changes constantly and when the characters are trying to get an edge on one another, the characters personalities are going reflective on how they attempt to do that. For example a character who prides itself on strength and a fair fight will rely on his perseverance and skill to win while another who relies on their wits will try to work the situation to play best to his/her advantages and minimize their disadvantages. And all of helps you enjoy the show by putting it into perspective. \\n\\n\r\nPerspective keeps you aware of the characters capabilities and limits and when to know when things are really going to shit and when things are really going well, and this is especially important when the stakes are high and the drama can be negated if we don't know how bad or good a situation is or could be if a certain result is reached and what that would mean. Thankfully it does it well and when someone is on the edge and pulls out of the bag to save themselves you really genuinely feel a sense of relief, a sense of despair when something promising turns out badly and a sense of triumph when someone can turn the odds into an unlikely victory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI don't give this a 10 because after going through the story a second time the flaws seem more apparent. The show isn't absolutely perfect but its pretty damn close to it. A lot of anime come out all the time and there is always a fair amount of good ones, even great ones. Some will have great stories, some will have great art direction and design, some will have great characters and some will be simply enjoyable. But very rarely does an anime do it all. For example Attack on Titan was praised to great art, great music, great story, great characters and suspense. If you thought that show was great this will blow your fucking mind. It's great at everything it does but unlike Attack on Titan it does it all so differently and it does so many different things. AOT usually got you when a character was killed. This show will get you for all sorts of things. It's a masterpiece but most importantly it's a masterpiece unlike any other. I don't just suggest you watch this show. I demand it.",

            "content": "David Productions: JJBA 2012 adapts the first two \"parts\" (Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency) of the long running sh\u014dnen manga going by the same name. While it's certainly not a masterpiece, far from it actually, what it sets out to achieve it does well.\r\n It's a faithful adaption, almost 1:1 besides some incredibly minor things, having fluid animation and good sound design (The OPs are some of the best in any anime in my opinion) definitely making this the definitive way of viewing JJBA.\r\nPositives:\r\nAside from the adaptation side of things, the actual story and characters are mostly well done. Yes, Dio isn't the best villainto ever come out of JJBA but isn't as bad as everyone else portrays him, he has a reason to do what he does and has characteristics even if quite cliche. Other characters such as the zeppeli family and the Joestars themselves are very vibrant and filled with personality, providing good dialogue which adds some personality to the show besides the fight scenes. The sound and art design are also spectacular, allowing for tense scenes that wouldn't be present if these weren't so good.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nThere are some pacing issues, something that can be done in a minute of screen time in one episode would take 10 minutes in another one, and the first 12 episodes which adapt Phantom Blood are certainly less entertaining then the last 12 episodes, mainly due to Dio being the antagonist in the first 12 episodes, and him not being incredibly interesting. There are one or two errors here and there but nothing you'd notice on your first watch. It also doesn't make a lot of sense, which could be considered a positive or negative depending on who you ask. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nJJBA 2012 is a overall good anime with positives that outweigh the negatives. A must watch for both new comers and existing fans of the manga.",

            "content": "Overall I really enjoyed this show, but I do think it has some glaring problems.\r\nThis season is split in half, with the first part focusing on Jonathan Joestar and the second focusing on Joseph Joestar. I didn\u2019t care much for the first part. Although the elements were there to make it just entertaining enough to sit through, the second part really triumphs over it in a lot of aspects.\r\nThe first part really only starts picking up after the 3rd episode, after which Hamon is introduced. Only then does the crazy buff fighting dude stuff really start happening, but it was few and farbetween, and thestakes were often pretty low from what I remember. All in all, the visuals didn\u2019t feel as strong in this part either, nor where there any musical themes that stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe second part was one hell of a ride compared to the first, and really made sitting through it all worth it! Joseph is much more of an interesting character than Jonathan, and Ceasar is an extremely memorable dude. The character designs felt a lot more stylish, the fights were much more interesting, and the art felt a little more wild overall. The Pillarmen theme is extremely cool in my opinion. The story felt overall more dense and compact despite how obvious it is that it was all written on a whim. That\u2019s really part of what makes this series so interesting, though.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it, but the first part really dampens the overall experience for me. The second part made up for a lot of it though, and I hope the series continues to become increasingly bizarre.",

I talk about the characters, but I don't reveal any spoilers about any of the plotlines.)\r\nJojo is a MUST-WATCH for any anime fan out there. Dare I say, you shouldn't call yourself a true anime fan if you haven't watched Jojo. There's a reason this show gets so much attention. It's bizarre, the art style is unique and this show does everything right. Plot, antagonists, keeping things interesting... you will NEVER get bored while watching Jojo. There's four parts (Phantom Blood, Battle Tendency, Stardust Crusaders and Diamond isUnbreakable). I can promise you, each part is full of excitement, plot twists and hilarious little jokes. Not to mention, Jojo always drops in lots of interesting facts. For example, DiU taught me that if you insert more than 10cc of air into someone's veins, it can kill them. Also, fish have single circulatory systems!\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that's unique about Jojo is that the protagonist changes with every part. It can seem weird to adjust to at first (I know it was for me) but it's what makes Jojo the masterpiece it is. Not to mention, Araki's art style changes with every part as well (contrast DiU to Phantom Blood for example, you'll definitely notice a difference) and the posing is 12/10. Some great memes have spawned from this series, and I can tell you, this series is even GREATER. Also, speaking of art, the art style can also take some time to adjust to. I remember watching the first few episodes and thinking \"what, these are teenagers? why the hell are they so muscular\" and I wasn't the biggest fan of the art style, but I can tell you now, the art style fits Jojo PERFECTLY. Plus, the outfits that the characters wear are quite imaginative. I really like Rohan's outfits (he's in DiU) and I love all the little details that go into creating the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie to you. Jojo has plotholes. But, Jojo can get away with it. It's so goddamned awesome that you can't help but think \"it's just another symptom of Araki's greatness\". There are great characters and not-so-great characters, and this is where I'm going to start getting a bit critical.\\n\\n\r\nDIO, one of the main antagonists on Jojo. Many people consider him to be a well fleshed-out antagonist, but I disagree here. Sure, his father was a bit of an ass, but it doesn't exactly justify his character. He does crappy things to people for the sake of it and then the fans yell \"what a great character! such a good antagonist!!\" I personally feel like more could've been done with DIO's character, rather than making him a mindless villain. I don't watch Jojo for character development (although we do get quite a bit of it) but it would've been nice to see just how far DIO's character could've been taken. This is remedied in DiU, where we get the antagonist 'Kira Yoshikage'. Personally, I like him a lot more than I did DIO, since I was always excited to see him on screen. DIO's basically just meme material (za warudo!! wry!! MUDA MUDA MUDA!!) while Yoshikage's a character with real ambitions and an interesting plotline.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does have a wide array of interesting characters though. You have the gentleman Johnathan, the jokester Joseph, the stoic Jotaro, the eccentric Speedwagon, the \"wants to live a quiet life\" Kira Yoshikage, the childish Polnareff and the list goes on. There's such a wide array of characters that you're bound to find someone who captures your heart. For me, that character was Joseph (in fact, he's so popular that he made it in Part 2, 3 AND 4) but I've got a lot of other close favourites. The only slight negative is that in some parts *cough* Stardust Crusaders *cough* the \"protagonist\" doesn't really feel like the protagonist. I feel like the show can sometimes lose track due to the large cast of characters, but I really didn't mind this since most, if not, all of the characters usually have something interesting to offer. If you're someone who likes MC-centric shows, then this might irritate you, but I thought it was nice that the show focused on other characters who weren't necessarily the protagonist. In the case of Stardust Crusaders, Jotaro is quite a reserved character, so if the show had focused on him more rather than the people around him, I feel like it wouldn't have been as great as it was. It was a choice which paid off, at least in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, something that Jojo's well-known for is its 'mistreatment' of animals. Dogs are often depicted getting their heads chopped off, or camels sliced in half, or dogs getting kicked, or dogs bleeding, or dogs being killed, or... yeah, you get the point. (There's even a compilation of Jojo dog deaths on Youtube in case you're interested.) Araki has said that when a character hurts a dog, it's meant to show that they're a bad character. If you feel a ways about seeing dogs get killed, maybe think twice before you go into this series. (I'm mentioning this point since I recall seeing a very 'colourful' review on Crunchyroll from a dog-loving vegan who was far from impressed by Dio's choice to kick a dog in the first episode.)\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the sound on Jojo is exceptional, to say the least. Their ED for Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency (otherwise classed as 'Season 1'), \"Roundabout\" by the British rock band YES, is amazing. In fact, I've got all of the Jojo openings downloaded on my laptop because I love them all so much. \"Crazy Noisy Bizarre Town\" (DiU OP) is one of my all-time favourites. I absolutely love it. However, the best opening in the whole of Jojo is their first one, \"Sono Chi no Sadame\". Especially the version with the SFX. It's all timed so that it matches the music, and you can tell that a LOT of thought went into the way that it was crafted. I've never once skipped a Jojo opening. NEVER. I even sit through the endings. When it comes to Jojo, you have to appreciate every second of it. Thanks to this show, I've gotten into some really good music. I'm now the proud owner of a selection of YES albums, along with an acquired taste for Dio (no points for guessing how I got into that band, haha) and Queen.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to fangirl and tell you that this series is the most flawless thing to hit Planet Earth and that Hirohiko Araki can do no wrong (then again, I feel like this is what this review's doing). I'm not saying that. When I got to Stardust Crusaders, I was really tempted to drop the show because I didn't like the new protagonist, Jotaro. After the masterpiece that was Battle Tendency, I wasn't sure whether I'd enjoy Stardust Crusaders. I left the show for about a month before picking it up again, and I ended up enjoying Stardust Crusaders quite a lot. Of course, Battle Tendency will always hold a special place in my heart, but Stardust Crusaders was quite the ride. It was hilarious, frustrating and bizarre (well, duh) all in one. Jojo is a show that you don't 'binge', at least if you want to appreciate it in its entirety. I spent about three months working my way through this series. It became routine for me to come home and watch an episode or two of Jojo. It was the highlight of my day. I'd come home, make a snack and spend 40~ minutes laughing at my laptop screen. On special days, I'd watch ten episodes in one day. Jojo's a long train ride, and by the time you get off, you'll be thinking about the day you can hop back on once again. It's a ride you'll never forget.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what are you waiting for? Stop reading this and go watch the first episode!",

            "content": "*Phew* Took a while to compleate part 1 and part 2 of JoJo's Bizarre Adenture. Anway, I'm gonna have to slip into two parts with a review per each.\r\nJust to clerafy: I had no motivation on rewatching or coming back here till probably 1 or 2 years. I had problems strugalin with Part 1 and somewhat i manengent to watch a total of 12 for the the second half. Another note i've take is how the animation is unique and key visuals make it kinda good.\r\nFavorite character from Part 1: Dio Brando\r\nFavorite character from part 2: Stroheim, Kars and Wammu\r\nNow that's taken outta the waylet's review Part 1: Phantom Blood\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: Generic and really, really boring imo. With all the hype around the series I was expecting something spectacular and what I got was something pretty mediocre at best. The first 4 episode start off kinda good and get better, but i don't see what's really ''Bizarre about episode 1 sinse it mostly seemed normal. The whole mask incendent and  dynamic between Jojo and Dio was really intriguing and I was looking forward to the building conflict after Ep 1. But then Jojo somehow forgave all of the despicable crap Dio pulled in the first episode and started treated him like a brother and friend. Then we find out that Dio was fated from birth to be evil thus flushing away all of his character motivation. Funny thing is that Dio stopped being interesting when he became a vampire. You think the opposite would be true. That's actually the good thing about it. Nothing else just got me to watch it the later episodes. The biggest issue is the shows refusal to shut up. There is almost always a character talking. They can't let the animation speak for itself, someone has to narrate what is going on at all times. Espissily how most the time i've bean spoiled with allmost everything that i can google about ''x''.And the Hamon powers couldn't really seem to stay consistent. Every episode some new never before mentioned ability pops up to Deus Ex Machina the group out of their situation. This also kinda got me to permentlily drop the show if it wasn't for Part 2 gettin' more interested.The first story is really, really... Not great. The second onwards pick up steam quite well though.The first story is pretty 'vanilla', and sets up for everything else that happens like a domino effect. It's also worth noting that it takes inspiration from Fist of the North Star, but this style was dropped and evolved elsewhere. The Deus Ex Machina tropes really pick up in later parts, where specific powers come into play, and everything becomes kinda formulaic and predictable. While the first part is MAYBE the same, it's still enjoyable, at least to me, and for it to be the first in a series of currently 8 stories and kinda bad (speaking subjectively), I think it's justified. The anime (and maybe the manga too) is hard to get into, especially if you usually watch contemporary anime with moe and tropes that have circulated the industry for maybe the last decade. It can also turn away people that are overexposed to JoJo memes, which have ran their course and are pretty dry now.I felt that this part is still guilty of tropes but tropes that were more common place 30 years ago, such as the constant narration and Deus Ex Machina powers (though that one is still a trope, just a less common one. Honestly, for a manga taking 30 years is kinda really retro and should of taken place back then, but i don't really get the animation is really good compared to a later part of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Generic and not much about them i can say. The only character i found liking is Dio and JoJo is okay. Then in the 2nd to last episode they introduced 3 characters out of nowhere that barely show up in the next episode and have 0 overall effect on the plot. Plus one of them get's a bigger role in a future part of the show. Speedwaggon kinda became so annoying with his personallity of bean ''affrad''.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: JoJo's creator is a HUGE music nerd, this will become more and more apparent as you go through the series and so far all the endings have been hit english classics.The music for the first part is by Hayato Musuo (Hellsing Ultimate, The World God Only Knows), and feels somewhat underwhelming compared to his other works. It does fill the void of silence, but it\u2019s a bit of a letdown.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I did enjoy the animation and the character designs. Baron Zeppeli in particular, loved how he looked.The animation is by David Production, and definitely captures the vibe that you would get from an 80s action anime, except with better production values. The style and colors are all over the top, which fits the overall style of this show. One aspect that did initally irritate me was the fact that the first part was obviously heavily influenced by Fist of the North Star. And they'be developt Part 2,3 and 4 (not sure bout 5). I've read a bit of the manga and it's draphics are kinda late 80's.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10  I'll give it's half a 6/10 for Phantom and gotta say it's only watchable if you want to stay kinda bored with a 1890 year of outdatted people. Otherwise, it's alright. Also, I acknowledge as the first story arc this one is likely to be the worse because the author hasn't quite figured out everything yet, so I am going to move on to Part 2 and give that a try. I also know Part 3n4 is suppose to be really good with a great villain but I might take a break from Jojo before I get to that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's about supernatrual.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Part 2, Battle Tendency, on the other hand, is set in New York shortly before the beginning of World War II, and follows Jonathan\u2019s grandson, Joseph Joestar (also known as JoJo). In this part, Joseph must deal with threats related to events from his Grandfather\u2019s past, and also must deal with the creators of the stone mask. Imo, it's better than Part 1 and get's better with animation aswell. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters/Music/Animation/Enjoyment: One world.Improvment over Part 1 and it's outdatted era. Almost every single thing was improved upon in part 2. Joseph was a better main character than Jonathan. I liked Jonathan, but there weren't really that many layers to him while Joseph had a mix of honorable warrior and untrustworthy trickster that somehow worked very well together. The Pillar Men were a marked improvement over Dio as well. Their motivation didn't really have much depth to it, but Dio's depth was thrown out when they added \"the birthmarks on his ear indicates that he was pure evil since the moment he was born.\"Joseph is kidna like how i am in real life ''angry, ladies man and etc'' his personallity makes up.The secondary cast was much improved. No new characters that were thrown in at the last minute that ended up dying the same episode. And almost all the characters had extremely distinct personality and even got me to care for a Nazi. I do wish we had more time with Suzie Q. Seeing how the anime is about the Jostar line I think it is a shame that Jojo's love interest who will help continue the line didn't get much for screen time.On that note, even though I knew about it going into Jojo I want to say how much I love how the story follows the Joestar family and not one specific member of it. Honestly, it is something I wish I saw more of in the american comic book industry.The battles in Part 2 was also a marked improvement. They kept me on the edge wanting to know what will happen next and the crazy stunts they pulled for a victory didn't feel like this massive Deus Ex Machina like they did in Part 1.Also, loved the Opening and Ending Credits. The Opening is lively and colorful and does a really good job introducing us to the elements of this part. My only complaint for the OP is Caesar's death was given away by it. I am actually wondering now if the Zeppeli line is the Leomons of JoJo's. I really loved how the Ending was a continuation of Part 1's ED, using the same song and the imagery picking up exactly where part 1's ended. Though I didn't like it when they messed around with what part of the song played during the ED. Sometimes this resulted in the music not properly lining up with the imagery.I do have some complaints. There is still the issue with it being dialogue heavy. Too many times characters are explaining what is going on when the visuals should be enough to get it across. Also, a lot of times where characters talk for too long instead of landing a decisive blow. I found it unbelievable that Jojo didn't figure out Lisa Lisa was his mom when she said she was the baby saved by Erina. We already knew that baby ended up marrying Joseph's father so why didn't he? I have a few other minor nitpicks like why they needed a giant UV canon to finish off Kars when the lights they were carrying should have been enough, but I don't need to go into all the nitpicks.The music for the first part is by Hayato Musuo (Hellsing Ultimate, The World God Only Knows), and feels somewhat underwhelming compared to his other works. It does fill the void of silence, but it\u2019s a bit of a letdown. Now, the score of the second part, on the other hand, was composed by Taku Iwasuki (Jormungand, Noragami), and does a MUCH better job, complimenting the over the top style. The first opening, \"JoJo ~Sono Chi no Sadame~\u201d by Hiroaki \u201cTOMMY\u201d Tominaga, feels more like an introduction to the series as a whole, with a booming rock track and a brass chorus. The second opening, \u201cBloody Stream\u201d by Coda, feels more like it\u2019s appropriate for that part, with more of a funk vibe and a big emphasis on horns, but provides just as much of a punch as the first opening. The ending is \u201cRoundabout\u201d by Yes, rather appropriate given the fact that, as previously mentioned, Araki is a huge fan of Western rock.\\n\\n\r\n(Sorry if i combine both parts into one along with my text I'm just really tired and haven't got time to talk >_>)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt Battle Tendency was great and makes me excited to move on to Part 3. I still feel that Jojo's isn't living up to all the hype around the series, but I think it speaks volumes when I still want to watch it. Most of the time when something is hyped to death when I go see it I end up disappointed. I did feel that way with Part 1, but not with Part 2. And I know it is only suppose to get better after that. I give this part a 8/10 and for a full score on both parts is 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPart 1 get's a 6/10\\n\r\nPart 2 get's a 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nIn math: 6+8=14:2=7\\n\\n\r\nI'm beaing honest, i wanna take a break from JoJo for a while probably xD\\n\\n",

Oh no, not even 5% of it.\r\nJoJo's Bizzare Adventure executes it's story and Cliches very well, making it incredibly interesting. Ever since watching JoJo, I haven't been able to forget about it. It simply draws you in so well. \r\nStory: 7\r\nNow, not much can be said about JoJo's first part (Phantom Blood). It's story follows Jonathan Joestar as he sets out on an adventure to defeat Dio, a powerful vampire. It's a typical Shounen story. The same can be said about the second part. However, the story progressesat a steady pace and keeps it interesting with funny and interesting dialogue, and a type of self-consciousness that keeps the power-scaling and events consistent. It's a well-executed and directed story with little to really complain about.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nOh boy, I will never forget this art style. It's truly unique. Trust me, you won't find that type of art style and character design in any other anime (at least, that I've watched). The character designs just scream the word: MANLINESS! The art and animation style fits the series, and I honestly never found a specific problem with it. The openings are also beautifully created, with CGI graphics.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe battle themes in JoJo get my blood pumping every time. Just like the Art, the music is truly unique. Just listen to the Pillar Man Awaken Theme from the second half of the series. Oh boy, it makes me want to dance and pose along with it's manly and epic beat. The themes also fit the characters incredibly well. I love the opening too. Not only does it have the main singing, but also sound effects in the background. The JOJOO scream at the end is brilliant too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nOnce again, these characters are somewhat cliche. However, they each have their perks and interesting set of dialogue. Their abilities and powers are all interesting. Most of all, they're just fun to watch. And Joseph Joestar is simply one of the most determined and enjoyable shounen characters I've seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI was completely enthralled and drawn into the story. It was a thrill-ride the whole way through, never getting boring. This series, like Gintama, has a special type of charm to it that makes you want to keep on watching. It's truly outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI fully recommend this series to everyone. After this, it's Stardust Crusaders, which is just as awesome!",

            "content": "Well it's about time one of the longest running and most influential manga got a proper adaptation and sweet mother of all that is Divine, it's glorious! First and foremost, this series is just a treat for the eyes from the intense, over the top, and  eye popping fight scenes to the unique art style.  It's rare that one sees an adaptation capture the spirit of the original work so well. Fair warning: Jojo runs on narm. Wild, jaw dropping, gloriously unrepentant badass narm. This is a series that simply shouldn't work, but by virtue of whatever eldritch sorcery the animators and Araki(the creator of the manga), conjured up it works. It's something that has to be seen to be believed. As far as story and characters are concerned, it's exactly what you would expect of a series with bizarre adventure in the title. The plot while coherent and sensible in it's own way, is downright zany. I can't say I know of too many shows revolving around the l battle between vampires created by an evil ritual mask and those who made it to begin with and two generations of a family armed with magical arts powered by the sun itself. The characters are for the most part interesting and endearing individuals, if not quirky. While the Jojo franchise is not known for emotional depth, it's hard not to get attached to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThough I have already praised the fight scenes as particularly spectacular, I feel that I must emphasize that it gives shows famous for over the top action such as Gurren Lagann, Kill La KIll, Hellsing, and DBZ a run for their money at some points.\\n\\n\r\nI implore you to give this one a try. The premise might alienate many, but for those willing to watch it the whole way through will be rewarded many times over with an entertaining viewing experience.",

JoJo's characters are surprisingly well written for a show most well known for it's many memes and latter foolishness and I felt a connection to each and everyone, without giving anythingaway you really feel their ups and downs and can respect everything they do.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art is perfect for what it needs to convey be it overwhelming power or for comedic effect. furthermore it's never jarring when it switches between these two tones.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, oh boy the story, it's nothing like I expected it to be, it's simple as far as the premise goes but it's the way that it's told that really hits home, it's all well and good to try and tell a epic fantasy but if you don't have the words to convey it then what is the point? the pillar men are imposing threats and you are left genuinely wondering how JoJo will win each time and it is almost never the way that you think he will. JoJo's consistently subverts expectations and this is always to it's merit. \\n\\n\r\nI do have to criticise the rather over the top admiration for the numerous Nazi character though, I am usually not bothered by this stuff as it can be a effective tool to show the power and evil of your opponent if you have to join forces with Nazi's, but here it was presented consistently as a alliance of respect, trust and most poorly of all admiration, subverting expectations is great and I am not looking for a show about punching Nazi's but when you are lauding praise and admiration onto them it does make one uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nhowever this is not enough to hold it back and it shall forever remain one of the most intelligent thrilling and most of all hilarious anime's to ever grace our screens\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, a pinnacle of human achievement that can only described as watching a very fabulous and incredibly entertaining fashion show car accident. This is quite honestly one of the best anime I've ever watched, not just for the fantastically weird story and downright sublime art. The memes drew me in and now I can't get out. Frankly, I don't want to! I'm going to break this review into the categories provided by MAL; Story, Art, Sound, Character, and Enjoyment. Have fun!\r\n[MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]\r\nStory- Holy shit this anime is a glorious drug-induced shitstorm of pure bliss. The story is unlike anything I've ever seenbefore. What other anime can claim to be broken into two parts, the first about Ninja's roid-raging golden-hearted secret love child fighting his adoptive vampire brother and his zombie army with the power of deep breathing exercises. That sounds like a joke, but it's dead serious and incredibly well-written. The second part is set nearly fifty years later before WWII, where a psychic British 19 year old teams up with a cocky Italian man with bubble powers and Nazi Robocop to defeat a quartet of ancient Aztec vampire strippers who were awakened from pillars of rock. It's like LSD but even more addictive. The second half has a slightly better protagonist, and all the side characters are just as likable as the ones in the first half. The second half is written even better than the first actually and I was laughing and crying through its entirety. There's no filler, tons of action, and it's paced very well. Any deus ex machina moments only make this wild ride better, serving as a way to increase the absolute insanity of this do-or-die hilarious gorefest. However, sometimes fights take turns that really stretch the already nearly broken suspension of disbelief. But those moments are few and far between, so I'm giving the story 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt- It's beautiful. Absolutely my favorite art style in all anime. Period. The way the colors of objects shift under different mood and lighting adds to the fabulously masculine realism of the character design. It's all very high quality and I've never seen it dip, not even once. The fight scenes are so well-animated that it feels real. 11/10 if I could, it's absolutely stellar. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The OP for both halves is straight up fire, the dramatic metal of the first setting the tone perfectly with fantastic singing. The second OP is just as good, actually better, with the jazzier tones fitting the more fast-paced wheeler-dealer style of Part 2. The outro is an old 70s rock song, which is an absolutely fantastic choice considering the inspiration drawn from American rock and metal. The soundtrack for the episodes is amazing as well, with all the audio blending perfectly with the scenes no matter the tone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- In-fucking-credible. Speedwagon best girl uwu. All the characters are laid out very well and are all very likable (or in Dio's case, incredibly hateable in the best way.) My only issue was the annoying side characters like Poco, who only served as plot fodder, and the lack of character building for Smokey. Jonathan is developed well, but seems very black-and-white and cliche. However, Speedwagon makes up for it by being absolutely amazing in both parts. Joseph is much more fleshed-out as a character and is significantly more likable than his grandfather Jonathan. Caesar is a bit annoying at first however, and Lisa Lisa doesn't get enough depth. However, these small flaws are overshadowed by the most cliche-yet-amazing villain ever: Dio Brando. There are no limits to his abominable evil, and he's so well-written despite his somewhat silly excuse for being malicious (daddy issues), you still want to pound into dust. Despite his absolutely monstrous and horrifying presence, he retains a devilish charm that somehow makes even the man who revoked his humanity likable in a twisted way. However, somewhat poor writing on a few side characters I am forced to rate this an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This anime had me doing everything from giggling to biting my nails with anticipation. It's a heart-pounding, gut-wrenching, shock-inducing ride that made me feel every emotion on the human spectrum. It was honestly some of the most enjoyable anime I've seen since Cowboy Bebop. 10/10, it's absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- A modern masterpiece that takes itself seriously because it knows how goofy it is. It's fun, heartbreaking, rage-inducing, and grotesquely shocking all at once. It is truly a rollercoaster of emotion and feeling I would ride over and over again. A few flaws do remain unfortunately, so I'm giving this a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is one of my all-time favorite anime now. It was fun as fuck the whole way through, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. This is a must-watch anime, you'll come for the memes, and stay for the masterpiece. You'll want to make all your friends watch it so they can experience it too! 10/10, would recommend to the universe. Also Joseph is my waifu now. :3",

            "content": "The following is a shot of testosterone and relevance. Viewer discretion is inadvisable. \r\nPart I:\r\nAngry blonde is adopted into a family and starts an entire generation of memes before becoming a vampire. His brother must learn magic kung-fu and the art of posing from an Italian who learned said kung-fu from an Asian cover artist of a western hair band. Together, along with the most over-the-top color commentator since Jim Ross (WWE reference), they pursue the vampire to slay him and destroy a stone mask. \r\nPart II:\r\nAmericanized European dude and Italian learn magic kung-fu to fight Aztec Gods of thiccness with the help of arobot nazi. Everyone poses flamboyantly, memes ensue. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 series, what are you doing with your life if you haven't watched it yet? \\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, the serious review. \\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is a series in multiple parts still ongoing, and as popular as ever. It follows each generation of the Joestar family through their adventures fighting against the various forces of evil. The first part follows the lives of Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brand, and their conflict leading up to Dio's turn into a vampire, and their inevitable, fateful showdown. It's clear from the first episode that Dio is entirely the focus, though Jonathan experiences necessary development in order to give a foil to his character. The concept of Hamon isn't as fleshed-out as Stands would later be, but it works for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe second part follows Joseph Joestar and his battle against the creators of the stone masks known as the Pillar Men. These are basically an ancient race who, for the most part, were content being revered as God's by the ancient Human's until one of them wasn't. Joseph must fight them and save the world before they achieve their goal of becoming the ultimate life-forms. Again, Hamon is the power used here, and it's fine for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is incredible. The art is perhaps the most exaggerated (granted, the 80's aesthetic of anime was like that everywhere, check out Fist of the North Star as an example), yet done to such an effect that you can forgive it. Perhaps what makes the series so loved by its fanbase is how unapologetic it is in being over-the-top. From Speedwagon's exaggerated reactions and telling us what we already witnessed, to the constant posing of characters during combat scenes. It's glorious flamboyant about how campy and silly it wants to be, and makes no excuses for it. Instead, it wholeheartedly embraces this and plays it straight, and you can't help but admire its honesty. \\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, treat yourself to the first two parts. It's truly an incredible ride and, love it or hate it, you won't have any regrets!",

            "content": "Disclaimer:\r\nThis review might contain minor spoilers and Hamon.\r\nBear in mind there are two parts in this anime part 1 following adventures of Johnathan Joestar and second one following adventures of Joseph Joestar. I'll say part 1 part 2 when I'm referring to them.\r\nJojo's bizarre adventure an anime I came in with the feeling of ,,ehh I'll probably dislike it,, my opinion changed from that to ,,well it's certainly  captivating and I daresay fun,, during part 1  and eventually became ,, Horrry sheet,, during part 2.\r\nNow I like the show that's a given but it's only fair to break it down so let's geton with it\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound. Ah the amount of heart put into an anime can be seen purely based on it's art. I had to paraphrase it so it wouldn't sound like a cheesy rhyme. So how is it? Well I can't call the art unique because this manly muscular bonebuster look isn't new it's just not present nowadays. What I do like is the way it's executed which both invokes nostalgia by having structure of characters resemble those older anime and using our modern media magic to enhance it and give it a specific look. Again it's working off of a cheat sheet so it can't be called completely unique. First part seems to have a bit of a weirder character design with some faces looking like a Ken doll that got slammed with a frying pan, looking at you Jonathan. The art in first part is around 8 but part 2 makes it much better I'd say a solid 9. Sound? Sound is good yeah and as in every JoJo installment sound effects are used in many scenes to enhance the impact. I won't rag onto it too much  here's a 10 because those openings made me grow chest hair.\\n\\n\r\n Story. Story shmory it's just an excuse to have over the top fights. Okay that's a lie but both parts have magical McGuffins that drive the plot somewhat. Part 1: Johnathan travels to track down a guy he knew that became a vampire trough a stone mask and is joined by colorful characters.Part two is that pillar men,guys stronger than vampires,were awoken from their slumber and Joseph has to travel to track them down and is joined by colorful charaters.The part two does put a lot of spins on the formula and isn't strictly tied to it but the goal stays the same. Let me talk a bit about Hamon because it's a bit of a staple of first two parts,along with enormous manliness. So hamon is art of correct breathing but it can be used as a weapon against vampires. The thing that annoyed me slightly during first part is that they seem to make up rules of Hamon as they go, like metal conducting Hamon well, but in part two you can see that rules established in part 1 are consistent. There are a few parts that are questionable regarding the use of Hamon so I can't say that there aren't some minor plot holes but they are somewhat explainable. \\n\r\nEight I feel isn't too harsh but the story isn't anything special and  plot twists are mostly predictable. It gets an 8 because of some touching moments and some moments that made me touch myself, okay the latter is a lie I was touching myself the whole time. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters woohoo. Reason why I prefer 1 and 2 over part 3. So let's dive into them firstly part one:\\n\r\n Johnathan Joestar is a wonderful manly man with manners of a true gentleman and a body size of a miniature truck, the size comment goes for 90% of characters tho. Speedwagon is your classic 80s narrator dressed as a character and does his job pretty well. Barron Zeppeli is Johnathan's tutor in Hamon. All three of these characters have minor quirks but their main trait is enormous manliness they radiate with and are fun albeit not too complex.  Okay now first parts characters are few degrees above generic which would land them at ,,actual human beings,, and part two has characters I'd classify as ,,interesting human beings,,.  Second part has Joseph ,who is voiced by the Tomokazu Sugita whom I had to mention because he feels even better here than he does in Gintama, is a silly lil' munchkin. He's a bit less mannered than Johnathan but is a wise cracking smartass. There's Caesar Zeppelli who's your suave italian shmuck but nonetheless interesting one. His motivation is put out with  a quick flashback but for some reason I didn't mind it. He does grow on you and also grows out of a classical womanizer into an actual character. There are few more and I've avoided describing villains because they are more enjoyable with as little knowledge beforehand.\\n\r\nScrew it here's an 8 for characters. If you write a character that is fun to follow then you deserve at least an 8. Do bear in mind part 2 is closer to 9 but I'll give it a lower grade regardless because I'm not that biased.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Yes.\\n\r\nOkay I have to elaborate. Fights often turn into a battle of wits rather than strength. It is a bit of a downer that sometimes you can predict whether a planned move will work or not but it still shows a nice amount of imagination that creator had. I'd give it a 10 but  it is understood that some people will mind these parts more so yeah here's a pretty 8.",

            "content": "This is going to be a short review that highlights the best parts about this anime and the series as a whole. From a short time Jojo fan who got into the series in the summer of 2015.\r\nJojo is an entertaining series thats genuinely fun to follow and discuss. It has a lot of style and unique and interesting concepts and its wonderful seeing a lot of homoerotic subtext within the series that doesn\u2019t paint itself as overly stereotypical and offensive (compare any Battle Tendency character to Puri Puri Prisoner from OPM, for example). While it does do a lot of things wrong within it\u2019sstory, it\u2019s genuinely a fun watch in the sense that it capitalizes on the concept that a journey is more substantial than the destination - which is why there\u2019s \u201cadventure\u201d in the name of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe first 9 episodes might be slow for a lot of people (I personally enjoyed them a lot), but keep in mind that the latter part of the anime is much better and this is a series that keeps getting better and better with each ongoing part (also debatable among the fandom). Keep in mind that while you might not be invested at first because of the jarring lack of characterization and overabundant dialogue that this is a VERY FAITHFUL (for better or for worse) adaptation of the original manga that came out in the 1980s - so it's a product of it's time. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, do not get disheartened by the obnoxious fans (I know for a lot of you this might be a stupid thing to say but believe it or not there's a lot of people who stay away from things just because of the fanbase), this series is much much more than memes and jokes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a 8.8/10 from me and give it a go if you like anime that tends to stray away from the norm of Harem Ecchi Shounen Fanservice crap that's out there nowadays!",

            "content": "Honestly, I would have given a 9 if the first part wasn't so rushed, but well... let's talk about it better in the next lines.\r\nStory: 6\r\nAs much as I enjoyed watching it, the story really didn't have anything too original to it. We start the anime being introduced to Jonathan Joestar and his family, or simply JoJo, we get an overview of how is his character like. After we get to know Dio Brando, the main villain. The powers are pretty simple too, Hamon (it remembers me a lot of Naruto's Chakra but without Jutsus) which's the 'good guy's' power, and the Mask, who givesvampire's powers to the 'bad guy's. But well... That's just the first part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure because just like the name says... we have a second part, which takes 50 years after the first part, now the story of Joseph Joestar! (yes! Another JoJo)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe animation had its flaws, but what is weirder is the anatomy of the characters, shoulders too big for their heads, and arms too big for... everything. It does get a little bit better in the second part, but still weirds me out a lot of times. But generally, we had colorful characters (which is a big plus for me), as well as good character design, pretty stable animation during the series and decent fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things in this anime, all the OST is pretty amazing but I have to mention especially the ending song and the second opening. The ending, Roundabout from Yes, first of all, I should talk about how shocked I was when I discovered this music is from the 70s, it's the first time I saw an OST using an international already existing song, and I was not disappointed at all, it has a catchy rhythm with interesting lyrics. The first opening was an ok one, the one that really shines for me was the second, totally captivating melody that makes you unconsciously sing along to it. Also, I should mention how much spoilers the opening gives to you, fortunately, you only catch them if you're paying really close attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is something that gave me a problem, mostly because of how rushed the first 9 episodes were, it didn't give enough time to digest information, and that compromises the connection you have with the characters, if something really sad happens you won't feel too much because the anime simply doesn't give you time to feel the character's pain. But about the protagonists, Jonathan is a simple-minded character, he has simple motivations and is easy to understand him, though his personality is damaged because of all the rush. Dio Brando is a bad guy, that's what everyone knows, but he isn't like others villains that have an entire philosophy behind their actions making them more likable, he's evil because he's evil, there's no explanation, and for my surprise the author gave it wonderful writing, because even without a 'reason' you still like Dio, he's just a really bad guy who you still like despite everything. And finally, there's Joseph, personally speaking, he's my favorite character, he's a smart guy, but in a funny way, he makes tricks and is kind of a goof, he tries to look serious but fails miserably at it, he's not perfect, and he doesn't even try to be, instead he transforms his flaws in advantages, and maybe that's why I like him so much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the first line of this review, I would have given it a 9 if it wasn't so rushed. The first part had potential honestly, despite not being too original, it started strong. But it was the studio's fault at trying to compress so much material at only a few episodes, if it had 24 episodes only for the first time... we would have had a totally different review until now. I couldn't help but want more of Jonathan before moving to Joseph, he's the first JoJo, the one who started everything, but had the least screentime. Joseph's arc was rushed too, again for the same reason, but it wasn't as much as Jonathan's, and maybe that's why too I like him better than Jonathan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI only gave it an 8 because of the second part, so I ask for everyone who's thinking of seeing JoJo to not give up in the first 9 episodes, because the series change completely after that, and I guarantee that is for the better, it's not luck that this anime has a really high score, after all, it's famous and loved for a reason.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, you're awesome if you read everything until here, thank you for reading this amateur's review in JoJo no Kimyou Na Bouken.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Jojo'S bizarre adventure is a long-running manga series in multiple parts, and this anime right her adapts the first 2 (also the worst 2). For the sake of convenience, I'll split this review in half: Half on part 1 (episode 1-9) and Half on part 2 (episode 10-26). \r\nPART I: PHANTOM BLOOD\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story is damn near impossible to explain without you sounding crazy. A buff British guy gets an evil step-brother who becomes a vampire, so he goes on an adventure to learn powers and beat up some dead guys. It's crazy - no it's.... bizarre. If nonsensical surreal humor is your style, you'll probablyenjoy this, even though I didn't. Trust me, surreal humor is incredibly up my alley, but it has to make sense within the world set up for it to be good. Yes, the entire series is crazy and nonsensical, but with part 1, it's too nonsensical. Even when taking the pre-established rules of the world into consideration, this makes no sense, it's just a lot of random events put together.\\n\\n\r\nCHARATCERS\\n\r\nAwful. I didn't care for anyone. Jonathon Joestar (the main character) is extremely underdeveloped as is the main antagonist, Dio. When the show wanted me to care about them by having a \"heart-warming\" moment, I couldn't care less, because they do nothing to make me care. This applies to all other characters. REO speedwagon is a really good band, but not a good character.\\n\\n\r\nART (animation and sound)\\n\r\nThe best part about this arc. It's really solidly done in terms of sound and animation. The uniqueness of the art style doesn't become apparent until part 2, but it's still really good here, as is the sound. The ending theme is \"Roundabout\" by Yes which not only is it a really great song, but it's also a meme. The voice cast, however.... The English dub is horrendous. They some how managed to mess up Johnny Young Bosch, one of the best voice actors ever. Even in Japanese, everyone seems to think that screaming at the top of their lungs and over-acting makes quality entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nPart 1 is not good. You have to watch it if you want to get into Jojo though, but it's only 9 episodes you have to trudge through. Maybe you will like this arc, it's not impossible.\\n\\n\r\nPART II: BATTLE TENDENCY\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nPart 2 follows Jonathan's grandson - Joseph Joestar. This part depicts him traveling around the world to defeat an ancient race of ultra-powerful, sexy naked men... I'm not joking. This part's story is marginally better, as it makes a tad bit more sense, and it also really got me captivated at times. But it's not great enough to save the season from Part 1.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nAlso weak. Joseph is 20 times more entertaining than Jonathan, but still rather underdeveloped in terms of main characters. His supporting cast is the exact same. When someone died, I didn't actually care all that much.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nNow things get cool. When looking at Jojo's bizarre adventure as a franchise, my favorite thing is the art style, and starting here, the art style gets really psychedelic, colorful and well-done. The same goes for the music, which is one of my favorite anime OSTs out there. The music can range from dubstep, to rock, to classical. The voice quality remains the same, though.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nPart 2 is much better, still flawed, but much better. I actually enjoyed part 2 to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL OVERALL\\n\r\nJojo's bizarre adventure is such a great franchise and the amount of good outweighs the amount of bad. I recommend you watch these 2 arcs only because I recommend you watch the next 2. In order to fully enjoy the great parts of Jojo, you need to see these first 26 episodes, despite their flaws.",

            "content": "JoJo\u00b4s Bizarre Adventure (JJBA, for short) is a manga series by Hirohiko Araki, spawned in 1986 in the shonen jump and still being publicized in the ultra jump. With more of 25 years of history, it has maintained popularity and quality during all of the run. It only had a short series of OVAs around the year 1993 and it never got a proper series until 2012.\r\nThe show follows the adventures of the Joestar dynasty, a family that is constantly caught in epic fights for their lives and their worlds. There have been 8 protagonists already, all whom share the JoJo nickname, and their storieshave last for more than 200 years already. Thus, the story is separated in 8 arcs, one by each protagonist and interconnected with some recurrent characters, plot lines, and concepts. The anime has already 3 seasons (with a fourth in the horizon), covering the first 3 parts, but here we are talking about the first one. \\n\\n\r\nThis show bursts in imagination. The story follows in the first half Jonathan Joestar against his evil stepbrother Dio Brando and later Jonathan\u00b4s grandson Joseph Joestar against a group of old gods who are responsible for the supernatural events of the first half. While the concepts are mostly common and uninteresting when heard (vampires, a power mixing martial arts with respiration and sunlight, resurrected Aztec gods, etc\u2026) the show handles them in unexpected and really engaging ways, keeping a fast pace. The aesthetic is a really important aspect, almost destroying the natural structure and colors of the characters and backgrounds for the sake of aesthetics. Similar even to Spanish painter El Greco works (1541), where the emotion of the situation is showed with unnatural images filled with an emotional energy that transmits directly to the viewer. The author, Araki, it\u00b4s closely inspired by the renaissance and pre-impressionism, which results in really artistic results in the most iconic shots. 80s music and fashion are also a big inspiration, which shows in the extravagant clothes of every character and the regular musical references in the names. The animation follows the manga closely, which is always good and rare in today\u00b4s industry.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, is a pretty solid series. It worked as a gateway to the manga for us (which in our opinion, reaches a much higher quality around the 6th and 5th arcs), but it\u00b4s enjoyable as a standalone piece. It has a transphobic joke around the middle of the second half, sympathetic Nazis (this in the context of pre-World War II) and the next season can be disappointing if you expect the speed of the first season or respectable female characters (that the first season does quite good for the times when it was written), but it\u2019s still a fantastic series as long as you\u00b4re aware of these problems. It\u00b4s a wild ride and you can enjoy it.\\n",

            "content": "I'm going to break down the review into two parts, one for each of the first two parts of the series.\r\n__\r\nPart 1- Phantom Blood:\r\nThis part is the start of it all, featuring vampires, stone masks, and an awesome top hat. As much as I hate to admit it, this is probably the worst part of the 8 parts of the series (besides part 5 in my opinion, which was (mostly) irrelevant to the rest of the series). However, there is defiantly still fun to be had. The main antagonist (who my friend refers to as D-bag Dio) is probably one of the biggest jerks inall of anime, which makes it interesting to watch the interactions between him and Jonathan (the main protagonist), a gentleman-like character. The story, when fully broken down, is very simple: a young man goes to hunt down the adopted-brother-turned-vampire to kill him and save humanity. There's not much depth to it, but there are still great parts, such as Zeppeli being awesome and some cool fight scenes. Overall PB is fun but falls short of being as good as most of it's successors. I give it a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Check out this part because it's fairly entertaining and you'll need to watch it to understand part 2.\\n\r\n__\\n\r\nPart 2- Battle Tendency\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the series really starts to pick up, in my opinion. Featuring (in my opinion) the best protagoninst in the series, Joesph Jostar does battle again a series of enemies called 'The Pillarmen'. Joesph is practically the complete opposite of Jonathan, which is good: he's goofy, very witty and resourceful, and takes lots of chances. This leads to interesting interactions with the characters who appear in the show. This part is almost twice the length of the previous part (17 episodes versus 9), which leads to a more in-depth plot with more interesting characters, action, and clever twists. This is one of the best parts of JJBA in my opinion, so check it out!\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: This part has great action and characters, making it the better of the first two parts, in my opinion.\\n\r\n__\\n\r\nOverall bottom line: This is almost a perfect adaptation, featuring very little cuts from the manga it's based on, excellent voice acting, solid animation, and  great, memorable characters. Definitely give this a try if you like action shows. Can't wait for the part 3 adaptation!",

            "content": "The short version of the review: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is an insanely fun show with cool yet goofy characters, with great music and art, and very clever fights. I think you'll probably like it.\r\nThe MUCH longer version(you've been warned)\r\nStory: From what I'd heard, this show was going to be all about the characters and the style, with the story getting less attention. To an extent, I heard correctly. However the story-while pretty silly in places- was more mature and well written than you'd think. Instead of spoiling anything, I'll just talk about the differences between the 2 parts this story is broken up into. Thefirst part takes the style of a darker tale involving an evil vampire in 1880s England, while the second part is a more camp (though still serious somehow) tale, that takes place in locations all around the world. Personally, I thought that the first part (episodes 1-9) took a little longer than it should have, with the middle section of the story dragging slightly, despite the cool fights taking place in it. This part also suffered the most from people constantly shouting commentary during the fights (and by people, I mean Speedwagon). This could get quite annoying at times, and slowed down the pace of the fights a fair bit. Part 2 suffers this as well, but less so to the point where it didn't bother me as it did in part 1. And while the plot for part 2 was better than part 1, it wasn't a masterpiece. It was just good. Better than average, but not spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation for this show was fairly average. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special (except for the opening). The reason I give the shows' art an 8, is because of the designs and the style in which everything is done. The show uses a very colourful palette for a lot of characters, and in certain scenes, the colours will all suddenly change. This means characters hair and clothes often end up changing into different in colour within the same scene. This may sound jarring, but for me it added a distinct charm to the shows art that no other show has shown me. The character and background designs are also incredibly good, and some characters look similar to other characters in different franchises. Just know that this is due to 2 reasons. 1) The show is parodying someone, or 2) The JoJo character IS the inspiration for the character you recognise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now this category is where the shoe truly shines. Mostly. I'll only give my impressions of the 2 protagonists though. I don't want to influence your views on the others should you choose to watch this show. Firstly, part 1 protagonist Jonathan. He's...generic. He's easily the dullest character in the show. He's a goody goody and fights like a faulty standard shounen protagonist. But he's supposed to be, since he's a direct parody of Ken from Fist of the North Star. Not that he's not likeable. He is. He just doesn't hold a candle to part 2 protagonist Joseph. Joseph is the best part of this show. He's over the top, rude, and seems completely off his rocker to most people. He's also the most clever protagonist I've ever seen in terms of fighting. Joseph fights completely opposite of how you'd expect a protagonist to fight: dirty. He is not afraid to pull out every cheap trick and clever tactic he knows, rarely ever fighting his opponent fair and square. And this is what makes watching him so fun. That and his gratuitous Engrish. Which is hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This shows OST is  good, but honestly isn't very catchy. The reason this area scores so highly is for the openings and ending. The openings are amazing both musically (especially part 2)and visually, and the ending uses a 70s  song by the English band called Yes. Honestly not much more to say about this one. The openings and endings are amazing, the OST is good too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is hard to put into words for a review. Because its just an enjoyable experience. The story is good but it isn't going to win any awards. The art is very stylish, even of the animation is only average. The sound is mostly incredibly apart from some unmemorable tracks. The characters are just the best though (ok maybe not Jonathon but he's still better than most protagonists). It's a great show because its fun. If what I've said sounds cool, you need to watch it yourself. If not, then you definitely shouldn't unless you're willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\n\r\n(This is my first ever review on this site, so sorry if it's a bit pants)",

            "content": "This is my first anime review ever and there were plenty of anime that I was planning on reviewing first, but this is the one anime that kept coming back to my head over and over again.  Let me start this review by saying that I did not read the manga before watching this anime.  I had only heard the title before a couple of times and I was never genuinely interested in it before.  Then one day i was really bored and looking for something new to dedicate myself to and i decided to give this show a look.  WhatI got was something really special, something that I hadn't  experienced with another anime in a long time.  Pure Excitement.  \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure doesn\u2019t focus on one particular story, but rather the different stories of the different generations in the Joestar Bloodline.  I thought this was a really unique aspect of the series because it gives us a more broad perspective on the world of Jojo.  It also allows the viewer to experience the growth in strength from one generation of Joestar to the next which makes the series feel a lot more epic in scale.  The best part about each Joastar's Story is that they are not all focused on one particular genre either.  In fact none of the series is focused on a single genre.  This anime is a dream come true, containing a little bit of everything.  The series contains elements of Romance, Action, Horror, Drama, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Mystery, Psychological, and pretty much any genre you can think of.  Another thing I really enjoyed about this series is that while it falls under the typical trope that shounen series always seem to have of throwing in overcomplicated plot points and such, it never feels to complicated until you start explaining it.  The series manages to crowd its story with different plot elements yet remains simplistic in the way it presents them, allowing even the most reluctant anime viewer to enjoy what the series has to offer.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art style and animation of Jojo is very hit or miss.  The the more nostalgic viewer will feel right at home with the over muscular character design which feels very reminiscent of classic manly series like Fist of the North Star and Berserk.  Whereas viewers who are more at home with the now common moe style animation may be pushed away by the art style.  It shouldn\u2019t be a deciding factor for wether you should watch it or not, but if you're not comfortable with this style of animation, then it may take some time for you to get into the series.  Also the openings are just pure eye candy, I found myself re-watching each opening over and over again.  The openings are made completely with CGI and while I usually hate CGI in anime, the intros look absolutely gorgeous with it.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound in this series, is just gorgeous.  From the amazing soundtrack to the Over the top voice acting, I found myself overcome with joy.  To start off, the music in this series fantastic, including the song Roundabout by Yes which got me really excited as soon as it played for the ending theme.  Both openings are not just eye candy, but also a great sensation to the ears. The first opening \u201cSono chi no Sadame\u201d is EPIC.  Very reminiscent of old anime openings that actually had to do with the plot rather than being completely irrelevant to the series in general.  While the first opening is more fun to listen to, if found myself enjoying the second opening theme, \u201cBloody Stream\u201d to be more badass for some reason.  The background music is very nice, especially in the first Phantom Blood arc since it has very epic orchestral music during some of the fight scenes, which goes along with the setting of the first arc.  The Battle Tendency Arc was much more upbeat and energetic which fit with the 2nd arc's protagonist's personality......Speaking of which\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are without a doubt the best thing that the series has to offer.  There is not one character in this anime that I felt was annoying and unnecessary. Even the villains in the series where so unlikable that they ended up being likable to some extent.  In particular Dio who has the most over the top performance in the series.  Half the time that Dio was on screen, I felt like I was watching a historical soap opera.  Jonathan Joestar (The first Jojo in the series) is kind of boring to me unfortunately.  I liked his character since he seemed noble and just an overall nice guy, and I supposes thats why I found him as a character pretty boring.  The only thing that stands out about him in particular is his willingness to stay an honest and good person even after all the things that happen to him.  Joseph Joestar on the other hand is pretty much the exact opposite.  He is probably my second favorite character in the anime (Dio being my first)  He has this renegade Han Solo type feel to him which makes it fun to see him act inappropriately along side a pretty serious cast of characters.  Even better about Joseph is how even though he can be a pretty big airhead at times in the series, he is a strategic master mind in battle, always looking for ways to outwit his opponent and turn the tables on them.  I could sit here all day typing about all the memorable characters that this series has to offer, but if I did, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to finish this review. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDespite the constant praise that I give this series, it isn't flawless (then again no anime is) there are moments where I felt it was dragging on too long, especially in Battle Tendency where it feels like forever for the final battles to finish, but In the end it is an overall enjoyable series with very little to hate about it.  If you have been recently feeling that there are just no action anime nowadays that feel epic anymore then this is a series that you really need to check out.  I can't guarantee that everyone will enjoy it, but fans of over the top anime will find themselves thoroughly enjoying this series",

            "content": "Manly. Heart-pounding. Exhilaratingly awesome. The ultimate epitome of the word \u201cbadass\u201d. These are the descriptions that paint the exquisite experience that is Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. Everything from the animation to the out-of-this-world battles, along with a cast of characters that is consistently entertaining makes Jojo an anime like no other. In a time where adaptations of pointless harems and ecchi shows have been stagnating the anime industry, Jojo comes along and brings a sense of fun and originality to the table, even if its story can get a bit muddled in the process! Now without further ado, here is the review that will convince youto experience the ever so fabulous and over-the-top anime that is Jojo 2012.\\n\\n\r\nJojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure (2012) is an anime adaptation of the insanely popular supernatural/shounen manga series of the same name, written and illustrated by the ever so imaginative mangaka, Hirohiko Araki. While there are a total of eight parts currently in the series, Jojo 2012 serves as an adaptation of the first two parts of the manga: Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. Phantom Blood covers the origin of the Joestar family, who are the main protagonists of the series. The story details the life of Jonathan Joestar, the protagonist of Phantom Blood, living as an aristocrat in 19th century England with his father, George. Jonathan\u2019s world goes upside down the moment Dio Brando ( a.k.a The Magnificent Lord Dio, a.k.a. greatest anime villain of all time) shows up in his life as an orphan who is adopted by Jonathan\u2019s father as a promise that George made to Dio\u2019s father long ago. From there on, Dio makes it his mission to rule over Jonathan and his family for reasons that are, well, pretty fucking asinine and confusing. After a time skip in the story, Phantom Blood\u2019s plot basically becomes completely bonkers. To sum it all up, Dio uses a supernatural mask that turns him into a vampire on regular civilians in order to build an army of supernatural warriors to take over the world, which Jonathan discovers thanks to the death of his dad by the hands of Dio, leading to Jonathan becoming a pupil of a man known as Will A. Zeppeli, who teaches Jonathan the spiritual fighting technique known as Hamon in order to combat Dio and his army and yata, yata, yata. So much happens in Phantom Blood with exposition both given to you and, for whatever reason, not given to you that I can only explain so much of it. Honestly, it is best that you experience Phantom Blood for yourself; however, the story suffers from asspulls and plot holes that are way too noticeable to ignore. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Phantom Blood\u2019s storyline is most definitely flawed, Battle Tendency contains a story that is the reason why you should become a fan of the series. Why is this the case, you might ask? Well, to put it simply in terms of entertainment, Battle Tendency is a fucking orgasmic rollercoaster ride of action and suspense. Taking place fifty years after the first story during the events of WWII, Battle Tendency stars one of the most entertaining and badass heroes of anime and manga, Joseph Joestar. Joseph, the grandson of Jonathan Joestar, is introduced to us as a young man living in Harlem, New York. Because of the kidnapping of an old friend of Jonathan (who is also the biggest bro in all of anime), Joseph gets himself tangled in a battle with a mysterious group of supernatural warriors known as The Pillar Men, who are seeking to allow their master, Kars, to rule over the world. What comes out of this energetic journey is a great amount of wit, strategic battles, and a plethora of colorful characters that will maintain your attention the entire way through. Make no mistake though; Battle Tendency\u2019s greatest strength is in fact Joseph himself, who is immensely more interesting and lively than Phantom Blood\u2019s Jonathan Joestar, who is a generic and often boring protagonist. All in all, Battle Tendency\u2019s story is a big reason of what makes Jojo 2012 worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, Jojo 2012 is one of the most vibrant and colorful anime that you can find. Something that is very evident and stylistic about the show is the fact that each and every character is uniquely presented by having distinguished colors and a high degree of insane fashion. And how can one ignore the gloriously jaw-dropping poses? Each and every pose that the characters make will leave you in a state similar to a prolonged orgasm that causes your eyes to roll back in such a lustful and vivid way, only to further make your toes roll back while sweat is dripping down from the wrinkles of your forehead\u2026\u2026.basically they\u2019re beautiful. Facial expressions are also noteworthy within this anime as they are very crisp and fluid, showcasing a lot of the emotions that characters are feeling during specific moments in the show. \\n\\n\r\nJojo 2012\u2019s soundtrack is also something that is out-of-this-world. The music may remind you of Saturday morning cartoon battle-theme songs and every piece of music is utilized in very outstanding ways during each and every fight of the series. Not to mention that both of the OP\u2019s and ED of the show are terrific, with the ED showcasing the song \u201cRoundabout\u201d from the band Yes. Not only is the soundtrack great, but so is the sound mixing and voice work in general. Sound effects due to the action sequences that take place are very well made and the voice acting is overly-exaggerated and ridiculous, which fits with the overall style of the series. \\n\\n\r\nJojo\u2019s Bizzare Adventure (2012) is an anime that allows one to sit back, relax, and witness dumb-fun action taking place in front you. While there are some noteworthy problems with its story and some of its characters here and there, Jojo 2012 still proves to be a hell of a fun ride that you don\u2019t usually get to witness in the shounen category of anime. The fights that are shown are all strategically unique in their own ways and the characters are all colorful and memorable, especially Joseph. Are you tired of redundant shounen anime that always inevitably manages to copy previous shounen stories? Then I present to you Jojo 2012, one of the most eye-popping and manly shounen anime you can have the pleasure of watching! \\n\\n",

            "content": "First of all, the anime has 2 parts of the manga series, the first one called\" Phantom Blood\" and the second one \"Battle Tendency\". Overall i will now summarize some of my toughts in different headlines. The Battle Tendency part starts at episode 9-10. Thats for me overall the better part.\r\nStory: The story from the first part starts very slow to get well, into the action. From the whole series the first 1-3 episodes are completely different than the rest of the anime. It has not much Action in it and feels, well somewhat like a stereotypical \"rival story\". Its okay to watch but notthat fun. The real story starts to begin in the 3 episode and continues with the mask and so on. Then the adventure starts and the main character an his friends go on a journey to beat the foes of the main antagonist. Somehow stereotypical, but still, enjoyable.The first part seems more like an intruduction to the whole Jojo universe, and many of the plot twists are build into the second part. Then the second part , Battle Tendency, starts. Thats a whole different thing. The story is way much better and has got very much mystery parts in it. I really enjoyed that story since it got many plot twists that got many connections with the first part so it is an anime that you should watch as fast as possible, otherwise you miss some. Oh and even importan characters can die, so you are never sure who survives a battle.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The style of the Art is just gorgeous. The artstyle got many colours and is overall very bright. The male characters mostly look very muscular, but that depends on if its a trained person or not. The eyes look very beatiful and the animations are great. There are many special effects , with really good animation. Im not a real expert of this kind of stuff, but for 2012 its very good and over the top as far as i watched other animes from that year. But one thing thats very unique is that the anime itself watches like a manga, you often see sound effects also written on the screen. Or if something is happening it also describes the situation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Very good overall, voice acting is very good, and the quality is nice. The openings are specially composed for this anime and specially the second one is very good, the first one is fine. The sound effects are awesome, explosions sound like they should and the music always fits to the theme. In case you cant hear, most of them are written on the screen so yeah , here ya go! The ending is kinda okay, some english song, not bad i liked that one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is very Jojo\u00b4s bizarre adventure shines the best. The characters. There are tons, of unique and reconizeable characters. Every character has a different personality that looks natural and not stereotypical anime stereotypes, specially that super unrealistic \"dere\" crap. The characters look first like some sterotypes, but there are not. The first protagonist, Jonathan Joestar (JoJo) is in someway a very proud and honourable character. He fights to be a gentleman, and for justice. But still is agressive at the right moments and acts like a human beeing. The second protagonist, Joseph Joestar(JoJo) is my favourite, hes the bold, funny,sympathetic \"asshole\" you can say. He is not very honourable and would and does everything to win a fight. He lies, provokes and jokes around to fool the enemy and think or execute a new plan. His fights are very strategic and funny. Also he got the abillity to say what the enemy thinks, of course thats also a scheme. There are plenty of good antagonists, foes, friend and even side charakters that each have an unique personality and the abillity to be easy remembered by the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: The fights are awesome. The overall enjoyemend was great, even if the first episodes seemed for me  a little boring compared to the awesome rest. The anime uses hamon, a technique that uses breath rythm that create shock waves that can be used in many different ways, and is the best enemy against the vampires. But thats not a simple way, even with this abillity, the protagonists are still very weak and overcome their physical lack of power with strategical moves in the different battles. Every battle is unique and you never know if someone survives it, or finds in the last second a new way to beat his enemy. The anime is very brutal, and very funny with the Joseph as the main character. I laughed and cried very often and or at the same the same time. The battles never end like a stereotypical battle, like a friend gets hurt the main character gets more power etc. It never ends this way and you never know what happens next. Its quite enjoyable to see how our protagonists struggle between life and death. I loved that part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its quite enjoyable and you have to atleast watch 4-5 episodes to see what i mean. The beginning is very boring compared to the rest. So go ahead and watch it. I can highly recommend that anime and to everyone who loves battle, comedy, or drama animes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "After such a long run this series finally gets an anime and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  Jojo's Bizarre Adventure depicts Parts I and II of the series (titled Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency respectfully) and follows the tragic events inflicted on the Joestar family by the selfishness and evil of a man by the name Dio Brando and the legacy he leaves behind.\r\nPart I's main character is Jonathan Joestar, a young English gentleman who strives to be good and just.  One day a young boy named Dio Brando is adopted into the Joestar house due to a promise Jonathan'sfather made to Dio's father.  Dio, seeking to become wealthy and powerful, decides to steal the Joestar family inheritance by any means necessary.  Eventually Dio tampers with Jonathan's archaeological research, resulting in him stealing a stone mask that on immediate contact turns humans into superhuman vampiric creatures.  Jonathan takes it in himself to vanquish Dio and save the world from total darkness.\\n\\n\r\nPart II's main character is Joseph Joestar, the grandson of Jonathan Joestar.  He is a brash and arrogant American, but is very cunning and kindhearted.  His story follows roughly the same as Jonathan's in which Joseph must vanquish the growing presence of the vampires.  However, these vampires are searching for a way to exceed their powers to become gods.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say the story hooked me.  As complicated as it may seem it flows and sinks into the brain well.  Although I have not read Part I and II of the manga yet from what I heard the anime does the manga justice.  The pacing is very well done the anime does not seem rushed at all.  The art is one of the most exquisite forms of art I have ever seen in an anime, especially with character design.  Music has an incredible influence on this anime, particularly American classic rock. \\n\\n\r\nTo add an unbiased side I can see people disliking this series.  The dialogue can be quite ridiculous at times.  Characters tend to narrate what is going on at the present moment, which adds to the \"bizarreness\" of this show.  A couple of side/minor characters are unnecessary.  However I don't believe one has to be bizarre in order to like this show.  This anime is very likable: it is full of action and suspense, it has some of the best main characters I have seen in a long time, and does it's best at what's supposed to be.  An adventure.",

            "content": "I really wish i could rate parts 1 and 2 of JoJo separately. my thoughts and enjoyment of them differ greatly. I would give part 1 a general 5 for being lackluster, weakly written \"superman like\" main character, and having it feel slow paced even though it sped through the manga material. I \"dropped\" this series a couple of times before I was able to finish the first part. All that aside, I have to commend the author for being able to end the first part on \"that\" note, not many authors are willing to take that kind of chance so this allowed him toflourish in later parts. The second part, while still keeping pretty much the name level of animation, I would give an 8 or 9. This part was enthralling due to the excitement and charisma the main character brought to the scene. His tactical thinking and personality brought life to the show. Now, the main character isn't all that was brought to the table, his dynamic with his friend/rival was interesting to see, as well as the villains most of which were given depth to their character whether in subtle or \"in your face\" pronounced ways. This second part of jojo is what got me into the series, and it as well as part 4 are now my favorites.",

            "content": "You know how most mangas, especially Shounen, love to have anime adaptation as the manga's being made? Well, Jojo is the exception to that rule. Even though the manga was first published back in the 80' and it's still going, it took until 2012 for fans to get an anime adaptation of this classic manga (And no, anything mad by Studio APPP doesn't count). So, was it worth it. Well... yes, but there are some problems, though most of them are more so Araki's faults than David Productions'.\r\nStory:\r\nThis season is composed of the first two arcs (Or parts) of the manga, the Phantom Blood Partand the Battle Tendency Part. I'm guessing they grouped them together because they aren't very long (Part 1 is only 5 Volumes long, with Part 2 being just a bit longer with 7 Volumes) and became they're very thematically and visually similar.\\n\r\nIt's probably also a goo thing that they were grouped together as I don't think neither part is that good on their own.\\n\r\nPhantom Blood has a lot of problems, the pacing is atrocious, the plot is generic, it takes itself way too seriously at times and it just feels... disjointed. Like, there's a bit of a massive tonal shift after episode 4 and it is jarring as hell. That said, some of the ideas introduced in it are very original, and I will admit I'm glad they used Victorian England as the setting, they even got to use Jack The Ripper.\\n\r\nPart 2 does fix some of these issues, but also adds new ones. As for the fixes, the pacing is a bit better, there is no tonal shift and the show does embrace how ridiculous it is. However I feel it often got too ridiculous, so much so that I couldn't really get invested into it and I honestly feel that it just sorta blends in with other Shounen of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nReally though, you less so watch Jojo for the plot and more for the characters, and with good reason. As for the Part 1 cast, While Johnatan is a bit generic, the guy is just so lovable that you don't really care after a while. Zeppeli makes for a good mentor as well, and Speedwagon is just fun. And of course, there's the main antagonist, Dio Brando. I... I don't even know what to say about him. The guy's a living meme by this point and there's a reason for it. He's hammy, he's evil, he's completely full of himself and is just a plain great villain. The side cast though sorta blends into the background, wth none of th them really standing out.\\n\r\nThe part 2 cast is a bit more uneven though. When they're good, they're good, but when they aren't... they kinda suck. I know a lot of people love Joseph I. This part, but I honestly felt he could be really annoying at times, and not the good kind. By contrast, Caesar was a great rival/best friend character that I rooted for all the way through. Lisa Lisa is also a pretty good mentor in her own right, being different enough from Zeppeli to stand out even though she has a very similar role in the plot. As for the main antagonists, well, Eisidisi sucks, Wammu is pretty cool, and Kars is just okay. The sidecasr does stand out a bit more though, especially Stroheim (Is that how you spell his name?)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks... okay. They went for the art style Araki used towards the end of Part 2, which means the Part 1 characters got a bit of a redesign. It does mostly stay on model, but there just isn't much movement with the exception of the last two fights.\\n\r\nSpeaking of the fights, they're hit or miss. Some are really good, with my favorites being the Ceasar Vs Wammu fight and the second Johnatan Vs Dio fight. The rest are okay, but don't stand out as much as they should.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great. It goes for a classic soundtrack with equally classical instruments while still having a few modern instruments thrown in for good measures (Seriously, this franchise loves to add the electric guitar in a bunch of its songs). The first opening \"Sono Chi No Sadame\" is fantastic, with it sounding almost like the theme song of a modern epic. I didn't care that much for the second opening \"Bloody Stream\" but I do love its chorus.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nGood lord this cast is fantastic.Starting out with Part 1's cast, even though it was his first major role, I loved Kazuyuki Okitsu as Johnatan for pretty much the same reason I love his character. Takehito Koyasu was also fantastic as Dio, easily Part 1's stand out performance. The rest is no slouch either, from Nobuo Tobita, Ayako Kawasumi, Tetsu Inada and even Kenjiro Tsuda.\\n\r\nPart 2, aside from having some older actors like Tobita and Kawasumi come back, adds in a few new ones. The stand out is definitely Tomokazu Sugita as Joseph. I may not care for the guy, but Sugita did a fantastic job. The others are great too, from Atsuko Tanaka, Keiji Fujiwara, Akio Otsuka and even Kazuhiko Inoue himself as the main antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSo no, Jojo ain't the eighth wonder of the world, but I still enjoy it. It's a show that reminds me of a simpler time when Authors just did whatever they wanted and just had fun, and it shows. It's cheesy 80' fun, sure, but damn if I didn't enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "This show is an original action/adventure series with lots of personality to it. The story follows the adventures and trials of a certain prestigious family and their descendants. Action can vary widely, some scenes can be slow to drag out emotional impact, and others can be fast paced to emphasize intensity. Animation and art is extravagant (in the sense that things are overdone). Movements are typically slow, but definitely not in a bad way. If I had to name something bad about this show it would be that lines and dialogue can be poorly written at times. It can sometimes feel as though lines werefilled because nothing better came up (idle, pointless talking). If I had to name something good about this show it would easily be the cast, characters have a deep backstory and interact in a very entertaining and unpredictable way. Character personalities and behaviors have a very uncommon temperament that makes them interesting. The theme of the show pairs beautifully with the music, timing is good and emotions are very often enhanced by it. Humor is something this show does very well. If you are a fan of shows with twists this one does not disappoint. Favorite characters: Dio/Jotaro/Polnareff/Joseph. I give it a 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nTLDR Version: Best cast. Hilarious. Visually well done. Grows hair on your chest.",

            "content": "Jonathan Joestar is kind of boring.\r\nFrom the first episode of JoJo's, I knew I was diving into a unique aesthetic experience. Sure, there's not a ton of frames put into each movement, but all the other artistic components grab your eyes and ears by the balls. You have them bright flat colors, the hyper-muscled manly men dressed in high fashion. You have kanji flying across the screen to let you know what's going on is \"menacing.\" And, let's not forget the most memorable musical cue to end an episode of anything in all of history. I looked at the first three episodes and thought, \"thisis a show that chews its own scenery.\"\\n\\n\r\nBut after the inital sensory overload, I struggled to be entertained by Phantom Blood. As I said at the top of this review, Jonathan Joestar isn't the most charismatic protagonist in anime. He's a nice guy, and... yeah, great guy. The side characters don't stand out much, and the story takes itself more seriously than I thought when I watched those hammy first episodes. But, there's no exciting twists and turns; it's just heroes train and fight bad guys, without the humor of Dragon Ball or the raging teen hormones of Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes Part Two, and the JoJo starts to gel. Gone is JoJoSchmo. In his place is his much more charismatic nephew, Joseph Joestar. Think British Channing Tatum post-2012. He's cocky. He's reckless. He loves his grandma.   If God went to his 3D printer and printed out the very definition of the ultimate movie star, he would still come up a bit short against Joseph. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast has a bit more teeth in part two as well. Lisa Lisa is an intriguing mentor figure, and Major Von Stroheim brings his own brand of masculine charisma, even though I kind of feel icky saying that, cause he is of course a Nazi. In the personality department, part one's DIO has an upper hand on part two's Pillar Men, but the latter provide an unprecedented physical threat, which makes us even more invested in Joseph's journey to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nIs the first season of JoJo's perfect? No. But, stick with it, and you'll see the seeds of what has become a worldwide phenomenon.",

            "content": "MINOR SPOILER WARNING\r\nNOTE: This review will be split into two parts. Part one will cover the Phantom Blood arc whereas Part two will cover the Battle Tendency arc.\r\nWhen I was first recommended Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (JJBA) I was skeptical to say the least. Thanks to the various memes I had seen I was thinking of avoiding this one. I'm so glad I didn't. JJBA is one of the best Shounen animes I have ever seen, and here's why.\r\nPart 1 - Phantom Blood (episodes 1-9)\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nSynopsis: In 1868, Dario Brando saves the life of an English nobleman, George Joestar. By taking in Dario's son Dio whenthe boy becomes fatherless, George hopes to repay the debt he owes to his savior. However Dio, unsatisfied with his station in life, aspires to seize the Joestar house for his own. Wielding an Aztec stone mask with supernatural properties, he sets out to destroy George and his son, Jonathan \"JoJo\" Joestar, and triggers a chain of events that will continue to echo through the years to come.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's not the most interesting or complex plot to an anime and is one of the anime's weaker aspects it doesn't take away from the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I at first I wasn't sure about whether I liked or disliked the art style I can safely say that I LOVE this art style. The animation is fluid and clean which makes for really intense and impactful action sequences and really adds to the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm just gonna say it as it is, this anime has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. While I like the second OP more than the first OP it doesn't mean that its a bad OP in fact, it's great! Not only is it well animated as well as symbolic it is also incredibly energetic, pumping you up for the awesomeness that is JJBA. And with Roundabout as the anime's ED you can't go wrong.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go none of the characters are necessarily unique or complex but are instead quite quirky and enjoyable to watch (e.g Speedwagon and Baron Zeppeli). However, there are some characters (e.g Erina) who are severely lacking a personality of some sort.\\n\\n\r\nJonathan is a fairly boring and dull main character. He's kind, just, gentlemanly and...that's about it. Other than that Jonathan is a pretty boring character. However, there are a few moments in which I question the sanity/intelligence of Jonathan. For example after his dog Danny is BURNED ALIVE by Dio  what do you think Jonathan did? BECOME BESTIES WITH HIM OF COURSE! Seriously there is no way that Jonathan forgave Dio for burning Danny alive and became FRIENDS with him.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Dio... well as far as villains go Dio is a pretty crap excuse for one. While he does a bunch of screwed up things (such as burning is step brother's dog alive) he lacks any sort of motivation or purpose to be evil.\\n\\n\r\nWhile for the most part none of the characters are very unique or complex their various quirks and traits are enough to keep me entertained and don't take away from the arc as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile (in my opinion) the Phantom Blood arc is the worst part of the series it is FAR from being bad in any sense of the word. It is merely outclassed by the following arc.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2 - Battle Tendency (episodes 10-26)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Half a century later, in New York City, Jonathan's grandson Joseph Joestar discovers the legacy his grandfather left for him. When an archeological dig unearths the truth behind the stone mask, he realizes that he is the only one who can defeat the Pillar Men, mystical beings of immeasurable power who inadvertently began everything.\\n\\n\r\nWhile better than the first arc the story in JJBA remains as one of the series weakest points. The introduction of the Pillar men as the main villains is a lot more intriguing/interesting than Dio. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll just say it as it is, Bloody Stream by Coda is my favourite anime OP. Not only is the music really jazzy and awesome like its predecessor it is also well animated and symbolic. The visuals and song really go hand in hand and really fits the Battle Tendency arc. And again with Roundabout returning as the ED for the arc you can't possibly go wrong.\\n\\n\r\nOverall JJBA has one of the best soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I even start with this one? How about stating that Joseph is one of the best main characters I have ever seen? Or that the Pillar men are much better villains than Dio? Or that some of the SIDE characters would make better partners than Caesar? Lets start with Joseph.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph is one of the best main characters I have ever seen. He is unique, quirky, smart, funny, cunning, crafty, and just downright fabulous! It took ONE EPISODE to make me like him better than Jonathan. ONE EPISODE!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the side characters in the second arc of JJBA Speedwagon and Erina make their appearances as older versions of themselves and do not appear very often in this arc. We are introduced to a few new characters, Stroheim (the best nazi I have ever known), Smokey (whose existence is completely pointless and Lisa Lisa.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains of this arc (the Pillar men) are much more interesting and intimidating than Dio. Unlike Dio these guys have a PURPOSE for being evil and are much more powerful than Dio. While they don't really have any real personalities or character they are still much better villains than Dio.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Caesar...well he just pales in comparison to Joseph. he lacks the individuality, charm and humour of Joseph.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBattle Tendency is easily my favourite JJBA arc as it improves from the first arc in every area. From the characters to the OP Battle Tendency (in my opinion) is my favourite JJBA arc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (as a whole): 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole I really enjoyed JJBA from start to finish. Thanks to the quirky cast of characters and villains the anime has to offer as well as well executed action scenes which are both thrilling and impactful.",

            "content": "When I first got hooked to JoJo, I didn't quite know why. The show seemed to draw strength from its weaknesses: bad guys were bad just because they were bad and the same for good guys. They went powering up and beating lesser bad guys until reaching the main villain. But this simple plot and characters had such a special charm that I can't really put my finger on.\r\nPerhaps once you get rid of these less important stuff you become able to truly enjoy the anime: the aesthetics, the unique art, the amazing soundtrack, the fights (this is one of the few animes that canmake episode-wide spanning fights that are still interesting and exciting), the personalities (that fully compensate the shallowness of the characters) and the over-the-top manliness of it all.\\n\r\nFrom the Phantom Blood arc to Battle Tendency some of these characteristics are intensified. It is more unambiguously over-the-top, the art style gains more intent and uniqueness. The plot gets more complex too, but nothing too worthwhile. By the end it starts losing steam, the disregard for story starts hurting and draws negative attention to it. The final battle is specially disappointing and feels kinda rushed.\\n\r\nAlso worth noting are the amazing openings and endings and the famous \"to be continued\" that truly lives up the meme it inspired",

            "content": "I made a video: you can find it at my YouTube channel \"BasementOtaku\"\r\nVideo Script:\r\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure (Season 1) (10/10): For more information related to my rating system the video description should be satisfactory. Now it is time to discharge this spoiler laden review. \r\nI never really gave JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure much thought. My brother had shown me an abridged series comprised of clips from an old OVA and with the large cast and ludicrously masculine designs I didn\u2019t see much I would be interested in. Then I was five stories up on the top bunk in a Chicago hostel when I noticed that Stardust Crusaderswas in the list of updated anime on Crunchyroll. I was mostly watching the latest anime but I decided to give the earlier episodes of JoJo a watch. My initial reaction was just how good the show looked, it wouldn\u2019t be until later rewatching the show that I would see how many still frames and little tricks were used to create the powerful sensation the show delivered but I was blown away by its quality. That quality was complemented by the shows bravado, primarily in the form of Dio Brando. When Dio lept out the carriage and gave Jonathan a domineering look accentuated by unique sound design and shaking katakana I was hooked. Now if you are interested in why JoJo\u2019s is such a fantastic show I recommend you check out Super Eyepatch Wolf\u2019s two in depth videos which I will link them in the description. They helped me to better understand why I enjoyed the first part \u201cPhantom Blood\u201d and why the later \u201cBattle Tendency\u201d turned me into such a fan of JoJo\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nNow as much as I enjoyed Phantom Blood, as it drew me into the series, I would probably only give it a seven or eight rating. The characters outside of Jonathan and Dio serve only as filler villains or to tell us just how wonderful Jonathan is. While Jonathan is lovable he isn\u2019t very deep, his emotions and actions are very straightforward, more bending to the environments he is placed in than having any established character traits. The other major weakness is how Phantom Blood handles character death, as Super Eyepatch Wolf points out in his videos, holding someone while they give their last words isn\u2019t how death really works. It is usually unexpected and fast or, as we are seeing in season 4 of JoJo\u2019s, you can live too long until your mental and physical abilities leave you and you are but a husk of your former self. Phantom Blood has characters slowly dieing in someone's arms three times (Father, Zeppeli, Jonathan), with Jonathan\u2019s father and Jonathan himself both slowly giving farewells while Dio is in a prime position to befoul the situation. With all of that said Phantom Blood is still an enjoyable over the top romp that runs with the Fist of the North Star baseline and mixes it up with crazy vampire and zombie antics, creating a truly memorable and daunting villain in Dio. \\n\\n\r\nThe shift from episode nine ending Phantom Blood into the rest of the season comprised of Battle Tendency was not easy. For the majority of episode ten I was pretty pissed that my lovable gentlemanly giant had been replaced with the loudmouth buffoon that is Joseph Joestar. I figured the story would continue to be hamon user tries to stop vampire with Straizo as the new vampire in another punchout adventure, this time in America some years later. It wasn\u2019t until Joseph whipped out a tommy gun and shot up a cafe and declared \u201cthis is war\u201d with tears in his eyes at the end of the episode that I changed my tune. I have watched Battle Tendency three times now, and it still continues to be my personal favorite bit of anime out there. The story is compact with a constant sense of urgency and scale. Joseph is crazy but always consistent to his character, displaying real character growth but never losing what makes him so darn fun to watch. The only major complaint being that the pillar men, ACDC in particular, weren't fleshed out enough but with that being said they all still felt grounded in the world and like the ludicrously overpowered demigods that they are. \\n\\n\r\nHats off to David Production as they managed to translate Araki\u2019s impactful panels into equally impactful frames. Now the manga has far more detail and warps character models quite a bit so the main strategy used to create a sense of impact is in JoJo\u2019s top tier sound design. Where Phantom Blood was getting the hang of great sound design such as Dio\u2019s arrival, Battle Tendency knows what it wants to do and delivers, as seen in JoJo\u2019s fight against the first pillar man. The music is minimal but tense and every effect is used to create a feeling of dramatic impact or tension. I am a fan of realistic sound design in slice of life anime but JoJo\u2019s is action sound design done right. In the music department you have quite a few standouts with the \u201cAwaken,\u201d however you pronounce this \u201cIl Mare Eterno Nella Mia Anima\u201d and \u201cPropaganda\u201d being three of my personal favorites. Awaken and Propaganda because they do a great job of building up hype as well as amping up powerful scenes and this one (\u201cIl Mare Eterno Nella Mia Anima\u201d) because of how fitting it is in its use. It is used as Caesar theme, which is fitting as an Italian opera works early on for adding a sense of confidence and grandeur to his character that cares so much about his Italian family ties, but becomes a powerful and heartbreaking song when you learn the lyrics. I cried quite a bit when I first experienced Caesar\u2019s death, even more when I was listening to the soundtrack, and even more when I read the english translation to the lyrics, and more every time I rewatch episode 20 or relisten to the song. It is the final crescendo that always gets me.\\n\\n\r\nWherever you go\\n\r\nWherever I go\\n\r\nMy love lies deep within your life\\n\r\nMy love remains in your days\\n\r\nIt takes just one of your smiles\\n\r\nOne single smile\\n\r\nMy soul shall never die. It is immortal \\n\r\nIt is no use shedding tears for me\\n\\n\r\nIt is difficult to express in words how much I truly love this show but I\u2019ll fight on. \\n\\n\r\nThe utilization of animation resources to ensure episodes always looked great when they needed to, even though you can tell the show didn\u2019t have the highest of budgets, is another example of JoJo striving to outdo itself. Nowhere is this more clear than in episode 22 \u201cA True Warrior.\u201d The CG used for the chariot race is not the best but the 2D still looks great, utilizing lots of still frames and tight screen splits to maintain quality and visual interest, with the sound effects continuing to portray impact. Then the animation gets quite smooth in this great shot of JoJo vaulting himself into the air in slow motion. It all works together beautifully to create the illusion that the events taking place are not simply comprised of many still images but are part of a larger moving whole. \\n\\n\r\nLastly the OP (note \u201copening theme\u201d) and ED (note \u201cending theme\u201d). Both the OPs in JoJo\u2019s are pretty darn fantastic but the vibrant colors, fluid motions, and seriously jammable song is what makes the OP for Battle Tendency one of my favorites and one I rewatch frequently. The ED is less visually impressive but what really impressed me about Battle Tendency is how the ending music of the ED would change, and it changes quite a few times, in order to better match the ending of a given episode. It was a great surprise and helped to make a rather visually uninteresting ED stand out in and already stand out show. \\n\\n\r\nHoly crap this has been a long review, and there is still so much to talk about. If you want to know more or have questions related to the JoJo\u2019s anime feel free to leave a comment, I\u2019m more than happy to converse with you.   \\n",

            "content": "Talking about the first season of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre adventure is hard due to the fact that it contains two parts of the series that greatly vary in quality into one 26-episode season. So, when reviewing it I will be splitting up my scores and thoughts on the animes adaptation of Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency and then averaging off my scores to give and overall view of the season. Before that I would like to say that David productions have done a great job in recreating the manga into anime most of the faults for the season lie within how dated the writing has becomeas the manga was made in the 1980s. In terms of Art, Sound and Direction the season scores 10\u2019s across the board. David productions has faithfully recreated the atmosphere, poses and bizarre colour pallet from the manga perfectly, sound wise there are so many memorable tracks from both the parts. In Phantom Blood there\u2019s the iconic use of Roundabout as the ED, while in Battle Tendency Bloody Stream and the Pillar men Awaken are some of the best tracks from the anime series. \\n\\n\r\nPhantom Blood: Phantom Blood (PB) is where most of the problems of the season lie and as for mentioned is because of how dated the source material has become. The first three episodes are the highlight for the first part of the season. Jonathans relationship with Dio is nothing new but manages to be interesting as the dynamic between them is entertaining and well executed. This can be attributed to the performances of their voice actors who do an excellent job at portraying their respective roles. In the case of Jonathan his clich\u00e9 and boring character in partially alleviated within this section due to this dynamic and his voice actor\u2019s performance however after the introduction of the supporting cast of heroes of villains this slowly fades as their relationship is put on the back burner for cookie cutter side villains, a mentor character and a friend that\u2019s only use for is to commentate the fights and the flaws within the writing of Jonathan as a character are made clear. This section where JoJo is forced into facing Dios minions detracts from key story details such as the jump between Dio and Jonathan\u2019s relationship from their teenage years to their adulthood (where they suddenly become friends), the backstory of the mentor character Zeppeli (which is glossed over in a flashback) and the workings/history of the Harmon clan, slowing the pace from a breakneck speed for the first few episodes to a crawl to episode 9 where the part ends. The 5 episodes after episode 3 feel longer than the 17-episode length of Battle Tendency. In addition to this while the fights are well directed they often boil down to who can punch the hardest with only the final fight being a semi highlight and a showing of how fights in the future of the series will go. Overall the ratings for the part in my eyes are.\\n\r\nStory = 4\\n\r\nArt = 10\\n\r\nSound = 10\\n\r\nCharacters = 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 7 \\n\\n\r\nBattle Tendency: Battle Tendency (BT) is where this season is completely redeemed. The new JoJo Joseph is a complete 180 on the previous protagonist with an interesting personality to bout. Joseph is intellectually dumb and hotheaded however when it comes to combat tactically he is a genius and more than makes up for his physical limitations when in comparison to Battle Tendencies antagonists the god like Pillar men. The fights within BT are no longer solved by punch fights unlike its predecessor, the fights within this section of the season are tactical bouts of wit where Joseph looks to outwit his opponent, lay traps, use trial and error, utilize his environment, emotionally toy with his opponents and tactically retreat/stall. In addition, throughout the season the adversity that Joseph faces molds him into a less hot-headed individual which in comparison to the PB where Jonathan started as the model gentleman and ended as so. The main villains of the part are intimidating and propose a real threat as well as having their moments within the part with Wammu being a personal favorite. In terms of the side character department the amount of fight commentating has decreased, and three side characters get a decent enough treatment with Caesar, Lisa Lisa and Von Stroheim all getting their time to shine with fights, have interesting character dynamics with Joseph and in Caesar and Lisa Lisa case a decently fleshed backstory. The Indiana Jones style of this part is also a welcomed addition speeding up the pace as all parties are in search of an item which pushes the plot forward keeping the plot from dragging. Overall the part is a massive improvement and my ratings for the part are as follows.\\n\r\nStory = 8\\n\r\nArt = 10\\n\r\nSound = 10\\n\r\nCharacters = 9 \\n\r\nEnjoyment = 10\\n\\n\r\nMean ratings \\n\r\nStory = 6\\n\r\nArt = 10\\n\r\nSound = 10\\n\r\nCharacters = 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 9 (8.5 round up due to BT taking up more of the season)\\n\\n\r\n There is some talk within the community whether due to JoJo\u2019s nature it\u2019s worth skipping Phantom Blood due to the massive disparity in quality compared to other parts and while narratively you can get by with the rest of the series by skipping it I personally think its worth the watch mainly due to the first three episodes and the establishment of Dio. \\n",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and all of its subsequent releases, are a good choice for you if you're looking for over the top action that progressively evolves into more interesting & strange setups and fights. It is very much an evolving action series, starting from a traditional 90's action series where the most basic strongest zealous badass gentleman wins because that's who he is, and then eventually going towards an action series where every fight and situation is so different from one another, that you will watch it to admire the way the different powers, mentalities, locations and respective opponents play out in creating wildly varyingand unique matchups.\\n\\n\r\nBut JoJo starts really simple in terms of wild matchups. Before I go into it, I'd like to say the following two things. First, JoJo is a series that can be digested in any order you want. It is split by parts and each part has an individual and selfconcluding story that of course ties together with every part and has some repercussions later, but you can watch JoJo in any order you want if you don't mind spoilers for the previous part and you could watch the former parts as flashbacks of what formerly happened if you'd choose to do so. I personally find the idea interesting, but I did watch/read them in the chronological order, so I can't guarantee the way you'll enjoy it if you were to watch them in an out of order fashion. Secondly I wanna say that this anime is formed of two parts out of the 8 JoJo has, which I'll talk about separately rather than together, but I'll tie it all together eventually. In the case of these two parts however, although I said they can be consumed in any order, I strongly advice you to always watch the first part, Phantom Blood, before you move on to the second, Battle Tendency, because you'll see the type of progress JoJo will be having during its lifetime and its constant desire to improve and differentiate from not only its previous parts but general action series conventions set within its time.\\n\\n\r\nI'll talk about each part's strengths and weaknesses, and then give more details on the overall JoJo experience, as in, what to expect going onwards into the future parts and what you should expect from JoJo.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Part 1, Phantom Blood.\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, Phantom Blood is nothing special. By itself, in terms of anything except one specific thing, it is quite average in most aspects that are prevalent elements of its own part. As I've said, the main character wins because he's honorable and strong, he's a manly man, he's traditional, his opponents are evil, he is not an interesting character on his own and the fights aren't that interesting either. The over the top elements aren't as prevalent, (at least not if intended) they're there, but they're not as ridiculous as they are to become, overall, Part 1 would be almost a botch if it wasn't directed well by the studio. But there's one thing, that is very interesting in Phantom Blood. Jonathan's relationship with Dio. And the studio, David Production, agreed with me on this one since out of the manga's content, they mostly focused on the moments crucial to the story and on displaying Jonathan's relationship with his adopted brother, Dio.\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship starts like this: Dio is adopted by a rich family after living through poverty and abuse and now he wants to inherit the money of the Joestar family. Due to his social status and overall demeanor, Dio despises Jonathan, seeing him as a weak person who doesn't deserve what he has, this leaving Jonathan completely oblivious to why Dio would hate him, since all he knew in his life is a comfortable life. It isn't a relationship that can be characterized as just good vs evil, as most of everything in this part seems to boil down to, but rather its core drive seems to be the people Jonathan and Dio are at their core, the aristrocrat vs the slums. Dio only knew abuse and ruthlessness from other people while Jonathan was raised to be a gentleman. Their relationship is really complex because two really fundamentally different people collide with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThat's what David Production tried to polish out of Phantom Blood. A complex relationship about the man who was raised right against the man who was raised wrong. They skipped most random fights between vampires and ghouls and only focused on things that display things about Dio, Jonathan and the core story that envelops during it. And this made Phantom Blood very interesting and a worthwhile watch for me. Even if it was mostly executed in a safe for its time way in the manga, the fact that I saw exactly what differentiated it from the other stories of its type due to the clever direction chosen by the studio, I had a worthwhile experience from this part. \\n\\n\r\nBut I wanna speak about the flaws of Phantom Blood. Outside the relationship of the protagonist and antagonist, and the over the top nature of the series with some of its moments, there's nothing inherently interesting or memorable about it. Like, there are some weird anatomical impossibilities or things that clearly don't work that way or are impossible that you can consider flaws too, but considering the over the top nature of JoJo, those things entertain me rather than dissapoint me. Doesn't mean that they're not there and other people would not hate noticing those, and there's no real need for examples here, because honestly, there's at least one every episode. Just expect being like \"humans can't do that\". Nowhere in any part is as ridiculous as in Phantom Blood. The amount of times I was like \"STUDY BASIC HUMAN ANATOMY\" due to the sheer amount of things that just don't work as rudimentary biology is significantly higher than it should've been, but eventually I got over it and was like, fuck it, it's hilarious. My favorite one has to be one of the first where the series goes into a first person perspective of the main character and he jumps over a gigantic fountain. Note there are no supernatural powers at this point.\\n\\n\r\nThe main flaw of Phantom Blood is that every fight is forgettable, as well as its opponents, which is a fucking terrible thing in an action series. There's just never really anything unique about most characters except for a few side characters that help the protagonist and there's also Dio. The power of the characters is a basic poorly explained power where you create energy through inhaling air right, and sent it into something and manipulate it in a way for practical use and cleansing vampires... well, it doesn't really sound as anything noteworthy, especially when your main character uses it to punch stronk. If only there was someone who could use the power properly... The villains are vampires or ghouls that are... best described as weaker than the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it fine is that the main focus, like 60%+ of the actual episodes allocated for this part, are spent on detailing and giving depth to the relationship between the protagonist and antagonist, and if you're interested in the type of relationship I've described, you will enjoy it, even if you're likely to find everything else about this part mostly mediocre. Unfortunately, if you're only looking forward for the interesting action bits of the series, you'll have to wait if you start in chronological order.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Part 2, Battle Tendency\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty much the polar opposite of its preceding part. While its story isn't really anything to write home about, the action of this part is solid, the main character is a breath of fresh air, being the complete opposite of Jonathan and this part has a bunch of memorable characters due to both their story and some ridiculous facts about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Joseph Joestar, who is a highly disrespectful guy who often gets himself involved into an altercation with anyone around deserving of it. He isn't a traditional gentleman like Jonathan and will exploit any opportunity to trick anyone into gaining an advantage over them in a fight. But what's more important is that Joseph, unlike Jonathan, never wins his fights due to brawn and instead always outwits his opponents.\\n\\n\r\nEvery battle in Battle Tendency is Joseph bullshitting his way through the whole thing, trying to outsmart everyone. If he runs out of ideas he just runs away or tries to bullshit a way to make the enemy let him run away. Anytime Joseph has a confrontation with anyone it is pure entertainment value as you have no idea how he's gonna get out of an unfavorable situation and through what bullshit, but you know that he will. Be it he does it through a way that feels overwhelmingly ridiculous and over the top or through a way that does seem tactically sound, I couldn't help but chuckle at the times he turned a situation his way. If you enjoy seeing a character constantly outsmart other people, you'll have a lot of fun with Battle Tendency. While I'd like to give an example that would make you understand what I mean, the best I can give you is suggest you to look for Joseph vs Cops on youtube. While it is not the most sound example of what I've explained, it does highlight the personality of the main character and his overall demeanor, as well as his craftiness, in a way that's very easy to compare with Jonathan.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the fact the writer, Hirohiko Araki, made this decision is really impressive, as it shows that he was willing to experiment to improve and he was trying his best to create an unique work. Not only did he go against the expectations of the overall average consumer at the time, but he also went against the expectations of the fans of the series to date. He took a risk because he thought it would be interesting, which is something to be respected, a risk that payed off and created a highly entertaining action series. That's what I wanted to show about JoJo as a series. It constantly tries to top itself off, become more interesting and unique and improve. That's how JoJo became one of the most influential series to date. It constantly challenged itself. And Araki, the writer, is well deserving of the praise.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters go, what's more interesting about them is that now they have actual roles and powers that differentiate them from the other characters, unlike the former where only a few characters stood out. While not every character is memorable, there's a lot of them that bring some personality of their own into the story. While I think this didn't necesarily help the overarching story, since the focus of the story wasn't as concise as before, it gave the fights more immersion and us more reasons to immerse ourselves with them. They don't really influence the overall flow of things when you really think about it, and this becomes a larger problem in the following part, but this is not the review I'll talk about that.\\n\\n\r\nIt topped its preceding storyline in almost every aspect. While there's no relationship as strongly displayed as Jonathan's & Dio's, everything else is completely better. I'd say it's a very good and entertaining action series. Some of the over top bits of it might be a high or a low for you, depending on what you want from action series, but it worked out great for me, as I enjoy a character going against opponents that are supposed to be significantly superior to them in every aspect and then outwitting them, and considering the gap of power between them, I am willing to accept some things. \\n\\n\r\nThe story now is about a race of people who are sensitive to sunlight but are the top of the foodchain awakening and their leader wants to become the perfect being, and Joseph and his team have to stop them. Doesn't really sound like anything noteworthy storywise and I'd say it is mostly fine in that department. It isn't exactly cliche, but it doesn't really stand out too much in sheer storytelling value. That's the one aspect it didn't top. While I do regret there wasn't really anything to create a strong conflict or animosity between the characters and create a relationship as complex as Dio's and Jonathan's, I was really impressed by how everything else improved. And at its core, it succeeds in being a really interesting action series.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 What's the overall JoJo experience?\\n\\n\r\nBluntly put, gorey, over the top and composed of well thought action.\\n\\n\r\nThere's plenty of moments where characters get very grotesque wounds, censored if not watching the BD version, so you can opt for what you prefer. The censorship style isn't one to really take away from what's happening in the moment. The wounds are just black as to remove the level of detail while still leaving enough detail to understand exactly what happened, so there's no need to be too afraid of what you might actually see.\\n\\n\r\nIt's over the top in the sense that, well... the characters take random poses, some homoerotic, some dress homoerotic, some do hilariously dumb shit that can barely be taken seriously, yet, somehow, it still ties together into something that can be taken seriously. In all honesty, I don't think I can make a list long enough where the show just simply does something incredibly ridiculous, you'll notice it, you'll shrug or chuckle, and then carry on. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the action... well... it's hard to describe in a short way. The first two parts of JoJo start with a power that has virtually infinite uses if you really think about it, but it has some limits because it can't be used on real humans, so eventually the writer developed a concept called stands, which are basically a manifestation of their spirits, which are meant to protect the user and all have different powers. It all gets really diverse later on with plenty of different powers and situations thrown into the mix, rather than having one character who outwits everyone, which as I've said, was entertaining, now every fight has an inner logic and some rules based on the limitations of each power, as each is unique. It's basically confrontations happening in a lot of varying situations, this creating great action, so the formula works.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle of the first 3 JoJo's is almost consistently GAR, which basically means it is an artstyle that features overlymasculine men. Afterwards, the artstyle seems to become more homoerotic and weird as fuck with its designs, but David Production does seem to want to take this into a direction of their own, for example, Part 4's backgrounds is mostly a blend of like 3 colors. It will also feature SFX effects written in katakana on screen, trait taken after the manga, giving JoJo a distinct visual feeling. Not to say they're gonna change Araki's character designs, just that they might take some liberties with some of the animation's style.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, the only reason you should check it out is if you're interested in action series. It constantly develops and tries to top itself off in terms of unique setups and it often does really well. I enjoy a good action series, and the action in JoJo is what I aspire to see in a series. I suggest checking out Part 3 or Part 4's fights to make an informed decision if you're interested in all of what JoJo has to offer, because that's the routine it will adopt.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I still stand by to something I said in another JoJo review:\\n\\n\r\nYou will most likely enjoy any JoJo if you're looking for a series with over the top action where they can be either downright silly, (intentionally) really hype or really unsettling. You will most likely dislike any JoJo if you're not gonna be willing to treat its story or its universe as somewhat senseless to some extent and aren't willing to enjoy its ridiculousness when it serves it.",

But, from this show I conducted two things, 1: The writer of this show watched a lot of DBZ for rfrence (Srsly, I don't know how many times I heard COLOR ATTACK OVER DRIVE!!!!) in episode 7 of this show... or 2: They were high, and had no Idea what they were doing, and after they got out of there highness thinking they were workingon One Piece they had to stick with it and. Right now, the creators lost a lot of blood cells while making this show..\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the show, this show is awesome, and does have a unique adventure to it. But the show might not be for everyone since the show is kind of like DBZ with them getting random power ups and battling people after people in each episode. But it does make you want to keep on watching so I have to give it to that, so if you ever want to watch this anime, Make sure that after episode 1, you smoke weed cause that's the only way you'll enjoy this show. (Okay maybe i was exagerating but still...)",

            "content": "***contains spoilers***\r\nExcuse me if this seems scattered, but my brain is all over the place after watching this.\r\nSo my story goes like this - after seeing lots of gifs and praise of this anime, i decided to give it a go... And oh boy, i couldn't imagine what i got myself into, guess it wasn't called a \"bizarre adventure\" for nothing. Let's start with the few good things the anime has - visuals and sound. The visuals are very stylized and amazingly drawn, though the fact that almost every male character looks the same (macho face and body that almost look indistinguishable from eachother) kindaruins it.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't read up on what this anime is or watch any spoilers, so going into this blind, my first impression of this was that this is a COMEDY. I watched this with my friend, and our time watching the first few episodes was split in 3 - one third when we where just laughing nonstop (from the comical acts, poses, face expressions, narration and lack of physics/ logic), one part where we where wondering why everyone acts and looks so strange, and the final third of the time doubting if it is in fact a comedy or not. Sadly, after a while we came to the conclusion it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what's the problem you ask? Well, first of all - consistency, internal logic, logic, physics... They all cry in the corner because the machos in the show seem too manly to notice those whimps. On top of that the show actually somehow manages to take itself seriously! And that would be ok if it was a show for kids, but it isn't! With all the gore cruelty and violence, its rating of 17+ here on MAL is well deserved (though why its tagged as shounen in the same time is a mystery to me.. probably because of how immature it is despite being rated for mature audience... i just... WHAT?).\\n\\n\r\nNarration. There's literally about a third worth of airtime of it. From the obvious to the less obvious, there's so much of it that the show manages to make the characters narrate despite the fact that it has a narrator as well! The characters are weak in best. Now that doesn't mean they didn't have potential, because they did - a lot of them where actually interesting to begin with, but they all get really boring and obnoxious after a pretty short time period because they are cliche and predictable, as well as lack any kind of development... Maybe that's why the show's answer to that problem is just killing them off as soon as possible, a fate that catches even the main protagonist (in the first part at least). The story is REALLY weak.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end my verdict is 6/10, but that's mostly because of the art, i'd say the rest is pretty dreadful and may be worth a watch only if you want some laughs.",

            "content": "Where to begin.... I may as well go with the normal rant about this being my opinion, how I will do my best not to give spoilers or how any likeness to real life people or events is strictly coincidental. As for me my over all impression of the anime was hard to describe and after many hours of thinking I have settled on the term \"uncomfortable\". No mater what was happening be it a heart wrenching moment of sorrow, a blood boiling fight or a spine chilling moment of realization, something felt off, but most of the time in a good way. Watching itwas like having a crush on someone you know you shouldn't. You like them, but something is just not right about it. Its not bad, its just not 100%. You know what I mean right? Any how on the the reviewing.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken is a surprisingly deep an well written anime. It takes a rather stock and by today's standards, a well used formula of vampire hunting and goes in a slightly different direction. The first thing to note is that the vampires in question were the old kind, violent, charismatic and with over inflated ego's. I found it quite refreshing to see the good old blood suckers from back in the day before they were over primed emo kids that shine in the sun instead of turning to dust. The origin of the vampire they opted to use was also out of the norm and honestly quite clever as well. All in all the villain's of the show were a nice cut above the standard throughout. It was unfortunate that I didn't feel the same about the hero's but to each there own.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is told in two parts. The first is a form of origin story, not of the vampires or of the hunters, but of the Joestar family to which the protagonist come from. It tells the tail of JoJo's grandfather and his struggle against the evil menace and the artifact that created them and concludes with the legacy his family is to inherit down the ages. This was, in my opinion, the best part of the show. The characters were better written and there relationships were much deeper compared to the second part of the story. I fell the show would have been improved over all if they had made this part two or three episodes longer but alas it was not to be so. It succeeds well as a prolog and dose a spectacular job of filling you in on the law without giving anything to big away, I only wish they could have kept the pace through out the 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and by far the longer section is when the story begins in earnest however. Set around fifty years after the events of the first part we are greeted with the protagonist saving a young man from some crooked cops. From this simple event everything seems to snow ball into a series of completely unrelated things resulting in a battle for the world. The true evil is revealed rather swiftly and goes a little further down the rabbit hole before deciding it should probably try and explain itself a little. It was around 4 episodes into the second story the water got muddy. Rapid introduction of unimportant or seldom used characters and a lack of explanations were the worst of it but ultimately not hampering. Despite all that it dose keep a steady flow of action and story development going, it just gets a bit messy. This mild fault in the writing however was the only major problem I had with the show. Most of the other things were little and nit picky and not really worth a mention.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note is the attention to detail in the world of JoJo. I don't claim to be a historian but fore each time period from the two story arch's they remain quite true. From the clothing to the technology all the way to the speech pasterns it felt real. A strong case was maid for this at the beginning of the second story set in America 1938 when we see JoJo being sold a \"new\" soda beverage. Not going to spoil the surprise but I found it quite funny and well plaid. The art stile was also quite interesting. It was quite exaggerated with lots of hard lines and inhumanly bulky muscles. It took me a little bit to get used to it but in the end I came around on it. I will say however it was a big influence on the \"uncomfortable\" feeling the show gave me.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up JoJo. Its a solid 7 from me. Good. I honestly recommend it to anyone willing, I doubt you will regret it. It is quite accessible to all levels of watcher as well. Its got enough action and trash talk to get you going but deep enough that the story watchers will get a good run from it as well. Take a swing and go for gold. JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken is worth the spot on you watch list.\\n\\n\r\nRock it out and anime on!\\n",

            "content": "It's 2017 and I've only just watched Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. I started this out just because I wanted a new series to start on and it had initially been recommended by a friend. Apart from that, I didn't really have any or much knowledge of JJBA at all. But maybe because I didn't expect a lot or know a lot, that was probably why I managed to enjoy it so much to be honest. \r\nThe storyline wasn't amazing. Typical powerful MC with a mission and tragic backstory and who grows throughout the sotry, etc, etc. The only thing that really stood out was maybe thepowers, even then it isn't as if other shounen anime don't have special attacks of their own. But honestly, it was good that the story didn't distract from the entire theme of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt was entirely too dramatic, with written text sound effects, and close ups of faces and amazing voice acting like, Dio's \"joJO\" will always be a favourite to me. The thicc thigh art style and basically the entire ost as well as colouring of the anime is so unique and captivating in itself - it was honestly a really big treat to the eyes in general. \\n\\n\r\nEven with some points of the story/set up bordering on \"WTF\" and \"Why am I still watching this?\", the moment you start JJBA it's completely too hard to stop. You want to know what happens to the characters next, even if you can guess what happens next. (Although there are details to the story you'd never be able to guess beforehand because honestly some of them are wAY too outlandish. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, JJBA deserves it track record as popular and known anime. The essence of 'bizarre' being so accurately represented in what happens throughout the anime as well the really amazing and entirely suitable art style and feel of the entire anime really brings it together as an orchestra of \"I don't know why but I fucking love this\" \\n\\n\r\n12/10 would recommend with or without rice",

            "content": "To me when watching anime or anything else for that matter, originality is very important to me. Unless something is well executed unoriginal shows really tend to put a damper on my viewing experience. On another note I am happy to say Jojo's Bizarre adventure doesn't disappoint in this category. As it is one of the most original and most fun anime series I have ever seen. \r\nJojo's Bizarre adventure is an anime series that has become a heavy fan favorite ever since it came out. It is based off a manga series by Hirohiko Araki that is divided into parts and this seriesadapts the first 2 parts. An OVA series and a movie later fans were craving a cut free true adaption and in 2012 this is what they got. And with that being said it was an instant hit and I can definitely see why.\\n\\n\r\n So what makes this series so good? Well I'll tell you why, entertainment. This series has balls to the walls action and humor that almost makes it impossible not to love. The story is a very simple yet effective tale that manages to incorporate many tropes and cheese to amp up the fun factor. The narriative's linear nature is actually not as bad as many would think however it isn't something deep or philosophical. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is essentially two arcs linked together. The reason this works is because the characters are related and the entire series as a whole follows the bizzare adventures of the joestars. One problem however is that I felt that there was too much of a quality difference between the two arcs. Like the first arc was good it was fine but the second arc was just amazing and it was like a complete upgrade from the first arc. \\n\\n\r\nAnother brilliant aspect of this series is the way the action is handled. I mean we all ,I've action in one way or the other but the idea of hamon is very unique and it adds more pizazz to the fights. The great animation also couples well with this aspect and it was just some excellent fights spanning the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters of this series all I will say is that they're very good. They were all entertaining and blended in with that macho cheesy theme the series's was going for. Joseph joestar was probably the greatest character in the series in my opinion as he utilized some great comedy and some great one liners. I was also a huge Caesar fan he was very funny and had some great character chemistry with Jojo. There were many villains present throughout the series and a few of them were interesting . Especially Wamuu and Dio. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was outstanding. Plenty of color it was fluid and as I mentioned earlier it coupled well with the action scenes. ut also had a wonderful sheen and polish to it. However I can't say the same about the mediocre CG present in both of the opening themes and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound present here was honestly amazing. The ost and opening themes were both great. The voice work was honestly great and it was very funny and the seiyuus really got into their characters very well. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end this series was a great ride. It was very funny with quality characters and an Intriguing story. It also had that great machismo cheese feel that didn't feel cringe worthy in a way. If you want an original piece that has quality to boot Jojo's Bizarre adventure is an excellent choice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now before I start this review, I must state that JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken actually contains the first TWO arcs of the JJBA series. I will first be reviewing the Phantom Blood arc, then the Battle Tendency arc. \r\nI have seen almost all of the JJBA series (save for the second half of part 7 and part 8, which is still ongoing at the time of writing). And I have to say, this first part of JJBA is probably the worst the franchise has to offer. This is not to say that I did not enjoy JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken at all. Thevarious characters such as Dio and Speedwagon did pique my interest enough to continue the show. Also, after reading the Phantom Blood anime, I have to say that the studio managed to make the arc less boring while still being faithful to Araki's original. My main criticism is that the first arc contains an overwhelming amount of cliches, from a Mary Sue/Kenshiro wannabe protagonist to an antagonist with no clear goal other than to be evil. Of course, it should be noted that JJBA started in 1987 and may have actually been the origin of all these cliches. (Regardless, a weak point of the arc)\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the second half of the JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken anime. I have to say Joseph Joestar's arc was a lot more exciting than the first arc. The Battle Tendency arc is really where JJBA's trademark wackiness starts to really show. From Stroheim, the bizarre ultra-nationalistic nazi to the wisecracking Joseph Joestar the characters are truly a delight to follow. The antagonists of this arc aren't really unique or interesting compared to other jojo antagonists, but they still manage to insert a good deal of conflict into the show. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I did say that these earlier arcs are probably the worst the JJBA franchise has to offer, but they are still JJBA arcs regardless. I highly recommend starting here to kickoff your journey into the JJBA franchise. JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken is entertaining enough and it will amplify your enjoyment once you reach the later arcs of the franchise.",

            "content": "It's probably the huge amount of enjoyment I got from watching it that made it so i just couldn't score it any lower than a 10. So call me biased if you want, but I just loved watching it.\r\nThis review also counts towards the Stardust Crusaders arc (I'm reviewing the series as a whole).\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is probably one of the best anime I've seen in a while, and has even worked it's way up to my top 3!\r\nWhy?\r\nIn my personal opinion Jojo is very original and unpredictable. It keeps throwing new twists at you and makes sure you never have a dull moment.\r\nThe seriestakes place in the real world during various time periods, but combines that with its own story, wit and action.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle really differs from any other popular anime released during the same time-period, which makes it even more unique, there's probably nothing from 2012 and onward that looks like JJBA.\\n\\n\r\nJJBA is a shonen anime, but the way they fight against the bad guys never gets repetitive. One time they have to play poker against someone who steals souls and puts them in poker chips, and Jojo has to win his friends back in an intense battle of wits. And the other time they have to battle it out in an action-packed over the top anime-fight!\\n\\n\r\nMy personal favorite part of the Jojo anime series are the villains. Because these guys are actually intimidating and scary!\\n\r\nEspecially DIO as he appears in part 3 of the series. The audience gets teased by a mysterious man whose face is constantly cloaked in shadows and manipulates others to do as he commands. Until he finally reveals himself to our heroes and they finally experience DIO's terror face to face!\\n\r\nThe way the story works its way up to this moment is brilliant and you should definitely experience that for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nI started watching JJBA in a period where I was kinda bored with anime, and I couldn't quite find something that I truly liked to watch... And it rekindled my interest in anime again. So if you're looking for something you have never seen before, that makes you sit at the tip of your chair but at other times makes you laugh, give this anime a try!",

            "content": "Hearkening back to the days of yore when anime men were built like brick houses, punching people resulted in them exploding into bloody chunks, and long internal and external discussions on the meaning of life padded runtimes, Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure is a breath of fresh air in the stagnant pool of modern anime. There\u2019s so much in Jojo that, in any other anime, would be miserably awful. The thing is, Jojo manages to combine nonstop, manly action with a lot of characters talking about nothing in a brisk, interesting way. In a world where twenty-six episodes of a shonen anime covers maybe twenty to twenty-fivechapters of a manga, Jojo covers 113 chapters in twenty-six episodes. And it never loses the integrity of the source material.\\n\\n\r\nJojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure is a generational saga that starts in the late 1800\u2019s with the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and his adopted brother, Dio Brando. Jonathan\u2019s father has acquired an ancient mask, which Dio winds up using to turn into a seemingly immortal vampire. As he builds his army, Jonathan trains to defeat his brother. Using a technique called the Ripple, he goes with his new master and best friend Speedwagon to defeat Dio.\\n\\n\r\nThis first part of the anime is actually one of my favorite manga storylines ever. It\u2019s very simplistic and Cain and Abel-esque, but it\u2019s so much fun because of how over-the-top it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe second story arc is about Jonathan\u2019s grandson, Joseph, who ends up battling against the Men in the Pillars, vampires who have been imprisoned in pillars since ancient times. He must train as his grandfather did, then finally take on his great enemies before they destroy the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the series is pretty simple and is the same tired \u201cFight, train, fight\u201d formula, but taken to crazy extremes. The training sequences aren\u2019t long and drawn out and the few training scenes are interesting because of how ridiculous they are. The action scenes are just the same, minus the last fight that was drawn out a bit more than any of the others. Expect fights to last only an episode, maybe an episode and a half. It\u2019s refreshing to watch a shonen series that doesn\u2019t bore you with drawn out fights. And while characters talk about honor and gentlemanship and all kinds of other stupid things, it isn\u2019t boring. Other characters are being decapitated, ripped in half, speaking despite missing essential body parts, and generally becoming gory messes, which typically enlivens any speech.\\n\\n\r\nThere are lots of soap opera moments that end with lots of crying and lessons about things that normal human beings don\u2019t have to worry about because we don\u2019t follow the code of warrior honor, but these just add charm. If the writing had been good, these scenes wouldn\u2019t have been worth it.\\n\\n\r\nIf the writing had been good, the anime wouldn\u2019t have been worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nJojo doesn\u2019t take itself seriously in the least and actually comes across as almost a parody of the macho manly-man anime of the eighties and nineties. At first I thought the writers were attempting to emulate the speaking of English people one hundred years ago, but then I realized they were just screwing with me. The writing is so fantastically bad that it has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s as operatically dramatic as you\u2019d want, while also bursting with hilarious phrases and words. \u201cWe\u2019re not chums anymore Jojo.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve piddled my pantaloons.\u201d Stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all just as ridiculous as the plot and writing. None of them have much character but the Jojo\u2019s are the selfless, self-sacrificing heroes who will do anything to protect honor and friendship and all that good shit. All the women are just loud, dumb, useless girls except for one, who the bad guys treat as a man anyway and is given a pointless bath scene. Any badass girl must have a bath scene if she is not shown in some sort of sexual position. Just look at Revy in Black Lagoon. She didn\u2019t wear much, sure, but she wasn\u2019t ever sexualized. Until a bath scene.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it\u2019s supposed to show that these women can be vulnerable?\\n\\n\r\nOr maybe it\u2019s just tits because there\u2019s a quota that needs to be met.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty much as retro as the rest of the anime. Lots of hard lines, big biceps, and fight scenes that don\u2019t run fluidly but instead cut to still shots of punches or loop the same punch animation. Despite that, the look and style actually give it a lot of character. I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, goddam was Jojo phenomenal. The first opening is cheesy as fuck but so good. The second opening isn\u2019t quite as great, but then you get the ending. Roundabout by Yes.\\n\\n\r\nLet me say that again:\\n\\n\r\nROUNDABOUT BY YES!\\n\\n\r\nAn actual licensed English classic closes every episode and damn is that awesome. I love the song, so it was a great surprise to hear it close out Jojo. The choice of song comes from Jojo\u2019s creator, a huge fan of American music. This is easily seen in the song choice as well as the names of the characters, almost all of whom are named after American bands, songs, or band members. From Speedwagon to Tong Pheti to Lisa Lisa, Jojo is so full of references you can fill a whole page pointing them all out. Catching them all is a fun game and the naming choices also enhance the show beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nJojo just has so much style. From the music to the character design to the way the characters do weird ballerina stances to the names to the animation\u2026everything about this show leaks a long-lost style that will never again be captured. This anime stands out specifically for being so stylized, unclean, and manly. Anime needed Jojo right about now.\\n\\n\r\nHeroes of modern anime are pussies like Eren from Attack on Titan or Kirito from Sword Art Online. Lanky little bitches who never cease to bore the crap out of me. Joseph and Jonathan are the opposite, giant men who only shed tears when reminiscing on the manliness of their fellow comrades.\\n\\n\r\nJojo is the kind of injection anime needs.  It\u2019s an injection of testosterone that seems to be lacking from pretty much every title of the past ten years. Anime has grown up in a lot of areas but seems to have regressed in a lot of others, especially as far as characters go. The characters have to be more relatable so, inevitably, become whiny teenagers. But what studios don\u2019t seem to recognize is that there is a goodly population of older anime fans who want to watch something that isn\u2019t full of angst.\\n\\n\r\nJojo isn\u2019t full of angst. It\u2019s full of motherfucking man juice.",

Do you like vampires ? (if you didn't it's not a problem i hate them vampires are faggots) Do you like Jojo's Bizarre adventure ? (ok that was a stupid question)\r\nIf you like all this and if you didn't you must watch JJBA because it's a fucking reference men ! It's one of the most popular manga in Japan and manga are Japanese, crazy right ? So this is cool ! \r\nBasically Jojo's Bizarre Adventure blow my mind, the firstpart isn't the most appreciate by humans but she is in a special part of my heart. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first part you will follow the story of Jonathan Joestar who is basically a faggot, one day Dio a mysterious and swag boy come to is house, kiss the girl he loved (but he didn't fuck already because it's a faggot) and try to became a member of Jonathan's (jojo for the hype guys) family, the father knows him because some stuff happened between the two families and blablabla we don't give a fuck. But after that a rivality born between Jojo and Dio and this rivality is the beggining of the most fucking epic/tragic/gay/muscular/funny/bizarre adventure that you're going to follow ! Dio's intentions are to have the Jonathan's father heritage, to later have bitchies and, maybe a champagne swimming pool.\\n\\n\r\nEach part happened in a different time and you will follow the Joestars family members which are all of them in a different way fighting Dio. (especially during the 3 first parts).\\n\\n\r\nThis manga and especially the anime got a special graphic style that i found beautiful, it reminds us of comics and all that shit. OST's are mind blowing and each part have a special music style : electro jazz, medieval-dubstep (not kidding it's fire, also guys don't forget to check out my mixtape) and stuf like music with instruments to make sound. The openings are so awesome that you will sing them under your shower so louder that your neighbour will probably fuck you up with a kamehameham (or without ham version for islamic persons). \\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure got a lot of humour (jokes and fun things that will makes you go : \"hahaha\"), rock references, fucking gay poses, and a lot of things that are so Jojo. The 4th season is coming this spring so it's the moment to start this adventure, you will not be disappointed and you'll check out my mixtape (again sorry for advertising people).\\n\\n\r\nSorry for bad english lol, and don't forget to +1 if you liked this review and don't forget to break your computer if you're a SAO fan !",

The earlier version is very confusing since happens after the 2012 version and also has a prequel in the last 6 episodes, it's just a mess.  This 2012 one is funny!\r\nGreat characters, good story, original, and also theart is pretty good so it's a great anime in general.",

            "content": "This is my first time watching \"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\", and I really loved it. This series contains a Part I and Part II, both of which are necessary in order to explain the Jojo universe's history, power dynamic, and sets the foundation of the Joestar legacy. The show's best feature is its strong aesthetic expression.  \r\nThe character designs and their movement are dynamic and expressive, which is necessary for an action-packed anime. My favorite part about \"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\" is the way the entire color palette changes as the mood does. The color is as dynamic as the movement, emotion, and expression. It couldswitch between the Cannon palette, its complementary colors, its negative palette, and radiant neon palettes, etc. This is a big way the show stays visually exciting.\\n\\n\r\nPart I and Part II should be treated as separate plots, and the two protagonists, although from the same kin, are well-established as different people. Although they share some qualities, such as a sense of justice and a very strong will, they have unique characteristics and methods of fighting that are different from the other. The former has a well-developed quest for vengeance, and the latter has the quest to defend his loved ones. The former has strength and discipline, and the latter is quick-witted and eclectic.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Part I and Part II protagonists embody the standard Warrior archetype. This is comparable to the trials and tribulations of a strong male hero like Odysseus. Both heroes have admirable mentors, each distinct and likable. There are also enjoyable training montages, and a noticeable development in strength. There are a handful of interesting companions, but a huge majority of supporting characters are very one-dimensional and bland.\\n\\n\r\nMy main qualm with Jojo, and shows like this in general, is that their inner struggle isn't something that is easy to empathize with. It's easy to bet on the hero, and it's a straightforward Good vs. Evil development. Although it isn't the main focus of the show, it's important to note. The plot is passable. It's poorly executed, and wantonly explained by a random narrator. The plot essentially exists as a side dish to the main course. The standard for character development set by Part I was decent, but its successor in Part II had barely (if any) character development. It leaves the viewer feeling less-invested in the protagonist's quest for victory and less afraid of the antagonists. It is easy to take the protagonist's ability and resilience for granted, because pain also doesn't have any 'true' consequences.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist having the Last Gasp Victory a ton of times before it finally happens leaves the viewer feeling mistrustful of the narrative. This complaint is also applicable to the antagonists and their upgrade from \"super\", to \"ultra super\" to \"super mega ultra deluxe\". Which is totally okay, if the viewer manages to catch the humor in that.\\n\\n\r\nThe over-the-top ridiculousness of \"Jojo's Bizzare Adventure\" was a quality I really enjoyed. The dialogue, the way characters move (walk, pose, fight), and the character design, paired with subtle and tasteful hints at its irony were really amusing and extremely well-executed. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show for people who enjoy watching action-packed scenes, enjoy visually pleasing anime, admire strong male characters, and find humor in drama/over-reacting.\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun watching this show for the first time, and I look forward to watching the other parts of \"Jojo's Bizzare Adventure\".\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not going to very in depth for this review, as I think JoJo is a pretty simple anime to describe. It's definitely a hit-or-miss for most anime viewers, and I can happily report that it was a hit with me.\r\nSTORY - 5/10\r\nMost of the show's watch-worthyness comes from the \"enjoyment section\", and has very little presence in the story. Objectively speaking, the show doesn't have a very good plot. There are two parts to Season 1 of JoJo, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. I definitely preferred Phantom Blood, but that was mainly due to the characters, which I'll get into later. \r\nOne of themain problems in both parts is the amount of exposition dumping used to provide back stories and explanations. The grandeur in which this is done helps compensate, but it can still be pretty annoying to hear characters talk on end with only semi-interesting content. And the content is just that: semi-interesting. The plot is not unique by any means, with two brothers,  one  evil, one good etc. None of that is unique in any sense, but the story manages to nevertheless keep pace and keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that I was  surprised at the beginning of Part 2, because I was generally curious as to what the series would do to continue to its story, and I think the structure of the series is really interesting in that sense. I can't really delve into detail, due to the nature of the series, but JoJo is definitely unique in the way that the parts are related and connected to each other.\\n\\n\r\nART - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nJoJo presents what is probably some of the most jarring animation to a viewer like me, used to the standard styles of all the main studios. I've watched the Ping Pong Animations, the Monogatari series etc, so I am definitely open to alternate styles in delivery, but I was still taken aback by the character designs and fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIt probably took me 2 or 3 episodes to get used to, but once I was accustomed to the character design, animated onomatopoeias and changing color scheme's, I started to really love it. David Production did a fantastic job creating it's characters, and expressing their emotions in their scenes. This walk the line of \"Art\" and \"Sound\", but I also think the openings were animated extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is obviously pretty picky, but my main problem with the character design is their legs. I'm pretty sure this was only a problem with the male characters, but each of their legs were small, and really thin. I know this is characteristic of the macho-man style, but it still bugged me a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThis definitely picked up as the series went along, but many of the initial fight scenes felt a bit choppy, when the nature of attacks could have allowed for really smooth animation. This gets even better in Stardust Crusaders and Stardust is Unbreakable, so if the series captivates you, know that the fight scenes get even better (Stardust Crusaders has one of the best fight scenes that I've seen. It's amazing).\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSONO CHI NO SADAME!!!!!!!!!!! JOOOOOOOOOOOOJOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening has made a place in the heart of any JoJo viewer, irrespective of what they thought of the show. \"JoJo (Sono Chi no Sadame)\" is honestly one of my favorite songs of all time, English and Japanese alike. It embodies the personality of this show to a tee. It's grand, exaggerated, loud, and testosterone-filled. \\n\\n\r\nThe second opening, \"Bloody Stream\" is also great, but not quite as representative of Battle Tendency. From a musical standpoint, I love it, but because it's a bit more casual, it's not quite as \"JoJo\" as Sono Chi no Sadame. It's still just as listenable, if not more so, than it's predecessor though.\\n\\n\r\nI initially didn't like the ending at all, but it grew on me over time. It was a little lazy in it's animation, but the song was still pretty nice. Definitely not as strong as the openings, but not a bad listen in itself.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo's voice cast is laden with some of the best seiyuus in the industry. David Productions did a fantastic job in the casting of Tomokazu Sugita, my personal favorite voice actor. Famous for a variety of roles,in some of the most famous anime, Sugita is outstanding at capturing the nuances and emotions in character dialogue. He doesn't disappoint in his  for Battle Tendency. He captures the character of Joseph Joestar with amazing precision, voicing everything from his seemingly arrogant nature, to his hidden soft side when sympathizing with others.\\n\\n\r\nTakehito Koyasu, known for some fantastic roles as well (see Bobobo in Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo) does an equally amazing job in voicing Dio Brando, Phantom Blood's main villain. Just the deep voice he uses is perfect for a villain who literally enjoys kicking puppies. He manages to communicate the pure evil that is Dio, in a way that is both spooking, yet comedic.\\n\\n\r\nThe main shortcoming with the sound in JoJo is the OST. While the aforementioned factors would seem to warrant a 10, the soundtrack had no memorable pieces at all. There was only one time I distinctly remember being impressed by the sound track, and that was in the killer squirrel scene. Yes, there's a killer squirrel scene. The change to dubstep was really surprising, yet oddly appropriate in the instance. Otherwise, there were no tracks other than the openings and endings that I could associate with the anime. And while the openings, endings, and voice acting was great, the OST is present throughout the anime, and was consistently underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters may merge into the enjoyment section, so I apologize if the line is a bit blurry. The character's are all so extreme, so outrageous, so... fabulous, that it's hard not to fall in love with them. The dialogue is extremely exaggerated, and reactions  are blown way out of proportion, which is why I can understand some people being turned off. Luckily, this appeals to my sense of humor, so I loved all of the characters in all of their extremity. There isn't much to say, other than they are just a  pleasure to listen to, and watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that I disliked was Speedwagon. He didn't seem to contribute anything at all to the story, and only reiterated things already said. I know that this is a part of the show's style/humor, but it was one aspect that I didn't enjoy at all. Additionally, there is absolutely no character development for any of the characters, which is something I definitely look for in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\\n\r\nObjectively, JoJo isn't that great of a show when it comes to story, or character development, but the the sheer bravado of the characters, the grandeur of the openings, and the poses make the show really fun to watch. If you don't take the plot too seriously, JoJo's Bizzare Adventure can easily become one of your favorite anime. \\n\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                         OVERALL - 7/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "JoJo's works so that each story is completed, forming a work that must be judged as a sum (although this analysis is about only the first two arcs of the anime), even though it can be (almost) assisted in parallel to each other. Something to emphasize is that each part has a different formula, as well as a different goal, executing it with mastery. Part 1, the first 9 episodes, aims to deliver the clash between Dio Brando and Jonathan Joestar. While part 2, the last 17 episodes, has a cause and effect formula, in which the story progresses with a cause (Speedwagon hijacked, forexample) and an effect (Joseph rescuing Speedwagon).\\n\r\nAs for the formula, in Part 1, \"Phantom Blood,\" is practically dedicated to building the battle between Dio and Jonathan, presenting the moment they know each other, and the culmination in their battle as adults. Generally speaking, it is a shounen de porrada, which aims to show this specific beating. And in the midst of it, we have the hamon, life energy used by the two protagonists, and Stone Mask, which turns your user into a vampire. These two powers, unlike the Stands present in parts 3 to 8, are somewhat \"limited\", which causes the protagonists and antagonists to innovate in using them. In Part 2, Battle Tendency, we have the \"cause and effect\" formula already quoted, which is used by every work, which aims to show Joseph's confrontation against the Pillar Man while disputing the Red Stone. As for the combat of both, Phantom Blood uses a combat in which things like \"brute force\" are fundamental for the triumph, whereas its successor, Battle Tendency, has a much greater valorization of the tactical combat. As for characters, we have a range that is uninteresting or interesting according to how much history needs them. From the masters of Joseph and Caesar, which are not necessary after training the two, to Stronheim and Speedwagon, who have a passive importance throughout the work, in addition to being externally charismatic. The trait is something admirable, in fact, something unique present only in JoJo's, being almost as unique and admirable as the soundtrack and the openings. And of course, like every good part of JoJo, there are always times to keep hair standing, like the death of Jonathan, (of the) Zeppeli, or even when Joseph throws the (burning) band of Caesar against Wham. And of course, although many criticize negatively, the conveniences in the work are not negative, much less positive, they just help the story to progress. Criticism, like every part of JoJo, does not escape that point. Having a \"enough\" plot, but with the depth of a child's pool (which does not make it bad), in fact, as a fan of manga from the 80's, it's an admirable plot despite being extremely run down by because of the limitation of David Production, having to adapt 113 chapters in only 26 episodes, which in my opinion, was something bad, making the work \"rush\". After this, we have as the biggest sin, and again by limitation of David Production, the animation. Despite being very animated in important scenes, there are moments that are detailed in the manga, however, are \"meh\" because of the animation. Anyway, it was a good attempt by David Productions to be the best adaptation of PB and BT to date.\\n\r\nJoJo's funciona de forma que cada hist\u00f3ria se completa, formando uma obra que deve ser julgada como soma (apesar dessa an\u00e1lise ser sobre s\u00f3 os dois primeiros arcos do anime), mesmo podendo (quase) ser assistida de forma paralela uma a outra. Algo a se destacar, \u00e9 que cada parte possui uma formula diferente, como tamb\u00e9m um objetivo diferente, executando isso com maestria. A parte 1, os primeiros 9 epis\u00f3dios, tem como objetivo entregar o embate entre Dio Brando e Jonathan Joestar. Enquanto a parte 2, os \u00faltimos 17 epis\u00f3dios, tem uma f\u00f3rmula de causa e efeito, em que a hist\u00f3ria progride com uma causa (Speedwagon sequestrado, por exemplo) e um efeito (Joseph resgatando Speedwagon).\\n\r\nQuanto a f\u00f3rmula, na parte 1, \"Phantom Blood\", \u00e9 praticamente dedicada a construir o combate entre Dio e Jonathan, apresentando o momento em que se conhecem, e a culmina\u00e7\u00e3o em sua batalha quando adultos. De uma forma geral, \u00e9 um shounen de porrada, que tem como objetivo mostrar essa porrada espec\u00edfica. E em meio a isso, temos o hamon, energia da vida utilizada pelos dois protagonistas, e a Stone Mask, que transforma seu usu\u00e1rio em um vampiro. Esses dois poderes, diferentemente dos Stands presentes na parte 3 \u00e1 8, s\u00e3o de certa forma \"limitados\", o que faz com que os protagonistas e antagonistas tenham de inovar ao utiliz\u00e1-los. Na parte 2, Battle Tendency, temos como f\u00f3rmula a \"causa e efeito\" j\u00e1 citada, que \u00e9 utilizada por todo obra, que tem como objetivo mostrar o confronto de Joseph contra os Pillar Man enquanto disputam a Red Stone. Quanto ao combate de ambas, Phantom Blood utiliza um combate em que coisas como a \"for\u00e7a bruta\" s\u00e3o fundamentais para o triunfo, enquanto sua sucessora, Battle Tendency, possui uma valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o muito maior do combate t\u00e1tico. Quanto a personagens, temos um leque que s\u00e3o desinteressantes ou interessantes de acordo com o quanto a hist\u00f3ria necessita deles. Desde os mestres de Joseph e Caesar, que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios ap\u00f3s treinarem os dois, at\u00e9 Stronheim e Speedwagon, que possuem uma import\u00e2ncia passiva ao longo da obra, al\u00e9m de serem externamente carism\u00e1ticos. O tra\u00e7o \u00e9 algo admir\u00e1vel, na verdade, algo \u00fanico presente apenas em JoJo's, sendo quase t\u00e3o \u00fanico e admir\u00e1vel quanto a trilha sonora e as aberturas. E claro, como toda boa parte de JoJo, h\u00e1 sempre momentos de manter cabelo em p\u00e9, como a morte de Jonathan, (dos) Zeppeli, ou at\u00e9 mesmo quando Joseph joga a bandana (em chamas) de Caesar contra Wham. E claro, apesar de muitos criticarem negativamente, as conveni\u00eancias na obra n\u00e3o s\u00e3o algo negativo, muito menos positivos, apenas ajudam a hist\u00f3ria a progredir. Cr\u00edticas, como toda parte de JoJo, desse ponto n\u00e3o escapa. Tendo um plot, \"suficiente\", mas com a profundidade de uma piscina de crian\u00e7a (o que n\u00e3o o faz ruim), na verdade, como um f\u00e3 de mang\u00e1s da d\u00e9cada de 80, \u00e9 um plot admir\u00e1vel, apesar de ser extremamente corrido por causa da limita\u00e7\u00e3o da David Production, tendo de adaptar 113 cap\u00edtulos em apenas 26 epis\u00f3dios, o que ao meu ver, foi sim algo ruim, tornando a obra \"rushada\". Ap\u00f3s isso, temos como maior pecado, e novamente por limita\u00e7\u00e3o da David Production, a anima\u00e7\u00e3o. Apesar de ser bem animado em cenas importantes, h\u00e1 momentos que s\u00e3o detalhad\u00edssimos no mang\u00e1, entretanto, s\u00e3o \"meh\" por causa da anima\u00e7\u00e3o. De toda forma, foi uma boa tentativa por parte da David Productions sendo a melhor adapta\u00e7\u00e3o de PB e BT at\u00e9 o momento.",

            "content": "This is an epic show that everyone should watch. Despite the rather lacking first part the amazingl second part makes up for it. The story of JoJo is one that spans many generations. This \"season\" covers the first two parts of JoJo.\r\nStory: 9\r\nOur first protagonist is Jonathan Joestar AKA JoJo. He is a true English gentleman who believes in justice. After previous events the Joestar household is getting a new inhabitant in form of DIO who's father rescued the head of the household, George Joestar. JoJo initially looks forward to getting a brother but after DIO immediately kicks JoJo's dog Danny his enthusiasm is extinguishedA few year's later events happen that shape both of their futures and those of many to come. What the writer of the manga seemingly focussed on when writing part one was the duality between DIO and JoJo. This is what drives the story forward and it is an interesting take which would be the basis for most of his storytelling to come. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the first part has a few interesting snippets but despite being so short a third of the episodes feel like filler to many and just plain boring to others. It is entirely possible to just skip the middle three episodes and hardly miss out on anything of interest. Fortunately through a rather clever way of storytelling by Araki (The writer of the manga) which is swapping protagonist every part the following part is action packed. Whilst the first part is generally seen as bad by the community it still has its moments and it is by no means bad it is simply just mediocre compared to what is to come. \\n\\n\r\nPart two of JoJo's takes place 50 years later and they follow our new main character Joseph Joestar who happens to be the grandson of Jonathan. After coming into contact with a piece of his past one of Jonathan's friends decides to confront our new JoJo. Here Joseph learns that an old friend has gone missing and he sets out to find him. Throughout his journey he comes into contact with an unlikely ally, a ceasar salad and an old lady and is forced to battle with such menacing foes as Esidisi(ACDC) and Wamuu(Wham). It truly lives up to its name. Part two is an obvious improvement over the first part storywise. There aren't any filler episodes and it all builds up to become an interesting story. The characters are great despite a few of them being so called cardboard cutouts they are interesting and they have great chemistry with each other. \\n\\n\r\nCompared to the manga there are only a few changes when it comes to the story through scenes either removed or added but they don't impact the story overall. David Productions have done a gureto when it comes to the adaptation considering the disastrous earlier adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the manga is despite being an early work quite good. David Productions did a great job in adapting the manga. Despite working with a limited budget, they pulled through in adapting the original artwork. There are several intriguing palette changes which spice up the artwork. DP also had a clever use of a singular moving image for a few second whilst the characters were speaking. Even though this might be seen as lazy they still use it effectively. These parts like most of the other part suffer from phenomena such as potato nose and others which means that the artwork can look really bad at times. There might be a few budget cuts made but the essence of the artwork still remains. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nWell, what can I say. Everything from the openings to the character voices and the soundtrack are great. Both of the openings are well made both in the visual and the audio departments. I would like to talk more about them, but it would take too long. The voice actors in JoJo are phenomenal. From part one and two the voices of DIO, Joseph and Stroheim are great. The show would not be what it is without them. They fit perfectly for their role and they are enthusiastic. According to me these were the best but the other cast members also did a great job. Finally the soundtrack especially during part two is gureto. Whilst the two most popular tracks are trap beats the remaining soundtrack does a good job of setting the mood and just all around being a good soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in JoJo are the main part. Everyone has their favourite JoJo, Jofoe and Jobro. From part one the two main characters are DIO and Jonathan. As I stated earlier their duality is the main focus of part one. DIO being an all around bad dude and Jonathan being a staple of valour and justice in the world make up most of what makes part one enjoyable. DIO has despite popular belief some motivation for his actions. Even though they might not be strong when you look more deeply they still exist. Jonathan is rather bland but his personality compliments that of DIO well. DIO is what most(including me) consider the highlight of part one due to him just being an all round fun character to watch. Most of the other characters from part one are generally just ok and not anything special. \\n\\n\r\nPart two's JoJo is massively different from the first JoJo. He still has the core values of Jonathan but he adds a twist. Joseph is what people would call a bit of an arsehole but we love him anyway. JoJo is not some goody two shoes because this time he feels more like an interesting character. His partner in crime is called Caesar and he is the grandson of Jonathan's mentor. Caesar is at first presented as the opposite of Joseph but after seeing each others worst side they let out the better parts of their personality and become friends. The antagonists of this part are mostly what could be considered well written minor antagonists since most of them aren't really fleshed out that much. Nevertheless it is fun to watch their battles with JoJo and Caesar.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 11\\n\\n\r\nWowa wee wa I really like JoJo. I can't say how much I like it but it is most certainly my favorite show of all time. It is not for everyone but I think that they should atleast watch all of the 26 first episodes before forming an opinion. I know of all to many people who have dropped midway through the first part not knowing what is to come. This is what I would call a flavorite show of mine. My experiences with JoJo have been great I want others to come into contact with this masterpiece. I started out not knowing what to expect but I was pleasantly suprised when it came to JoJo. King of all shonen anime and manga is JoJo. All words in the dictionary could not even explain how much I apprieciate this show. Let's end it here before it gets out of hand\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nJoJo is a great show and I encourage everyone to watch it. Everything from it's bizarre and interesting story to it's quirky and likable characters leaves something for everyone. \\n",

            "content": "The first installment of JoJo's Bizzare Adventure (aka JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken) contains two seasons in it, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendencies. \r\nThe former revolves around the life of Jonathan Joestar and his dealings with Dio. This season, though being a short one packed a major punch at the end of the season. The first 9 episodes could be considered as nothing more than an understanding of the characters and their strengths and weaknesses but things begin to pick up from episode 10. Despite a slow start, the series manages to give a satisfactory ending to all the viewers. The opening song in thisseries, Sodo Chi no Sadame, is quite commendable and it fits the overall theme of the anime perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationships shared between people in Phantom Blood are fairly straightforward and in this regard, it fell short of offering the suspense that Battle Tendencies could. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to Battle Tendencies, this was a whole lot better than Phantom Blood. It wasn't just all fighting here, it showed actual battle tactics and the honor one warrior had for another. Some emotional scenes touched us more deeply than others and was pivotal in changing the tone of the anime from a mere fighting anime to a fighting anime filled with strong emotions such as love, hate, etc. \\n\\n\r\nBattle Tendencies revolved around Joseph Joestar, and this part fulfilled what all PB couldn't. Had better animations (to a certain extent), better character development and a much broader storyline. BT is longer than PB hence they had enough time to elaborate on their characters. \\n\\n\r\nOne notable thing about this part was that the characters' involvement with each other was quite nice and therefore just made the anime that much more fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSumming up, if you wanna pick up the series, start watching but decide whether you wanna continue after watching at least half of BT.",

Without sucking up to the JoJo fanbase, I just found this and the other seasons to be quite an adventure. Quite a worthwhile ride at that, and by that I mean at the very least enjoyable to a higher degree than many others. It's also pretty much a show I can go back and enjoy multiples times which is an awesome praise in my eyes, as are the rest of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.\r\n When I watch JoJo I flash back to allthe Ian Flemmings 007's, especially with the openings. All that trippiness and posing I guess. I think I read that Hirohiko Araki said Ian Flemming was a direct influence. The art and the music are especially praiseworthy (exquisite even)* and the story is pretty compelling if nothing else.\\n\\n\r\n At any rate all you need to know about JoJo's Bizarre adventure overall is that there will always be a JoJo, some villainous ass to be kicked, an adventure to be had and most of it is going to be most obviously Bizarre!",

            "content": "It's hard to really find something that hasn't already been said about this show and it's remarkably hard to explain this show as a whole to someone who hasn't seen it or already doesn't have some familiarity with the memes or fanatical fanbase.\r\nIn short, JJBA is one of those shows that's just unique in everything it does. There's never been anything else truly like it, at least later. I personally JoJos doesn't come into its own until Part 3 where now it feels like yet another shonen battle show. Being an older one, it doesn't suffer a lot of modern cliches like tournament arcs ora broody protagonist. This one of the hot-blooded muscle-bound 80s punch-fests of yesteryear. What this show has more than others, however, is an unapologetic ownership of everything it wants to be and does so in a way that feels endearing.\\n\\n\r\nThis section of the show covers parts one and two of the JJBA series: Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. Each can be taken as a story in their own right but really work as a pair and serve as a foundation for a large majority of the rest of the series, where things really jump off. Despite the name, this show has an easy to comprehend if dynamic power system that allows for a lot, but doesn't really go for the \"lol random\" style of bizarre you'd see in other shows self-styled as such.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to really explain what makes this such a good show on its own. However, the writing, story flow, character development, and willingness to be as over the top as it wants without any breaks or apology to me is what does it. There's nothing I would call a genuine flaw in the show outside of this part's somewhat annoying tendency to over-explain some characters' maneuvers and plans, something that mercifully gets better after this installment. This does mean a lot of dialogue however. I highly recommend the dub to people who have trouble with subtitles with this one.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're even remotely curious, give it a whirl. Just be prepared that if you continue, we're hitting Stand territory in Part 3 onward and that's when \"Bizarre\" really starts happening.",

            "content": "Ah yes the wonderful meme-filled world of JoJo's. Phantom blood is probably the weakest of the adaptations. Jonathan doesn't do it too much for me, too stoic for me and a bit too stiff when it comes to characters. The action is pretty enjoyable despite some of the fight scenes being just who can muscle the hardest. The music is something I've come to appreciate with this part of JoJo's. The op and ed are just plain infectious and amazing in most aspects and the OST doesn't slouch either. Jojo's part 1 has crazy action, over the top poses, muscly men for days, and ofcourse best girl Speedwagon. I urge you reading this to take the dive into the wonderful and crazy world of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto part 2. This is where the show really starts going for me. Joseph is my favorite Joestar. Full stop. The western influences this part uses are nothing short of phenomenal for the time when it was written. The change of main character from Jonathan is an interesting way to keep exploring the world and crafting interesting characters. One of the biggest changes from part 1 is the way fights change. Instead of being an all out muscle show from Jonathan's time, Joseph thinks and concocts a plan for battle. His plans going so many layers deep in trying to out think the opponent. This change to how fights function creates this crazy puzzle element to each fight each one playing out differently than the last making every fight fresh. If you were hesitant from part 1 I strongly urge you to continue onto part 2 cause once you start down this path you will not want to stop.",

            "content": "Jojo's bizarre adventure is a show that probably every anime fan has heard of. It is, in my opinion, one of the most popular shows of all time. Cause even if you haven't watched it, you know the memes. Even if you haven't heard of the show completely, the \"to be continued\" meme will crawl into your life anyway. \r\nSo it wasn't surprising that I was going to watch the show eventually. And to be honest, I was a little disappointed. Here's why:\r\nMy biggest problem with the show is the pacing. Many episodes can feel so long, because of the fight scenes. The characters alwayshave to stop and explain what to do or stop to warn the enemy that they will do something. I have two problems with this. First, why would they do this? Why do they expect the enemy to also stop what they're doing, to listen to what the protagonist has \"planned all along\". It also ruins the pacing, as I said before. The episode would probably be half as long if they didn't show us a bunch of exposition at us. You can give information without text, you know that right. \"Show, don't tell\" is important, but wasn't considered here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd sadly, that was the thing that \"ruined\" the show (I still liked it). It was harder to enjoy the show when the episodes were so boring. Cause there were many things about the show that was very unique. The fight scenes didn't consist of only punches and kicks. There was an actual strategy, which is very unique in these kinds of shows. Without the exposition, the fight scenes would have been great! \\n\r\nI was also very immersed in the story and wanted to know what was going to happen. Especially in the multi-episode fights, where I needed to know who was going to win. If it I wasn't immersed enough, I wouldn't have felt the same.\\n\r\nAnd lastly, I really liked the style that the show went with. The weird colors and patterns were so unique and cool to look at. I wouldn't say that the visuals were fantastic, but were unique and interesting to look at.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo I'm sorry all of you Jojo fans. I still liked it, just not enough I guess...\\n\\n\r\nStrong 7/10",

Overall, this series is really good, with good sound desing and an artstyle that, while unappealing at first (was the thing that made me hold off for some months) you learn to enjoy it after the first ~5 episodes.",

It seems to have good continuation but certain things seem to lack logic. I AM IN NO WAY COMPLAINING about that i mean its called Jojo's BIZARRE Adventure after all but it makes me kind of obsessive\r\nArt: Let me just say I LOVE THE ART its unique it perfectly capturesthe grandeur and outrageous atmosphere of the show. the art is very solid looking but its smooth and fits the series well the way they animated the sound effects even \\n\r\nits hilarious \\n\\n\r\nSound: between the OST and the first opening and ending you can listen and hear the manliness. you have the solemn acoustic guitar music to full on final battle music the kind of loud and grand playing that just is a treat or the ears\\n\r\ni didnt want to use the word grand/grandeur again but i cant find a better word to illustrate the feeling\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Jonathan Joestar in every sense he is a gentleman who sticks to his beliefs more than any shounen protagonist ive ever seen \\n\r\nin every conflict he had he never disrespected his opponents he maintained good morals and never had to use any of the \"2edgy4me\" personality twists that i see a lot these days. but then we meet Joseph Joestar it is apparent from the start of the 2nd arc Battle Tendency that he is a far cry from our gentlemanly friend Jonathan \\n\r\nSPOILERS FOLLOW FROM THIS POINT UNTIL THE END OF THE CHARACTERS SECTION\\n\r\nin his first fight with straits this becomes obvious. I expected him to  block and question straits  the whole time nope Joseph pulls out a tommy machine gun and shoots straits and the whole cafe he was sitting in to smithereens \\n\r\ni think ill enjoy battle tendency \\n\r\nspoilers over\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10 so far its over the top way of presenting itself, the posing,the battles, the posing, the tragic moments,AND THE POSING\\n\r\ni jus cant get over it those poses i wish that was okay in real life tio pose as you speak your mind\\n\\n\r\noverall: im enjoying every bit of it so far and suspect that after watching all of battle tendency ill give it a 10/10 \\n\r\nand then ill nearly die as i wait 11 days for stardust crusaders to be released",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is an amazing show, and one I think everyone who enjoys Action-oriented animes should try out. My review won't contain spoilers, and I'll break it down by category;\r\nSTORY: 8/10\r\nWhile the synopsis that I read for this show didn't seem like it would be for me, I decided to try it on a whim because of a recommendation from a friend of mine. Trust me, the story is good. It manages to pace itself surprisingly well, and even the few episodes I would consider filler are really enjoyable and added some aspect of characterization to the show. It follows some genre tropes, andit's intentionally cheesy at times, but it always manages to make it feel authentic, which should be applauded in a medium where so many shows neglect this.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\nWhile the art style isn't the best for a 2012 anime, the use of contrasting colors results in a unique and always-interesting art style that is very appealing to the eye. Because of this method of coloring, the fight scenes always feel fresh and welcome.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music in this show is stellar. The original opening themes are catchy and fitting. The ending theme is also, as it samples different parts of the song \"Roundabout\" by Yes!. The music in the show is great as well, as it uses different genres of music to appropriate the atmosphere and the music is always very well placed. The voices in the dub aren't the best, as expected, but they're not annoying and fit the characters quite nicely. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: \\n\r\nThough, after the 9th episode, our perspective switches to another generation of Joestars, the main character(s) (which is always a JoJo lol) are always likable. There isn't a lot of character development, really the only you'll find here is in the shounen sense, in that the characters get stronger and gain new abilities (think Dragon Ball Z). Still, the characters manage to stay interesting throughout. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nThe only category I can be completely subjective on, I enjoyed this show A LOT. Its's now one of my favorites, and I can't wait to watch Stardust Crusaders and the 4th entry to the series this year.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8.5/10\\n\r\nI think most people will enjoy this anime, once it picks up, so I recommend watching the series through. You won't regret giving JoJo a chance.\\n",

            "content": "Jojo no kimyou na bouken,is definitely the kind of anime/manga that, or you love or hate it. I really love the series but I will try to make a review to explain this jojo condition\r\nJojo starts with phantom blood, the most hated and unappreciated part of jojo, but its simplicity is the key of the great narrative in JoJo universe. In most shonens animes, we already have an established universe, and we already know what will be plot and the elements of it. But Jojo starts like a soap opera, none of the characters knew the stone mask, the vampires, the Aztec race, the Stands,all these elements will be built throughout the series, in other narratives. Probably that\u2019s why most people hate jojo, they were expecting to watch the THE MOST INCREDIBLE AND MASTERPIECE AND EDGY STORY OF ALL. But then they feel tricked and dropps jojo and starts a new part, but they still don't like it, and I will tell you why (You got all the rights to still hate it after my explanation, I understanding you)\\n\\n\r\nThe most greatness of Jojo is not to innovate and create something complex, but is create something original and fun using just the most simply formulas, and how theses formulas expand themselves in another narratives composing the universe. Jojo in this firsts two parts use the cliche purposely to make dramatically scenes and give more characterization for the characters, the main example of it is Dio. But however not always it works, like the fact the zeppelis in this part is just a plot device. But still have some good point on it, and what make me forgive some narrative minor problems is the setting and the characters\u2019 charisma.\\n\\n\r\nAraki for sure know how to create characters, during all the series probably you going to love someone (or not) they all have unique personalities and design, and the only thing more fascinating than the characters is the battles. All battles in jojo have high chances of death, the characters gotta improvise with they powers and with the scenario  around them, in order to be able to defeat much more powerful enemies, since pocket of air under rocks to using the stand to transform your body in mobius strip(part 6), that\u2019s why the setting is essential to create these situations\\n\\n\r\nWith all these points mentioned, jojo's story will be getting better and more refined throughout the series, that's why jojo is an anime / manga with a peculiar and unique style of telling a story, if you watch waiting for the of less or with open mind to bizarre of this world, you will surely love it (Jojo is like a rough diamond)",

            "content": "JoJo's Bizzare Adventure is a series that I used to avoid mainly because of the fanbase... (and as irony may have it, I'm now sinking into the fandom) but I eventually gave in. I sat down and watched Phantom Blood/Battle Tendency and now that I've finished it, I figured that a review is a given.\r\nThough one thing is for certain, the word ''bizzare'' isn't just for show.\r\nThe show's overdescriptive manner and fittingly bizzare contents managed to captivate me and now I'm hooked.\r\nCONTAINS SPOILERS\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nPART 1 - Phantom Blood [EP 1 - 9]\r\nThe beginning of the story and the ground for everything else to come.\r\nIt all startswith Dio Brando's arrival as Jonathan Joestar's adopted brother to accomplish his goal of overtaking the Joestar mansion and heritage.\\n\\n\r\nThe Phantom Blood arc is split in 2 halves - the first half being Jonathan and Dio's childhood as they grow up in the same household while Jonathan has to endure Dio's constant torture and eventual mutual peace.\\n\r\nJonathan reveals his scheme to everyone and as it crumbles down, Dio kills Joseph's father and casts away his humanity to become a vampire.\\n\r\nWith JoJo going through deadly hurdles to eventually destroy Dio and the mask and bring peace back to his and everyone else's lives, eventually succeeding but forfeiting his own life in the process, leaving behind his pregnant wife as a set up for the next arc.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom Blood's pacing is extremely fast and haphazard but that's one of it's charms alongside the bizzare characters and great art direction.\\n\r\nWhile the fast pace made the arc more enjoyable in a certain aspect, it's also the reason why some other moments just fell short, it sucked the impact out of them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the overall writing had a few misses here and there, mainly in the first half, as a lot of the issues that were present could've been solved simply by logic (I know, it's not something I should look for in JoJo) and Jonathan just properly explaining what's actually happening and what Dio's true personality is to his father.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization for everyone is as simple as it gets, but that's not bad, since JoJo's greatness comes with it's simplicity. Everyone's based around a single trait. Jonathan wants to be a true gentleman, and his behaviour ove the course of the series certainly lives up to that. Meanwhile Dio's just straight up rotten to the core. He's violent, arrogant and selfish. Although that's something most likely caused by the harsh enviorment he was raised in, while JoJo was pampered and spoiled.\\n\r\nAlthough as Part 1 went on, I didn't really get attached to a single character besides Dio, Jonathan and based fangirl Speedwagon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Part 1 is a fun arc with interesting concepts and ideas that were executed properly,\\n\r\nIt's got a lot of charm thanks to it's bizzare cast of characters, the captivating art and great soundtrack but some aspects could've been executed better.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nPART 2 - Battle Tendency [EP 10-26]\\n\\n\r\nThis is the the longer part of the two. It's also a lot more consistent in structure, making it easier to follow.\\n\r\nIt takes places 2 generations later, with our main protagonist being Joseph Joestar, the grandson of the late Jonathan Joestar as he gets pulled into events caused by what happened 50 years ago. He's the only one who can defeat the Pillar Men, the ones who inadvertently started everything. JoJo, together with Speedwagon seeks out Caesar A. Zepelli to improve his Hamon, and over tough experiences together, the two form a manly bond and set out to defeat the Pillar Men. As the events unfold Joseph learns more about Hamon and gets stronger and stronger and eventually defeats the Pillar Men, though not without losses along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace in Battle Tendency isn't as fast as Phantom Blood's, giving you more time to ease in into the premise and to get attached to the characters, which is great because the characters themselves are a lot more fleshed out than Part 1's cast. Not only is the nuance of the characters a couple notches above Phantom Blood's, the combat system itself is a lot more fleshed out, with us getting an actual idea on how Hamon works within the universe alongside a more appealing use for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is more tight and suspensful, every battle feels like a struggle and there were well executed twists that I didn't expect. We get to see the gradual pace and effort put in which JoJo learns how to use Hamon instead of magically being a prodigy at it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters as a cast also have a much better dynamic than Part 1's quickly put together group of characters that have no real synergy with each other (Dio and Jonathan are an exception).\\n\r\nJoseph feels energetic and fresh, he's a joy to look at on the screen at all times and his defining trait of being a cunning trickster has a pretty wide application withing the story, unlike Jonathan's bland gentleman etiquette. Joseph also grows in the story to an extent, starting out as someone who's easier to anger but matures in some aspects over the course of the story.\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about JoJo's main companion during the story, Caesar A. Zepelli, the grandson of Part 1's Will A. Zepelli. Unlike his grandpa, Caesar has a properly presented personality and his dynamic with Joseph feels like a brotherly bond, something that Part 1 tried to achieve with Jonathan and Will to an extent as suggested by Will's words ''you're both like a son and a brother to me'', though it didn't succeed.\\n\r\nWe also spend considerably more time with Caesar than we do with Will, which makes him a lot easier to get attached to.\\n\r\nPart 2 as a whole feels like a natural successor to Part 1, with pretty much a similar overtone but much much better execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST of Part 2 is a lot better, it's used at the most appropriate times, pulling you into the scene even more. Though I certainly didn't expect dubstep, it actually fit well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Part 2 is a fantastic experience, with a fun - unique cast, great soundtrack and better writing and is a natural improvement of everything in Part 1 by a large margin.\\n\r\nWhile I've yet to see what's to come in the future Parts of JoJo's Bizzare Adventure, I can see why Part 2 receives the high praise that it does. Battle Tendency also happens to be the main reason why my final score of the show is as it is. It's simply that good.\\n",

            "content": "LA heard the memes, LA now KNOWS of these memes origins and now already from the first season alone LA knows why Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is soo beloved, yep LA is entranced into the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure franchise and is in it for the long haul. Took LA a frickin' while to get into the series proper and all the more something LA wished LA picked up sooner...\r\nWith LA's personal details about Jojo's Bizarre Adventure out of the way, let's start this review proper.\r\nSpoilers ahead...\r\nLA will be straight and say this especially when concerning the splitting of arcs of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season, theyBOTH have their benefits with the elements used (mainly characters and scale) but LA found that Phantom Blood arc was the best from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season and that was because of one character...DIO BRANDO.  LA will say it here but Dio Brando was LA's favorite villain of this entire season, due to the impact and visceral effects he had to both the plot and characters. See LA sees Dio as perfect blend of both a personal villain for Jonathan Joestar as well as major setting villain due to the stone mask and the calculated rampages he made throughout the arc, Dio as a personal villain is ingrained to his personality of being the suave yet bastardly personality, portrayed through his youth, constantly one upping Jonathan in the process and wanting more and more power due to his poor and horrible upbringing leading him to the stone mask yet under the guise being \"in the right\" and \"pure\" towards others through sheer confidence. The stone masks also might represent how two-faced Dio is as a result which was nice symbolism to Dio and his craving for power. As a settings villain,  it's the more obvious due to him effectively gaining vampirism-zombie powers and him finding ways to kill innocent people, gaining the army of the undead vampires as well as his grudge against the Joestars being ever more prevalent and him effectively wanting to be immortal and him killing the Joestars being the final link to him being invincible. Dio was and is the best villain of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season and LA wouldn't of written an entire paragraph about him if it wasn't, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season has another set of villains with one character being rather close to him, but he's small potatoes even compared to Dio, which LA will get to later...Dio did nothing wrong.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom Blood arc if anything was the setting up of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's, everything from the feud between the Joestars and Brando's, the Ripple powers and the stone mask. The Phantom Blood arc isn't just about Dio, as Jonathon Joestar has something of character development early on, him in his youth being a bratty half-pint, being born to a rich family, with Dio being in the picture made Jonathan look bad in comparison as he toe sooty rich kid without a care and once Dio gets his hand on the stone mask, Jonathan grows into a more mature and stable fighter in order to save the world, he had help of course, from Robert E.O Speedwagon and Will A Zeppeli, Speedwagon being something of a support character to Jojo whilst also giving us the necessary information during battles, he wasn't useless to say the least, the other main contributor is Zeppeli, something of a mentor to Jojo in the form of Ripple powers. The Phantom Blood arc's main draw at least for LA is Dio, but nonetheless it was a wild ride with crazy fights though it kinda fizzled out by the end of it's arc and \"lacked some impact\" towards itself as a result. Phantom Blood arc was LA's favorite arc of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season either way though.\\n\\n\r\nYour next line would be \"So how about Battle Tendency?\"\\n\\n\r\nSo Battle Tendency or the the second half of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season, well LA will get to talking about the main villain of Battle Tendency, Cars, yes Cars is larger in scale in terms of Dio, he is also VERY similar to Dio is many ways, from his impact of the Joestars to the plot at large, but in comparison to Dio, that \"personal villainy\" just isn't there, in comparison to Jonathan and Dio's which strings the feud all the way back to their youths, but in comparison to Joseph and Cars, it just came a bit too late in LA's eyes, but in terms of scale, he definitely brought it and this time it's just not Cars but two other \"Pillar Men\" by the names of AC/DC and Wham. LA actually liked Wham the most of the villains mainly of how different and righteous of a warrior his beliefs took him. Ok enough on villains, how is Battle Tendency, well for one, events from Phantom Blood arc DOES have effect on this arc and it's one of the better elements of it, a new generation of Joestars comes into play with the new villains of the Pillar Men wanting to become immortal...like Dio!. Joseph Joestar has the similar personality to Jonathan in a ways only he really doens't change much, Caesar on the other hand being the Will Zeppelli to Jonathan's Joseph, instead of being allies straight from the start Caesar and Joseph has more of clashing ideals through their personalities but soon they warm up with Caesar getting the character development while Joseph gets the plot powers honed and refined for the Pillar Men, with that comes in the new mentor Lisa Lisa and oh boy is she important to the plot (seriously).  Battle Tendency has some of the more crazier battles than Phantom Blood considering the scale and stakes at hand and with the refine of the Ripple powers after the last generation, it just makes the fights even more batshit insane and unpredictable as hell especially with how Jojo's Bizarre Adventure takes it's battles in general are like 5 steps ahead of you and amazingly animated. Battle Tendency also covers up the loose ends quite well besides those final scenes of the season which opens our way into the next season but nonetheless, LA found Battle Tendency to be nicely packed, easily digestible, just amazingly awesome in it's fights and how it strings it's plotlines even in it's most mundane. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by David Production, well what can LA say, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season was stylized in whichever way and whenever it wanted portraying the mood of it's characters through it's stylized changes and heck background coloring changes on a whim at times and that is one of the key points of keeping LA interested, not to mention the aforementioned awesomely crazy fights links into the animation which doubly made each fight adrenalined fueled and all the more showing off what David Production could do, every character is distinct even with the same name (The Joestars) and even the background effects being stylized to hell and back, seriously David Production was amazing in the animation department and didn't skimp on the blood and gore (seriously Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season shows off more cut off limbs and blood like Tite Kubo in his later Bleach chapters having a field day).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, well THEY WENT FULL HAM AND LA MEANS EVERY CHARACTER GOES FULL HAM IN THIS SERIES SOME TIME OR ANOTHER, MAJOR PROPS TO TAKEHITO KOYASU, KAZUYUKI OKITSU, TOMOKAZU SUGITA, ATSUKO TANAKA, TAKUYA SATOU, YOUJI UEDA, ATSUSHI IMARUOKA AND KAZUHITO INOUE as Dio, Jonathan Joestar, Joseph Joestar, Lisa Lisa, Caesar Zeppeli, Speedwagon, Stroheim and Cars respectively, seriously the cast was GODLY.\\n\\n\r\nWell this is only Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season  and LA hasn't gotten into the \"Stand Powers\" that Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is soo well known for and LA is more than interested in venturing further into Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season with both it's arcs vying for the best both for their strengths and weaknesses, LA nonetheless loved Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's 1st season as a whole and nice way for LA to have a taste of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and quite obviously LA wants more!. \\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is truly bizarre...WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\\n\\n\r\n\u2190To be continued indeed...",

            "content": "I finally got around to watching JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure and it was a wild ride, full of fun moments, plot convinces galore and fabulous manly fighting. Also 8-packs. Six packs are the old, outdated standards for the ideal male body now.\r\nSTORY: 7 / 10\r\nLots of tropes and relies a lot on plot convinces (like items appearing at exactly the right moment etc), but if it wasn\u2019t a really fun ride I don\u2019t know what else it is. Although it did get predictable at times, it still kept me wanting to see what happened next, keeping me cheering along for the next inevitable super extra eventthat only crazy villains and over the top humans with ridiculous amounts of strength and stamina being all heroic could do.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nReally stylized, but really nice looking! Made it really fun to watch, you know everyone (males mostly) in this series are SUPER EXTRA BUFF and could easily crush bricks with their thighs. Dang. Also those bright colours in cutaways and inner monologues looked so cool-not to mention the banger-ness of the openings! Super fun to watch as it made the manga come to life, literally making it 3d! It looked like a lot of love had been put into it!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nLit. Loved that I can finally understand the \u201cTo be continued\u201d meme I never understood before with this famous bass lines. Also really cool touch how the sound effects were added in the last theme song(s?), made me question if I had been hearing things or not haha. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7 / 10\\n\\n\r\nWe have heroic heroes and jerk bad guys who are easy to hate. Characters didn\u2019t really get developed but had the story happen around them? It was fine and enjoyable, fitting the theme, but nothing super deep felt like it was going on. Like Dio is evil for the sake of being evil by having the most perfect power-hungry upbringing with his parental angst etc etc etc.\\n\r\nThe one thing I was disappointed about was (SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 23) how Lisa Lisa, the first strong female character we see gets defeated in like\u202630 seconds and of course is up to Joseph to save the day. RIP to strong women holding their own in a fight when the male lead is present.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nHecka fun time, even if some scenes could feel stretched out a bit(like a couple of the fights) and other things feeling rushed/not super explained\u2026but a fun time if you expect super extra everything with really buff men, then you have all of that and it\u2019s a blast!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters weren\u2019t ever developed much/at all beyond their motivations(like wanting more power so now evil and wanting to dominate the world\u2026or wanting to fight for justice so now a good guy etc, super basic). It was still fun to watch them, however, due to things generally moving fast and keeping the story moving if not by character development but by plot convinces that moved things to the next event.\\n\r\nI feel like I\u2019ve said \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cenjoyable\u201d a lot already, but this what this was for me, nothing crazy deep or thought provoking (haha) but once you look past some of the cheesy (and super cheesy) elements, it\u2019s there to entertain and blow your mind with all the extra fighting styles of these extremely ripped god-like men yelling plenty of their lines.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t enjoyed an anime so much lately for just being \u201cfun\u201d, I do appreciate dramatic or highly developed stories, but sometimes you need a bright, fun time that can still surprise you sometimes, and for me JoJo was just that.\\n\r\nPrepare for handsome men screaming about justice and what fighting moves they\u2019re using in extreme detail and enjoy the explosions of colours and perfectly sculpted 8-packs.",

            "content": "Have you heard of Jojo? Of course you have if you're here, but what is Jojo?\r\n    Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a manga divided in several arcs adapted in this anime. The first 26 episodes of this anime deal with the two first parts of Jojo: Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. In the first part, we follow the adventures of Jonathan Joestar( Jojo ), son of a rich English aristocrat. One day, due to past events, Jojo's father welcome a new kid who is the same age as Jojo: Dio Brando, a kid who seems innocent at first sight but who reveals himselfto have a strong desire for power, implying to humiliate Jojo in its own house. I won't reveal more about the story but this is a story which emphasizes courage, friendship and other values but also skills as intelligence: This series is particularly famous for its uniques fights implying not only strength but also a strong mind and a sharp eye. \\n\\n\r\n   Concerning the art, the anime tends to respect the original design of the characters but has taken quite a few liberties in the first part, due to a very complex design in the manga. For the first part of Jojo, the art is just correct but isn't particularly outstanding, with sometimes a lack of fluidity.\\n\\n\r\n   The sound design is quite good, a few OST are really memorable such as the theme of Jonathan Joestar and, of course, the different openings and endings, I think you have certainly heard a Jojo fan screaming \"SONO CHI NO SADAME\", don't worry, in a few 26 episodes you will join him to sing together ;)\\n\\n\r\n   The characters are here the core of the series, strong-minded characters, charismatic adjuvants and ennemies, each one embodying a value: the first Jojo embodies perfectly the courage whereas the Jojo of the second part is a manifestation of intelligence. Their names are often a reference to the author's musical tastes. From Jojo pops out a colorful universe with a great diversity of characters and personalities.\\n\\n\r\n   Now you know what lacks in your animelist! :)",

            "content": "This anime is a gem.\r\nStory: 10/10. I've never found a more unique story in an anime. Granted, Part 1 is a sort of generic tale of \"two brothers going on different paths and fighting each other at the crossroads\", but the over-the-top dynamic of the fights, characters and situations are engaging and a joy to watch. \r\nHowever, I think it's really in Part 2 where the show hits its stride with a rather intriguing story and great, unique characters. In all honestly, if you read someone the plot summary of Part 2 they'd think you were on something, but that's the beauty of it: it'scalled JoJo's BIZARRE Adventure, right? And the show delivers fully in that respect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. The art is fantastic, and the frequent change of the color scheme/palette really brings life and vibrancy to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. Great soundtrack, especially the opening and endings. The infamous Roundabout plays just at the right time, and other great OSTs add a new dimension of life and intensity to the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Some characters are great and memorable, and others have personality but aren't used to their full potential (particularly in Part 1). Also, the characters' over-the-top nature makes them lovable and unique, but at times it can be too much if not done properly. For example, in Part 1 Jonathan goes on and on about how a certain enemy is great because they respect their opponent; this is fine, except he says the same thing for 10 minutes straight and it really adds no depth to his character. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Joseph does wacky, crazy things and handles daring situations with goofiness and a lack of tact, only to reveal he's been five steps ahead of the opponent all this time. This makes for enjoyable, intense situations while showing us the extent of Joseph's creativity and craziness. It also showcases the type of BIZARRE adventure JoJo can be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+/10. JoJo is a great pile of memes, tragedy and shounen glory. I don't think anyone can watch this show all the way through and forget about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. The only reason this show's not a 10/10 is because of Phantom Blood being comparatively weaker to Battle Tendency. If I had to give individual scores, Phantom Blood is a 7.5/10 while Battle Tendency is a 10/10. PB does a good job of setting up BT, and BT delivers fully with a great new adventure. \\n\\n\r\nYou know what, +1 for Speedwagon. 10/10",

            "content": "If you are someone who loves retro anime and manly men with ridiculous proportions posing, this is definitely something for you.\r\nBefore i start this review out i need preface it with the fact that i am a massive fan of the manga and this series in general and as a result their will be a certain amount of bias as a result however i will try to keep as objective and critical of the series as possible. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\n(Possible light spoilers!)\r\nThe story covers the first two parts of the manga Phantom blood and battle tendency starting at phantom so i will discuss that first. Phantomblood is  set in 1880s England and follows Jonathan Joestar (aka jojo) as he attempts to stop his evil adopted brother Dio from enacting is nefarious plans of complete world domination. A relatively simple premise that is luckily saved by the relationship between Jonathan and Dio; It is simply extremely enjoyable watch these two go at it throughout the story who are polar opposites to each other.\\n\r\nThe second part Battle Tendency follows Joseph Joestar, the previous protagonists grandson, in 1938 New York during the second world war and his adventures to stop the evil pillar men, ancient aztec warriors with extraordinary abilities from obtaining the red stone of aja, a stone which when used in conjunction with the stone mask will nullify the pillar mens only weakness sunlight and give them god level powers. Already it is quite clear that this is a different beast from the previous part with a much more interesting premise than the previous part. The characters in this part are superb the best example of this being the protagonist who in contrast to Jonathan is hot headed brash protagonist who is the most interesting character to watch to just see what he might do next or how he is going to get out of situations. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is great for this series and mimics the mangas art while also improving on it. Everything is very fluid and nice to look at with only a few hiccups here and there.The colours which imitate Arakis very inconsistent color palletes make this a constant visual orgy that keeps you engaged from start to finish.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track is incredibly well fitting, enjoyable to listen to even when out on the go or as casual listening and will definitely be stuck in your head weeks after watching the anime. There's not much else to say about  i can say about the OST.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers for early events!)\\n\\n\r\nIf this was a review of only part 2 this would easily be a 9 however due to part 1 being included i have to unfortunately dock points from the total score. Part 2''s characters are all great and incredibly interesting to watch how they react to events however part 1's characters are quite frankly generic and very boring to watch besides the two mentioned in the story sections(and speedwagon).My main big gripe is with part 1's villain Dio who intially is a very interesting character with goals and ambitions yet is still human however after becoming a vampire becomes this boring evil man for the sake of being evil\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall i would definitely recommend this anime because although it does have a lot of flaws is just a blast to watch\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok so here's the thing with this one. The way JoJo's works if you don't already know is that there are multiple parts and each part follows a different descendant of the original protagonist, Jonathon Joestar. This first season consists of the first two parts of JoJo's Bizzare Adventure. Now some might jump in this show from episode 1 and enjoy it immediately and love it the whole way through. I personally, could not get into the story of Part 1 and didn't know that it would eventually change into a different setting with different characters down the line. Once I found thisout I trudged through until I got to episode 10 where Part 2 starts. I enjoyed part 2 alot more but still wasn't totally feeling JoJo even after finishing this season. However, I like Part 3 and Season 2 of JoJo's a great deal and I love part 4 and season 3. So personally what I would do if you just can't get into this whole Jojo craze is try jumping into a later part because they're pretty self contained, and if you enjoy that then you could probably appreciate the earlier stuff more if you go back. I don't think this series should be looked over because although it's weird and very manly yet feminine there's nothing like it and in my opinion it just gets better as it goes on.",

It's not just action, it's not just over the top, it's not just manly, it's all of that, plus more. \r\nAll joking aside, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is an amazing show about good triumphing over evil, honor, and intelligence. A lot of the action that happens in the show is planned out, unlike a lot of other action series I have seen. Every attack is planned, every step calculated, and it's the same for both the good guysand the bad guys. \\n\\n\r\nThe two Jojos of this season, Jonathan and Joseph are both so unique and cool in their own way that it never feels like one completely overshadows the other (Though Joseph is clearly the best Joestar, let's just get real here). Dio is a fantastic antagonist and his ability to be used as a meme machine is just incomprehensible. \\n\\n\r\nI truly love the art design for this show, and the fact that they never stick to one color palette for too long makes the show pop out and look even cooler. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on, but that would go into spoiler territory, and I don't want to do that. So I'll leave it at this.\\n\\n\r\n Please, watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. It is truly one of the greatest, if not one of the most important pieces of fiction out there.",

Pretty generic monster fighting anime where the characters use the tired trope of yelling out which mystical power fighting move they're using before they use it. The characters and story are boring. They fall back on the tropes of destined hero who quickly learns to tap into a mystical power and becomes proficient at it way too quickly. Within a day of learning of its existence Jojo is already using many different Harmon techniques. And the villain has no motivation beyond \"I'm evil and I'm going to be evil to everyone.\" So of course without any sort ofreal emotion between hero and villain the story has to fall back on \"Look at this cool technique!\" It could all be replaced with Naruto jutsus and nothing would feel any different. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is a bit novel, and art is decent enough, but it's no where near enough to save this. It's not terrible, but being terrible would almost make it better, because at least it would be campy or ridiculous or something. As it stands, this doesn't stand out from the crowd in any meaningful way.",

            "content": "JoJo \"is a work born as manga by Hirohiko Araki in 1987 and 2012 has come to us a very faithful adaptation anime\r\n Needless to mention the depth of \"JoJo plot\", since it looks like a classic battle shonen; we must instead speak of opera characters, which are really worth mentioning.\r\n In the first generation there is the contrast between the two protagonists \"Jonathan joestar\" and \"Dio Brando.\" Jonathan joestar (also known as JoJo all its descendants) is the embodiment of absolute good. A man who protects the weak even at the cost of his life and trying that bit of humanity present in theheart of the wicked, representing the figure of the champion par excellence. Dio Brando, adopted by joestar family, is the total opposite of Jonathan. A selfish man who takes pleasure in ruining the lives of others (see the fury that evidence against the main protagonist), and who gets to kill his own adoptive father; It represents the figure of the Devil. The roles of the two characters are taken to the extreme in order to make it clear to the viewer in a more marked way the opposition between good and evil.\\n\r\n In the second generation (unlike before) there are a lot of characters who stand out in the characterization, but the ones that have impressed me the most were \"Joseph joestar\" and \"Wamuu\". Joseph joestar, grandson of Jonathan, is one of the best anti-heroes I've ever seen in a manga / anime. A man of unpredictable actions that sometimes depict him more as a figure \"evil\" than as a real protagonist, funny and sometimes even crazy. Wamuu is a man full of pride, honor where you can see some slight tinge of humanity. Since fighting his only reason for living, he is struck by the words of Joseph, which then leaves the train in view of their future confrontation.\\n\\n\r\n Because it is considered one of the best shonen battle of all time?\\n\r\n First, the \"best shonen battle\" expression is very generalized. We must distinguish two types of battle shonen: strategic and non-strategic. A good battle nonstrategic shonen is considered that when there are good animations, choreography and sometimes even the unpredictability in the outcome of the battle. A good battle strategy instead shonen is precisely characterized by more or less unpredictable and exciting strategies.\\n\r\n \"JoJo\" belongs to the second category, and we must say that although you already know the outcome of many battles (as said before, the story of \"JoJo\" is quite predictable), this product will keep you and will always want to know in what so the bad guys will be wiped out. \"JoJo\" was one of the first works that gave birth to the shonen battle strategy; without it, many anime / manga from the likes of \"HunterXHunter\" probably would not exist. There are many works in which the presence of \"JoJo\" is felt and some of them are not even of the battle or even of shonen.\\n\\n\r\n The famous pose of \"JoJo\" are present in \"Monogatari\", \"Gurren Lagann\" \"Medaka Box\" and many other works. The \"wryyyyy\" spoken by Steph of \"No Game No Life\" is a clear reference to the direction of JoJo vampires. The coat and black hat Mako ( \"Kill the Kill\") recall the clothing Jotaro Kujo (presented as a figure in the latest episodes of the first season and starred in \"Stardust Crusaders\").\\n\r\n Maybe there are other quotes of \"JoJo\", but these are just examples that make it clear how important it was in the history of anime and manga.",

            "content": "A wonderful piece of art! I am still surprised I held out this long to finally watch it.\r\nStory:\r\nThe one thing that kept me from watching the Anime in the past (around 1-2 years ago) was actually the very first episode. I do assume that this is the big quencher for most people. However, once you manage to get past that episode and watch further, the story is very sensitive and I, personally, have managed to build a good bond with all the characters.\r\nThe finale was... definitely special. As with a lot of other parts of this Anime, it had twists at every possible moment.\r\nThis willget a 9/10 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art-style was lovely as well. During the monologues they managed to put a strong focus on what was important. It's not really my favorite art-style, but it sure is on 2nd place! 9/10!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs for the sound - the first part of the Anime (up until... episode 9 I think) was lovely.\\n\r\nThe 2nd part however was filled with a lot of \"bass-boosted\" moments. That's why it only got a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the story part already, I personally have managed to build a good bond with all the characters, be it good or bad.\\n\r\nThey have managed to show the specific stereotypes really well.\\n\r\n9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI am a big fan of everything-with-comedy and \"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken\" managed to really put jokes where they were necessary and not overuse it at every possible moment. Even in dangerous or serious moments they managed to put in completely unexpected jokes that made me laugh a lot.\\n\r\n9/10!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMy overall score for \"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken\" is a 8/10, most of this came through the sound problems in the 2nd part of the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nNext up on my list:\\n\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders",

And this is that case. \r\nIt's really hard to review that kinda anime, that leaves so much emotions after watching, so I'll structure this in separate parts:\r\nStory.\r\nIt feels very swift, like a good adventure book. JoJo does not give you time to get bored or get used to places or characters. It delivers everything right to your face, and it is in fact pretty confident about. Right away you'll get, why this is called \"bizzare adventure\", expect any kinda plot turns, especially odd ones. \r\nCharacters.\r\nDonot hope for high character depth, for they speak actions, rather than words. But that what makes them so lovely and amusing to audience. \\n\r\nArt. \\n\r\nI guess, that's half of the reason why JoJo fandom has so many people in it. The main word here is exaggeration. Many characters look like twice as big than Arnold Schwarzenegger, weird posing, clothing makes you cringe at first and battle \"arenas\" take enormous places. Yes, it is epic. \\n\r\nTo top it all off, you have aesthethic of mysterious corners and beatiful architecture of Victorian England and loud streets and giant skyscarpers of 30's USA.\\n\r\nOverall, I think this might be one the most inspiring animes of early 2010's. It's amazingly fun to watch, and it definetily leaves a mark in your memory. \\n\r\nP.S.: Drinking game: take a shot when someone poses weirdly or looks gay for no reason.",

This is a bit different as it follows two different stories, taking the first two arcs of the manga, a shorter one followed, by a longer one.\r\nArt:   the art worked for me, not completelysure my thoughts on it's style all the time, but it was pleasant and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:   This is where I feel it was a bit hurt by, the main char you get to know, and the villains for the most part, but the side chars and supporting chars don't often really feel fleshed out, but I did enjoy the main so it wasn't too noticeable, just wish everyone else got more fleshing out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:   this is a good series, and I recommend it, the next two are in my opinion better, but this is a good starting point and sets up things that will show up later on down the road.",

            "content": "So, welcome to my review for JoJo's Bizarre Adv-\r\nYOU THOUGHT THIS ANIME REVIEW WOULD BE DONE BY iBLEWUPTHEMOON. BUT IT WILL BE DONE MY ME, DIO.\r\nLike that one anime, what was it? KILL LA KILL? (seriously I'd really go for some Kill la Killing right about now) this anime runs on PURE ENJOYMENT, especially when I, DIO am on screen whooping the ASS of some filthy member of the JOESTAR FAMILY. (or an ancient Aztec vampire)\r\nWhile the plot is a SIMPLETON plot. It being mostly driven by \"Go and try defeat ME, DIO before I make a GLORIOUS VAMPIRE EMPIRE\" in part one and \"DefeatPOWERFUL AZTEC VAMPIRE GODS (who still aren't as powerful as I, DIO, at least I think) before they destroy the world in GLORIOUS VAMPIRE FASHION\" in part 2. While the plotlines are simplistic, they are unique as in they are BOMBASTIC or as the title implies, BIZARRE, and you don't know what's going to happen next. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really fuels the ABSOLUTE ENJOYMENT of this series is how INSANE its presentation is. While it isn't the best animated series out there, it is given life through its use of color and its trademark use of RANDOM TEXT EFFECTS like its the bloody Batman TV series. It also makes great use of sound effects and music. Its simple yet expressive presentation makes scenes like ME, DIO, kicking ass even more memorable. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes this series memorable are its characters. One standout character is obviously me, DIO, stealing the show in every scene I'm in, whether it being me STEALING JOJO'S GIRL in awesome fashion, REJECTING MY HUMANITY, and roast some Zeppeli guy buy asking him how many breads he had eaten in his life. Of course there are some standout characters other than I, DIO, like... uh... I'll be back in a minute.\\n\\n\r\nHey it's me, iBlewupthemoon, I don't know how Dio managed to hack into my MAL account, but he more or less wrote a lot of this review for me, so let's talk characters. While Jonathan is very much a vanilla 80's anime hero, which may be a hit or miss for some, his gentlemanliness (is that a word?) and how he effectively makes the template for later protagonists in the series really makes him an admirable and great hero, even though he is not as unique as later protagonists. Joseph manages to contrast Jonathan very well while still giving the JoJo flavor. What he lacks in Jonathan's memorable tact and chivalry, he makes up in outlandish creativity and wackiness making him a standout character. Dio already covered, well, himself, and its hard to beat how iconic he is, but the Pillar Men steal the show almost as much. They are all unique and save for their leader, Kars, who is very much a despicable human being (if he even is one), they show a fair amount of complexity for villains. While they oppose Joseph, they have their own unique and usually admirable motives. While not as important to the plot, unique more minor characters like Speedwagon and Stroheim make this even more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a complex and deep anime, look somewhere else. The plot is simple but makes a perfect medium for some off the walls action that continues to establish JoJo as one of the most entertaining parts of Japanese culture\\n\\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to form my own Stardust Crusaders so I can KEEP DIO OFF MY MAL ACCOUNT. \\n",

            "content": "I got into Jojo through memes because of that I though Jojo would be nothing but a laughing stock. It actually felt like that for a long time. But the end of first arc actually was pretty sad. Show can make drama work when it wants. From there show become significantly better and it's greatness capped at episode 17. It gradually went down again but remained an enjoyable watch.\r\nLet's talk about some specifics. This is an action show but the best thing it gets is comedy. I don't know how intentional it is but it gets it right. That's why I still think this showis good even though I think story was trash and didn't like artstyle a lot. Action in this series is I think mediocre. There is no choreography, there is way too much talking during battles and everyone is so eager to explain their strategies to their opponents. There is some thought behind it though, narration of batshit insane fights can be a lot of fun and show doesn't rely on second winds that much. Characters are really well made. Some are redundant, some(all?) are shallow but show gets some characters right so damn well. You tend to love characters because of their quirks though, they don't feel realistic. Story was weak. First arc is comical and indefensibly random. Second arc starts out strong but falls apart rather quickly. It's never a good idea dwell on story when it comes to Jojo.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Jojo is a lot of fun, if you're into it. It's quirky which may turn some people away and that's okay. Unfortunately it doesn't get good immediately so you kinda have to stick with it if you want to find out whether you are going to like it or dislike it.",

            "content": "The first season of the Jojo's anime depicts both Phantom Blood(aka the original Jojo's) and Battle Tendency. Due to the extreme distance in both style and quality between both, I need to do two reviews to treat them fairly.\r\nPhantom Blood:\r\nStory: 7 : Alright, we start off with a fairly simple story of two youths growing in extremely different worlds: one is a rich, pampered and weak, but kind and chivalrous daddy's boy, Johathan Joestar(aka JoJo), and the other is an utterly psychotic scumbag from the depths of London who was raised by an alcoholic father who overworked his mother to death, then demanded booze fromhis son after his wife wasn't there to get it anymore, Dio Brando. Dio also looks like he inherits from his mother far more than his father. (spoilers from here on out till the end of this paragraph)\\n\r\nThen the poor kid gets adopted by the rich kid's dad, where he proceeds to push the rich kid to suicide to get the luxurious heritage for himself. Then the weak daddy's boy grows to 195cm and 100 kgs. Then he beats the shit out of Dio. Then Dio keeps trying to get the heritage and Jonathan keeps beating his shit. Then Dio gets beaten so bad he dies. Then he gets transformed into a vampire. Then an old Italian comes in to teach Jojo a magical ripple power to fight Dio. Then Dio summons legendary Medieval Knights and essentially summons Castlevania in Britain. Then Dio dies. But not really. Then he finds Jojo again. And the story ends.\\n\\n\r\nSo in case you didn't know, this is bizarre. Very bizarre. It starts off as a battle between two teenagers, one extremely righteous and the other extremely sick in the head, and it devolves, evolves, explodes, I don't know at this point, into something so wierd and outlandish that there are no words.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing becomes a vampire/horror movie made in manga after it started as a simple battle of Good vs Evil. It's Bizarre as Bizarre gets.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4 : Ok let this be said...I don't like it. I can't quite argue the whys or hows. I just think it generally looks poor. It's not \"awful\" but it's just a thing about Jojo art, about any of its art, manga or anime, that never quite clicked for me.  Sure it's Bizarre yet again, but all I feel about itself past the Bizarre style is that it's trying so hard to look Manly that even the girls look ugly, for one, and for two, the entire style just feels too tryhard. I don't feel like I'm looking at characters so much as MANLIEST MAN OF MANLIEST IN MANLAND at every face. It's just...not working for me. At all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 : My GOD, this quality voice acting. Voice actors seem to have just the most amazing amount of fun and go all out in the entire anime. A ton of the openings are wonderful in Jojo and the two openings of season 1 are easily some of the best songs I've heard in a long time, especially if you understand the lyrics. While visually I can't appreciate this at all, sound-wise it's some of the best I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3 : Here's the real reason I divided Phantom Blood from Battle Tendency. You see, Phantom Blood's characters utterly suck.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes a good character can be anything depending on the type of story you want. But the thing with Phantom Blood is that the story it wants is an extremely clear-cut battle of Good VS Evil. Jonathan is a chivalrous, kind, courageous, strong, noble, caring, perfect Knight. Dio is vile, cruel, traitorous, selfish, filled with sin. And that's it. There is absolutely zero subtlety or complexity in the PB characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a grossly simplistic and straightforward battle of archetypes. The Ultimate Knight VS The Ultimate Demon. This simplicity in the characters and their roles makes a lot of room for a complex and fast-moving plot, but while the plot and the general story benefit from it, the characters are woefully, abysmally boring. The one defining character maker is choice. Your characters are faced with choices and must choose what they prefer. Well in PB, Jonathan will always choose the Chivalrous thing to do. Dio will always choose the Evil thing to do.  It's so boorishly simple that I find Baron Zeppeli(the italian guy) to be a vastly more interesting character, despite the fact that in most mangas, he'd be a third-rate jobber.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the painful lack of interesting personalities, Phantom Blood distastefully takes itself wayyyyy too seriously. Jojos is a series that I like a lot, but I like it sarcastically. I think everyone does to a point, you can love Jojos, but you just have to raise an eyebrow to some of the more insanely bizarre parts and ideas of it. It's all part of the fun of course, I don't mean to say that I mock Jojo, but I find it to be enjoyable only as a piece of entertainment, as a fun anime. I can't ever take something so strange and archetypal seriously, especially with this art style and the more insane plots and characters of later arcs. And it's exactly what Phantom Blood does: it gives you the Great Hero, the Great Devil, and then they fight in battles that are super epic and extremely serious.\\n\\n\r\nExcept you care about neither Hero nor Devil. They just exist to be The Hero and The Villain, and past their roles in the manga, they never have a moment where they feel liike they exist. They never experience or show anything past their Life of a Hero/Devil. And when you care about nobody and everyone wants to be taken seriously, it just sucks horribly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyent: 2 : I am very serious when I say that Phantom Blood bored me. I like having seen it for the sake of continuity with later Jojos, but by itself, I can only define it as the beginning of something great that started off very poorly. Jonathan and Dio are extremely simple, the art style of super manly 17 year olds is ridiculous, and when you make a 18 year old battle a medieval knight next to an Italian magic user who trained in Tibet and who always wears a top hat and circus magician clothes even in his battles, I just have to call bullshit. And Jojos is filled with this bullshit in all its instances, except Phantom Blood has the extreme distaste of taking itself SERIOUSLY. And I mean utterly seriously. I don't think a joke is cracked in all its 9 episodes. Nothing is funny, nothing is lighthearted, nothing is fun at all.\\n\\n\r\nI'm shown a guy in circus clothes fighting a 250kg zombie medieval knight so the 18 year old hero that looks like he's had 3 jaw implants can chase down a vampire and end him by patting him with ripples of light born from his breathing, and I'm supposed to take it seriously?\\n\r\nGive me a break...\\n\\n\r\nBattle Tendency:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 : The Bizarre goes full overdrive here, and the story style shifts from a vampire/horror movie to an Indiana Jones ripoff, and my god is it better in every possible way. Jonathan is gone and he's replaced by a new Jojo called Joseph Joestar, and the story makes you travel around, befriend wierd nazis, fight millenial superhumans, go through epically bizarre anime trainings, you have fun at every new location and place, everything is just as crazy as before, more even. It's a complete renewal in story style, in time period, in goal, in result, everything is so refreshing, it might as well come from another series compared to Phantom Blood, only the art style really connects them, along with the main plot thread.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 : I still don't like it, but we've gone from ridiculously manly with every character looking like some kind of embodiment of virility, to the same thing, but that takes itself far less seriously. And suddenly it all works a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10 : The VA was good? It's better. The music was good? It's better. Everything in here is better than it was. Jonathan and Dio were good? Joseph is better. I honestly can't even dislike anything about what I hear in Battle Tendency. It's as good as it gets for a long-running anime. The only better soundtrack, VA and general hearing quality I can think of is Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 : Aaaaah, the best REAL jump from Phantom Blood. We leave boring and serious Holy Knight of Good Jonathan, and we go straight to funny, witty and incredibly entertaining Indiana Jones wannabe Joseph. The progress is immense already, but then there's the side characters, who also get a pretty big boost from ol' Baron Zeppeli and Jonathan's dad. Caesar Zeppeli, Lisa Lisa, Stroheim, every guy on the sidelines is as good as it gets, bizarre as you can hope it and entertaining every time.\\n\\n\r\nYet, the side characters progress pales immensely compared to the growth of the best part of Battle Tendency to me: the VILLAINS.\\n\\n\r\nJoseph is a huge improvement in every possible way, but to me Esidisi, Wamuu and Kars are some of the best entertainment anime villains I've ever seen. Wamuu easily earns a place on the podium of best opponents in all manga history. He's noble, respectable, admirable, manly like no other, creative and powerful, and in every way yet has the flaws any honourable warrior would have and he is absolutely adorable both as a hurdle to overcome and as an opponent to admire.\\n\r\nKars is not as grand a villain but he is still pretty brilliant in many ways and he managed to build an amazing balance for Battle Tendency, in the sense that you never see both an opponent and a villain being fought. Opponents aren't evil or mischevous, they're just people you have to fight. Villains are vile, and that's the beauty of these two: Wamuu is an amazing opponent and Kars a very good villain. \\n\\n\r\nJoseph, Wamuu and Kars alone push the value of Battle Tendency above pretty much anything, perhaps even the famous next Jojo Arc, Stardust Crusaders. They transform a generally boring, grey, haughty and simplistic battle of good versus evil in Phantom Blood into something immensely more stylish, bizarre, fun and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9: I honestly would have a hard time seeing Battle Tendency again. Simply because half the magic of Jojo's is discovering the new crazy ideas, and without that, I fear that I might get bored quickly. I'm not as big a fan as others might be when it comes to Jojos. But whenever I remember how quickly I gulped episode after episode, smiled and laughed and applauded at every new crazy idea, every new quip, every new Jojo thing, I can't give it anything under a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 : Phantom Blood should be seen in my opinion, even if I'd give it a 4 by itself(9 for Battle Tendency). It should be seen because Jojo is such a grand achievement of manga and anime that it deserves to be seen as a whole. But I wouldn't make my opinion of Jojo after seeing Phantom Blood. The seriousness of it contrasts so hard with the rest of the series that it's essentially another beast.\\n\r\nHowever, Battle Tendency NEEDS to be seen. I originally tried Jojo as a manga and started from the beginning, and quickly left out of sheer boredom. I tried again years after due to all my friends praising it, and started with the best part by reputation, which was Stardust Crusaders. After enjoying Stardust immensely, I tried it all from the start again, and Battle Tendency now seriously disputes Stardust's first place seat. If Stardust is more creative, long, and interesting, Joseph, Kars and Wamuu are also serious arguments that make this just as good, and perhaps better.",
