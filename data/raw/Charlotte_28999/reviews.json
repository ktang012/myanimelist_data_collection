            "content": "Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\n--------------------\r\nTell me if this description sounds familiar: \u201cA group of \u2018special\u2019 highschoolers defined almost exclusively by archetypes and/or tragic pasts form an organization together. They don\u2019t really get along at first, but they get to know each other extremely intimately over time, eventually culminating in a romance. Many tragic events take place as the innocent and sympathizable highschoolers are victimized by the cruel, cruel world. Eventually, they must accept sacrifice to fulfill their lives and destinies.\u201d Some of you are probably thinking \u201cThat\u2019s Angel Beats!\u201d, while the rest of you are probably thinking \u201cThat\u2019s Charlotte!\u201d Well, good news: You\u2019reboth right, because for all intents and purposes, they are exactly the same show. \\n\\n\r\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not going to criticize this anime on the sole basis that it isn\u2019t even pretending to differentiate itself from another show; I\u2019m going to criticize this show because not only does it contain all the same errors that the show it plagiarized (yes, I know they had the same writer, so it\u2019s not technically stealing) also contained, but it managed to magnify those errors significantly. Horrible plotholes, absurd amounts of over-convenience, awful world-building, identity confused characters, my god; Charlotte is nothing but a fucking mess.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with what is, in my opinion, the biggest problem the show has, the characters. They are completely shallow, completely one-dimensional, and more often than not, completely devoid of personality. Let\u2019s take our protagonist, Yuu, for example: The first episode introduces him as a character brimming with personality. He\u2019s intelligent, arrogant, devilish, etc. These are traits that at the very least gave him a personality and the potential for development. However, as soon as the ED played at the end of episode one, everything about him that was established in that first episode is COMPLETELY forgotten. Never again does he exhibit any of traits that supposedly define him. He instantaneously turns into literally Otanashi; A boring bland, personality-less nobody which is pretty much the worst thing a character can be. Did they really think that we wouldn\u2019t notice if they stopped giving him individuality after a single episode? It\u2019s either a laughable oversight or an attempt to trick the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t much to say about the rest of the cast; they are either completely indistinguishable or defined entirely by traits/quirks. There is one in particular I will go over though just so I can talk about how terrible the romance in this anime is: Nao. Nao is Yuu\u2019s love interest which is a big problem for one simple reason: They fail to demonstrate so much as a single iota of chemistry or personal connection with each other at all. Rather than gradually growing together, we are instantaneously told that they are in love! No no no writers: that\u2019s cheating. You can\u2019t just skip all the necessary steps of a good romance and expect us to buy it. Seriously, what intimate moments did they ever share together? I can even recall a scene where Yuu watched Nao get brutally beaten by a mob with complete indifference, as he did nothing to even attempt to assist her. What a pair. This romance is so laughable that when a love confession is finally made, the other character remarks in a surprised/confused fashion \u201cI don\u2019t think there was ever a time for you to think favorably of me.\u201d I mean\u2026 That pretty much hits the nail on the head. I don\u2019t think there was either.\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t even gotten to how shitty the plot of this show is and the reasons why it didn\u2019t even remotely work. First of all, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Being a show about superpowers, it\u2019s obvious that plotholes are going to emerge from characters not using certain powers at certain times or in certain ways, but to THIS extent? You will pull your hair out trying to count how many times a situation that could have been easily resolved through superpowers is treated as a legitimate conflict. Every cardinal sin of story telling is present in Charlotte: Dues ex machine, plotholes, asspulls, you name it. It\u2019s some of the worst melodrama to ever be animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe second big issue with the plot is the remarkably inconsistent tone and its total inability to incorporate elements of both comedy and tragedy without being clumsy and awkward. This is a problem that is seriously pervasive in anime as a whole; if you want your dramatic scene to be taken seriously, DON\u2019T IMMEDIATELY PRECEED IT WITH CHILDISH COMEDY! Every time something that is supposed to be taken seriously happens, you better believe a heaping dosage of comic relief is right around the corner. Even scenes involving death can\u2019t keep comedy out of the picture. This form of writing demonstrates an inherent immaturity and lack of understanding of said medium; it\u2019s completely embarrassing and there is no excuse for it. This disturbing pattern NEEDS to disappear from anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I feel the need to especially stress is the god-awful pacing and stupendously rushed nature of Charlotte. If you want an example of how to rush your show so badly that even the most na\u00efve audience members become alienated, watch episode 13 of Charlotte. Seriously; the world needs to see that miserable atrocity and learn from it so that history does not repeat itself. When you could literally turn the events of single episode into a series of its own, maybe spread your material out a little better? I\u2019ve somehow gone multiple paragraphs without mentioning Angel Beats yet again, but this anime has the exact same issue with pacing; it\u2019s very evident that these two shows had the same writer.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Charlotte is one of the worst anime dramas you will ever see. Even Angel Beats with all its flaws is noticeably superior. This rushed, childish, shallow emotion porn cannot be believed by a thinking person; you will literally be taken aback by how many obvious mistakes have been made. The animation and music may be nice, but I do not recommend this anime to anybody unless you want to see how NOT to write a good anime drama.",

            "content": "Charlotte can be described like a Golden Corral buffet table: you come in the hungry and with high expectation, and its packed to the brim with all sorts of things you love and recognize, such as selfish Lelouch esque protagonist, the reality of Chuunibyou, the (attempted) feels and moe of Clannad, the humor of Angel Beats!, a Kokoro Connecty set-up, siscom, time-travel, tsundere, yandere, super powers, Slice of Life, light-gore, pop idol songs, love confessions, etc. You read right; this show has yandere characters. This show is packed to the brim with cool motifs, but you're only able to leave with a sick feeling ofregret post-binge. As you\u2019ve probably heard countless times, Charlotte has a wicked concept, stellar OP, and is headed by the people who brought you Angel Beats! and Clannad. If you were like me and didnt know that before picking up Charlotte but instead only thought 'Hey that sysnopsis seems super cool, lets do this', well needless to say you will know by the end where Charlotte is coming from and whats its going for.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I didn't go into Charlotte knowing its creators, but I have seen and tend to like both Angel Beats! and Clannad. That being said, there were a number of times in which I felt treated to with a few nods to those shows. But then those 'slight nods' began to become outright recycling of Key's old content. Especially I'm talking about the baseball episode. What is their obsession of everything being settled by baseball in anime? Sure, it was cool and fresh in Angel Beats! and Clannad, but this is the third series of theirs (and like the fifth series total) I've seen in which the main characters have to join a baseball league in order to settle some sort of dispute. Would it really be that hard for them to play one of the hundreds of other sports related games so we would at least be treated to new content? And then there is the whole camping episode, which is again something reused from Angel Beats with the fishing scene. Or the dongos Yu eats. And the pop idol set up and music inclusion. Plus the whole getting locked in a bunker deal. Kidnappings. Etc. The argument here isn't that the entirety of Charlotte is just re-purposed Angel Beats!/Clannad material, but there's so much of Charlotte that doesn't come across as original that it starts to lose its own identity as a show.\\n\\n\r\nBut when Charlotte is establishing itself, it does so through sucker punches to your chest that knock the entire show off its feet. Episodes 1-6 are standard anime fare almost to the point of being episodic, very little happening that strengthens the characters relationships to each other but instead showcasing what the set-up is 'going to be', to the point that there were a couple times I sat there wondering exactly what the point of the show was if nothing was really progressing. That was until a certain twist delivered at the end of the sixth episode that changes the entire set-up, and making it at least moderately understandable what was being built into with the first half of the show. The issue with this though is that it's a double edged sword; as major of a shift as it is, it doesn't necessarily defend the wasted potential of the whole first half. Because, instead of capitalizing on said shift and making it important, Charlotte decides to resolve said conflict within a single episode just about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's a major problem I have with this show; nearly every single conflict or problem that is brought up is resolved within the confines of the episode it is presented. Take the episodic nature of the first half: Yu gets up, has breakfast with his sister for bonding purposes, goes to school, stares at Nao, 'Such a turn off!', gets lunch with his boyfriend, gets called to the student council, they go off on a mission, does something Angel Beast! esque, they complete \u2018ability of the week\u2019 quest, Yu goes home, has more sister bonding time, role credits. Never is a conflict presented here that roles over into another episodes, besides maybe Nao\u2019s older brother, and even an instance in which Nao is group tortured is never really explained or fleshed out, and merely serves to further bond Yuu and Nao, albeit poorly done. Even the major shift of episode 7 is resolved by its completion, with very few repercussions following, which was HUGE wasted potential, but more on that later. Then, the next beat down is delivered within episode nine, in which a SECOND major shift is made, though this one not an emotional but a physical change to the status of the world of Charlotte. Unfortunately, even this is resolved by episode 10, the ending of which left me literally wondering \"Okay now what?\" since there wasn't anything set up for them to worry about. Episode 11 brings around an entirely new foe right at the end of the series that literally has no name and is finished off by the episode\u2019s end, while episode 12 takes place entirely in one single setting. None of this is truly spoilery information, as none of these situations are foreshadowed very well, if at all in the beginning segments of Charlotte. Instead, it comes across as if the creators simply made up whatever came to mind episode to episode to episode, choosing to throw in a little gore here and a little romance there whenever it felt like, and none of its singular pieces coming together to create a well unified whole.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh, speaking of holes; this show contains more plot holes than swiss cheese, and less originality than my jokes. Mid-season time travel is thrown in, of all things! But make no mistake; this is no Steins; Gate. So massive is this plot bumbling that an entire thread in the forum is dedicated to pointing such instances out. Even in casual watching, without committing to being overly critical, it was hard to stomach some instances in which the characters would present very thin reasoning as undeniable fact. Take, for instance, the episode in which they enlist a character named Yusarin. The reason this pop icon is being forced into hiding is because she someone got a hold of an executives phone and read some confidential texts on it. This is all that is said on the subject, and is largely accepted by the other characters in the show. Now: why on this heavenly earth did she pick up this guys phone, unlock it, read his messages, and then take his phone with herself (as she is still in possession of it until the episodes end)? How is that a normal thing to happen? But this level of Suspension of Disbelief is only a mere shadow as to what is expected. Without spoiling anything, I can still make the point that Yu having memories from a past, now no-existent self, goes both totally unexplained and is downright preposterous, besides just being impossible. Yet another instance that goes 100% unexplained, but instead is just waived as a \u2018Mysterious coincidence\u2019. I\u2019m not going to spend the rest of this review listing every such unbelievable instance in Charlotte, but trust me when I say they exist in such blatant amounts that it\u2019s hard to miss. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, on a whole, so much of Charlotte goes unexplained that you just sort of have to fill in all the holes yourself, or watch purely for entertainment purposes, without connection to the charecters. You may think to yourself that situations presented early on will be addressed by the finale, but instead, most of what happens within each episode fails to get mentioned later, and the ending is, while mildly interesting, a full deus ex cop-out write in for the entire arc of the conflict. It literally poses the most bombastic solution possible to the overall issue to the show, and condenses a sequence of events that could have been an entire anime unto itself into a single episode. Actually, that may have been a more interesting story...\\n\\n\r\nAnd all this wouldn\u2019t be a problem if there was at least some sort of overall message to it all, some well-timed character development, or valiant theme, but instead, the entire series is just a rushed stream of consciousness by the creators, with a smorgasbord of characters who either serve only as comic-relief or canon-fodder, and no emotional depth outside of a few shocks here or there. When supposedly major characters are only introduced at the final quarter of the series, there really is no hope at delivering a cohesive whole.\\n\\n\r\n*MAJOR SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nThe largest issue of the series comes from how they treat Ayumi\u2019s death. Not the fact that she did die, but no, the fact that she was allowed to come BACK. Her death was, if anything, at least added much needed interest to the series, and I was ready for the next six or seven episodes to be Yuu\u2019s struggle to come back from that grief, with the help of his friends and maybe other ability users, and a cleaner handle on character development. Instead, within three episodes, she\u2019s just resurrected from the dead, and its all good. How is that even allowed? Where is the emotional depth of her sacrifice now? Because when someone dies in real life, they\u2019re dead. The end. You don\u2019t get a go-back and redo everything just because your mystery brother could go back in time. I wanted it to be a choice for him, either to save her, or not to, and leave reality like it was. Instead, the anime expects you to just accept that even death isn\u2019t deep enough for this anime to overcome. Is there no respect to the dead? They could have at least made the second half like his failed attempts at trying to save her, eventually going blind from futility, and Nao being the one to bring him back to earth yet again, fully realizing their relationship. Instead, they squandered the entire second half for some terrorism plot and a confession less sturdy and emotionally moving than a pan of strawberry jello.\\n\\n\r\n*END OF MAJOR SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nMy ending point is the fact that Charlotte is an anime of massive wasted potential. Though I do like Key works, romances, and all the things put into Charlotte (the fact they went with such a selfish protagonist was a strong introduction say the least), they just come out in a garbled mess that looks pretty but tastes confusing and awful.",

            "content": "Oh Charlotte, where did we go so wrong? You looked like you\u2019d be an interesting story revolving around students coping with super powers but instead you offered up a story with about as much direction as a goldfish with Alzheimer\u2019s. The anime packed a tonne of ideas and characters into too small a space and it started to burst at the seams. Charlotte, from the mind of writer Jun Maeda and put to screen by P.A. Works, promised a lot. Script writer Maeda looked to address the pacing problems prevalent in his earlier work Angel Beats and deliver a similar emotional \u2018punch\u2019 at the sametime. By some phenomenal fluke he actually managed to make a bigger meal of it in both areas. I\u2019m not even mad. I\u2019m impressed.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s such a huge disappointment that not enough time is dedicated towards any of Charlotte\u2019s characters to help hammer home its more emotional set pieces. Time that could have been spent towards developing the cast is instead wasted on repetitive unfunny gags, irrelevant side stories and ridiculous new elements thrown into the narrative like it was some afterthought. Charlotte sets off in first gear as it lays the groundwork for its story but then it tries to change into fourth gear by ballooning out its cast size with people I don\u2019t even know or care about. It\u2019s an uncomfortable ride. At a certain point the show tries to accelerate ahead with exciting new ideas but instead it stalls, bogged down by pacing which can be called nothing short of atrocious. Charlotte dawdled around and then flashed ahead so quickly I get whiplash thinking about it. With paper-thin characters and an utter mess of a script Charlotte\u2019s journey is unfulfilling, with a destination to match.\\n\\n\r\nYu Otosaka is our main man. We follow him as he starts to abuse his power to briefly take over others\u2019 bodies, both for his own pleasure and his own gain. A boy who acts cocky and lacking in morals, he starts out as a nice change of pace from your standard high-school male lead. His personality came into conflict with a lot of people around him and for a brief period it led to some amusing results. However, Yu\u2019s rebellious nature was at first refreshing but then it became non-existent. It was like a cheap drawcard to the show to have this cocksure lead, only to have him start to behave like \u2018generic high-school lead guy\u2019 within a short space of time. When this darker side of him emerges again later on in the series it actually feels out of character. The story does at least go out of the way to create ambitions and meaningful motivation for him but very little about Yu himself will stick for long in my mind. Nao Tomori is our other major player. A girl with a sharp tongue and unafraid to call things as she sees them, Nao is also an interesting character in the show\u2019s early stages. She catches out Yu abusing his power and shows him a side of the world he didn\u2019t know about. But like Yu she doesn\u2019t go anywhere as our story plays out. Her \u2018cold and disinterested\u2019 shtick gets boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic between the two lead characters is almost non-existent yet the show tries its hardest to use their relationship as a means to drive many parts of the story. Because of that, many of the scenes I watch containing the pair of them feel static. One episode which tries to show a new side of both Yu and Nao actually turned out to have virtually no bearing on the rest of the show. Still, they at least have their role to play in the overarching story and that\u2019s more than what can be said for their classmates Yusa and Joujirou. Yusa is a blonde-haired idol, an occupation that has zero importance to the story other than trying to justify having a cute girl as part of the show. Her power in the show actually had the most potential in terms of leaving an emotional impact on the viewer. But why do that when she can act cutesy and sing songs? In a series where so many characters are trying their hardest to claim the gold medal for wasted potential she might just come out on top. Joujirou spends most of his time on screen being obnoxious and completely useless in the grand scheme of the story. His purpose in Charlotte appears to worshipping the ground Yusa stands on before drowning everyone in the vicinity in his blood that explodes from his nostrils. His moments of \u2018comic relief\u2019 \u2013 please note the inverted commas \u2013 also come at horribly timed moments. These two cast members are just the tip of the iceberg. Not a single supporting character in this show feels valuable.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn\u2019t explore Yu or those closest to him well enough at all. \\n\r\nThere are moments you can almost feel the show begging you \u201cThis is the part where you cry now\u201d and I\u2019m sitting there throwing my hands in the air screaming \u201cWhy should I? I hardly know them\u201d. Heck, there\u2019s even times where it begs you to empathise with someone whose minutes of screen time you could count on one hand. Emotional moments have impact if characters have depth, and depth is something I can find more of in a petri dish than the cast of Charlotte. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when I was being assured by other viewers during the early episodes that there was nothing wrong with the slow pace because Maeda was clearly \u2018saving up for something\u2019 and taking his time to develop the cast. Once our lead quartet was introduced, not only were the initial episodes repetitive in their structure but they weren\u2019t even entertaining. A lot of them revolve around the exploration of these super powers, such as their limits and the way others use them. That\u2019s absolutely fair as a form of short exposition but I was at my wits end by the time this phase of the show finally drew to a close. You ended up viewing episodes whose entire purpose it was to later on have some cheap moment of meaning at the series\u2019 end, not actually help maintain your interest in the story at its current point. Then, at a point later on, it just explodes with more characters who steal more screen time from our original bunch. It\u2019s a mess.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done Charlotte is hampered in many areas. The start is repetitive, the middle feels redundant and the ending is packed with conveniences. Maeda is definitely a man of ambition and cool ideas but I\u2019d really like to see him make something minus the comic relief, better build up and a story that involves more of its cast. The story of Charlotte itself is interesting on paper but the way is what put to screen is incredibly underwhelming. \\n",

            "content": "I was (mildly) hyped for this show.\r\nI kept watching it thinking the next episode was going to be really good, and I almost got it with the last a couple minutes of a certain episode making me really hyped for the next one.\r\nAnd here we are, all wrapped up, and with my score, you can probably tell what I thought of it.\r\nThe story for Charlotte is dreadful, being plagued by inconsistencies, with minimal character development, and most of the development is reverted anyway so who cares at this point. Nothing even happens in term of story progression or character development for the first, I don'teven know, 8(?) episodes. If there's any indication as to how poorly thought out the story was, the show's namesake was literally only mentioned in a brief 1 minute scene more than halfway through the show and then almost never talked about again for the entire show. The pacing of the show is awful too, this show could've easily been 6 episodes if they trimmed all the garbage filler, and they could've told a much better story in the same amount of time if they redistributed the events to make the mood shift of the show around the 4th episode, with the last episode of the show being spread throughout the last 3 or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's one redeeming factor is that it looks okay. The music is really generic japanese stuff. Neither are the spectacular, and are about what you've come to expect from a slice of life. I thought the Engrish was amusing at the beginning, but it became increasingly more annoying to listen to as the show progressed and probably ruined any chance of me being amused by VAs attempting to speak English in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, as a result of having no development, are entirely one-dimensional and predictable, especially the side characters who are introduced for 5 minutes and convey their intent about as well as an LA Noire character, so by about the halfway point, you could pretty much guess verbatim what's going to happen. However, despite being completely predictable, they are incredibly inconsistent, and this is where my point earlier about reverted character development comes into play. Although, you can predict exactly what happens, characters will, very often, do the most random things, then quickly revert back to how they were before and do exactly what you predicted what happen with no consequences at all, so it just leads to pointless filler.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I'm not even sure if I want a second season so that they might learn where they messed up and try to make it good because this show had a lot of potential.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this show was disgusting and insulting. They added in forced feels at the most random times, for characters that were quite literally introduced in the same episode so you feel no attachment to them, in addition to random moe garbage and humor, and some stuff that I think was supposed to be deep and philosophical but really made no sense, and they just expected the viewers of this show to be stupid enough and lap it all up. Charlotte is a show that's clearly made by the books to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and could even pass as an insulting satire mocking the anime industry and its viewers.",

Now im ready!\r\nWhen i heard about key making a new anime i was excited up to the roof,  when the show charlotte started i grabbed my laptop lock myself in my room and wait for the tears to come but... that didnt happened.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nWell i thought the concept of the story was perfect, the ideas of diseases of superpowers that they only last during adolescence it blow my mind. But the idea that the serie it was onlygoing to last 13 episodes long i knew it was going to rush the things at the end. Well my friends without spoiling you the last episode was a huge rush for me. The last 5 minutes were beutiful, but i thought it can have another chapter or even better other 11 episodes. The lack of tears in my face made me feel insatisfactory, i dont know if the way i watched the anime 1 episode per week affected my attachement to the anime's emotions. I think that if you want to get a better experience of the serie you have to watch it all in a day, maybe two.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art was sublime... There were mounts and mounts of backgrounds; gorgeous backgrounds, cities, cliffs, deserts, etc. The art disdnt dissapoint me at all, I really thought it was good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nIm just saying half of the music is going straight to my ipod.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe main character changed throgh the serie such as the secondary characters, something that i thought \"wow not in every anime happends this\" The begging of the anime shows us a maniac of power protagonist and at the end shows us a kind and heroic character. The secondaries for me were the best *cof* *cof* yusarin my wifu *cof* *cof*. And i dont wanna get started with Tomori!!! She is perfect from the mature and motionless way she acted to the kind and patient she was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI looked every single episode on the day it came out, and at the end of it i wanted to skip time to next saturday. My 2015 favorite!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nSince i thought it was a little rushed the last episode i didnt feel putting a 10 to the anime but i think if they split the last episode into 2 and i dont know maybe posting them all at once (just kidding) it would be a 10 for me. I highly recommend this anime been watch all in a day so you dont get the feeling of insatisfaction like i do. \\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoy this review... it was made with all the love of my kokoro",

            "content": "I started watching charlotte after I saw one of the scene in the meme. The sheer number of negative remarks lead me to write this review and also because how much I liked it. Now It got me hooked right from the start, that ability with the person with that attitude. I think most people, if not everyone, would use the ability protagonist has any differently than he did, which made him relatable. \r\nThis is the first anime in a long time that I have watched where I didn't disliked the main protagonist. Nobody blushes as much as other drama anime. I couldn't guess whatcould happen next. First few episode are most likely forgotten by how the remaining part goes on. While that may not be good thing, last episodes are has more impact and a really satisfying ending, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow as I said, after ep 6 or so we learn more and more about the story and why the anime is named what it is named. while some may say the story gets more deviated, personally I liked it very much. I don't get much time to watch anime lately so its been a while since I could watch anime of this sort and the development of story was really interesting for me.\\n\r\nThe ending was really satisfying too. I was thinking that story can't be wrapped that quickly and believed ep 12 to be a good ending but as I watched the last episode and learned that the anime is contained and concluded within ep 13, and in a really better way, it really deserved the 10 I gave it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you like surprises and know nothing of what happens in this anime on later episodes, it is going to be delightful to watch, since it doesn't go as expected, But that is my opinion, may be I am easily amused, but I like it and would recommend this to my friend\\n",

            "content": "The way I look at Charlotte is like a show that started off buzzing with potentially well-thought ideas. Then as time went on, it really crashed and burned. Like almost pouring rice. \r\nCharlotte, an original show conceived by Jun Maeda, is a series made by Aniplex and P.A. Works. The series takes place in a world where a small percentage of people manifest supernatural powers. While this hardly sounds original, Charlotte does have a unique presence with its characters. Yuu Otosaka, a first year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, developed his ability to possess others temporarily and made himself a fake academic honor student. The firstepisode establishes himself as a narcissistic individual who uses his powers for personal gains. \\n\\n\r\nNow, this actually sounds kind of like a neat idea. The ability to possess others can really have a dominating effect especially for someone like Yuu. Early episodes establish him using this ability with some dangerous risks. That is until we have a girl named Nao Tomori who catches Yuu using his ability and forces him to join the student council in order to help others with these unique abilities. Like Yuu though, Nao also shows a narcissistic side of herself and for some reason lacks female friends. A good portion of Charlotte shows her using a camera filming events around her life. Joining them includes Jojiro Takajo, a boy who can apparently move at supersonic speed, and Yusa Nishimori, a popular idol singer who can channel the dead. As part of the early phases, the show takes on a slice of life focus. Every episode essentially shows the members of the student council use their ability to help others and prevent troublemakers from causing chaos. This sometimes comes at high risk as some abilities can be quite dangerous. And as such, the show maintains a somewhat dark side with some minor foreshadowing. Furthermore, we are also introduced to Yuu\u2019s little sister Ayumi, who is like an energetic light bulb that can brighten anyone\u2019s day; figuratively of course. \\n\\n\r\nWith a small cast of main characters such as this, Charlotte essentially had a good story going. Yes, some of the episodes feels like distractions that incorporate generic school life activities such as baseball or outdoor camping trips. However, the show originally maintained a cool level of comedy. It can make the viewer laugh such as with Joiro\u2019s over-exaggerated expressions of his obsession towards Yusa. Ayumi can also be likable at times with her bright personality that seemingly has some influences towards others. Everything originally was standard and then, trouble hits.\\n\\n\r\nI guess it shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise. Jun Maeda is known for his involvement in Key related works. These include Kanon, Air, and Clannad. Some recurring themes include family values, magical realism, and his intention to draw tears from the viewers with emotional scenarios. So here for Charlotte, it really isn\u2019t much of a surprise that there\u2019s a familiar trend. The first few episodes sets up a lot of fun and actually works hand in hand. Then, the second half of the show kicks into a darker tone with the story. And to be quite frank honest, it feels like the show got possessed. It turns into a series that forcefully tries to draw out emotional impact starting with Yuu\u2019s depression. There is a good reason for this but the transitional direction of his character really is an oddball. Furthermore, Yuu\u2019s role becomes somewhat like a savior to protect a certain someone. It\u2019s like Yuu almost became another person as the story progresses. The turning point of the series makes Yuu look like a hero but is really one? Honestly no. In fact, Yuu is more of the anti-hero and without a certain person\u2019s help, I fear what he really may become. The recurring themes written by Jun Maeda comes into full hold as we get alternate worlds, timelines, and loops. And in general, the show changes way too much for its own good. A major problem I found throughout the latter half of the story is the numerous plot holes that appears out of nowhere. Furthermore, there are the continuous jokes that becomes apparently blend after seeing it so many times. The mood of the story constantly changes from one point to another that eventually becomes almost intolerable. It\u2019s also fairly predictable and has some fairly anti-climactic resolutions to problems. Despite this, I do give Charlotte some credit for taking the risk. I think the show is more suited for certain audiences that appreciates the writing style of Jun Maeda. Otherwise, Charlotte will take some enormous patience especially to get answers to wanted questions. These include the meaning of Charlotte, how Yuu\u2019s relationship with others changes, and what true essence of some of the characters\u2019 powers are. As with I mentioned earlier on, there\u2019s a strong uphold about family values that is easily carved out with Yuu and Ayumi\u2019s relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of relationships, the most noticeable one is probably Yuu and Nao throughout the series. In several ways, they are similar but hard to get along. Yuu\u2019s change builds a more stable relationship with her as time goes on. However, when it comes to love or romance, the series drops the ball. You\u2019ll have to see it for yourself but it\u2019s something that\u2019s easily forgettable. That also brings back to my earlier problems with the show. Some of the characters establishes their presence such as Zhiend\u2019s singer but are later seemingly forgotten. There could have been a more meaningful relationship that they can forge and leave viewers to remember for. Instead, too many things happen at once and the final few episodes really seems like it\u2019s trying to fit everything into a box. Yuu\u2019s attempt to become some sort of savior makes me feel like he really isn\u2019t suitable for the job. And lastly, I think the glasses guy (Tokajo) and Yusa\u2019s relevance in the series slipped like sands of an hourglass. Of course, their relationship hardly moved an inch. \\n\\n\r\nNow I will say this. Charlotte makes its name and presence known with its high level production values. Once again, we see the colorful style of P.A. Works\u2019 characters and a few of the scenes in the show can be described as scenery porn. While the character designs are usually generic, the powers themselves holds a dominating presence. Yuu\u2019s ability to possess others is heightened by the way the art is done with his eyes while there\u2019s also neat camera focuses of characters\u2019 facial expressions. The OP and ED theme song has a mystical presence that invests on its show\u2019s themes and foreshadowing. As such, the cinematography and overall animation for Charlotte is exceptional and is something to remember.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a show mixes in comedy and tragedy, you\u2019ll need to transit both with a fitting way to match the presentation. While not as strong as its artwork, Charlotte\u2019s soundtrack works well on most parts. Dialogues matches with character voice mannerisms and the OST in general is easy to keep up with depending on the shift of the tone. For voice mannerism itself, the characters are represented in a tolerable way whether it\u2019s Yuu\u2019s narcissism, Ayumi\u2019s hyperactive energy, Yusa\u2019s charming personality, or even her other self, who is almost a complete opposite of Yusa\u2019s character. The show also retains some musical themes as introduced in later episodes although the songs can be questionably enjoyable. For all other things though, Charlotte\u2019s soundtrack is satisfactory without breaking the limits.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is pretty much a show that is hard to accept. I think taking Charlotte for granted for what it is originally was easier for some people but as the story progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to tolerate. This is evidenced by its sharp turn in characterization, story mood changes, and reused ideas coming from Jun Maeda. As a show that tries far too hard to induce drama or tear-jerking moments, it really didn\u2019t succeed in such a way. Now I will admit though, Charlotte\u2019s comedy can make the fans laugh a bit and the premise can seem to be interesting. The first few episodes were really fun to watch and although had a plotless direction focused well on what it is. Just be aware that the second half of the show will take a drastic change and whether you like it or not, it\u2019s hard to adapt with. And honestly, that\u2019s a certain kind of blunder.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nYou find it strange that a line is missing for the ride, but you chalk it up to luck. At some point, you find the lone worker, his nametag reading J.M. He instructs you to climb the ladder before you, with you more than willing to do so. J.M. smiles and waves you off, and you climb.\r\nThe climb was quick because of how thrilling it was along the way. You are now at the top, with you overlooking the entire park. A sign says to sit down on the platform. At first, you wonder why thereis no seat and no seatbelt, but then the ride starts. From behind, you feel a push. You start to roll forward down a ramp. It is not pleasant but it is at least tolerable. Thankfully the incline is not steep, so you are not rolling fast. You start to develop bumps and bruises, thinking that this is some kind of experimental ride.\\n\\n\r\nThen, suddenly, you start to fall down steps. You start to hear bones snap as the hard edges of the stairs jut into your limbs. The stairs are made of wood, so your bruises start to scrape and then bleed. You start to panic, wanting off this wild ride, wishing that your parents had said no like they always did. At the same time, the steepness starts to increase, speeding you up at intermittent intervals.\\n\\n\r\nJust before you cannot take any more, you are in freefall. You believe that it is over, that a trampoline will cushion your landing. But it does not. Instead, you land on a landmine, blowing your arms clean off. The steep steps continue, except now that you have no arms the angular velocity of your person increases, forcing you to shut your eyes lest the spinning-induced nausea makes you vomit. With each new step, you lose a tooth, and with every other new step, you lose a memory, the repeated impacts putting you in and out of consciousness.\\n\\n\r\nYou cannot tell who is what or what is where. And just when you cannot take any more for the second time, you land on a massive spike, impaling your chest, your insides now your outsides. Your breathing is sporadic and splinters have sewed your right eye shut. So with the last of your strength, you raise your left eyelid to discover the name of the ride you just rode. There, in white letters with a comet here and a swooping star there, it reads: Charlotte.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is a poor excuse for an anime, and nowhere is that more evident than in the narrative it attempts to construct. A slew of problems plague it, sickening each of its areas to the point that no remedy available could possibly cure its ailments. From inconsistencies in the plot to the minutiae of the writing, the show is kept bedridden, prevented from performing at an acceptable level. It is a downhill tumble down a mountain, dwindling the health of the show and leading to its inevitable death.\\n\\n\r\nLike any descent, it is best to start at the summit. The first episode of Charlotte is quite well-done. While the \u201chigh school kids with superpowers\u201d is an overused formula, it managed to establish its setting in an interesting manner, placing the abilities and the main character in a negative light. The negativity, the intriguing side cast, and the supposed theme of self-correction poised the show as something grand. Then the problems start.\\n\\n\r\nThe most prevalent problem of Charlotte is the pacing. Pacing is the spacing of events \u2013 the more that goes on in a short amount of time, the faster the pacing and vice versa. For most shows, pacing is not a detriment so long as it is neither too fast nor too slow. It needs to rest in the Goldilocks region to maintain a leveled approach and keep its plot from careening out of control. Charlotte, however, effectively murders the golden-hair invader and dumps the molten porridge over her lifeless body. The anime transitions from tolerably slow to whiplashing the audience as it continuously ramps up the speed of the pacing. Yuu\u2019s mental breakdown is the first sign \u2013 a high school student to a might-as-well-be drug addict over the course of a couple of weeks or so. Time travel is introduced shortly after. Terrorists follow, with the finale of the anime cramming together a literal worldwide, person-to-person vacation. The events are not illogical or even uninteresting but they happen so fast and so often that it becomes a disconnected smorgasbord of scenarios rather than a connected grouping of instances.\\n\\n\r\nPacing speaks nothing of the actual events themselves, which are arguably worse. Many of the plot lines or plot points within Charlotte either lead to dead ends or are forgotten about entirely, both usually the byproduct of the aforementioned pacing. Nao\u2019s older brother receives a resolution halfway through the season, only to never be mentioned again. The lead singer of \u201cZhiend\u201d serves as a trigger to push events forward, but has no spot in the narrative beyond her final song. Ayumi\u2019s resolution is overly clean, with her likewise tossed on the wayside after her conflict is taken care of. When this or any anime does this, it causes the plot to feel disconnected, therefore reducing its cohesiveness and subsequently the strength of its narrative. Interestingly the show did take advantage of its own plot developments at times \u2013 having his original girlfriend appear and try to help him out of his rut demonstrates the show\u2019s awareness of its own material. But the majority of the time, the anime exists in the former camp, cumulative fragments that turn the plot into an indiscernible mess.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte\u2019s mess continues in other areas, specifically dealing with the writing itself. Again, to be fair, the anime does have its moments \u2013 Nao telling each of the earlier ability users to never use their abilities again to maintain the ruse against Yuu was clever. But a large amount of its other moments do not live up to even half of this execution. For example, Yusa\u2019s \u201cspells\u201d are a comedic gag that treads into overused territory, the same reactions occurring every time. Also the time travel reveal, which is little more than a huge exposition dump. Worse still is the hospital visits near the end, where a series of characters appears one after another to make up for spending so little time on them in the first place. It leads to repetition and in most cases a distinct lack of purpose since each subsequent event is supposed to build off of the previous ones. But because the previous events are so weak due to a combination of the poor pacing, unused plot points, and the stagnant writing, the shaky tower they create is never capable of standing upright.\\n\\n\r\nThis trifecta sees its lowest point during episode eleven, now infamous for being absolutely asinine. The character whose family was conveniently taken hostage, Shun having never known of this character\u2019s extended family despite countlessly time travelling, and Yuu going to the warehouse alone despite the group tailing him moments later are more than enough to constitute a failed narrative. The entire confrontation was not even about Nao, the terrorists, or even Pooh; the whole point was to remove the time travel variable from the equation. Any other situation could have been chosen yet the show decided on this one for a reason, the reason being to avenge Pooh and to \u201cpayback\u201d Nao. But both bonds are not exactly taut: the former he barely knew and the latter he had always butted heads with no signs of affection. In other words, Yuu\u2019s inspiration was likewise lax. So while not entirely representative of the anime, this episode made it evident how broken the show truly was.\\n\\n\r\nHalfway through the descent, Charlotte has already broke but it does not stop hitting itself. Another issue is the title of the show, which is irrelevant. The comet it is named after is never seen or, perhaps obviously, never used throughout. It is simply mentioned as the source of the strange particle or virus that causes the people to gain the abilities. Granted it might be unimportant; the actual comet means nothing in the grand scheme of things, moving the attention away from it and to the abilities it technically contains.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, that would be the argument if it did keep attention on its abilities. Instead, one of the show\u2019s biggest focal points is confusingly ignored. Besides \u201cinvisible\u201d \u2013 which gets used a lot earlier \u2013 and \u201cplunder\u201d \u2013 which gets used a lot later \u2013 abilities often go severely underutilized, appearing only a handful of times. Some hardly get used at all \u2013 the opening episodes contain abilities that, once stolen, are used to a minimal extent. The time travel is even purposely prevented from being used. Charlotte\u2019s finale also follows this trend: Yuu plundered thousands of abilities, but no more than ten were shown. To play devil\u2019s advocate, similar to the comet the abilities might not even be the point of the anime. If space rocks and superpowers are not what the anime is about, then something else must be.\\n\\n\r\nThis is when the bottom of the mountain is reached because there is no point to Charlotte; there is no thematic presence. It never centers on one specific notion, with a fairytale ending of \u201cliving happy lives from now on\u201d when they had been doing that (or trying to) from the beginning. There might be something about never giving up even in the face of ridiculous adversity, but the use of abilities makes this a moot point since the abilities lessen the adversity considerably. One might also argue that the show is about having and pursuing goals. Nao fighting to save others to have them avoid a fate like her brother\u2019s, Yuu plundering everyone to earn a romantic relationship, and Shun time traveling to the point of blindness to protect his family and other \u201cability-wielders\u201d (as they call them) showcase how a goal motivates and pushes people to do the impossible. But since Nao\u2019s and Shun\u2019s dreams fall on Yuu, and Yuu\u2019s own goal is lost, this theme loses merit as well.\\n\\n\r\nThus, after falling down a mountain while crashing into rocks formed of horrible pacing, weak writing, and nonexistent themes, Charlotte\u2019s narrative lands at the bottom, perishing in the process.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIf Charlotte does anything correct, it is in regards to its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself is vibrant, with locations varying. Schools, parks, and warehouses are featured, each filled with details that make them realistic in their presentations, appropriate for the realistic setting. Lighting is nuanced, with sunlight and fixtures casting shadows and shine where needed. Camera angles are likewise well-done, with low shots, up-close shots, and landscape ones constantly shuffled through to give the show a dynamic feel. Other tricks, like reflections in mirrors and rippling water, demonstrate the anime\u2019s regard for its visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the abilities, when they are used, is also interesting. Invisible has a rainbow sheen combined with transparency, plunder makes Yuu\u2019s eyes go green, and \u201ccollapse\u201d causes the wielder to glow and essentially explode. A distinction for each ability is given \u2013 telekinesis has a purple outline, disintegration has a sparkly effect, and combustion produces flames \u2013 that makes each come off as unique as they are.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the character designs dip in execution. Many are rather plain: Yuu, Joujirou, and Ayumi, to name a few. Nao as well, but for her, her deep blue eyes and white hair contrast, coinciding with her outward cuteness and inward abrasiveness. Surprisingly it is Yusa\u2019s older sister that has the best design. Her orange hair, red outfit, and ruby-colored eyes are a perfect fit for her fiery personality. Similar to episode eleven, she might be an outlier, but she showed where they could have gone had the designs refrained from being so plain.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation mirrors the art, staying consistently high throughout the season. Even disregarding the abilities, characters walk, flail, and react in nearly all situations, standing still for natural lengths of time. Alongside moving background objects, ruffling hair, and shattering glass, the anime always keeps its parts going, giving the show much needed strength.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nJust when Charlotte starts to climb back up the mountain with its art and animation, it quickly falls down again when its cast is investigated thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nInvestigating the side cast first is simple since the majority of them are either missing characterization, development, or purpose, sometimes a combination of the three. Joujirou, the Yusa-obsessed man in glasses, has that to his name alone. He is a huge fan of a pop star. Nothing else is learned or given about him past a certain point since the anime decided to ditch him to focus on the latter half of the show \u2013 Shun, time traveling, and world plundering. Yusa is arguably worse; she can sing and dance, her bubbly behavior allowing her to befriend anyone. But the development she receives is shoved into the span of a few minutes rather than throughout the season with her older sister visiting her family to eat food and her older sister writing her a letter. That is to say, while she does receive development, it is arguably worse than having none at all since what she was given was so lazy and lame.\\n\\n\r\nLaziness and lameness are also found in Ayumi and Shun who oppose each other in a negative sense. Ayumi is the little sister, her adorableness and worrying attitude acting as a rock for Yuu. Plus, her pizza sauce skills know no bounds. She was poised to be a worthwhile character for the rest of the cast to connect with, but similar to Joujirou, following her death avoidance her presence diminishes nearly entirely. The worst part, though, is that this ruins her relationship with Yuu, which was a major driving force for his character. Shun is on the opposite side of the spectrum. The older brother, he was introduced late, so very little is known about him besides his friendship with Pooh, and even then the audience does not get enough of the two together to understand how connected they were. Meaning when Pooh dies, Shun\u2019s breakdown does not have the necessary emotions established with the viewer to let them feel his plight. Furthermore, and opposite to Ayumi, Shun\u2019s relationship with Yuu has no weight not because they stop focusing on it but because they never focused on it to begin with. Not during flashbacks and not during the present, either. Shun even purposefully hid himself from Yuu to keep Yuu out of harm\u2019s way, meaning a relationship of any kind would not have the chance to exist. So when Shun gets emotional with Yuu or vice versa, once again the effect is not as strong as it portrays itself.\\n\\n\r\nMoving beyond the side cast of Joujirou, Yusa, Ayumi, and Shun are Nao and Yuu, arguably the worst characters of the anime considering the proportion of on-screen time and development they undergo. Nao is a seemingly distraught person. She lost her family at an early age and she is bullied in school (questionable, since it only happens once and is never touched on again). As a result, she trusts and believes in almost nobody, keeping people away to stop herself from losing anyone ever again. This explains why she uses a camcorder: she places an obstacle between her and the world, treating the world with the same distance as she does people. It is clear that she is someone who is afraid of connecting with others, a person in need of help. She has traits that would supposedly see change, but she never gets it. As the leader of the group, she has to act as such, never exposing her faulty interior. During more private moments, she cracks slightly but only to the point that her emotions evaporate. Taking a step back and looking at the season altogether reveals that Nao never truly had the spotlight all to herself, so she never could progress past her problems. The ending tries to instill the idea that she has changed for the better \u2013 that she will start using her camcorder to record \u201chappy everyday life\u201d \u2013 but it literally occurs within the last minute of the show, indicating how much of a failed character she is.\\n\\n\r\nBut the worst character is undoubtedly Yuu for one reason: passiveness. Yuu, like the first episode, starts off really strong, a troubled person who was extremely full of himself. But after the first episode, he is sidelined, Nao, Joujirou, and Yusa taking center stage with Yuu making a comment or two here and there. The focus then shifts to Ayumi and Sara (the lead singer of \u201cZhiend\u201d). Here, Yuu does not so much develop as he becomes an entirely different person, with the outcome having him go back to square one. The focus shifts once more to Shun, where both sides of his conflict use Yuu as a pawn. The final episode is the first instance where Charlotte puts Yuu at the forefront of its happenings. But as it was during Ayumi\u2019s death, he becomes an entirely different person that has no relation to his earlier self, with this outcome even worse since he regresses not back to square one but to square zero. Sympathy is not possible since it is \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d to care about or have feelings towards him since he was relegated to being a side character for the majority of the show. In short, passiveness did him in.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, themes for characters are passive in a way, since they are at the mercy of the characters that control them. In order to investigate what message the cast is relaying, their abilities should give the answer because each individual person has a power of their own. Joujirou\u2019s speed makes sense given his overzealous outbursts. Yusa\u2019s dual-self coincides with her normal student and super star status. Shun\u2019s time travel represents his determination and willingness to sacrifice himself for something bigger. Nao\u2019s invisibility makes sense given her loner persona. Yuu\u2019s plundering strangely works since he is a person who has no discernable qualities of his own. Thus, the superficial view is that\u2026people have traits that make them who they are. This is too commonplace and inherent to be a theme. Instead, it could do with uniqueness of traits \u2013 that everyone is different \u2013 but this fails since the abilities of people sometimes overlap \u2013 Pooh\u2019s ability-wielder-finder ability exists in others. It might deal with the abilities themselves; each one has a peculiar caveat attached to them. Joujirou\u2019s speed cannot be controlled, Nao\u2019s invisibility can be applied only to one person at a time, Yuu\u2019s plundering causes him to pass out for five seconds, and so on. So it might be that people are imperfect, that everyone has something about them that is off-kilter. Sadly this does not work as well since the reasoning for the defects is not expounded on, the imperfections a penalty rather than a talking point.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore there is no point. The abilities do not provide a meaningful message, an expected answer since the narrative also proved that the abilities were not what mattered most. Thus the characters are without themes and, coupled with their missing development, are left in dire straits at the bottom of the mountain once more.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is the last strong point of Charlotte. The piano and vocalist are in harmony throughout, creating a hopeful piece, fitting the tone of the anime. The ghostly reverb in the beginning, the quick, soft lyrics in the middle, and the resounding violins in the end combine to make a piece that is simultaneously familiar and otherworldly, once again finding comfort within the confines of the show. The ending theme somewhat counteracts its counterpart, the piece filled mostly with a repetitive middle section despite the strong vocals. The start of the song with its onomatopoeia is a soft lead in to the soft piece, said softness more or less matching Nao\u2019s longing. The guitar, violins, and slow lyrics pad the song further, making it, if nothing else, an alright method of easing the audience out of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is filled with a variety of pieces to fit the occasion. Lots of piano tracks to heighten the somber moments, hard violin pieces to maximize tenseness, and silly sounding instruments to increase the comedy. While the OST is not particularly memorable, it effectively bolsters the scenes it takes part in.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is similar, resting somewhere around average. Kouki Uchiyama as Yuu has a voice that is too old for his character. Plus, his screaming was never convincing. Ayane Sakura as Nao passes due to the incredulity she can include in her speaking to give her that mean yet cute edge. Maaya Uchida as Yusa is the only strong performance, doing the voices for both the younger and the older sister, capturing their personalities nicely through the performances she gives.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI would be lying if I said that the first episode did not impress me. Because it did. Then the rest of the anime happened, and I could not believe how it continued to shoot itself in the foot with each new episode. I did find Nao and Yusa cute and funny, but as individual characters they were so poorly presented that my disappointment nearly cancelled out the laughs. Yuu was a boring main character, Ayumi\u2019s adorableness not being around was a bad move, and Joujirou\u2019s shtick got old quick. None of the characters were engaging enough for me to resonate with, leaving me to simply follow the flow of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI also had no real emotional connection to the anime. I did not cry when Yusa was reading aloud her letter from her older sister, Pooh\u2019s death did not impact me in the slightest, and I did not care for Yuu when he was going rogue or journeying alone. The anime\u2019s events never made me feel anything, thereby reducing the amount of entertainment I got out of it. Still, I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next. I was not invested in the show, but it piqued my interest when Yuu time travelled or set out on his unrealistic adventure.\\n\\n\r\nSomething trivial that ticked me off was the order in which Yuu plundered abilities during his mega journey. The first official one he stole to start it off was Nao\u2019s. It would have been infinitely more poetic to have her be the last one. Yuu fights and travels and steals, surviving as much as he can, until the very end where he finally meets her, with a touching yet heartbreaking reunion. Instead, the last one is some random girl in some random village with Yuu somehow getting hit with arrows despite being the strongest human to have ever lived, and then a helicopter coming down to save him as his arm is outstretched towards Nao\u2019s gift. It is somewhat silly to be mad about this since this is not my anime. However the idea of going full-circle \u2013 starting at the beginning and ending at the beginning \u2013 is powerful narrative-wise, so seeing such a hugely missed opportunity irks me.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte deserves almost no praise. Outside of the art and bits of its music, the anime crashes and burns, its story and characters abysmal in their overall execution. Needless to say, this is one ride that nobody should ever have to endure.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, poor pacing, forgotten plot points, weak writing, irrelevant content, and no extensive thematic presence\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, beautiful art, cool-looking abilities, okay character designs, and above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, Joujirou, Yusa, Shun, Nao, and Yuu are underdeveloped, underused, or both, with their abilities meaning nothing to them or grander themes\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, zero resonance, no emotional connections, and an irking directional decision, yet still interesting enough to follow through to the end\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE*\r\nHere it is. \r\nFor me, Charlotte was a really good work overall. It was probably the best out of the Summer 2015 season, and honestly one of my favorites in my anime experience so far.\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\nSTORY - 8/10\r\nDon't get me wrong, the synopsis sounded so cliche and so boring I didn't actually feel like watching this in the first place - what actually gave me the push to was the poster art (we'll get into that later, anyway) - but it surprised me really much. It had really surprising plots, and the feel you had while watching everything happen, characters showing up, everything, wasn't constant.This story brought not one way to look at it, but uncountable ways to. \\n\\n\r\nART - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I loved the art for this. Charlotte had a great animation and even though this whole art rating thing is personal and differs with people's tastes, I think that's the one thing most people can agree about. What I loved so much about the art, too, was the colors. So, this was this fantasy sci fi piece, with a comet's name and they used a lot of purples and blues and whenever the sky was visible here, it was just gorgeous to look at. That was a great point too - the colors mean a lot to me in a good art.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSome people say there was no character development - well, I don't think like that at all. There was a ton of character development, but it was so fluid and natural to watch, you don't even realize it happening. And I just loved it that way. By the time you finish Charlotte and compare the character's behavior the first and last time you saw them, you realize it. Specially the main character. The main character got a huge change of attitude, that you don't quite realize until half of the series is through. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI hold Charlotte in a really dear place, specially because I felt like there was something more to it. The abilities only teenagers have are some sort of symbol to the troubles of being a teenager: it's tough, it's when you come to terms with yourself and try to realize were you belong. And that was a conclusion I came to personally after thinking about the series as a whole for a bit. \\n\\n\r\nI'd really recommend you to watch this series, but you have to be able to see beyond what's right there and try to get something out of it. That's the best way to do it! (:",

            "content": "I'll have a rant with Charlotte. It deserves it. Why isn't there a zero score for 'story'?\r\nIt is oft repeated that everybody, well not everybody, but many people, had high hopes for Charlotte, and that 'people' includes me in the ranks. It was the first name on my team sheet for the summer season. Such a waste.\r\nIt's also repeated that it started okay and plunged down after a certain point. This plays true to the words, it shot up the horribility scale after about EP8. Everything went wrong. The pacing, the character development. But especially the plot. The believability of that plot. Plot holes aregalore. It's really depressing trying to talk about every one of them. The last episode was especially a huge pile of garbage on that front, which you have to see to believe. How is that even possible? There were too many 'red dots' on one map in one city and too much time taken for him to erase one dot at a time for me to believe any second of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a big problem too. Nao is well-loved and praised, at least round here in my part of the Earth. She is well-designed, no doubt about it. However she plays too little a part in the short and appalling main plot, think about it again, doesn't she? About all the others, well...there are too many come-and-go characters that just slip in, do their part which have wildly varying impacts on the plot, and then vanish with slim explanation on their past or future actions and intentions. Even two 'main characters' in the main party, glasses guy and idol girl, really do nothing to complement the anime outside of giving the odd giggle(or, to put it better, vain attempt at making you giggle) and being a kind of christmas visual decoration. We still don't know virtually anything about them after the end of the last episode. It's impossible to like the character as a moving character that has flesh and blood, even though they're 'main characters'. Ms. Zhiend and Nao's older bro clog up more than one episode of the anime, and the whole of EP8, for literally nothing, as their forced drama is reversed when the MC turns back time. What was the point?\\n\\n\r\nPacing and production, to a lesser extent was also to blame. Look at the flashback scene in EP9 and...It\u2019s really bad. I'll have a moan with the main band Zhiend as well. They're vaguely listenable, but how on earth are they a post-rock band? And why did Maeda try to emphasize that?\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves the art. It's not a masterwork in design and movement, but it's certainly commendable and faults were hard to find in the quality throughout the series. That's it though. It doesn't leave waves of astonishment for that, and is just...a little better than the average anime you get. There's no trying to leave from the tradition neither, everything is standard. Is it better enough than your average 'moe anime' or whatever they call them to cover up its gaping shortcomings in just about every department excepting the art? Nah... it just serves to make this shit look a bit less shit.\\n\\n\r\nThat's Charlotte then for me. I was planning to give this a long, critical mind you, but still long review up until EP11 or something. I lost the remaining love for this over the next couple of weeks, and gave up on giving it a long review as it was a waste of time. That leaves this rant. No recommendation people, don't watch it. No chance I'm waiting for another series from Maeda. Not in a million years.",

In short, people love Key, and when a new anime fronted by Key or Key\u2019s figurehead and principal writer Jun Maeda rolls around, people pay attention. It could be because you\u2019re excited for a new anime from your favorite writer, it could be because you\u2019re one of the director\u2019s many critics and you can\u2019t wait to see their new trainwreck, or you could just be interested in the hype the new series delivers as a passive observer; whatever the case, interest is generated. Naturally, Charlotte, being the newest title in Jun Maeda\u2019s impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9, was met with a tidal wave of hype. Does Charlotte match the standards expected by a Key title? Well, yes and no.\\n\\n\r\nThe first six episodes are a testament to all things Jun Maeda, a near complete collection of tropes anybody familiar with his work probably knows intimately by now: food jokes, baseball, school hi-jinks, and tinges of supernatural melodrama, among others. Frankly, these episodes are riddled with so many KeyTropes\u2122 that one might think they were purposely constructed as a parody of everything Maeda is known for. By episode 4, all except the most rabid of Key fans will be more than a little tired with the barrage of shenanigans pressed upon us. The problem isn\u2019t so much that Maeda uses his traditional writing style, it\u2019s that the execution of his ideas are simply too familiar. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen this before, and I\u2019ve seen it done better than this.\u201d His writing is almost a caricature of itself at this point. As a fan of Maeda\u2019s writing style, I found myself chuckling a number of times and invested in \u201cThe Everyday Adventures of Tomori and Friends\u201d more than I retrospectively can understand, but I doubt the average viewer is going to empathize with these feelings. Then, against all odds, Charlotte turned 180 in potentially one of the most contrasting shattering of tropes and clich\u00e9s I\u2019ve ever witnessed in an anime: episode seven.\\n\\n\r\nThe 7th episode of Charlotte is without question one of Key\u2019s finest episodes, sitting in pleasant company with the 18th episode of Clanand: After Story, the 10th episode of Kanon, and the finale of Angel Beats. For probably the second time in his career, Maeda wrote a dramatic story earthed in realism and believability that does not rely on emotional oversensitivity. Filled with flawless progression, powerful character development, and tight writing, Maeda proved he has a grasp on human emotions and Charlotte is not just another show aimed at appealing to the viewer\u2019s appreciation for zany comedy and \u201cfeels.\u201d It even successfully implements Maeda\u2019s traditional appreciation for sensationalism and does so with class. From episode seven onwards, Charlotte catapults through a number of plot twists and thrills with a sense of maturity foreign to Key\u2019s works, only ever devolving back to its handbook of clich\u00e9s to lighten the atmosphere and strengthen the execution rather than relying on them to even catch interest. However, herein lies Charlotte\u2019s largest fault (no, it\u2019s not the pizza sauce jokes): resolution.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps a testimony to the fact a Key story can\u2019t be told with finesse in a mere 13 episodes, Charlotte\u2019s single most fatal flaw is its pacing and the means by which its drama is resolved. Character development is curbed for the sake of bringing a close to each individual obstacle in a single episode and, in the best of cases, two episodes. The drama of the early episodes is ruined by the absence of build-up and negligence of expansion, and the drama of the latter episodes is diminished by the constraints of its run time that force a harried resolution without thoroughly exploring the events and before viewers are given the chance to even register what\u2019s going on, let alone sink into our protagonist\u2019s emotions\u2026 which brings us to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf Charlotte\u2019s pacing is the gaping wound to the series, then its characters would be the taut string that attempts to cease the blood loss. Each member of our four-character primary cast is loveable and amusing, and a lot of Charlotte\u2019s idiosyncratic humor would utterly fail without its characters to support it. Yuu Otosaka, accurately dubbed \u201cmini-Lelouch,\u201d is sly and selfish yet charismatic and\u2026 loves his sister. Nao Tomori is a stoic, responsible, and sweet girl that maneuvers skillfully across the tsundere rope, the one Key girls often do, striking a delicate balance between casually hostile and apprehensively caring. This gives her a believable emotional distance, especially taking into consideration the struggles pressed upon her, far removed from the cringe-inducing display of many of the anime community\u2019s beloved tsunderes (Taiga is shit). Joujirou Takajo and Yusa \u201cYusarin\u201d Kurobane kind of play second fiddle to our protagonists and would have benefited greatly from more development (Takajo especially; Kurobane received her share of development, but its execution was disappointing at best\u2014more on that in a minute), but between Takajo\u2019s presence as the butt of Charlotte\u2019s many jokes and Yusarin\u2019s dualistic personality, I couldn\u2019t help but admire both of them anyway. There are a number of side characters which play an important role later in the story; speaking much of them would spoil several important events, but it\u2019s worth noting that they are all likeable characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Charlotte\u2019s fatal ailment to some extent succeeded in demolishing its characters as well. As mentioned previously, the pacing of the series consistently stifles character development. Some of Yuu\u2019s actions come out of left field, Tomori winds up a side character by the end, and the bits of development the other characters get is crammed into a time allotment so tightly controlled it just seems forced\u2014Kurobane\u2019s ultimate resolution is literally compacted into less than 5 minutes of a single episode. Charlotte nearly completely sacrifices the important element of build-up in the execution of its drama, and without that build-up it\u2019s difficult for the audience to really care about what\u2019s going on. Episode 7 is the single moment in the series that remembers that importance, and, to no surprise, it focuses on Yuu. As the protagonist, all of the genuine development in the series is heaped at Yuu. Even the events seemingly intended to develop the side characters commonly, ultimately serves the purpose of developing Yuu. It is for this reason that, despite some misgivings, Yuu is a well-rounded, well-developed character and certainly among the best of Key\u2019s protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I have no specific comments about the standard sound direction\u2014the BGM is certainly not as noteworthy as that of Key\u2019s holy trinity (Clannad, Kanon, Air)\u2014praise should be directed towards the stellar voice work of Kouki Uchiyama for Yuu Otosaka and Ayane Sakura for Nao Tomori. Yuu\u2019s voice work is theatrical and lively, perfectly complimenting his character, yet apprehensive and dejected when required. Nao\u2019s voice in contrast is some combination of subdued, stern, and alluring; and, truthfully, Ayane Sakura\u2019s voice is so charming I could\u2019ve turned off the subtitles and just appreciate the beauty of her voice work. \\n\\n\r\nI opened this review up with the word \u201cambivalence\u201d to set an atmosphere for my general impression of the series. While the first half of the series is an enjoyable yet basic collage of slice-of-life shenanigans, the second half swiftly swings into motion reminding me why I love Key\u2019s works, yet ultimately leaving me with mixed feelings because its unfortunate pacing restrains its overflowing potential. The resulting product is a vaguely impressive series that falls short of its fathers. And, disappointing as it is, it could have matched them with a handful more episodes, just a bit more time to expand its events and characters, to cover its plot holes. I hope this serves a lesson for any hypothetical future projects: Maeda, please make it two cour.",

            "content": "Charlotte is another one of those controversial anime which you see people complaining about *everywhere* yet it still actually has pretty decent ratings. From this we can deduce that there are probably a lot of people hating on it mostly because everyone else is doing it and they don't want to stand out, and/or that the show is mostly successful among casual viewers who don't bother speaking their mind about it over the internet to begin with. It all sounds uncannily similar to the public view on Sword Art Online in that sense, doesn't it? And in the same way, while Charlotte is certainly noton the same level as most of Jun Maeda's earlier works, there are still countless anime significantly worse than this. The world doesn't solely consist of black and white.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is a story about people with super powers. Only temporary and highly imperfect ones yes, but super powers all the same. It follows the life Otosaka Yuu, an initially arrogant high-schooler who has the ability to take control of people's minds for five seconds at a time; an ability he has used to cheat his way to the highest grades of his school. That is until he one day gets caught red-handed by an unknown girl who is seemingly aware of his ability, Tomori Nao, who then forces him and his sister to transfer into her own school instead: a special school built solely for students with supernatural abilities. And thus their new lives begin as Yuu and his newfound companions struggle through their lives as they attempt to fit into society, as well as do their best to stay away from any scientists who might seek to turn them into experimental guinea pigs.\\n\\n\r\nNow the first problem with Charlotte is simply that the first five episodes are rather... uninteresting to say the least, and feel mostly like filler. These episodes pretty much run on an \"ability user of the week\" theme, as they are all separate stories about Yuu and his friends having to find and subjugate some person abusing his/her super power in some manner of fashion. But there is no semblance of coherence to it, and it doesn't feel like the main plot is going anywhere at all. Or rather it doesn't feel like any sort of main plot even exists. It's mostly just quirky over-the-top comedy similar to what we saw in Angel Beats and not a whole lot more.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't until episode six that the main story actually starts out for real. Here the story immediately takes a significantly darker turn, which was clearly written for shock value. Then it gets a lot more interesting for a few episodes (though Yuu's character development still feels highly unrealistic), but as it gets closer to its climax, Charlotte starts feeling a bit like an unfinished mess script-wise. I'm not going to spoil any details of course, but there are a ridiculous amount of ideas that are juggled with towards the end of the story, and it feels like the plot takes a whole new direction with every new episode. One week it felt like I was watching Steins;Gate. The other it was Zankyou no Terror. Etcetera. Really it doesn't feel like the plot even knows where it wants to go, and as a result you get a jumbled mishmash of a storyline in the grand scheme of things. Also as an inevitable result of this, there are many plot elements which feel rather poorly thought-out. When you take a completely unexpected direction with the plot, you better have done the groundwork for it to make sense, but Charlotte doesn't always do this because some of the twists feel more like plot holes than anything else simply because earlier events seem to contradict them. In addition, despite the now more serious general atmosphere of the show, it still insists on reusing the silly comedic elements of its opening episodes every so often, but unlike those, it no longer feels appropriate at all. Oh and if you're looking for some sort of tear-jerking drama in this anime like Jun Maeda normally specializes in, you should probably look someplace else because Charlotte really isn't that kind of story at all. Rather the only drama it really has is quite cheesy, and among other things contains a pretty forced and unnatural romance subplot, but even that is still nothing more than a secondary aspect of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nothing spectacular, but I find them likeable enough for the most part. In the very beginning, Yuu is the spitting image of Lelouch both in terms of personality and super power which thrilled me quite a lot, but sadly he calms down and becomes more of a standard protagonist pretty quickly. Nao is rather hotheaded and violent, but still very caring for her friends and family on the inside. The other main characters primarily consist of other ability users from the school, including the pop idol Yusarin who has a quite unique take on the \"split personality\" concept, as well as the glasses guy Joujirou who possesses the ability to teleport... sort of. There is also the rather overwhelming little sister Ayumi whom I know a lot of people disliked quite a lot, but she's treated more like a plot device than anything else throughout the story. Whether or not this is a good or bad thing though is debatable.\\n\\n\r\nThe production value however, as you may expect from P.A. Works, is top tier. While it doesn't look quite as mesmerizing as some of their earlier works such as Nagi no Asukara, it is still absolutely beautiful to look at. The character designs and the scenery both look amazing. The music is equally on point, which again may only be expected given the people behind it. The OP and ED are both among the very best of the year for sure.\\n\\n\r\nBut although it may be pretty to look at and listen to, that is sadly not all there is to an anime, and Charlotte falls flat in the more important categories instead. I really felt like the story always had potential, but it never really got itself together. I felt like I was constantly waiting for some clever plot twist that would make all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, and suddenly explain why all the questionable plot twists played out the way they did... but it never really happened. Episode nine did a good job with clearing up everything up to that point, but as for the events of the last few episodes... I'm afraid I can't say the same. As a result, the ending isn't exactly the best one I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything though, I still somehow found Charlotte fairly entertaining from start to finish. Admittedly a lot of that probably just comes from the initial hype the series had, but even when it started to get more and more problematic script-wise, it didn't exactly get boring. And that is still the most important aspect in my mind, given that anime is, after all, nothing but entertainment media in the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte feels kind of like an incomplete experimental anime which tries to do too many things at the same time, and as a result doesn't really succeed with any of them. Rather it leaves more holes than answers instead. But it still manages to keep you guessing and curious about what kind of curveball it's going to throw at you next. Does that make it a good anime? Maybe not, but despite all its problems I still can't make myself hate it. While it's certainly a very flawed anime, I still had fun watching it.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only we could all learn to not hype series up to the second tier of heaven before they start airing; it only makes the disappointment feel all the greater when it doesn't live up to the expectations in the end.",

Not realistic...darker but hopeful.\r\nThe STORY that gets really interesting by every chapter have just one problem. Its like every 3 or 2 episodes the anime changes from slice of life to drama, and after 2 comes back to slice of life and then romance and then action. Many people disliked this but I love it. It let me think and watch every part of the anime deeper and gave me enough to still being curious.\r\nWhat can I say about the ART...just \"P.A.Works.\". Beutiful environment bythe way.\\n\r\nThe SOUND is good,;I loved the op and ending but maybe I personally dislike the part of the anime of progressive rock.\\n\r\nAll CHARACTERS have good personality s. Everyone is cool. But they focused so much on Yuu and some parts on Nao that I forget about the others characters.  Even if they would kill someone I won't get sad at all. But talking in general I loved the changes of every character while story goes on. Anyways I loved something of every character and that is how it should be. \\n\r\nI ENJOYED all episodes. Calm, tragedy,  school, love, tears. Maybe it make me feel a little sad for the music, art and what happened. But I feel it... I felt it.\\n\r\nIn OVERALL I gave this a 9 because I didn't enjoy a anime for so long. Because I felt what yuu felt what nao felt. And I didn't expect anything.  I just watch and put my heart on it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "-THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS-\r\nCharlotte seems to be the \"Key\" title that sticks out the most from the bunch. Not only is it an original story, but it also has a darker and more complicated story. Yes. COMPLICATED. As it is a Key title, many people got hyped up for it before it came out and it has become one of the most popular shows of not only the Summer 2015 season, but in 2015 as well. So how is it really?\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAs with all the Key titles, Charlotte starts off as this happy, school feeling slice-of-life show. A few episode later it divesdown into deeper and darker themes with the characters revealing something different about them. The entire show mostly plays out on the darker moments rather than the school life and that is something I appreciate from it. However, it doesn't save the story from being a rushed mess. Like Gakkou Gurashi, Charlotte's story doesn't know what it wants to be. It jumbles from a happy slice-of-life show to dark action show with a hint of mystery. The story seems as if it's changing it's mind every 5 minutes from the two themes since it wants to be both but it doesn't know how. Also, it's very rushed. We have a death in episode 6 from a character we should care about but the anime gives us so little time with that character. Instead, it gives us a baseball episode and a camping episode. Those episodes should've been used for us to learn about the characters more. Every episode after episode 6 is a Steins;Gate wannabe mindfuck. Only not that good kind. With a rushed story and such little episodes, everything seems to complicated to follow.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte was brought to us by studio P.A. Works. Responsible for shows like Angel Beats (another Key anime) and Nagi no Asukara. And the production values for those shows are beautiful to look at. While the shows themselves may not hold up well, they still have beautiful art and animation all around. This however, kind of does that, just in a very toned down kind of way. The animation in the opening is beautiful and really brings out P.A. Works potential with their animation skills. Not only that, but the colors and backgrounds (excluding some of the character designs) mix in pretty well. Another thing I like is how when the tone shifts, the color pallets would change in tone and it does it wonderfully. But the rest of the animation is pretty mediocre. The characters movements seem very sloppy and a bit too quick for the type of anime this is. Also, the hair and the eye combination for some of these characters just doesn't mix well together. Nao's sea foam type hair and dark blue eyes just seem so off. The lead singer for the band who is blind has pink hair and light blue eyes just looks so mismatched. The animation isn't terrible or bad by any means, but for P.A. Works, it's kind of a let down.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nHighlight of the show. This show gets props for having a great opening and ending song. The opening gives out a happy, cheerful but subtle deep themes that just fit perfectly for the show. The ending is a much more so somber that also fits the show well. Also, the show has a great cast of voices that all put great effort into their performances. However, even if the sound is good, the soundtrack on the other hand is lacking. It sounds just like a bunch of things we've heard of before and some of the soundtracks that play do not match with the scene the anime is showing us. However, that doesn't weigh out the good performances by the cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOH BOY HERE WE GO. The worst part of Charlotte. Nao while actually a pretty interesting character doesn't do much or develops. Otosaka, the main lead, goes from a bad ass to a bland and uninteresting character by episode 3. Otosaka's sister plays a major role in the show but she's the same moeshit, \"ONIICHAN!\" stereotype we've seen in a billion of other shows. Rest of the characters? Who cares? They don't do much to the show or show up at all. Even the new character don't do much at all. They're just there to give Otosaka his orders while just standing around. What am I supposed to feel for this idol chick with her dead sister ability? NOTHING. Since the anime barley gives her any screen time. The guy with the glasses not only has no point to the anime, but he's one of the most pointless characters I've ever seen. Key's worst characters to date.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked some of the action moments and watching Nao. That's it. Most of the time I was just checking the time and begging this anime to be over and done with. It was painful to sit through to the point I felt like dropping it. I very much dislike dropping series and I didn't want this to be my first. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWasted Potential: The Anime. \\n\r\nCharlotte has a misguided and jumbled story, average animation (though not exactly a bad thing), HORRENDOUS CHARACTERS, and a rushed ending that makes you go, \"What was the point of it all? Why did I watch this atrocity?\" P.A. Works has never really been good at drama anime or good at anything in the matter, but this feels like a new low for the studio. And I though Glasslip from last summer was a bad anime by P.A. Works- and even though it's bad, it's not Charlotte bad. I really would like to see something good from P.A. Works for once. FOR ONCE. I guess that's too much to ask. I recommend staying away from this series. Even though it has a good opening and ending and a good cast that gave out great performances, it doesn't save the show at all.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n",

How's it going. \r\nUPDATE\r\nI originally dropped this show at 8 episodes, having felt that this show was possibly going to be one of the worst experiences I have ever had. However, I decided to complete it to fully deiscern for myself whether or not it was as bad as I thought. Now, after finishing the 5 episodes that I neglected, I can safely say:\r\nThat this show is one of the worst shows I have ever seen, and far worse than I could have imagined at that.\r\nNow, the way that I rate shows is fully detailed on my profile, so look there for myfull reasoning, but just know this: what I define as the worst anime is a show that has so many negative aspects about it that anything good that may come from it doesn't compare to the flaws and downright offensive structure of the show in question.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said,\\n\\n\r\nSTORY & CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis show is horribly paced, featuring six whole episodes in the beginning of nothing but one-off unmemorable characters and nearly emotionless segments that could have been dealt with in just a couple of episodes. In fact, episodes 2-6 might as well be the same episode, just with a different super power and forgettable character. \\n\\n\r\nNow, some may argue that Angel Beats! also shares this problem. However, the difference here is that Angel Beats! had a full cast with recurring characters that kept coming back, allowing for an attachment to grow with these characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte, by comparison, gives us a cast of four unremarkable character tropes that are no different from any character we have seen before. The only character really exempt from this is Tomori Nao, the main heroine of the series (though she herself is simply just a deviation from Yuri Nakamura, who herself is almost frighteningly similar to Haruhi Suzumiya).\\n\\n\r\n However, the episodic nature of these first couple episodes would have made this show a simple 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the edge happens.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is so bad with how dark and depressing it tries to be that it comes off as comedic at best. I found myself laughing at scenes that most would describe as traumatic or depressing because they just felt so rushed and souless that laughing was the only correct emotional response. In fact, some of the major plot points and threads in this show, which are meant to draw out an emotional response, felt lifeless.\\n\\n\r\nI will talk about the major problems later, but first:\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the only thing that could save this show is its animation and sound design. I DO find the animation to only be a slight upgrade of Angel Beats! (though even that is disputable, as Angel Beats! has better art direction). I suppose it is fair that P.A. Works has improved since Angel Beats!, as the animation is cleaner and feels less glossy. The problem, however, is that the character designs, overall, are unmemorable for the most part, with the exception of Tomori Nao. The design sense is good, but mostly forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also fairly well-done, as the background music and sound direction are fine for the most part. Charlotte also has its own vocal performances by fictional band ZHIEND, but the music is mostly...meh for the most part. The show's musical aspects shine especially in the area of its opening \"Bravely You\" by Lia, an opening that I have to admit is the best of the Summer anime season. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this show is almost like Sword Art Online in this sense. The art and sound of course are fairly well-done, but when comparing it to Angel Beats!, Nagi no Asakura or even Shirobako, it doesn't really stand out too well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut, that leaves us with the major problem with the series.\\n\\n\r\nIT'S TOO CLUTTERED\\n\\n\r\nJun Maeda has clearly not learned from his mistakes from Angel Beats!, and arguably he has done a much worse job, as this show is too short for the story it is trying to tell.\\n\\n\r\nOr perhaps, I should word it like this:\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats!'s problem is that it had too many characters that needed development, which required at least a 24-episode timeframe.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte feels like a string of ideas which could form five different SHOWS, each either 24 episodes or 13 episodes in their own regard. An Angel Beats!/X-Men style episodic comedy. An emotional revenge story. A blatant Steins;Gate ripoff. And a whole solo series with its own issues and moral questions which was packed into ONE EPISODE. \\n\\n\r\nThis show was ruined by its ambition and lack of planning, and I cannot stand it.\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nThis show is currently my #4 least favorite show of all time. How anyone can actually say this show is good baffles me. I wanted to love this show. I really did. However, it just tries so hard to be this dark, emotional story that I cannot enjoy it without being constantly irritated by all of its numerous flaws. And Jun Maeda NEEDS to learn how to pace out a series correctly. I cannot see myself ever reccomending this to anyone, and I just hope one day Jun Maeda ACTUALLY learns from his mistakes.",

It doesn\u2019t work like that. \r\nSo what are our ingredients? \r\n1) Good-looking audience surrogate male protagonist. 2) Equally good-looking female protagonist with tragic backstory. 3) Super kawaii imouto. 4) Glasses-wearing idol fanboy. 5) Moe idol character. 6) High school setting. 7) Government baddies. 8) Supernatural abilities 9) Deaths, but not really. 10) Romantic subplot\u2026see where I\u2019m going with this?\r\nThe biggest problem for Charlotte seems to be its inherent lack of confidence in having compelling characters and telling an interesting story. Hell,when the director himself admits that the anime doesn\u2019t pick up until episode 6, something is definitely wrong here. Indeed, the first five episode are incredibly formulaic, yet acts as if it isn\u2019t. Charlotte doesn\u2019t trust its audience enough to be able to accept what it does, and thus ends up spelling everything out. Why must we be constantly reminded how good-looking Yuu and Tomori are, how much of a turn off Joujirou is, and how despicable the government/scientists are? Only if you didn\u2019t think these elements could be interesting at face-value.  \\n\\n\r\nChef Charlotte suffers by trying way too hard and playing it way too safe. The mood of this series is jarring, shifting from humorous to tragic to \u201cheartfelt\u201d in seconds. Which could work and is possible (see Gintama), but the problem is that it oversells these moments. The jokes work the first time since humor is effective when it\u2019s over-the-top, but quickly becomes a recycled tool. The dramatic moments are overdone with its constant rage-faces and Supersaiyan-esque screaming. It tries to force in moments of fan service like Yusarin\u2019s singing under the mask of plot development. The more risky ingredients like death and romance are either haphazardly tossed in or negated altogether. Don\u2019t add things if you\u2019re not going to see them through. \\n\\n\r\nIf the most delicious part of this anime is the omurice with pizza sauce, then I think the director needs to go back to culinary school.",

            "content": "It was the summer of 2006, the heat rather modest (a rarity in my hometown of Augusta, GA), and I was aiming to make a quick buck. Roused by the success of my parents\u2019 yard sale earlier that day, I convinced my little brother to follow me door-to-door, selling T-shirts and books, my books. I aspired to become an author (even back then) yet lacked the necessities to further my vision. What I did was borrow the books on my shelf, glue my name where the author\u2019s should be, and sold other people\u2019s products as though it were my own. It was an utterly disgustingact, one I reflect on in shame.\\n\\n\r\n(You\u2019re not gonna believe this but I managed to earn two dollars from my scheme).\\n\\n\r\nFor those of us that have viewed Charlotte in its entirety, this anecdote likely sounds very familiar. This is an anime that exists by blatantly pilfering the ideas, the mood, and the essence from other entities; it siphons from its own decency and originality for a profit. Charlotte is, in short, a Jun Maeda work through and through. Of course, it\u2019s possible to be distracted from the rampant plagiarism, thanks to the excess of stunning scenery porn (another feat of visual excellence by P.A. Works). Charlotte is the equivalent of the Anchor Arms from SpongeBob; it projects a self-assured exterior that does absolutely nothing to repair its fragile inner workings. The crux of Charlotte\u2019s glaring imperfections is that it mounted too much pressure on itself and then crumpled under the weight. Charlotte champions itself as a slice-of-life, a time travel epic, a Code Geass knockoff, a tearjerker of a romance, a modern take on the superhero genre, and a mystery simultaneously. However, Charlotte flounders in every facet, especially when it involves mystery.\\n\\n\r\nEvery recognizable cast member contains some sort of superpower and this enables the characters to settle each case without a hitch. Cold cases don\u2019t exist in the world of Charlotte; \u201csuspects\u201d, \u201csecond-guessing\u201d, and \u201cnabbing the wrong guy\u201d are foreign concepts here as well. In fact, Charlotte\u2019s detective work is completely and utterly devoid of realism. It\u2019s the superpowers that can identify, locate, and apprehend any criminal (It doesn\u2019t require Sherlock Holmes to arrest robbers anymore, not when someone with invisibility can do the job). In the rare occasion that powers aren\u2019t of any use, Charlotte\u2019s cast is still able to solve cases thanks to the miracle of plot convenience (You cannot fathom how effortless the interrogation scenes are). Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the man that popularized the mystery genre, likely rolls in his grave at the existence of Charlotte.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cElementary\u201d is how I\u2019d describe Charlotte\u2019s approach to detective work, and the same could be said for its characterization. The central cast members are Self-Insert MC, followed by Haruhi Ripoff, Quirky Glasses Guy, Cute Pop Idol, and Jailbait Chef. They (and every other character in Charlotte) are pure, benevolent, and utterly righteous beings that take actions for noble causes. One person seeks to follow their dreams while another aims for a second chance with his crush and all of them \u2013 all of them \u2013 are concerned with protecting their friends and family. Charlotte\u2019s characters are absolutely not allowed to display any personality flaws; if they do, the show will ensure said character returns to the path of righteousness as soon as possible (This is exactly what I despised about Once Upon A Time). When one character embarks in the lifestyle of a degenerate, it\u2019s an apology and a good meal that causes him to make a turnaround. As you and I both know, our world is filled with sunshine and rainbows and Mary Sues. Charlotte has no time for anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no doubt you\u2019ve heard people claim this show is riddled with plot holes, logical fallacies, pacing issues, and unintentional hilarity. All of this is certainly true but one thing needs to be said here: Charlotte is dull; it\u2019s wildly, relentlessly, colossally dull. Both the theme song and ending theme are legitimate sleeping pills while the utter lack of visual creativity never fails to disappoint (especially in comparison to Angel Beats). If that doesn\u2019t lower your expectations, I guarantee that Charlotte\u2019s putrid sense of humor will do the trick. The fanboy monologues from Quirky Glasses Guy, the oh-so-funny catchphrases (\u201cBig turnoff!\u201d), and the nosebleeds are where the eyerolls will commence. Charlotte has a fascination for introducing unbearable gags, i.e. episode 3\u2019s name gag, and lingering over them (a Jun Maeda trademark) like no other. The \u201cwitty\u201d asides are guaranteed to fall flat every time; for a show that enjoys dubbing each character\u2019s power as \u201chalf-assed\u201d, it\u2019s a fitting description for its sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nNo review of Charlotte (or any Jun Maeda work for that matter) can be complete without mentioning the inability to understand subtlety. You don\u2019t get a moment of silence with Charlotte. It\u2019s nothing but noise with this show, as if muting the inspirational strings and sappy dialogue just once is too much to ask for. Charlotte exterminates the \u201cshow; don\u2019t tell\u201d concept with its tiresome monologues and excessive narration; every instance of character development is spelled out for you, as if you can\u2019t observe what\u2019s happening for yourself. Even Angel Beats has more tact that this hunk of garbage.\\n\\n\r\nAsk Charlotte for a finale that\u2019s respectable and it goes for convoluted instead.\\n\r\nAsk Charlotte to be original and it quits before episode 2.\\n\r\nAsk Charlotte to aspire for higher standards and it wallows in its own stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nIf there are a few tips I\u2019d give to potential viewers of this travesty, it would be to prepare for disappointment. It would be to not misconstrue a copy-and-paste job for originality. It would be to not be deceived by pretty colors and gorgeous midafternoon skies. It would be to be wary of cop outs and deus ex machinas and an egregious confession of love. Better yet, it would be to take a glance at the legion of negative reviews, alongside the glut of low scores, and stay far, far, far away from Charlotte.",

            "content": "Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\n--------------------\r\nTell me if this description sounds familiar: \u201cA group of \u2018special\u2019 highschoolers defined almost exclusively by archetypes and/or tragic pasts form an organization together. They don\u2019t really get along at first, but they get to know each other extremely intimately over time, eventually culminating in a romance. Many tragic events take place as the innocent and sympathizable highschoolers are victimized by the cruel, cruel world. Eventually, they must accept sacrifice to fulfill their lives and destinies.\u201d Some of you are probably thinking \u201cThat\u2019s Angel Beats!\u201d, while the rest of you are probably thinking \u201cThat\u2019s Charlotte!\u201d Well, good news: You\u2019reboth right, because for all intents and purposes, they are exactly the same show. \\n\\n\r\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not going to criticize this anime on the sole basis that it isn\u2019t even pretending to differentiate itself from another show; I\u2019m going to criticize this show because not only does it contain all the same errors that the show it plagiarized (yes, I know they had the same writer, so it\u2019s not technically stealing) also contained, but it managed to magnify those errors significantly. Horrible plotholes, absurd amounts of over-convenience, awful world-building, identity confused characters, my god; Charlotte is nothing but a fucking mess.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with what is, in my opinion, the biggest problem the show has, the characters. They are completely shallow, completely one-dimensional, and more often than not, completely devoid of personality. Let\u2019s take our protagonist, Yuu, for example: The first episode introduces him as a character brimming with personality. He\u2019s intelligent, arrogant, devilish, etc. These are traits that at the very least gave him a personality and the potential for development. However, as soon as the ED played at the end of episode one, everything about him that was established in that first episode is COMPLETELY forgotten. Never again does he exhibit any of traits that supposedly define him. He instantaneously turns into literally Otanashi; A boring bland, personality-less nobody which is pretty much the worst thing a character can be. Did they really think that we wouldn\u2019t notice if they stopped giving him individuality after a single episode? It\u2019s either a laughable oversight or an attempt to trick the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t much to say about the rest of the cast; they are either completely indistinguishable or defined entirely by traits/quirks. There is one in particular I will go over though just so I can talk about how terrible the romance in this anime is: Nao. Nao is Yuu\u2019s love interest which is a big problem for one simple reason: They fail to demonstrate so much as a single iota of chemistry or personal connection with each other at all. Rather than gradually growing together, we are instantaneously told that they are in love! No no no writers: that\u2019s cheating. You can\u2019t just skip all the necessary steps of a good romance and expect us to buy it. Seriously, what intimate moments did they ever share together? I can even recall a scene where Yuu watched Nao get brutally beaten by a mob with complete indifference, as he did nothing to even attempt to assist her. What a pair. This romance is so laughable that when a love confession is finally made, the other character remarks in a surprised/confused fashion \u201cI don\u2019t think there was ever a time for you to think favorably of me.\u201d I mean\u2026 That pretty much hits the nail on the head. I don\u2019t think there was either.\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t even gotten to how shitty the plot of this show is and the reasons why it didn\u2019t even remotely work. First of all, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Being a show about superpowers, it\u2019s obvious that plotholes are going to emerge from characters not using certain powers at certain times or in certain ways, but to THIS extent? You will pull your hair out trying to count how many times a situation that could have been easily resolved through superpowers is treated as a legitimate conflict. Every cardinal sin of story telling is present in Charlotte: Dues ex machine, plotholes, asspulls, you name it. It\u2019s some of the worst melodrama to ever be animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe second big issue with the plot is the remarkably inconsistent tone and its total inability to incorporate elements of both comedy and tragedy without being clumsy and awkward. This is a problem that is seriously pervasive in anime as a whole; if you want your dramatic scene to be taken seriously, DON\u2019T IMMEDIATELY PRECEED IT WITH CHILDISH COMEDY! Every time something that is supposed to be taken seriously happens, you better believe a heaping dosage of comic relief is right around the corner. Even scenes involving death can\u2019t keep comedy out of the picture. This form of writing demonstrates an inherent immaturity and lack of understanding of said medium; it\u2019s completely embarrassing and there is no excuse for it. This disturbing pattern NEEDS to disappear from anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I feel the need to especially stress is the god-awful pacing and stupendously rushed nature of Charlotte. If you want an example of how to rush your show so badly that even the most na\u00efve audience members become alienated, watch episode 13 of Charlotte. Seriously; the world needs to see that miserable atrocity and learn from it so that history does not repeat itself. When you could literally turn the events of single episode into a series of its own, maybe spread your material out a little better? I\u2019ve somehow gone multiple paragraphs without mentioning Angel Beats yet again, but this anime has the exact same issue with pacing; it\u2019s very evident that these two shows had the same writer.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Charlotte is one of the worst anime dramas you will ever see. Even Angel Beats with all its flaws is noticeably superior. This rushed, childish, shallow emotion porn cannot be believed by a thinking person; you will literally be taken aback by how many obvious mistakes have been made. The animation and music may be nice, but I do not recommend this anime to anybody unless you want to see how NOT to write a good anime drama.",

            "content": "Charlotte can be described like a Golden Corral buffet table: you come in the hungry and with high expectation, and its packed to the brim with all sorts of things you love and recognize, such as selfish Lelouch esque protagonist, the reality of Chuunibyou, the (attempted) feels and moe of Clannad, the humor of Angel Beats!, a Kokoro Connecty set-up, siscom, time-travel, tsundere, yandere, super powers, Slice of Life, light-gore, pop idol songs, love confessions, etc. You read right; this show has yandere characters. This show is packed to the brim with cool motifs, but you're only able to leave with a sick feeling ofregret post-binge. As you\u2019ve probably heard countless times, Charlotte has a wicked concept, stellar OP, and is headed by the people who brought you Angel Beats! and Clannad. If you were like me and didnt know that before picking up Charlotte but instead only thought 'Hey that sysnopsis seems super cool, lets do this', well needless to say you will know by the end where Charlotte is coming from and whats its going for.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I didn't go into Charlotte knowing its creators, but I have seen and tend to like both Angel Beats! and Clannad. That being said, there were a number of times in which I felt treated to with a few nods to those shows. But then those 'slight nods' began to become outright recycling of Key's old content. Especially I'm talking about the baseball episode. What is their obsession of everything being settled by baseball in anime? Sure, it was cool and fresh in Angel Beats! and Clannad, but this is the third series of theirs (and like the fifth series total) I've seen in which the main characters have to join a baseball league in order to settle some sort of dispute. Would it really be that hard for them to play one of the hundreds of other sports related games so we would at least be treated to new content? And then there is the whole camping episode, which is again something reused from Angel Beats with the fishing scene. Or the dongos Yu eats. And the pop idol set up and music inclusion. Plus the whole getting locked in a bunker deal. Kidnappings. Etc. The argument here isn't that the entirety of Charlotte is just re-purposed Angel Beats!/Clannad material, but there's so much of Charlotte that doesn't come across as original that it starts to lose its own identity as a show.\\n\\n\r\nBut when Charlotte is establishing itself, it does so through sucker punches to your chest that knock the entire show off its feet. Episodes 1-6 are standard anime fare almost to the point of being episodic, very little happening that strengthens the characters relationships to each other but instead showcasing what the set-up is 'going to be', to the point that there were a couple times I sat there wondering exactly what the point of the show was if nothing was really progressing. That was until a certain twist delivered at the end of the sixth episode that changes the entire set-up, and making it at least moderately understandable what was being built into with the first half of the show. The issue with this though is that it's a double edged sword; as major of a shift as it is, it doesn't necessarily defend the wasted potential of the whole first half. Because, instead of capitalizing on said shift and making it important, Charlotte decides to resolve said conflict within a single episode just about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's a major problem I have with this show; nearly every single conflict or problem that is brought up is resolved within the confines of the episode it is presented. Take the episodic nature of the first half: Yu gets up, has breakfast with his sister for bonding purposes, goes to school, stares at Nao, 'Such a turn off!', gets lunch with his boyfriend, gets called to the student council, they go off on a mission, does something Angel Beast! esque, they complete \u2018ability of the week\u2019 quest, Yu goes home, has more sister bonding time, role credits. Never is a conflict presented here that roles over into another episodes, besides maybe Nao\u2019s older brother, and even an instance in which Nao is group tortured is never really explained or fleshed out, and merely serves to further bond Yuu and Nao, albeit poorly done. Even the major shift of episode 7 is resolved by its completion, with very few repercussions following, which was HUGE wasted potential, but more on that later. Then, the next beat down is delivered within episode nine, in which a SECOND major shift is made, though this one not an emotional but a physical change to the status of the world of Charlotte. Unfortunately, even this is resolved by episode 10, the ending of which left me literally wondering \"Okay now what?\" since there wasn't anything set up for them to worry about. Episode 11 brings around an entirely new foe right at the end of the series that literally has no name and is finished off by the episode\u2019s end, while episode 12 takes place entirely in one single setting. None of this is truly spoilery information, as none of these situations are foreshadowed very well, if at all in the beginning segments of Charlotte. Instead, it comes across as if the creators simply made up whatever came to mind episode to episode to episode, choosing to throw in a little gore here and a little romance there whenever it felt like, and none of its singular pieces coming together to create a well unified whole.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh, speaking of holes; this show contains more plot holes than swiss cheese, and less originality than my jokes. Mid-season time travel is thrown in, of all things! But make no mistake; this is no Steins; Gate. So massive is this plot bumbling that an entire thread in the forum is dedicated to pointing such instances out. Even in casual watching, without committing to being overly critical, it was hard to stomach some instances in which the characters would present very thin reasoning as undeniable fact. Take, for instance, the episode in which they enlist a character named Yusarin. The reason this pop icon is being forced into hiding is because she someone got a hold of an executives phone and read some confidential texts on it. This is all that is said on the subject, and is largely accepted by the other characters in the show. Now: why on this heavenly earth did she pick up this guys phone, unlock it, read his messages, and then take his phone with herself (as she is still in possession of it until the episodes end)? How is that a normal thing to happen? But this level of Suspension of Disbelief is only a mere shadow as to what is expected. Without spoiling anything, I can still make the point that Yu having memories from a past, now no-existent self, goes both totally unexplained and is downright preposterous, besides just being impossible. Yet another instance that goes 100% unexplained, but instead is just waived as a \u2018Mysterious coincidence\u2019. I\u2019m not going to spend the rest of this review listing every such unbelievable instance in Charlotte, but trust me when I say they exist in such blatant amounts that it\u2019s hard to miss. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, on a whole, so much of Charlotte goes unexplained that you just sort of have to fill in all the holes yourself, or watch purely for entertainment purposes, without connection to the charecters. You may think to yourself that situations presented early on will be addressed by the finale, but instead, most of what happens within each episode fails to get mentioned later, and the ending is, while mildly interesting, a full deus ex cop-out write in for the entire arc of the conflict. It literally poses the most bombastic solution possible to the overall issue to the show, and condenses a sequence of events that could have been an entire anime unto itself into a single episode. Actually, that may have been a more interesting story...\\n\\n\r\nAnd all this wouldn\u2019t be a problem if there was at least some sort of overall message to it all, some well-timed character development, or valiant theme, but instead, the entire series is just a rushed stream of consciousness by the creators, with a smorgasbord of characters who either serve only as comic-relief or canon-fodder, and no emotional depth outside of a few shocks here or there. When supposedly major characters are only introduced at the final quarter of the series, there really is no hope at delivering a cohesive whole.\\n\\n\r\n*MAJOR SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nThe largest issue of the series comes from how they treat Ayumi\u2019s death. Not the fact that she did die, but no, the fact that she was allowed to come BACK. Her death was, if anything, at least added much needed interest to the series, and I was ready for the next six or seven episodes to be Yuu\u2019s struggle to come back from that grief, with the help of his friends and maybe other ability users, and a cleaner handle on character development. Instead, within three episodes, she\u2019s just resurrected from the dead, and its all good. How is that even allowed? Where is the emotional depth of her sacrifice now? Because when someone dies in real life, they\u2019re dead. The end. You don\u2019t get a go-back and redo everything just because your mystery brother could go back in time. I wanted it to be a choice for him, either to save her, or not to, and leave reality like it was. Instead, the anime expects you to just accept that even death isn\u2019t deep enough for this anime to overcome. Is there no respect to the dead? They could have at least made the second half like his failed attempts at trying to save her, eventually going blind from futility, and Nao being the one to bring him back to earth yet again, fully realizing their relationship. Instead, they squandered the entire second half for some terrorism plot and a confession less sturdy and emotionally moving than a pan of strawberry jello.\\n\\n\r\n*END OF MAJOR SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nMy ending point is the fact that Charlotte is an anime of massive wasted potential. Though I do like Key works, romances, and all the things put into Charlotte (the fact they went with such a selfish protagonist was a strong introduction say the least), they just come out in a garbled mess that looks pretty but tastes confusing and awful.",

            "content": "Oh Charlotte, where did we go so wrong? You looked like you\u2019d be an interesting story revolving around students coping with super powers but instead you offered up a story with about as much direction as a goldfish with Alzheimer\u2019s. The anime packed a tonne of ideas and characters into too small a space and it started to burst at the seams. Charlotte, from the mind of writer Jun Maeda and put to screen by P.A. Works, promised a lot. Script writer Maeda looked to address the pacing problems prevalent in his earlier work Angel Beats and deliver a similar emotional \u2018punch\u2019 at the sametime. By some phenomenal fluke he actually managed to make a bigger meal of it in both areas. I\u2019m not even mad. I\u2019m impressed.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s such a huge disappointment that not enough time is dedicated towards any of Charlotte\u2019s characters to help hammer home its more emotional set pieces. Time that could have been spent towards developing the cast is instead wasted on repetitive unfunny gags, irrelevant side stories and ridiculous new elements thrown into the narrative like it was some afterthought. Charlotte sets off in first gear as it lays the groundwork for its story but then it tries to change into fourth gear by ballooning out its cast size with people I don\u2019t even know or care about. It\u2019s an uncomfortable ride. At a certain point the show tries to accelerate ahead with exciting new ideas but instead it stalls, bogged down by pacing which can be called nothing short of atrocious. Charlotte dawdled around and then flashed ahead so quickly I get whiplash thinking about it. With paper-thin characters and an utter mess of a script Charlotte\u2019s journey is unfulfilling, with a destination to match.\\n\\n\r\nYu Otosaka is our main man. We follow him as he starts to abuse his power to briefly take over others\u2019 bodies, both for his own pleasure and his own gain. A boy who acts cocky and lacking in morals, he starts out as a nice change of pace from your standard high-school male lead. His personality came into conflict with a lot of people around him and for a brief period it led to some amusing results. However, Yu\u2019s rebellious nature was at first refreshing but then it became non-existent. It was like a cheap drawcard to the show to have this cocksure lead, only to have him start to behave like \u2018generic high-school lead guy\u2019 within a short space of time. When this darker side of him emerges again later on in the series it actually feels out of character. The story does at least go out of the way to create ambitions and meaningful motivation for him but very little about Yu himself will stick for long in my mind. Nao Tomori is our other major player. A girl with a sharp tongue and unafraid to call things as she sees them, Nao is also an interesting character in the show\u2019s early stages. She catches out Yu abusing his power and shows him a side of the world he didn\u2019t know about. But like Yu she doesn\u2019t go anywhere as our story plays out. Her \u2018cold and disinterested\u2019 shtick gets boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic between the two lead characters is almost non-existent yet the show tries its hardest to use their relationship as a means to drive many parts of the story. Because of that, many of the scenes I watch containing the pair of them feel static. One episode which tries to show a new side of both Yu and Nao actually turned out to have virtually no bearing on the rest of the show. Still, they at least have their role to play in the overarching story and that\u2019s more than what can be said for their classmates Yusa and Joujirou. Yusa is a blonde-haired idol, an occupation that has zero importance to the story other than trying to justify having a cute girl as part of the show. Her power in the show actually had the most potential in terms of leaving an emotional impact on the viewer. But why do that when she can act cutesy and sing songs? In a series where so many characters are trying their hardest to claim the gold medal for wasted potential she might just come out on top. Joujirou spends most of his time on screen being obnoxious and completely useless in the grand scheme of the story. His purpose in Charlotte appears to worshipping the ground Yusa stands on before drowning everyone in the vicinity in his blood that explodes from his nostrils. His moments of \u2018comic relief\u2019 \u2013 please note the inverted commas \u2013 also come at horribly timed moments. These two cast members are just the tip of the iceberg. Not a single supporting character in this show feels valuable.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn\u2019t explore Yu or those closest to him well enough at all. \\n\r\nThere are moments you can almost feel the show begging you \u201cThis is the part where you cry now\u201d and I\u2019m sitting there throwing my hands in the air screaming \u201cWhy should I? I hardly know them\u201d. Heck, there\u2019s even times where it begs you to empathise with someone whose minutes of screen time you could count on one hand. Emotional moments have impact if characters have depth, and depth is something I can find more of in a petri dish than the cast of Charlotte. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when I was being assured by other viewers during the early episodes that there was nothing wrong with the slow pace because Maeda was clearly \u2018saving up for something\u2019 and taking his time to develop the cast. Once our lead quartet was introduced, not only were the initial episodes repetitive in their structure but they weren\u2019t even entertaining. A lot of them revolve around the exploration of these super powers, such as their limits and the way others use them. That\u2019s absolutely fair as a form of short exposition but I was at my wits end by the time this phase of the show finally drew to a close. You ended up viewing episodes whose entire purpose it was to later on have some cheap moment of meaning at the series\u2019 end, not actually help maintain your interest in the story at its current point. Then, at a point later on, it just explodes with more characters who steal more screen time from our original bunch. It\u2019s a mess.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done Charlotte is hampered in many areas. The start is repetitive, the middle feels redundant and the ending is packed with conveniences. Maeda is definitely a man of ambition and cool ideas but I\u2019d really like to see him make something minus the comic relief, better build up and a story that involves more of its cast. The story of Charlotte itself is interesting on paper but the way is what put to screen is incredibly underwhelming. \\n",

            "content": "I was (mildly) hyped for this show.\r\nI kept watching it thinking the next episode was going to be really good, and I almost got it with the last a couple minutes of a certain episode making me really hyped for the next one.\r\nAnd here we are, all wrapped up, and with my score, you can probably tell what I thought of it.\r\nThe story for Charlotte is dreadful, being plagued by inconsistencies, with minimal character development, and most of the development is reverted anyway so who cares at this point. Nothing even happens in term of story progression or character development for the first, I don'teven know, 8(?) episodes. If there's any indication as to how poorly thought out the story was, the show's namesake was literally only mentioned in a brief 1 minute scene more than halfway through the show and then almost never talked about again for the entire show. The pacing of the show is awful too, this show could've easily been 6 episodes if they trimmed all the garbage filler, and they could've told a much better story in the same amount of time if they redistributed the events to make the mood shift of the show around the 4th episode, with the last episode of the show being spread throughout the last 3 or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's one redeeming factor is that it looks okay. The music is really generic japanese stuff. Neither are the spectacular, and are about what you've come to expect from a slice of life. I thought the Engrish was amusing at the beginning, but it became increasingly more annoying to listen to as the show progressed and probably ruined any chance of me being amused by VAs attempting to speak English in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, as a result of having no development, are entirely one-dimensional and predictable, especially the side characters who are introduced for 5 minutes and convey their intent about as well as an LA Noire character, so by about the halfway point, you could pretty much guess verbatim what's going to happen. However, despite being completely predictable, they are incredibly inconsistent, and this is where my point earlier about reverted character development comes into play. Although, you can predict exactly what happens, characters will, very often, do the most random things, then quickly revert back to how they were before and do exactly what you predicted what happen with no consequences at all, so it just leads to pointless filler.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I'm not even sure if I want a second season so that they might learn where they messed up and try to make it good because this show had a lot of potential.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this show was disgusting and insulting. They added in forced feels at the most random times, for characters that were quite literally introduced in the same episode so you feel no attachment to them, in addition to random moe garbage and humor, and some stuff that I think was supposed to be deep and philosophical but really made no sense, and they just expected the viewers of this show to be stupid enough and lap it all up. Charlotte is a show that's clearly made by the books to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and could even pass as an insulting satire mocking the anime industry and its viewers.",

            "content": "Well this is my first review so if anyone notices an orography mistake, punctuation mistake, etc, i hope you can tell me so i can improve. Now im ready!\r\nWhen i heard about key making a new anime i was excited up to the roof,  when the show charlotte started i grabbed my laptop lock myself in my room and wait for the tears to come but... that didnt happened.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nWell i thought the concept of the story was perfect, the ideas of diseases of superpowers that they only last during adolescence it blow my mind. But the idea that the serie it was onlygoing to last 13 episodes long i knew it was going to rush the things at the end. Well my friends without spoiling you the last episode was a huge rush for me. The last 5 minutes were beutiful, but i thought it can have another chapter or even better other 11 episodes. The lack of tears in my face made me feel insatisfactory, i dont know if the way i watched the anime 1 episode per week affected my attachement to the anime's emotions. I think that if you want to get a better experience of the serie you have to watch it all in a day, maybe two.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art was sublime... There were mounts and mounts of backgrounds; gorgeous backgrounds, cities, cliffs, deserts, etc. The art disdnt dissapoint me at all, I really thought it was good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nIm just saying half of the music is going straight to my ipod.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe main character changed throgh the serie such as the secondary characters, something that i thought \"wow not in every anime happends this\" The begging of the anime shows us a maniac of power protagonist and at the end shows us a kind and heroic character. The secondaries for me were the best *cof* *cof* yusarin my wifu *cof* *cof*. And i dont wanna get started with Tomori!!! She is perfect from the mature and motionless way she acted to the kind and patient she was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI looked every single episode on the day it came out, and at the end of it i wanted to skip time to next saturday. My 2015 favorite!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nSince i thought it was a little rushed the last episode i didnt feel putting a 10 to the anime but i think if they split the last episode into 2 and i dont know maybe posting them all at once (just kidding) it would be a 10 for me. I highly recommend this anime been watch all in a day so you dont get the feeling of insatisfaction like i do. \\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoy this review... it was made with all the love of my kokoro",

            "content": "I started watching charlotte after I saw one of the scene in the meme. The sheer number of negative remarks lead me to write this review and also because how much I liked it. Now It got me hooked right from the start, that ability with the person with that attitude. I think most people, if not everyone, would use the ability protagonist has any differently than he did, which made him relatable. \r\nThis is the first anime in a long time that I have watched where I didn't disliked the main protagonist. Nobody blushes as much as other drama anime. I couldn't guess whatcould happen next. First few episode are most likely forgotten by how the remaining part goes on. While that may not be good thing, last episodes are has more impact and a really satisfying ending, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow as I said, after ep 6 or so we learn more and more about the story and why the anime is named what it is named. while some may say the story gets more deviated, personally I liked it very much. I don't get much time to watch anime lately so its been a while since I could watch anime of this sort and the development of story was really interesting for me.\\n\r\nThe ending was really satisfying too. I was thinking that story can't be wrapped that quickly and believed ep 12 to be a good ending but as I watched the last episode and learned that the anime is contained and concluded within ep 13, and in a really better way, it really deserved the 10 I gave it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you like surprises and know nothing of what happens in this anime on later episodes, it is going to be delightful to watch, since it doesn't go as expected, But that is my opinion, may be I am easily amused, but I like it and would recommend this to my friend\\n",

            "content": "The way I look at Charlotte is like a show that started off buzzing with potentially well-thought ideas. Then as time went on, it really crashed and burned. Like almost pouring rice. \r\nCharlotte, an original show conceived by Jun Maeda, is a series made by Aniplex and P.A. Works. The series takes place in a world where a small percentage of people manifest supernatural powers. While this hardly sounds original, Charlotte does have a unique presence with its characters. Yuu Otosaka, a first year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, developed his ability to possess others temporarily and made himself a fake academic honor student. The firstepisode establishes himself as a narcissistic individual who uses his powers for personal gains. \\n\\n\r\nNow, this actually sounds kind of like a neat idea. The ability to possess others can really have a dominating effect especially for someone like Yuu. Early episodes establish him using this ability with some dangerous risks. That is until we have a girl named Nao Tomori who catches Yuu using his ability and forces him to join the student council in order to help others with these unique abilities. Like Yuu though, Nao also shows a narcissistic side of herself and for some reason lacks female friends. A good portion of Charlotte shows her using a camera filming events around her life. Joining them includes Jojiro Takajo, a boy who can apparently move at supersonic speed, and Yusa Nishimori, a popular idol singer who can channel the dead. As part of the early phases, the show takes on a slice of life focus. Every episode essentially shows the members of the student council use their ability to help others and prevent troublemakers from causing chaos. This sometimes comes at high risk as some abilities can be quite dangerous. And as such, the show maintains a somewhat dark side with some minor foreshadowing. Furthermore, we are also introduced to Yuu\u2019s little sister Ayumi, who is like an energetic light bulb that can brighten anyone\u2019s day; figuratively of course. \\n\\n\r\nWith a small cast of main characters such as this, Charlotte essentially had a good story going. Yes, some of the episodes feels like distractions that incorporate generic school life activities such as baseball or outdoor camping trips. However, the show originally maintained a cool level of comedy. It can make the viewer laugh such as with Joiro\u2019s over-exaggerated expressions of his obsession towards Yusa. Ayumi can also be likable at times with her bright personality that seemingly has some influences towards others. Everything originally was standard and then, trouble hits.\\n\\n\r\nI guess it shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise. Jun Maeda is known for his involvement in Key related works. These include Kanon, Air, and Clannad. Some recurring themes include family values, magical realism, and his intention to draw tears from the viewers with emotional scenarios. So here for Charlotte, it really isn\u2019t much of a surprise that there\u2019s a familiar trend. The first few episodes sets up a lot of fun and actually works hand in hand. Then, the second half of the show kicks into a darker tone with the story. And to be quite frank honest, it feels like the show got possessed. It turns into a series that forcefully tries to draw out emotional impact starting with Yuu\u2019s depression. There is a good reason for this but the transitional direction of his character really is an oddball. Furthermore, Yuu\u2019s role becomes somewhat like a savior to protect a certain someone. It\u2019s like Yuu almost became another person as the story progresses. The turning point of the series makes Yuu look like a hero but is really one? Honestly no. In fact, Yuu is more of the anti-hero and without a certain person\u2019s help, I fear what he really may become. The recurring themes written by Jun Maeda comes into full hold as we get alternate worlds, timelines, and loops. And in general, the show changes way too much for its own good. A major problem I found throughout the latter half of the story is the numerous plot holes that appears out of nowhere. Furthermore, there are the continuous jokes that becomes apparently blend after seeing it so many times. The mood of the story constantly changes from one point to another that eventually becomes almost intolerable. It\u2019s also fairly predictable and has some fairly anti-climactic resolutions to problems. Despite this, I do give Charlotte some credit for taking the risk. I think the show is more suited for certain audiences that appreciates the writing style of Jun Maeda. Otherwise, Charlotte will take some enormous patience especially to get answers to wanted questions. These include the meaning of Charlotte, how Yuu\u2019s relationship with others changes, and what true essence of some of the characters\u2019 powers are. As with I mentioned earlier on, there\u2019s a strong uphold about family values that is easily carved out with Yuu and Ayumi\u2019s relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of relationships, the most noticeable one is probably Yuu and Nao throughout the series. In several ways, they are similar but hard to get along. Yuu\u2019s change builds a more stable relationship with her as time goes on. However, when it comes to love or romance, the series drops the ball. You\u2019ll have to see it for yourself but it\u2019s something that\u2019s easily forgettable. That also brings back to my earlier problems with the show. Some of the characters establishes their presence such as Zhiend\u2019s singer but are later seemingly forgotten. There could have been a more meaningful relationship that they can forge and leave viewers to remember for. Instead, too many things happen at once and the final few episodes really seems like it\u2019s trying to fit everything into a box. Yuu\u2019s attempt to become some sort of savior makes me feel like he really isn\u2019t suitable for the job. And lastly, I think the glasses guy (Tokajo) and Yusa\u2019s relevance in the series slipped like sands of an hourglass. Of course, their relationship hardly moved an inch. \\n\\n\r\nNow I will say this. Charlotte makes its name and presence known with its high level production values. Once again, we see the colorful style of P.A. Works\u2019 characters and a few of the scenes in the show can be described as scenery porn. While the character designs are usually generic, the powers themselves holds a dominating presence. Yuu\u2019s ability to possess others is heightened by the way the art is done with his eyes while there\u2019s also neat camera focuses of characters\u2019 facial expressions. The OP and ED theme song has a mystical presence that invests on its show\u2019s themes and foreshadowing. As such, the cinematography and overall animation for Charlotte is exceptional and is something to remember.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a show mixes in comedy and tragedy, you\u2019ll need to transit both with a fitting way to match the presentation. While not as strong as its artwork, Charlotte\u2019s soundtrack works well on most parts. Dialogues matches with character voice mannerisms and the OST in general is easy to keep up with depending on the shift of the tone. For voice mannerism itself, the characters are represented in a tolerable way whether it\u2019s Yuu\u2019s narcissism, Ayumi\u2019s hyperactive energy, Yusa\u2019s charming personality, or even her other self, who is almost a complete opposite of Yusa\u2019s character. The show also retains some musical themes as introduced in later episodes although the songs can be questionably enjoyable. For all other things though, Charlotte\u2019s soundtrack is satisfactory without breaking the limits.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is pretty much a show that is hard to accept. I think taking Charlotte for granted for what it is originally was easier for some people but as the story progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to tolerate. This is evidenced by its sharp turn in characterization, story mood changes, and reused ideas coming from Jun Maeda. As a show that tries far too hard to induce drama or tear-jerking moments, it really didn\u2019t succeed in such a way. Now I will admit though, Charlotte\u2019s comedy can make the fans laugh a bit and the premise can seem to be interesting. The first few episodes were really fun to watch and although had a plotless direction focused well on what it is. Just be aware that the second half of the show will take a drastic change and whether you like it or not, it\u2019s hard to adapt with. And honestly, that\u2019s a certain kind of blunder.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nYou find it strange that a line is missing for the ride, but you chalk it up to luck. At some point, you find the lone worker, his nametag reading J.M. He instructs you to climb the ladder before you, with you more than willing to do so. J.M. smiles and waves you off, and you climb.\r\nThe climb was quick because of how thrilling it was along the way. You are now at the top, with you overlooking the entire park. A sign says to sit down on the platform. At first, you wonder why thereis no seat and no seatbelt, but then the ride starts. From behind, you feel a push. You start to roll forward down a ramp. It is not pleasant but it is at least tolerable. Thankfully the incline is not steep, so you are not rolling fast. You start to develop bumps and bruises, thinking that this is some kind of experimental ride.\\n\\n\r\nThen, suddenly, you start to fall down steps. You start to hear bones snap as the hard edges of the stairs jut into your limbs. The stairs are made of wood, so your bruises start to scrape and then bleed. You start to panic, wanting off this wild ride, wishing that your parents had said no like they always did. At the same time, the steepness starts to increase, speeding you up at intermittent intervals.\\n\\n\r\nJust before you cannot take any more, you are in freefall. You believe that it is over, that a trampoline will cushion your landing. But it does not. Instead, you land on a landmine, blowing your arms clean off. The steep steps continue, except now that you have no arms the angular velocity of your person increases, forcing you to shut your eyes lest the spinning-induced nausea makes you vomit. With each new step, you lose a tooth, and with every other new step, you lose a memory, the repeated impacts putting you in and out of consciousness.\\n\\n\r\nYou cannot tell who is what or what is where. And just when you cannot take any more for the second time, you land on a massive spike, impaling your chest, your insides now your outsides. Your breathing is sporadic and splinters have sewed your right eye shut. So with the last of your strength, you raise your left eyelid to discover the name of the ride you just rode. There, in white letters with a comet here and a swooping star there, it reads: Charlotte.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is a poor excuse for an anime, and nowhere is that more evident than in the narrative it attempts to construct. A slew of problems plague it, sickening each of its areas to the point that no remedy available could possibly cure its ailments. From inconsistencies in the plot to the minutiae of the writing, the show is kept bedridden, prevented from performing at an acceptable level. It is a downhill tumble down a mountain, dwindling the health of the show and leading to its inevitable death.\\n\\n\r\nLike any descent, it is best to start at the summit. The first episode of Charlotte is quite well-done. While the \u201chigh school kids with superpowers\u201d is an overused formula, it managed to establish its setting in an interesting manner, placing the abilities and the main character in a negative light. The negativity, the intriguing side cast, and the supposed theme of self-correction poised the show as something grand. Then the problems start.\\n\\n\r\nThe most prevalent problem of Charlotte is the pacing. Pacing is the spacing of events \u2013 the more that goes on in a short amount of time, the faster the pacing and vice versa. For most shows, pacing is not a detriment so long as it is neither too fast nor too slow. It needs to rest in the Goldilocks region to maintain a leveled approach and keep its plot from careening out of control. Charlotte, however, effectively murders the golden-hair invader and dumps the molten porridge over her lifeless body. The anime transitions from tolerably slow to whiplashing the audience as it continuously ramps up the speed of the pacing. Yuu\u2019s mental breakdown is the first sign \u2013 a high school student to a might-as-well-be drug addict over the course of a couple of weeks or so. Time travel is introduced shortly after. Terrorists follow, with the finale of the anime cramming together a literal worldwide, person-to-person vacation. The events are not illogical or even uninteresting but they happen so fast and so often that it becomes a disconnected smorgasbord of scenarios rather than a connected grouping of instances.\\n\\n\r\nPacing speaks nothing of the actual events themselves, which are arguably worse. Many of the plot lines or plot points within Charlotte either lead to dead ends or are forgotten about entirely, both usually the byproduct of the aforementioned pacing. Nao\u2019s older brother receives a resolution halfway through the season, only to never be mentioned again. The lead singer of \u201cZhiend\u201d serves as a trigger to push events forward, but has no spot in the narrative beyond her final song. Ayumi\u2019s resolution is overly clean, with her likewise tossed on the wayside after her conflict is taken care of. When this or any anime does this, it causes the plot to feel disconnected, therefore reducing its cohesiveness and subsequently the strength of its narrative. Interestingly the show did take advantage of its own plot developments at times \u2013 having his original girlfriend appear and try to help him out of his rut demonstrates the show\u2019s awareness of its own material. But the majority of the time, the anime exists in the former camp, cumulative fragments that turn the plot into an indiscernible mess.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte\u2019s mess continues in other areas, specifically dealing with the writing itself. Again, to be fair, the anime does have its moments \u2013 Nao telling each of the earlier ability users to never use their abilities again to maintain the ruse against Yuu was clever. But a large amount of its other moments do not live up to even half of this execution. For example, Yusa\u2019s \u201cspells\u201d are a comedic gag that treads into overused territory, the same reactions occurring every time. Also the time travel reveal, which is little more than a huge exposition dump. Worse still is the hospital visits near the end, where a series of characters appears one after another to make up for spending so little time on them in the first place. It leads to repetition and in most cases a distinct lack of purpose since each subsequent event is supposed to build off of the previous ones. But because the previous events are so weak due to a combination of the poor pacing, unused plot points, and the stagnant writing, the shaky tower they create is never capable of standing upright.\\n\\n\r\nThis trifecta sees its lowest point during episode eleven, now infamous for being absolutely asinine. The character whose family was conveniently taken hostage, Shun having never known of this character\u2019s extended family despite countlessly time travelling, and Yuu going to the warehouse alone despite the group tailing him moments later are more than enough to constitute a failed narrative. The entire confrontation was not even about Nao, the terrorists, or even Pooh; the whole point was to remove the time travel variable from the equation. Any other situation could have been chosen yet the show decided on this one for a reason, the reason being to avenge Pooh and to \u201cpayback\u201d Nao. But both bonds are not exactly taut: the former he barely knew and the latter he had always butted heads with no signs of affection. In other words, Yuu\u2019s inspiration was likewise lax. So while not entirely representative of the anime, this episode made it evident how broken the show truly was.\\n\\n\r\nHalfway through the descent, Charlotte has already broke but it does not stop hitting itself. Another issue is the title of the show, which is irrelevant. The comet it is named after is never seen or, perhaps obviously, never used throughout. It is simply mentioned as the source of the strange particle or virus that causes the people to gain the abilities. Granted it might be unimportant; the actual comet means nothing in the grand scheme of things, moving the attention away from it and to the abilities it technically contains.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, that would be the argument if it did keep attention on its abilities. Instead, one of the show\u2019s biggest focal points is confusingly ignored. Besides \u201cinvisible\u201d \u2013 which gets used a lot earlier \u2013 and \u201cplunder\u201d \u2013 which gets used a lot later \u2013 abilities often go severely underutilized, appearing only a handful of times. Some hardly get used at all \u2013 the opening episodes contain abilities that, once stolen, are used to a minimal extent. The time travel is even purposely prevented from being used. Charlotte\u2019s finale also follows this trend: Yuu plundered thousands of abilities, but no more than ten were shown. To play devil\u2019s advocate, similar to the comet the abilities might not even be the point of the anime. If space rocks and superpowers are not what the anime is about, then something else must be.\\n\\n\r\nThis is when the bottom of the mountain is reached because there is no point to Charlotte; there is no thematic presence. It never centers on one specific notion, with a fairytale ending of \u201cliving happy lives from now on\u201d when they had been doing that (or trying to) from the beginning. There might be something about never giving up even in the face of ridiculous adversity, but the use of abilities makes this a moot point since the abilities lessen the adversity considerably. One might also argue that the show is about having and pursuing goals. Nao fighting to save others to have them avoid a fate like her brother\u2019s, Yuu plundering everyone to earn a romantic relationship, and Shun time traveling to the point of blindness to protect his family and other \u201cability-wielders\u201d (as they call them) showcase how a goal motivates and pushes people to do the impossible. But since Nao\u2019s and Shun\u2019s dreams fall on Yuu, and Yuu\u2019s own goal is lost, this theme loses merit as well.\\n\\n\r\nThus, after falling down a mountain while crashing into rocks formed of horrible pacing, weak writing, and nonexistent themes, Charlotte\u2019s narrative lands at the bottom, perishing in the process.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIf Charlotte does anything correct, it is in regards to its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself is vibrant, with locations varying. Schools, parks, and warehouses are featured, each filled with details that make them realistic in their presentations, appropriate for the realistic setting. Lighting is nuanced, with sunlight and fixtures casting shadows and shine where needed. Camera angles are likewise well-done, with low shots, up-close shots, and landscape ones constantly shuffled through to give the show a dynamic feel. Other tricks, like reflections in mirrors and rippling water, demonstrate the anime\u2019s regard for its visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the abilities, when they are used, is also interesting. Invisible has a rainbow sheen combined with transparency, plunder makes Yuu\u2019s eyes go green, and \u201ccollapse\u201d causes the wielder to glow and essentially explode. A distinction for each ability is given \u2013 telekinesis has a purple outline, disintegration has a sparkly effect, and combustion produces flames \u2013 that makes each come off as unique as they are.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the character designs dip in execution. Many are rather plain: Yuu, Joujirou, and Ayumi, to name a few. Nao as well, but for her, her deep blue eyes and white hair contrast, coinciding with her outward cuteness and inward abrasiveness. Surprisingly it is Yusa\u2019s older sister that has the best design. Her orange hair, red outfit, and ruby-colored eyes are a perfect fit for her fiery personality. Similar to episode eleven, she might be an outlier, but she showed where they could have gone had the designs refrained from being so plain.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation mirrors the art, staying consistently high throughout the season. Even disregarding the abilities, characters walk, flail, and react in nearly all situations, standing still for natural lengths of time. Alongside moving background objects, ruffling hair, and shattering glass, the anime always keeps its parts going, giving the show much needed strength.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nJust when Charlotte starts to climb back up the mountain with its art and animation, it quickly falls down again when its cast is investigated thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nInvestigating the side cast first is simple since the majority of them are either missing characterization, development, or purpose, sometimes a combination of the three. Joujirou, the Yusa-obsessed man in glasses, has that to his name alone. He is a huge fan of a pop star. Nothing else is learned or given about him past a certain point since the anime decided to ditch him to focus on the latter half of the show \u2013 Shun, time traveling, and world plundering. Yusa is arguably worse; she can sing and dance, her bubbly behavior allowing her to befriend anyone. But the development she receives is shoved into the span of a few minutes rather than throughout the season with her older sister visiting her family to eat food and her older sister writing her a letter. That is to say, while she does receive development, it is arguably worse than having none at all since what she was given was so lazy and lame.\\n\\n\r\nLaziness and lameness are also found in Ayumi and Shun who oppose each other in a negative sense. Ayumi is the little sister, her adorableness and worrying attitude acting as a rock for Yuu. Plus, her pizza sauce skills know no bounds. She was poised to be a worthwhile character for the rest of the cast to connect with, but similar to Joujirou, following her death avoidance her presence diminishes nearly entirely. The worst part, though, is that this ruins her relationship with Yuu, which was a major driving force for his character. Shun is on the opposite side of the spectrum. The older brother, he was introduced late, so very little is known about him besides his friendship with Pooh, and even then the audience does not get enough of the two together to understand how connected they were. Meaning when Pooh dies, Shun\u2019s breakdown does not have the necessary emotions established with the viewer to let them feel his plight. Furthermore, and opposite to Ayumi, Shun\u2019s relationship with Yuu has no weight not because they stop focusing on it but because they never focused on it to begin with. Not during flashbacks and not during the present, either. Shun even purposefully hid himself from Yuu to keep Yuu out of harm\u2019s way, meaning a relationship of any kind would not have the chance to exist. So when Shun gets emotional with Yuu or vice versa, once again the effect is not as strong as it portrays itself.\\n\\n\r\nMoving beyond the side cast of Joujirou, Yusa, Ayumi, and Shun are Nao and Yuu, arguably the worst characters of the anime considering the proportion of on-screen time and development they undergo. Nao is a seemingly distraught person. She lost her family at an early age and she is bullied in school (questionable, since it only happens once and is never touched on again). As a result, she trusts and believes in almost nobody, keeping people away to stop herself from losing anyone ever again. This explains why she uses a camcorder: she places an obstacle between her and the world, treating the world with the same distance as she does people. It is clear that she is someone who is afraid of connecting with others, a person in need of help. She has traits that would supposedly see change, but she never gets it. As the leader of the group, she has to act as such, never exposing her faulty interior. During more private moments, she cracks slightly but only to the point that her emotions evaporate. Taking a step back and looking at the season altogether reveals that Nao never truly had the spotlight all to herself, so she never could progress past her problems. The ending tries to instill the idea that she has changed for the better \u2013 that she will start using her camcorder to record \u201chappy everyday life\u201d \u2013 but it literally occurs within the last minute of the show, indicating how much of a failed character she is.\\n\\n\r\nBut the worst character is undoubtedly Yuu for one reason: passiveness. Yuu, like the first episode, starts off really strong, a troubled person who was extremely full of himself. But after the first episode, he is sidelined, Nao, Joujirou, and Yusa taking center stage with Yuu making a comment or two here and there. The focus then shifts to Ayumi and Sara (the lead singer of \u201cZhiend\u201d). Here, Yuu does not so much develop as he becomes an entirely different person, with the outcome having him go back to square one. The focus shifts once more to Shun, where both sides of his conflict use Yuu as a pawn. The final episode is the first instance where Charlotte puts Yuu at the forefront of its happenings. But as it was during Ayumi\u2019s death, he becomes an entirely different person that has no relation to his earlier self, with this outcome even worse since he regresses not back to square one but to square zero. Sympathy is not possible since it is \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d to care about or have feelings towards him since he was relegated to being a side character for the majority of the show. In short, passiveness did him in.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, themes for characters are passive in a way, since they are at the mercy of the characters that control them. In order to investigate what message the cast is relaying, their abilities should give the answer because each individual person has a power of their own. Joujirou\u2019s speed makes sense given his overzealous outbursts. Yusa\u2019s dual-self coincides with her normal student and super star status. Shun\u2019s time travel represents his determination and willingness to sacrifice himself for something bigger. Nao\u2019s invisibility makes sense given her loner persona. Yuu\u2019s plundering strangely works since he is a person who has no discernable qualities of his own. Thus, the superficial view is that\u2026people have traits that make them who they are. This is too commonplace and inherent to be a theme. Instead, it could do with uniqueness of traits \u2013 that everyone is different \u2013 but this fails since the abilities of people sometimes overlap \u2013 Pooh\u2019s ability-wielder-finder ability exists in others. It might deal with the abilities themselves; each one has a peculiar caveat attached to them. Joujirou\u2019s speed cannot be controlled, Nao\u2019s invisibility can be applied only to one person at a time, Yuu\u2019s plundering causes him to pass out for five seconds, and so on. So it might be that people are imperfect, that everyone has something about them that is off-kilter. Sadly this does not work as well since the reasoning for the defects is not expounded on, the imperfections a penalty rather than a talking point.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore there is no point. The abilities do not provide a meaningful message, an expected answer since the narrative also proved that the abilities were not what mattered most. Thus the characters are without themes and, coupled with their missing development, are left in dire straits at the bottom of the mountain once more.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is the last strong point of Charlotte. The piano and vocalist are in harmony throughout, creating a hopeful piece, fitting the tone of the anime. The ghostly reverb in the beginning, the quick, soft lyrics in the middle, and the resounding violins in the end combine to make a piece that is simultaneously familiar and otherworldly, once again finding comfort within the confines of the show. The ending theme somewhat counteracts its counterpart, the piece filled mostly with a repetitive middle section despite the strong vocals. The start of the song with its onomatopoeia is a soft lead in to the soft piece, said softness more or less matching Nao\u2019s longing. The guitar, violins, and slow lyrics pad the song further, making it, if nothing else, an alright method of easing the audience out of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is filled with a variety of pieces to fit the occasion. Lots of piano tracks to heighten the somber moments, hard violin pieces to maximize tenseness, and silly sounding instruments to increase the comedy. While the OST is not particularly memorable, it effectively bolsters the scenes it takes part in.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is similar, resting somewhere around average. Kouki Uchiyama as Yuu has a voice that is too old for his character. Plus, his screaming was never convincing. Ayane Sakura as Nao passes due to the incredulity she can include in her speaking to give her that mean yet cute edge. Maaya Uchida as Yusa is the only strong performance, doing the voices for both the younger and the older sister, capturing their personalities nicely through the performances she gives.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI would be lying if I said that the first episode did not impress me. Because it did. Then the rest of the anime happened, and I could not believe how it continued to shoot itself in the foot with each new episode. I did find Nao and Yusa cute and funny, but as individual characters they were so poorly presented that my disappointment nearly cancelled out the laughs. Yuu was a boring main character, Ayumi\u2019s adorableness not being around was a bad move, and Joujirou\u2019s shtick got old quick. None of the characters were engaging enough for me to resonate with, leaving me to simply follow the flow of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI also had no real emotional connection to the anime. I did not cry when Yusa was reading aloud her letter from her older sister, Pooh\u2019s death did not impact me in the slightest, and I did not care for Yuu when he was going rogue or journeying alone. The anime\u2019s events never made me feel anything, thereby reducing the amount of entertainment I got out of it. Still, I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next. I was not invested in the show, but it piqued my interest when Yuu time travelled or set out on his unrealistic adventure.\\n\\n\r\nSomething trivial that ticked me off was the order in which Yuu plundered abilities during his mega journey. The first official one he stole to start it off was Nao\u2019s. It would have been infinitely more poetic to have her be the last one. Yuu fights and travels and steals, surviving as much as he can, until the very end where he finally meets her, with a touching yet heartbreaking reunion. Instead, the last one is some random girl in some random village with Yuu somehow getting hit with arrows despite being the strongest human to have ever lived, and then a helicopter coming down to save him as his arm is outstretched towards Nao\u2019s gift. It is somewhat silly to be mad about this since this is not my anime. However the idea of going full-circle \u2013 starting at the beginning and ending at the beginning \u2013 is powerful narrative-wise, so seeing such a hugely missed opportunity irks me.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte deserves almost no praise. Outside of the art and bits of its music, the anime crashes and burns, its story and characters abysmal in their overall execution. Needless to say, this is one ride that nobody should ever have to endure.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, poor pacing, forgotten plot points, weak writing, irrelevant content, and no extensive thematic presence\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, beautiful art, cool-looking abilities, okay character designs, and above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, Joujirou, Yusa, Shun, Nao, and Yuu are underdeveloped, underused, or both, with their abilities meaning nothing to them or grander themes\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, zero resonance, no emotional connections, and an irking directional decision, yet still interesting enough to follow through to the end\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE*\r\nHere it is. \r\nFor me, Charlotte was a really good work overall. It was probably the best out of the Summer 2015 season, and honestly one of my favorites in my anime experience so far.\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\nSTORY - 8/10\r\nDon't get me wrong, the synopsis sounded so cliche and so boring I didn't actually feel like watching this in the first place - what actually gave me the push to was the poster art (we'll get into that later, anyway) - but it surprised me really much. It had really surprising plots, and the feel you had while watching everything happen, characters showing up, everything, wasn't constant.This story brought not one way to look at it, but uncountable ways to. \\n\\n\r\nART - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I loved the art for this. Charlotte had a great animation and even though this whole art rating thing is personal and differs with people's tastes, I think that's the one thing most people can agree about. What I loved so much about the art, too, was the colors. So, this was this fantasy sci fi piece, with a comet's name and they used a lot of purples and blues and whenever the sky was visible here, it was just gorgeous to look at. That was a great point too - the colors mean a lot to me in a good art.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSome people say there was no character development - well, I don't think like that at all. There was a ton of character development, but it was so fluid and natural to watch, you don't even realize it happening. And I just loved it that way. By the time you finish Charlotte and compare the character's behavior the first and last time you saw them, you realize it. Specially the main character. The main character got a huge change of attitude, that you don't quite realize until half of the series is through. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI hold Charlotte in a really dear place, specially because I felt like there was something more to it. The abilities only teenagers have are some sort of symbol to the troubles of being a teenager: it's tough, it's when you come to terms with yourself and try to realize were you belong. And that was a conclusion I came to personally after thinking about the series as a whole for a bit. \\n\\n\r\nI'd really recommend you to watch this series, but you have to be able to see beyond what's right there and try to get something out of it. That's the best way to do it! (:",

            "content": "I'll have a rant with Charlotte. It deserves it. Why isn't there a zero score for 'story'?\r\nIt is oft repeated that everybody, well not everybody, but many people, had high hopes for Charlotte, and that 'people' includes me in the ranks. It was the first name on my team sheet for the summer season. Such a waste.\r\nIt's also repeated that it started okay and plunged down after a certain point. This plays true to the words, it shot up the horribility scale after about EP8. Everything went wrong. The pacing, the character development. But especially the plot. The believability of that plot. Plot holes aregalore. It's really depressing trying to talk about every one of them. The last episode was especially a huge pile of garbage on that front, which you have to see to believe. How is that even possible? There were too many 'red dots' on one map in one city and too much time taken for him to erase one dot at a time for me to believe any second of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a big problem too. Nao is well-loved and praised, at least round here in my part of the Earth. She is well-designed, no doubt about it. However she plays too little a part in the short and appalling main plot, think about it again, doesn't she? About all the others, well...there are too many come-and-go characters that just slip in, do their part which have wildly varying impacts on the plot, and then vanish with slim explanation on their past or future actions and intentions. Even two 'main characters' in the main party, glasses guy and idol girl, really do nothing to complement the anime outside of giving the odd giggle(or, to put it better, vain attempt at making you giggle) and being a kind of christmas visual decoration. We still don't know virtually anything about them after the end of the last episode. It's impossible to like the character as a moving character that has flesh and blood, even though they're 'main characters'. Ms. Zhiend and Nao's older bro clog up more than one episode of the anime, and the whole of EP8, for literally nothing, as their forced drama is reversed when the MC turns back time. What was the point?\\n\\n\r\nPacing and production, to a lesser extent was also to blame. Look at the flashback scene in EP9 and...It\u2019s really bad. I'll have a moan with the main band Zhiend as well. They're vaguely listenable, but how on earth are they a post-rock band? And why did Maeda try to emphasize that?\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves the art. It's not a masterwork in design and movement, but it's certainly commendable and faults were hard to find in the quality throughout the series. That's it though. It doesn't leave waves of astonishment for that, and is just...a little better than the average anime you get. There's no trying to leave from the tradition neither, everything is standard. Is it better enough than your average 'moe anime' or whatever they call them to cover up its gaping shortcomings in just about every department excepting the art? Nah... it just serves to make this shit look a bit less shit.\\n\\n\r\nThat's Charlotte then for me. I was planning to give this a long, critical mind you, but still long review up until EP11 or something. I lost the remaining love for this over the next couple of weeks, and gave up on giving it a long review as it was a waste of time. That leaves this rant. No recommendation people, don't watch it. No chance I'm waiting for another series from Maeda. Not in a million years.",

            "content": "ambivalence.\r\nKey is a household name for any anime connoisseur. Even those with a mere passive interest in the medium as a whole are probably familiar with at least one of Key\u2019s titles\u2014a close friend of mine whose anime experience mostly encompasses Naruto knows Clannad as \u201cthat anime which gives people the sads\u201d and subsequently won\u2019t watch it because \u201cit\u2019ll give me the sads.\u201d Clannad: After Story has permanently lodged itself within MAL\u2019s top 10, several other Key titles (such as Angel Beats! and Kanon) receive a lot of love around here, and multiple Key visual novels have received wide acclaim, with Clannad, Little Busters, andRewrite all ranking within vndb\u2019s top 15. In short, people love Key, and when a new anime fronted by Key or Key\u2019s figurehead and principal writer Jun Maeda rolls around, people pay attention. It could be because you\u2019re excited for a new anime from your favorite writer, it could be because you\u2019re one of the director\u2019s many critics and you can\u2019t wait to see their new trainwreck, or you could just be interested in the hype the new series delivers as a passive observer; whatever the case, interest is generated. Naturally, Charlotte, being the newest title in Jun Maeda\u2019s impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9, was met with a tidal wave of hype. Does Charlotte match the standards expected by a Key title? Well, yes and no.\\n\\n\r\nThe first six episodes are a testament to all things Jun Maeda, a near complete collection of tropes anybody familiar with his work probably knows intimately by now: food jokes, baseball, school hi-jinks, and tinges of supernatural melodrama, among others. Frankly, these episodes are riddled with so many KeyTropes\u2122 that one might think they were purposely constructed as a parody of everything Maeda is known for. By episode 4, all except the most rabid of Key fans will be more than a little tired with the barrage of shenanigans pressed upon us. The problem isn\u2019t so much that Maeda uses his traditional writing style, it\u2019s that the execution of his ideas are simply too familiar. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen this before, and I\u2019ve seen it done better than this.\u201d His writing is almost a caricature of itself at this point. As a fan of Maeda\u2019s writing style, I found myself chuckling a number of times and invested in \u201cThe Everyday Adventures of Tomori and Friends\u201d more than I retrospectively can understand, but I doubt the average viewer is going to empathize with these feelings. Then, against all odds, Charlotte turned 180 in potentially one of the most contrasting shattering of tropes and clich\u00e9s I\u2019ve ever witnessed in an anime: episode seven.\\n\\n\r\nThe 7th episode of Charlotte is without question one of Key\u2019s finest episodes, sitting in pleasant company with the 18th episode of Clanand: After Story, the 10th episode of Kanon, and the finale of Angel Beats. For probably the second time in his career, Maeda wrote a dramatic story earthed in realism and believability that does not rely on emotional oversensitivity. Filled with flawless progression, powerful character development, and tight writing, Maeda proved he has a grasp on human emotions and Charlotte is not just another show aimed at appealing to the viewer\u2019s appreciation for zany comedy and \u201cfeels.\u201d It even successfully implements Maeda\u2019s traditional appreciation for sensationalism and does so with class. From episode seven onwards, Charlotte catapults through a number of plot twists and thrills with a sense of maturity foreign to Key\u2019s works, only ever devolving back to its handbook of clich\u00e9s to lighten the atmosphere and strengthen the execution rather than relying on them to even catch interest. However, herein lies Charlotte\u2019s largest fault (no, it\u2019s not the pizza sauce jokes): resolution.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps a testimony to the fact a Key story can\u2019t be told with finesse in a mere 13 episodes, Charlotte\u2019s single most fatal flaw is its pacing and the means by which its drama is resolved. Character development is curbed for the sake of bringing a close to each individual obstacle in a single episode and, in the best of cases, two episodes. The drama of the early episodes is ruined by the absence of build-up and negligence of expansion, and the drama of the latter episodes is diminished by the constraints of its run time that force a harried resolution without thoroughly exploring the events and before viewers are given the chance to even register what\u2019s going on, let alone sink into our protagonist\u2019s emotions\u2026 which brings us to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf Charlotte\u2019s pacing is the gaping wound to the series, then its characters would be the taut string that attempts to cease the blood loss. Each member of our four-character primary cast is loveable and amusing, and a lot of Charlotte\u2019s idiosyncratic humor would utterly fail without its characters to support it. Yuu Otosaka, accurately dubbed \u201cmini-Lelouch,\u201d is sly and selfish yet charismatic and\u2026 loves his sister. Nao Tomori is a stoic, responsible, and sweet girl that maneuvers skillfully across the tsundere rope, the one Key girls often do, striking a delicate balance between casually hostile and apprehensively caring. This gives her a believable emotional distance, especially taking into consideration the struggles pressed upon her, far removed from the cringe-inducing display of many of the anime community\u2019s beloved tsunderes (Taiga is shit). Joujirou Takajo and Yusa \u201cYusarin\u201d Kurobane kind of play second fiddle to our protagonists and would have benefited greatly from more development (Takajo especially; Kurobane received her share of development, but its execution was disappointing at best\u2014more on that in a minute), but between Takajo\u2019s presence as the butt of Charlotte\u2019s many jokes and Yusarin\u2019s dualistic personality, I couldn\u2019t help but admire both of them anyway. There are a number of side characters which play an important role later in the story; speaking much of them would spoil several important events, but it\u2019s worth noting that they are all likeable characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Charlotte\u2019s fatal ailment to some extent succeeded in demolishing its characters as well. As mentioned previously, the pacing of the series consistently stifles character development. Some of Yuu\u2019s actions come out of left field, Tomori winds up a side character by the end, and the bits of development the other characters get is crammed into a time allotment so tightly controlled it just seems forced\u2014Kurobane\u2019s ultimate resolution is literally compacted into less than 5 minutes of a single episode. Charlotte nearly completely sacrifices the important element of build-up in the execution of its drama, and without that build-up it\u2019s difficult for the audience to really care about what\u2019s going on. Episode 7 is the single moment in the series that remembers that importance, and, to no surprise, it focuses on Yuu. As the protagonist, all of the genuine development in the series is heaped at Yuu. Even the events seemingly intended to develop the side characters commonly, ultimately serves the purpose of developing Yuu. It is for this reason that, despite some misgivings, Yuu is a well-rounded, well-developed character and certainly among the best of Key\u2019s protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I have no specific comments about the standard sound direction\u2014the BGM is certainly not as noteworthy as that of Key\u2019s holy trinity (Clannad, Kanon, Air)\u2014praise should be directed towards the stellar voice work of Kouki Uchiyama for Yuu Otosaka and Ayane Sakura for Nao Tomori. Yuu\u2019s voice work is theatrical and lively, perfectly complimenting his character, yet apprehensive and dejected when required. Nao\u2019s voice in contrast is some combination of subdued, stern, and alluring; and, truthfully, Ayane Sakura\u2019s voice is so charming I could\u2019ve turned off the subtitles and just appreciate the beauty of her voice work. \\n\\n\r\nI opened this review up with the word \u201cambivalence\u201d to set an atmosphere for my general impression of the series. While the first half of the series is an enjoyable yet basic collage of slice-of-life shenanigans, the second half swiftly swings into motion reminding me why I love Key\u2019s works, yet ultimately leaving me with mixed feelings because its unfortunate pacing restrains its overflowing potential. The resulting product is a vaguely impressive series that falls short of its fathers. And, disappointing as it is, it could have matched them with a handful more episodes, just a bit more time to expand its events and characters, to cover its plot holes.

            "content": "Charlotte is another one of those controversial anime which you see people complaining about *everywhere* yet it still actually has pretty decent ratings. From this we can deduce that there are probably a lot of people hating on it mostly because everyone else is doing it and they don't want to stand out, and/or that the show is mostly successful among casual viewers who don't bother speaking their mind about it over the internet to begin with. It all sounds uncannily similar to the public view on Sword Art Online in that sense, doesn't it? And in the same way, while Charlotte is certainly noton the same level as most of Jun Maeda's earlier works, there are still countless anime significantly worse than this. The world doesn't solely consist of black and white.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is a story about people with super powers. Only temporary and highly imperfect ones yes, but super powers all the same. It follows the life Otosaka Yuu, an initially arrogant high-schooler who has the ability to take control of people's minds for five seconds at a time; an ability he has used to cheat his way to the highest grades of his school. That is until he one day gets caught red-handed by an unknown girl who is seemingly aware of his ability, Tomori Nao, who then forces him and his sister to transfer into her own school instead: a special school built solely for students with supernatural abilities. And thus their new lives begin as Yuu and his newfound companions struggle through their lives as they attempt to fit into society, as well as do their best to stay away from any scientists who might seek to turn them into experimental guinea pigs.\\n\\n\r\nNow the first problem with Charlotte is simply that the first five episodes are rather... uninteresting to say the least, and feel mostly like filler. These episodes pretty much run on an \"ability user of the week\" theme, as they are all separate stories about Yuu and his friends having to find and subjugate some person abusing his/her super power in some manner of fashion. But there is no semblance of coherence to it, and it doesn't feel like the main plot is going anywhere at all. Or rather it doesn't feel like any sort of main plot even exists. It's mostly just quirky over-the-top comedy similar to what we saw in Angel Beats and not a whole lot more.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't until episode six that the main story actually starts out for real. Here the story immediately takes a significantly darker turn, which was clearly written for shock value. Then it gets a lot more interesting for a few episodes (though Yuu's character development still feels highly unrealistic), but as it gets closer to its climax, Charlotte starts feeling a bit like an unfinished mess script-wise. I'm not going to spoil any details of course, but there are a ridiculous amount of ideas that are juggled with towards the end of the story, and it feels like the plot takes a whole new direction with every new episode. One week it felt like I was watching Steins;Gate. The other it was Zankyou no Terror. Etcetera. Really it doesn't feel like the plot even knows where it wants to go, and as a result you get a jumbled mishmash of a storyline in the grand scheme of things. Also as an inevitable result of this, there are many plot elements which feel rather poorly thought-out. When you take a completely unexpected direction with the plot, you better have done the groundwork for it to make sense, but Charlotte doesn't always do this because some of the twists feel more like plot holes than anything else simply because earlier events seem to contradict them. In addition, despite the now more serious general atmosphere of the show, it still insists on reusing the silly comedic elements of its opening episodes every so often, but unlike those, it no longer feels appropriate at all. Oh and if you're looking for some sort of tear-jerking drama in this anime like Jun Maeda normally specializes in, you should probably look someplace else because Charlotte really isn't that kind of story at all. Rather the only drama it really has is quite cheesy, and among other things contains a pretty forced and unnatural romance subplot, but even that is still nothing more than a secondary aspect of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nothing spectacular, but I find them likeable enough for the most part. In the very beginning, Yuu is the spitting image of Lelouch both in terms of personality and super power which thrilled me quite a lot, but sadly he calms down and becomes more of a standard protagonist pretty quickly. Nao is rather hotheaded and violent, but still very caring for her friends and family on the inside. The other main characters primarily consist of other ability users from the school, including the pop idol Yusarin who has a quite unique take on the \"split personality\" concept, as well as the glasses guy Joujirou who possesses the ability to teleport... sort of. There is also the rather overwhelming little sister Ayumi whom I know a lot of people disliked quite a lot, but she's treated more like a plot device than anything else throughout the story. Whether or not this is a good or bad thing though is debatable.\\n\\n\r\nThe production value however, as you may expect from P.A. Works, is top tier. While it doesn't look quite as mesmerizing as some of their earlier works such as Nagi no Asukara, it is still absolutely beautiful to look at. The character designs and the scenery both look amazing. The music is equally on point, which again may only be expected given the people behind it. The OP and ED are both among the very best of the year for sure.\\n\\n\r\nBut although it may be pretty to look at and listen to, that is sadly not all there is to an anime, and Charlotte falls flat in the more important categories instead. I really felt like the story always had potential, but it never really got itself together. I felt like I was constantly waiting for some clever plot twist that would make all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, and suddenly explain why all the questionable plot twists played out the way they did... but it never really happened. Episode nine did a good job with clearing up everything up to that point, but as for the events of the last few episodes... I'm afraid I can't say the same. As a result, the ending isn't exactly the best one I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything though, I still somehow found Charlotte fairly entertaining from start to finish. Admittedly a lot of that probably just comes from the initial hype the series had, but even when it started to get more and more problematic script-wise, it didn't exactly get boring. And that is still the most important aspect in my mind, given that anime is, after all, nothing but entertainment media in the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte feels kind of like an incomplete experimental anime which tries to do too many things at the same time, and as a result doesn't really succeed with any of them. Rather it leaves more holes than answers instead. But it still manages to keep you guessing and curious about what kind of curveball it's going to throw at you next. Does that make it a good anime? Maybe not, but despite all its problems I still can't make myself hate it. While it's certainly a very flawed anime, I still had fun watching it.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only we could all learn to not hype series up to the second tier of heaven before they start airing; it only makes the disappointment feel all the greater when it doesn't live up to the expectations in the end.",

Not realistic...darker but hopeful.\r\nThe STORY that gets really interesting by every chapter have just one problem. Its like every 3 or 2 episodes the anime changes from slice of life to drama, and after 2 comes back to slice of life and then romance and then action. Many people disliked this but I love it. It let me think and watch every part of the anime deeper and gave me enough to still being curious.\r\nWhat can I say about the ART...just \"P.A.Works.\". Beutiful environment bythe way.\\n\r\nThe SOUND is good,;I loved the op and ending but maybe I personally dislike the part of the anime of progressive rock.\\n\r\nAll CHARACTERS have good personality s. Everyone is cool. But they focused so much on Yuu and some parts on Nao that I forget about the others characters.  Even if they would kill someone I won't get sad at all. But talking in general I loved the changes of every character while story goes on. Anyways I loved something of every character and that is how it should be. \\n\r\nI ENJOYED all episodes. Calm, tragedy,  school, love, tears. Maybe it make me feel a little sad for the music, art and what happened. But I feel it... I felt it.\\n\r\nIn OVERALL I gave this a 9 because I didn't enjoy a anime for so long. Because I felt what yuu felt what nao felt. And I didn't expect anything.  I just watch and put my heart on it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "-THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS-\r\nCharlotte seems to be the \"Key\" title that sticks out the most from the bunch. Not only is it an original story, but it also has a darker and more complicated story. Yes. COMPLICATED. As it is a Key title, many people got hyped up for it before it came out and it has become one of the most popular shows of not only the Summer 2015 season, but in 2015 as well. So how is it really?\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAs with all the Key titles, Charlotte starts off as this happy, school feeling slice-of-life show. A few episode later it divesdown into deeper and darker themes with the characters revealing something different about them. The entire show mostly plays out on the darker moments rather than the school life and that is something I appreciate from it. However, it doesn't save the story from being a rushed mess. Like Gakkou Gurashi, Charlotte's story doesn't know what it wants to be. It jumbles from a happy slice-of-life show to dark action show with a hint of mystery. The story seems as if it's changing it's mind every 5 minutes from the two themes since it wants to be both but it doesn't know how. Also, it's very rushed. We have a death in episode 6 from a character we should care about but the anime gives us so little time with that character. Instead, it gives us a baseball episode and a camping episode. Those episodes should've been used for us to learn about the characters more. Every episode after episode 6 is a Steins;Gate wannabe mindfuck. Only not that good kind. With a rushed story and such little episodes, everything seems to complicated to follow.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte was brought to us by studio P.A. Works. Responsible for shows like Angel Beats (another Key anime) and Nagi no Asukara. And the production values for those shows are beautiful to look at. While the shows themselves may not hold up well, they still have beautiful art and animation all around. This however, kind of does that, just in a very toned down kind of way. The animation in the opening is beautiful and really brings out P.A. Works potential with their animation skills. Not only that, but the colors and backgrounds (excluding some of the character designs) mix in pretty well. Another thing I like is how when the tone shifts, the color pallets would change in tone and it does it wonderfully. But the rest of the animation is pretty mediocre. The characters movements seem very sloppy and a bit too quick for the type of anime this is. Also, the hair and the eye combination for some of these characters just doesn't mix well together. Nao's sea foam type hair and dark blue eyes just seem so off. The lead singer for the band who is blind has pink hair and light blue eyes just looks so mismatched. The animation isn't terrible or bad by any means, but for P.A. Works, it's kind of a let down.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nHighlight of the show. This show gets props for having a great opening and ending song. The opening gives out a happy, cheerful but subtle deep themes that just fit perfectly for the show. The ending is a much more so somber that also fits the show well. Also, the show has a great cast of voices that all put great effort into their performances. However, even if the sound is good, the soundtrack on the other hand is lacking. It sounds just like a bunch of things we've heard of before and some of the soundtracks that play do not match with the scene the anime is showing us. However, that doesn't weigh out the good performances by the cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOH BOY HERE WE GO. The worst part of Charlotte. Nao while actually a pretty interesting character doesn't do much or develops. Otosaka, the main lead, goes from a bad ass to a bland and uninteresting character by episode 3. Otosaka's sister plays a major role in the show but she's the same moeshit, \"ONIICHAN!\" stereotype we've seen in a billion of other shows. Rest of the characters? Who cares? They don't do much to the show or show up at all. Even the new character don't do much at all. They're just there to give Otosaka his orders while just standing around. What am I supposed to feel for this idol chick with her dead sister ability? NOTHING. Since the anime barley gives her any screen time. The guy with the glasses not only has no point to the anime, but he's one of the most pointless characters I've ever seen. Key's worst characters to date.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked some of the action moments and watching Nao. That's it. Most of the time I was just checking the time and begging this anime to be over and done with. It was painful to sit through to the point I felt like dropping it. I very much dislike dropping series and I didn't want this to be my first. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWasted Potential: The Anime. \\n\r\nCharlotte has a misguided and jumbled story, average animation (though not exactly a bad thing), HORRENDOUS CHARACTERS, and a rushed ending that makes you go, \"What was the point of it all? Why did I watch this atrocity?\" P.A. Works has never really been good at drama anime or good at anything in the matter, but this feels like a new low for the studio. And I though Glasslip from last summer was a bad anime by P.A. Works- and even though it's bad, it's not Charlotte bad. I really would like to see something good from P.A. Works for once. FOR ONCE. I guess that's too much to ask. I recommend staying away from this series. Even though it has a good opening and ending and a good cast that gave out great performances, it doesn't save the show at all.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n",

            "content": "Hi there. How's it going. \r\nUPDATE\r\nI originally dropped this show at 8 episodes, having felt that this show was possibly going to be one of the worst experiences I have ever had. However, I decided to complete it to fully deiscern for myself whether or not it was as bad as I thought. Now, after finishing the 5 episodes that I neglected, I can safely say:\r\nThat this show is one of the worst shows I have ever seen, and far worse than I could have imagined at that.\r\nNow, the way that I rate shows is fully detailed on my profile, so look there for myfull reasoning, but just know this: what I define as the worst anime is a show that has so many negative aspects about it that anything good that may come from it doesn't compare to the flaws and downright offensive structure of the show in question.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said,\\n\\n\r\nSTORY & CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis show is horribly paced, featuring six whole episodes in the beginning of nothing but one-off unmemorable characters and nearly emotionless segments that could have been dealt with in just a couple of episodes. In fact, episodes 2-6 might as well be the same episode, just with a different super power and forgettable character. \\n\\n\r\nNow, some may argue that Angel Beats! also shares this problem. However, the difference here is that Angel Beats! had a full cast with recurring characters that kept coming back, allowing for an attachment to grow with these characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte, by comparison, gives us a cast of four unremarkable character tropes that are no different from any character we have seen before. The only character really exempt from this is Tomori Nao, the main heroine of the series (though she herself is simply just a deviation from Yuri Nakamura, who herself is almost frighteningly similar to Haruhi Suzumiya).\\n\\n\r\n However, the episodic nature of these first couple episodes would have made this show a simple 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the edge happens.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is so bad with how dark and depressing it tries to be that it comes off as comedic at best. I found myself laughing at scenes that most would describe as traumatic or depressing because they just felt so rushed and souless that laughing was the only correct emotional response. In fact, some of the major plot points and threads in this show, which are meant to draw out an emotional response, felt lifeless.\\n\\n\r\nI will talk about the major problems later, but first:\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the only thing that could save this show is its animation and sound design. I DO find the animation to only be a slight upgrade of Angel Beats! (though even that is disputable, as Angel Beats! has better art direction). I suppose it is fair that P.A. Works has improved since Angel Beats!, as the animation is cleaner and feels less glossy. The problem, however, is that the character designs, overall, are unmemorable for the most part, with the exception of Tomori Nao. The design sense is good, but mostly forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also fairly well-done, as the background music and sound direction are fine for the most part. Charlotte also has its own vocal performances by fictional band ZHIEND, but the music is mostly...meh for the most part. The show's musical aspects shine especially in the area of its opening \"Bravely You\" by Lia, an opening that I have to admit is the best of the Summer anime season. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this show is almost like Sword Art Online in this sense. The art and sound of course are fairly well-done, but when comparing it to Angel Beats!, Nagi no Asakura or even Shirobako, it doesn't really stand out too well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut, that leaves us with the major problem with the series.\\n\\n\r\nIT'S TOO CLUTTERED\\n\\n\r\nJun Maeda has clearly not learned from his mistakes from Angel Beats!, and arguably he has done a much worse job, as this show is too short for the story it is trying to tell.\\n\\n\r\nOr perhaps, I should word it like this:\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats!'s problem is that it had too many characters that needed development, which required at least a 24-episode timeframe.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte feels like a string of ideas which could form five different SHOWS, each either 24 episodes or 13 episodes in their own regard. An Angel Beats!/X-Men style episodic comedy. An emotional revenge story. A blatant Steins;Gate ripoff. And a whole solo series with its own issues and moral questions which was packed into ONE EPISODE. \\n\\n\r\nThis show was ruined by its ambition and lack of planning, and I cannot stand it.\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nThis show is currently my #4 least favorite show of all time. How anyone can actually say this show is good baffles me. I wanted to love this show. I really did. However, it just tries so hard to be this dark, emotional story that I cannot enjoy it without being constantly irritated by all of its numerous flaws. And Jun Maeda NEEDS to learn how to pace out a series correctly. I cannot see myself ever reccomending this to anyone, and I just hope one day Jun Maeda ACTUALLY learns from his mistakes.",

            "content": "If I were to summarize Charlotte,  it would be like trying to make soup by throwing all your favorite foods into a pot. It doesn\u2019t work like that. \r\nSo what are our ingredients? \r\n1) Good-looking audience surrogate male protagonist. 2) Equally good-looking female protagonist with tragic backstory. 3) Super kawaii imouto. 4) Glasses-wearing idol fanboy. 5) Moe idol character. 6) High school setting. 7) Government baddies. 8) Supernatural abilities 9) Deaths, but not really. 10) Romantic subplot\u2026see where I\u2019m going with this?\r\nThe biggest problem for Charlotte seems to be its inherent lack of confidence in having compelling characters and telling an interesting story. Hell,when the director himself admits that the anime doesn\u2019t pick up until episode 6, something is definitely wrong here. Indeed, the first five episode are incredibly formulaic, yet acts as if it isn\u2019t. Charlotte doesn\u2019t trust its audience enough to be able to accept what it does, and thus ends up spelling everything out. Why must we be constantly reminded how good-looking Yuu and Tomori are, how much of a turn off Joujirou is, and how despicable the government/scientists are? Only if you didn\u2019t think these elements could be interesting at face-value.  \\n\\n\r\nChef Charlotte suffers by trying way too hard and playing it way too safe. The mood of this series is jarring, shifting from humorous to tragic to \u201cheartfelt\u201d in seconds. Which could work and is possible (see Gintama), but the problem is that it oversells these moments. The jokes work the first time since humor is effective when it\u2019s over-the-top, but quickly becomes a recycled tool. The dramatic moments are overdone with its constant rage-faces and Supersaiyan-esque screaming. It tries to force in moments of fan service like Yusarin\u2019s singing under the mask of plot development. The more risky ingredients like death and romance are either haphazardly tossed in or negated altogether. Don\u2019t add things if you\u2019re not going to see them through. \\n\\n\r\nIf the most delicious part of this anime is the omurice with pizza sauce, then I think the director needs to go back to culinary school.",

Voice actors and subtitling were almost near perfection. I'm actually struggling to pickup anything negative about this Anime. Even the ending left me, full, if that makes sense. I was extremely happy with the ending, which is something I can't say about a lot of Animes.\r\nEven If you don'thave time to watch this Anime, make time, and watch it.

            "content": "It was the summer of 2006, the heat rather modest (a rarity in my hometown of Augusta, GA), and I was aiming to make a quick buck. Roused by the success of my parents\u2019 yard sale earlier that day, I convinced my little brother to follow me door-to-door, selling T-shirts and books, my books. I aspired to become an author (even back then) yet lacked the necessities to further my vision. What I did was borrow the books on my shelf, glue my name where the author\u2019s should be, and sold other people\u2019s products as though it were my own. It was an utterly disgustingact, one I reflect on in shame.\\n\\n\r\n(You\u2019re not gonna believe this but I managed to earn two dollars from my scheme).\\n\\n\r\nFor those of us that have viewed Charlotte in its entirety, this anecdote likely sounds very familiar. This is an anime that exists by blatantly pilfering the ideas, the mood, and the essence from other entities; it siphons from its own decency and originality for a profit. Charlotte is, in short, a Jun Maeda work through and through. Of course, it\u2019s possible to be distracted from the rampant plagiarism, thanks to the excess of stunning scenery porn (another feat of visual excellence by P.A. Works). Charlotte is the equivalent of the Anchor Arms from SpongeBob; it projects a self-assured exterior that does absolutely nothing to repair its fragile inner workings. The crux of Charlotte\u2019s glaring imperfections is that it mounted too much pressure on itself and then crumpled under the weight. Charlotte champions itself as a slice-of-life, a time travel epic, a Code Geass knockoff, a tearjerker of a romance, a modern take on the superhero genre, and a mystery simultaneously. However, Charlotte flounders in every facet, especially when it involves mystery.\\n\\n\r\nEvery recognizable cast member contains some sort of superpower and this enables the characters to settle each case without a hitch. Cold cases don\u2019t exist in the world of Charlotte; \u201csuspects\u201d, \u201csecond-guessing\u201d, and \u201cnabbing the wrong guy\u201d are foreign concepts here as well. In fact, Charlotte\u2019s detective work is completely and utterly devoid of realism. It\u2019s the superpowers that can identify, locate, and apprehend any criminal (It doesn\u2019t require Sherlock Holmes to arrest robbers anymore, not when someone with invisibility can do the job). In the rare occasion that powers aren\u2019t of any use, Charlotte\u2019s cast is still able to solve cases thanks to the miracle of plot convenience (You cannot fathom how effortless the interrogation scenes are). Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the man that popularized the mystery genre, likely rolls in his grave at the existence of Charlotte.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cElementary\u201d is how I\u2019d describe Charlotte\u2019s approach to detective work, and the same could be said for its characterization. The central cast members are Self-Insert MC, followed by Haruhi Ripoff, Quirky Glasses Guy, Cute Pop Idol, and Jailbait Chef. They (and every other character in Charlotte) are pure, benevolent, and utterly righteous beings that take actions for noble causes. One person seeks to follow their dreams while another aims for a second chance with his crush and all of them \u2013 all of them \u2013 are concerned with protecting their friends and family. Charlotte\u2019s characters are absolutely not allowed to display any personality flaws; if they do, the show will ensure said character returns to the path of righteousness as soon as possible (This is exactly what I despised about Once Upon A Time). When one character embarks in the lifestyle of a degenerate, it\u2019s an apology and a good meal that causes him to make a turnaround. As you and I both know, our world is filled with sunshine and rainbows and Mary Sues. Charlotte has no time for anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no doubt you\u2019ve heard people claim this show is riddled with plot holes, logical fallacies, pacing issues, and unintentional hilarity. All of this is certainly true but one thing needs to be said here: Charlotte is dull; it\u2019s wildly, relentlessly, colossally dull. Both the theme song and ending theme are legitimate sleeping pills while the utter lack of visual creativity never fails to disappoint (especially in comparison to Angel Beats). If that doesn\u2019t lower your expectations, I guarantee that Charlotte\u2019s putrid sense of humor will do the trick. The fanboy monologues from Quirky Glasses Guy, the oh-so-funny catchphrases (\u201cBig turnoff!\u201d), and the nosebleeds are where the eyerolls will commence. Charlotte has a fascination for introducing unbearable gags, i.e. episode 3\u2019s name gag, and lingering over them (a Jun Maeda trademark) like no other. The \u201cwitty\u201d asides are guaranteed to fall flat every time; for a show that enjoys dubbing each character\u2019s power as \u201chalf-assed\u201d, it\u2019s a fitting description for its sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nNo review of Charlotte (or any Jun Maeda work for that matter) can be complete without mentioning the inability to understand subtlety. You don\u2019t get a moment of silence with Charlotte. It\u2019s nothing but noise with this show, as if muting the inspirational strings and sappy dialogue just once is too much to ask for. Charlotte exterminates the \u201cshow; don\u2019t tell\u201d concept with its tiresome monologues and excessive narration; every instance of character development is spelled out for you, as if you can\u2019t observe what\u2019s happening for yourself. Even Angel Beats has more tact that this hunk of garbage.\\n\\n\r\nAsk Charlotte for a finale that\u2019s respectable and it goes for convoluted instead.\\n\r\nAsk Charlotte to be original and it quits before episode 2.\\n\r\nAsk Charlotte to aspire for higher standards and it wallows in its own stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nIf there are a few tips I\u2019d give to potential viewers of this travesty, it would be to prepare for disappointment. It would be to not misconstrue a copy-and-paste job for originality. It would be to not be deceived by pretty colors and gorgeous midafternoon skies. It would be to be wary of cop outs and deus ex machinas and an egregious confession of love. Better yet, it would be to take a glance at the legion of negative reviews, alongside the glut of low scores, and stay far, far, far away from Charlotte.",

            "content": "As a preface, please forget my overall score awhile.  I'd like to recommend Charlotte to any newcomer to anime. It has pretty enchanting setting including super power with school setting which is usually become attraction to the newcomer or younger shounen audiences. With drama and some comedy, the storytelling is accessible and pretty easy to be digested.  Although the pacing at many moments are rushed,  it has still not lost the essence of the show. I believe that\u2019s the main reason why there are still many people like this show.\r\nWritten by Maeda Jun/Key with helps from P.A. Works and Aniplex. Seems Maedafactor is the most reason why people to watch Charlotte, including myself.  Prior to Charlotte, to be honest,  I found Maeda\u2019s story-writing usually filled with repetitive melodrama. But the fact is I had always been enjoying his works. Perhaps it is because Maeda always finds the way with simple but enchanting setting and twist. But unfortunately you won\u2019t find something like \u201cAfter Story\u201d or \u201cRefrain\u201d here. Moreover it became the worst of Maeda/Key I\u2019ve ever seen. As a perspective from someone who have watched it because of Maeda,  my impression towards Charlotte can be described in one sentence in the following:\\n\\n\r\n\u201c2015 is the falldown of both Key and Maeda.\u201d \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs the first breakdown, let\u2019s start from arwork and animation, the strongest aspect amongst the whole department. In my opinion, today,  P.A. Works is one of the leading artwork makers in anime world in terms of TV series. Their work ethics should be appreciated. The background landscapes are made in such detail. The character designs and animation are well made, pretty similar to other P.A. Works\u2019 works before. It is very hard to notice any inconsistencies here. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the sound. I have mixed feelings regarding it. Charlotte has very good OP and ED; both are sung by Lia and Aoi Tada respectively. Similar to its predecessor which also made by same studio, Angel Beats. But the OST/Insert music, somehow a letdown. Before Charlotte, Key/Maeda usually made soundtrack with evocative tune. Charlotte OST kinda duller and inferior for me compared to its predecessor (i.e. Clannad, Angel Beats, and Little Busters). I can hardly remember any of its tracks. It is not that the OST are bad, but it was really below my expectation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t elaborate the synopsis because everyone can see it in the page description. Speaking of the story, the storytelling and story writing are the biggest problem in Charlotte. Rushed pacing in the second half being the most prominent. Personally I wouldn\u2019t mind if a show has very past pacing, if it has purpose to give a sharp development. But in Charlotte rushed pacing leads to poor characterization, bitter comedy, forced drama, forced romance, plot holes, rushed ending, and leaves many question regarding the world building left unanswered. The worst thing is rushed pacing at second half is caused by unneeded material in first half. Especially at episode 4-5 where the \u201cpower of the week\u201d has no direct connection to the story-character building to the whole series and makes it looks like a filler. Both Maeda/Key and PA Works\u2019 series composer should delete it and fill it with another proper material to give more story, character, and world building depth. If they make it, I\u2019m pretty sure Charlotte would be far better. I dare to call it bad story writing or miss-management of the series composing. Put the pacing aside, the major story progression is the biggest disappointment. The series\u2019 title word \u201cCharlotte\u201d and scenes from opening song has promising premise with its symbolism to give it more potential material to the setting depth and plot. But as the story progress towards the end, the whole story progression became straight-forward melodrama which can be found in thousands mediocre show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd now here is another problem in Charlotte, it is the character(s). Let\u2019s start from our main MC, Yuu. In the very beginning he seemed very promising character with his philosophical narration. But then less than 2 minutes he turned into immature person using his super power for immature personal gain (I dare to call it not spoiler because it only example from first 1-2 minutes of the series).  Saw the transition development, back then I was thinking: \u201cIs this supposed to be a kind of joke?\u201d If not, then it is really disappointing to find a character writing inconsistency just within first 2 minutes of the series . If yes, then it was bitter. But that example isn\u2019t the big deal because that\u2019s just one example of MANY minor character flaws that can be seen. The ultimate disappointment is with many cast, at the end only Yuu has significance importance throughout the show. The other cast are just being left as single-dimensional characters. There is nothing wrong with single-dimensional characters but it is really destroyed my enjoyment when the most prominent, the only multi-dimensional character is flawedly written from the very beginning. \\n\\n\r\nSecond to Yuu, there is Nao that has more significance throughout the show than other. But too bad, due to bad pacing and series composing, she just has only purpose limited only to enlarger the plot width, not to strengthen the drama. This is why you won\u2019t feel the chemistry throughout the show regarding the romance. Speaking of Ayumi, Joujirou, Yusa-Misa, Shunsuke and others, they are the single-dimensional characters that I was talking about. Maeda/Key should compress the amount of cast to give more characterization to each characters. The bad characterization in Angel Beats is repeated again this time, but worse. \u201cMaeda seems doesn\u2019t work with only 13 episodes\u201d may be a scapegoat justification. Actually it shows his inferiority as a writer.  Tons of writer out of there did much better with only 13 ep or fewer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory and Plot (4/10)\\n\r\nVisual Art (7/10)\\n\r\nAudio (7/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment (2/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte isn\u2019t only a bad show but also disappointing. An honest score would be \u201c4\u201d from me due to poor story-character writing. For me story writing and character become important aspect in Charlotte because it supposed to be a drama show. But from newcomer perspective, this show could be a good experience as it may offer enjoyment for someone who doesn\u2019t put emphasis in story and character detail. Charlotte is similar to the popular \u2018Sword Art Online\u2019, with poor story writing and characterization, it still offers interesting setting, artwork, and sound department (although personally I found Charlotte\u2019s sound department, especially the insert OST was a letdown). So I have to give it a higher score because of the said perspectives. But for someone who seeking for story writing and character detail and haven\u2019t watch this show, I recommend to not watch it. It may surely a total waste of time. And for Maeda/Key fan, my deep condolences for you. You\u2019re live long enough to see an ultimate disappointment, except you\u2019re biased.\\n",

            "content": "Charlotte is the anime that is touted by a lot of people as \"a better version/ spiritual successor of Angel Beats!\" before airing. Same studio, same character designer, same creator (Jun Maeda, he's even writing the script now), what could go wrong? Turns out, everything can. Not only Charlotte failed to surpass Angel Beats, it managed to be one of the worst animes of the season. \r\nMAJOR Spoiler alerts.\r\nStory: 3\r\nI'll admit, the story sounds promising, I was super hyped, and I really don't have any hate for high school setting animes as long as it is done right. The first and second episode was alsoreally good. Then the show started to go episodic filler. To be honest, I don't actually remember much about these episodes because it was all about catching other power users and there's literally zero character development. Then BAM, Ayumi's death happened, the show started to go all plot focused, we have lelouch improper copycat oops sorry, we have  Yuu Otosaka getting over the death of his sister, and honestly that part was actually done well. Now when that conflict is over, through a series of asspulls and plotholes, Yuu brought Ayumi back. Yep, all that impact from Ayumi's death was GONE, what's good to portray a person getting over the death of another person if that dead person could be revived a few days later? After all that stuff, you thought the asspulls gonna be over but NOOOOOOPE, new villains appeared out of nowhere and was defeated within a few minutes, and then we have the death of another character, which I barely had a chance to know. Since time travelling is now out of the question, what now? Yep, I was surprised Yuu said he was going to travel the world. Wow, that's potential. What will happen to Yuu when he travels the world, what kind of character will he become? This Yuu travelling the world arc could've been great if it was 3 episodes or more, but the problem here is we only have one episode left. It couldn't get any worse if they went with something else that could fit the 1 episode timeframe instead. Instead we have AROUND THE WORLD IN 22 MINUTES, and 2 minutes of romance between Yuu and Nao with zeeeeero buildup. Pacing is horrible and you could never now what would happen next, because there is zero forshadowing, zero buildup.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art of Charlotte is great, great in 2010. This is 2015 now, and not even Na-Ga's character design could save this show. Backgrounds are standard, character details are standard, 720p resolution upscaled into 1080p is standard (Many studios adopted 900p and some are even using native 1080p resolution). Nothing really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nSound is the only redeeming factor of the show. The OP \"Bravely You\", sang by Lia, is awesome, i could say the BGM and some the insert songs are good too. But this is Jun Maeda we're talking about. Compared to his other works, Charlotte is just isn't up to par.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nYuu is a lelouch copy cat, if he didn't looked like lelouch I would've had a hard time remembering his face. He has the most development throughout the series, but he doesn't have ANYTHING SPECIAL. Other than the fact that he looks like lelouch, nothing differentiates him from other main characters. His development is also not evenly paced, first episode he was like \"oooh im so freaking awesome i don't care about anyone\" and the next episode he was like \"oooh these poor people must be hard i gotta help them\". Nao is your typical tough girl yet cares for people in the inside kind of girl. Glassed guy is just there for the comedy, and the fact that the comedy ISN'T EVEN GOOD, idol girl is also the same. All the characters except Yuu received ZERO DEVELOPMENT throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nI would be lying if I said I enjoyed this for the plot or characters. I watched the end of Charlotte purely just to see how bad it could get while listening to the Jun Maeda soundtracks. I bursted out of laughter in the hospital scene where Nao cried and said she was Yuu's boyfriend. Am I supposed to feel sad or something???? \\n\\n\r\nCompared to Angel Beats:\\n\r\nExactly the same art quality, yet has a significantly better soundtrack, comedy that is ACTUALLY FUNNY, a plot that was actually watchable and actually made sense (although rushed), characters that actually have redeeming qualities and traits.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nCharlotte upped the flaws of Angel Beats over level 9000, while removing all of the stuff that Angel Beats did right. One of the worst anime of the season that you should only watch if you:\\n\r\n- Want to listen to the music (Maybe you should find them on youtube then)\\n\r\n- Watch it just to see how bad it is \\n\r\n- Watch it to kill time (there are way better animes out there for you to kill your time but hey, it's your choice ! )\\n\r\nIt had potential to be great, but turned out to be utterly terrible. Would definitely watch the second season if there was one, just to see how bad it can get.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Toward the middle of the story, I'd almost forgotten about these two \"main\" characters. But I really didn't care for either of them so It didn't affect my enjoyment, but it might affect yours. \r\n*SPOILERS AHEAD*\r\nThe overall story had many loopholes, for example when Yu took Takajou, Tomori and Yusa's powers before leaving the journey he did not once take advantage of those abilitieson his journey. Furthermore, when Yu took the ability of healing, he didn't heal his damaged eye. why? Also, couldn't the people who want to capture the power users raid the school? What is stopping them? However, the main thing that bothered me the most was that despite the danger of exposing themselves as power users they used them without caution on their missions.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode may also disappoint some as I believed that this series could have continued for another seven episodes, at least, instead of rushing the crap out of the end.        \\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite all the issues listed above, I enjoyed the show way too much for these issues to majorly affect my score. I highly recommend this show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If there's anything for me to be thankful of Charlotte, it have motivated me to write a review about the anime. I was one of those \"silent lurkers\" in the site. I know I'm late to the party - being a Summer 2015 anime, I am almost a year too late to say about it. Now that I have time and it looked interesting, I thought it would be a good anime trip. Boy, I was wrong.\r\nLet's start with the story. My interest was piqued when I first saw its first episode aired on Animax last year that laid out a decent opening. The moreepisodes I watch, the more I wonder about the plot of the story. I don't see where Charlotte is going at all, right to the very end. It seemed to be building something every episode, but I don't receive what it was building. Fortunately for Charlotte that was what keeps me going on. I am not sure if I am that dense to not notice such a thing, frankly. The first 6 episodes are pointless and episodic, then they started to roll out a plot at episode 7. With the foreshadowing on earlier episodes, the plot given is predictable. As it only has 13 episodes, the plot is rushed, crammed in the last 7 episodes, the last being the most guilty of the rush as it could easily expanded, if possible, but they fit it into one. Most of the events in Charlotte are bland. If there is ever a spike or climax, it will be gone in the next or few episodes later as it has been resolved. There were many little things that are briefly mentioned in the anime, as an example, the reason why the anime is called \"Charlotte\", but it was quickly tossed aside and acted as if nothing has ever happen, leaving confusion of why such things have happened. Supposedly, \"for plot purposes\". Charlotte felt like it was trying to please many different groups of people at once, but ended up in disappointment to everyone, with seemingly \"romance\", \"comedy\" and \"tragedy\" that had me panned face throughout the episodes. I am disappointed of how it have ended. The expectations that it have been building are not shown to me. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the characters. Pure disappointment. We have an interesting male lead (Yuu Ohtosaka) who isn't the generic protagonists of being an idiot, overpowered, straightforward, and wants to be a hero. However, his traits have vanished into thin air after first episode and turned into a generic lead instead. I don't see his narcissistic self anymore after episode 1 as he was continued to be pushed around by female lead (Nao Tomori) and friends, being a character that is just... there. At episode 7, Charlotte emphasizes his presence of being a main character, but he has turned into a useless one at that point. Nao Tomori is your Kuudere, and since she is a Kuudere, there is not much change of herself. The rest of the gang (Jojiro Takajo and Yusa Nishimori) are just for comedic purposes. Most interesting characters have little screen time that one wonders if they were created just to fill in some holes. None of the characters are fleshed out at all. None of them particularly stand out or memorable to me. Apart of being more trusting towards each other between the four main characters, there is not much to say, because there is nothing to say. Supposedly Nao Tomori is the love interest of Yuu Ohtosaka, but there was NOTHING that portrays how one falls for the other. It's magic, snap your fingers and voila - they are in love. The last two episodes are the worst representative of love between the two characters. The supposedly \"character development\" of the first half of Charlotte didn't make any impact of how I view those characters - it is as if they are just put up on stage for us to know, \"Oh look these are these characters with this thing\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Charlotte seems to be its only saving point, though there is not much to save as it is not too spectacular either. I have a personal hate against its female characters that have huge irises that takes up 95% of their eyes, but I bear with it. The background of the anime is rather outstanding and realistic, a plus point. As usual of anime, the characters have odd colored hair and eyes to stand out from the rest. I don't have much to say about the art of Charlotte as it is quite the norm for most anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening of Charlotte is rather catchy, especially its rapping-like parts. I always skipped the ending so I can't say anything about it. The soundtracks of the anime seemed to be nonexistent, but I do tend to ignore most of it if it wasn't too memorable, and until now I could not recall any soundtracks in that anime itself despite finishing it just the day before writing this.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the anime? None. I am surprised that people rate this anime a 10, from browsing through the scores of the reviews, and seeing that it has almost 8 out of 10 from the total score. Charlotte seems to be a wasted potential, as it continues to build something but nothing from start to finish has surprised me or gone above my expectation (which is average). It has absolutely no re-watch value in my opinion, because there isn't anything I would enjoy at all. Nothing in the anime stands out and it will be forgotten within weeks. If anyone mentions Charlotte, the first thought will not be \"that anime\" but \"a person's name\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was disappointing. I am unsure what Charlotte wants to show to me, or it have shown to me everything but manages to not live my expectation of being an average show. I cannot say that it is \"the worst anime ever\" as that would change at every few seasons or so, but it is definitely one of the bad ones I've watched. It is but a bland anime with little to no plot, with a great dose of rush at the end.",

            "content": "You know, for all the flak that PA Works gets for focusing a lot of their shows on crappy dramas, I think a good portion of their works suck because they don\u2019t have enough drama. There was Angel Beats, which seemed to think that every single part of the story needed to be on dope because it thought subtlety would put viewers to sleep. Hanasaku Iroha had 20% of worthwhile material in its runtime buried under boring \u201canime comedy\u201d and teen drama that refused to move the story and characters forward. Tari Tari wanted to be cheese. Shirobako had the director wear a cowboy outfit.Glasslip is something we all want to forget. And now we\u2019ve got Charlotte, which as the making-of-interview (that has since been taken down so I\u2019m not going to link it) flat-out stated wants so hard to be energetic that the definition of context escaped their brain, went go-karting with Bowser, and came back a jittery wreck.\\n\\n\r\nNow I haven\u2019t been paying much attention to the reaction this show has gotten since it\u2019s written by Jun Maeda and anything he\u2019s involved in is pretty much doomed to spontaneously combust all over itself before the first episode airs. And honestly, I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s still trying to be noticed after all this time. I mean it\u2019s been awhile since Key has been relevant, as you only see them mentioned these days because someone just keeps on discovering the existence of Clannad rather than through any real effort on the company\u2019s own part, which is so knee-deep in irony that the amount of tears shed by the fanbase just can\u2019t compare. And let me tell you, when someone wants to recapture nostalgia in the anime industry, it almost never ends well, as Steins;Gate just can\u2019t seem to get through its overinflated skull.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s not bash the man too much. I mean it\u2019s not like I have anything to add given the number of hammers with his name on it that most people I talk to own. I\u2019m actually kind of glad that Charlotte exists, because I personally found it kind of interesting in how it succumbs to and (barely) avoids a lot of things I don\u2019t like about \u201cvisual novel anime\u201d, and this is a good opportunity to list off my issues with that flawed medium using it as a framing device. Perhaps I can convince VN writers who come across this list to actually make a smooth transition into the medium. And then maybe I can become Iron Man and wipe out all terrorism in the world.\\n\\n\r\n1) Please Establish Personal Stakes Within The First Episode\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watch a premiere, I want to have an idea of what I\u2019m watching and why I should care about it. Since almost all first episodes are only 22 minutes, this usually works by focusing only on one character, finding out what makes him tick, and then introducing a conflict that is both engaging in terms of scale whilst having enough of a narrow focus so that it affects the character in a significant way. Most visual novel anime unfortunately decide the best way to start is to have the characters dick around or participate in unestablished, usually saccharine events whilst trying to find the plot through the various characters and plot elements it (slowly) meets whilst doing so, hoping the audience will have enough trust in what could be rather than what actually is. And anyone who falls for this method gets funny looks from me, especially when they fall for it fifty gazillion times.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is actually one of the things that Charlotte does do right for the most part: having Yu discover his powers, abusing them, getting punished for it, and then given a chance to become a better person. It\u2019s one mistake was that it didn\u2019t make it clear how said redemption would occur. Which didn\u2019t turn out great for the show, but we\u2019ll let the rest of the steps take care of that.\\n\\n\r\n2) Stop Confusing Setup For Story Progression\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m aware that exposition is important in real life as well as in fiction, but visual novels in general seem to only use it as an excuse to world-build or move plot points along, and world-building/plot progression for its own sake is about as interesting as watching somebody play a videogame with said game being The Order 1886. But at least there\u2019s some interaction when you\u2019re doing that sort of stuff with the actual source. Anime doesn\u2019t have any physical interaction from the viewer at all, and thus watching the characters finding random super powered people who will never be important again after they\u2019re dealt with, or establishing rules that will only pay off later and don\u2019t have much of a current purpose is really fucking boring. Puzzle-piece anime needs more to it than just solving a puzzle, because otherwise you\u2019d get those awful walking simulator games like Gone Home or the once-mighty now pitiable Durarara adaptation. And god knows I have enough boredom in my life as is.\\n\\n\r\n3) Quit Using Time Travel as a Story Mechanic\\n\\n\r\nNot that it was that badly used in this anime. I did like how it acknowledged at the end that time travel shouldn't be used as a Deus Ex solution and proceeded to ignore its existence. But I still think something\u2019s gone horribly wrong when you\u2019re blatantly ripping off Madoka, and it wasn\u2019t exactly used well there either.\\n\\n\r\n4) Don\u2019t Masturbate Character Interactions\\n\\n\r\nThis one sort of crosses over into Number 2, but my point is that characters should drive the story. Story should not drive the characters. When I watch characters on-screen, I do not want to see them hang out like they\u2019re at every single party I\u2019ve ever been too (remember, I had kinda strict Asian parents) or watch idol vidoes or the importance of building robots for over four hours! I want to see them go through challenges in their lives with personal stakes and growth at the end of it all. You can have them relax in-between tense moments ala Persona 4, but the tension and central narrative must always still be there because otherwise you\u2019d just get Persona 4 Golden\u2019s nauseatingly sickening additional friendship scenes. And even then, some of said scenes were funny. But as we established sometime ago, anime humor sucks major balls, so good luck with getting me involved in what\u2019s happening by getting me to laugh.\\n\\n\r\n5) Don\u2019t Include Useless Characters In General\\n\\n\r\nSo Charlotte has these two characters - a glasses guy who is basically Youhei Sunohara by way of post-90s Sonic the Hedgehog, and an annoying idol who is slightly more tolerable when she\u2019s possessed by her dead gangster sister - and to say that they add fuck all to the narrative would be such an understatement that it\u2019d make \u201cthis is bad\u201d sound like an accurate representation of your entire apartment complex burning down. An actually good VN anime would have them go surf on a tidal wave and into a volcano far away from me or give them minimal, yet vital screen time whilst convincing me they have lives even if it\u2019s not related to the story. But as we established far back, Charlotte is not a good VN anime and I honestly can\u2019t decide whether it\u2019s good or bad that the show never gave them anything important to do because their present-day screen time was already testing my patience. And that\u2019s not even including everyone else, who either exist to die or just exist to be blatant plot points that could have easily been tackled by characters that had actual meat to them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is up with visual novel writers wanting to put in every stereotype imaginable in the narrative anyways? Yes Maeda, I know fans really loved the fishing guy from Angel Beats, but fans also really love Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2, and he hasn\u2019t had any dignity since then.\\n\\n\r\n6) Enough With The Large Number of Poorly Connected Set Pieces\\n\\n\r\nYou know how visual novels all have multiple routes, usually in the form of each character having their own story and all that? And how visual novel adaptations in the old days decided the best way to please the fans would be to cram them all into the narrative no matter how disjointed and artificial it seemed? Well that practice is all but dead now, but old habits die hard. And a lot of these types of anime seem to come from the school of \u201ccoming up with the set pieces first and then stringing a plot around them\u201d. And boy does it show, because there\u2019s this rock group in Charlotte that pretty much exists solely to have a concert that is barely connected to the plot and could easily have been replaced by something else. And to make matters worse, the concert was nowhere near as good as the one in Angel Beats, let alone something decent like Nana.\\n\\n\r\nNot that it\u2019s an inherently bad method of telling a story, as James Cameron\u2019s Terminator film has proven back in the 80s, but even Naughty Dog hasn\u2019t done a great job at perfecting that method with their Uncharted games so what makes you think people far-less skilled than the best AAA storytellers in the world would do any better, let alone pull off what happened in Episode 11 naturally?\\n\\n\r\n7) Rushed, Poorly-Connected Endings Need to Die\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte's ending isn't actually too bad, but it could have been a lot better than it actually was. Most visual novel anime realize at the end that they had neglected to connect their large number of plot threads throughout their runtime and attempt to tie up as many of them as they can in the final episode to the point that it feels rushed to the point of either deus ex or horrendously lacking in substance beyond those connections. Charlotte keeps its focus on the main character for its finale and unlike Plastic Memories, actually makes him go through real struggles with actual consequences that are brought out by himself as well as his environment before ending on a bittersweet note that nicely caps off his personal journey from dick to flawed Christ. However, it does this at the sacrifice of botching its \"super power as a metaphor for puberty\" angle (because personally, I've never seen a human with the ability to take away teenage angst just by looking at them) and its main female lead ultimately ends up as nothing more than a bit player due to this. It's pretty clearly early on that Nao is supposed to represent the hopeful side of what happens after you \"grow up\", but that doesn't excuse how little she actually gets to do.\\n\\n\r\n8) In Conclusion...\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte has the bones of a half-decent superpower drama, but either it didn\u2019t drink enough milk to grow them properly or said milk was always chocolate and the sugar high caused it to drop down a sewer somewhere. This is probably the first time anybody\u2019s said this, but this is one Key anime that really could have benefitted from having more drama in it. The actual bits where the main has to overcome obstacles that actually progress the story are alright, even if the setup to them is wonky as hell. And the important characters are slightly above average when they're not trying to do bad stand-up comedy. But its visual novel-rooted failures are just too major to really recommend, and it just doesn't go far enough to deliver satisfactorily on its promising start - which is the one thing Maeda has been getting better at over the years admittedly, so baby steps along with a personal note from me that he should quit whilst he\u2019s ahead because I'm pretty sure he's run out of ideas by this point.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the show is a bit of a wash, but I did got a lot of mileage out of finishing the thing. That\u2019s not saying much though, because I also finished and have written quite a bit on Classroom Crisis - another original anime written by a popular VN writer - as well. Thanks for the experience Maruto, although I doubt you\u2019ll be returning said thanks once my review goes up tomorrow.",

            "content": "Just simply looking at the synopsis of this anime makes me want to doze off. There isn\u2019t not a single thing that I found remotely interesting or original in this anime. High schools, teenagers with superpowers, overused slapstick humor, all the typical shit plague most anime nowadays. And it doesn\u2019t help that it is also written by Jun Maeda, a writer whose work always are far more concerned with manipulation the viewers emotions even when it doesn\u2019t make any logical sense. But since I didn\u2019t have anything good to do with my time, I decided to watch this anime despite being put off at first.Now thirteen episodes later, what do I think of it now? Well to put it simply, this show was one of the worst experience with anime I had all year.\\n\\n\r\nTo be blunt, the story of Charlotte is messy and stupid. For the first half of the show, the show is just another slice of life nonsense. To make myself clear, I have nothing against slice of life shows, but this one completely devoid of any charm or wit. None of the humor is particularly funny, since most of it comprised of overused gags and slapstick. Nothing occurs plot wise since all the characters do is dicking around playing baseball, go camping, and help other superpower teens. And you know what? If that was all the show was, I would just discarded as another forgettable rom com and would even bother to write this review. But atlas, Charlotte takes a sudden tone shift and becomes almost an entirely different show. Without spoiling much, the writer tries to make the series far more dramatic and serious. But since there was almost zero effort put in to make the viewers care about the characters or story, everything comes off more comically stupid rather that emotionally touching. The thing becomes unfocused mess with one of the most erratic and inconsistent tone I have seen. It alternates between comedy, moe, sad, intense, and boring at a whim as if this was written by Hideo Kojima. And it doesn\u2019t help that the show rushes so much plot at end it becomes ridiculous. Then the show end on a grand whimper, resolving everything with plot conveniences and deus ex machinas,\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they are flat and shallow as you can get. There are far too many characters for a twelve episode series, and it doesn\u2019t help that the show does very little to make the viewer care for the characters. Instead of trying to flesh the existing characters so the viewer can get to care about them, the show just waste its time on comedy and constantly introducing new characters. Honestly, I can only remember the characters for whatever superpower they have instead of any characteristics or traits. The only character I remember was Yuu because he is just basically a copy of lelouch vi britannia. \\n\\n\r\nEven the animation and soundtrack fail to stick out from the norm. While PA works shows generally look polished and crisp, but this is one looks mediocre at best. The character designs are bland and the only thing about the animation that does stick out were the detailed backgrounds. And even those were wasted on a dull and uninteresting setting.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is a show that tried to be everything. It tried to be a comedy, it tried to be a thriller, it tried to be a tear jerk, and tried to be sci fi. Yet it doesn't focus on any of those aspects and fail to accomplish anything. Charlotte fails to be funny, it fails to have memorable or relatable characters, it fails to have an interesting or coherent world, and it fails make any sense whatsoever. It felt if Jun Maeda wanted to jam a dozen concept in the show instead of being focusing on anything. Half of the show was is the character dicking around, and when the show decided to get an actual plot, the show was almost over. In the end, this show broken beyond repair and should be avoided at all cost.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMessage me if you have any questions or concerns\\n",

            "content": "\u201cThe scars you can\u2019t see are the hardest to heal.\u201d\r\nTomori Nao (Charlotte)\r\nTo start off, I am writing this review so I can really give potential viewers an idea of what this show has to offer, without influencing their opinion with a biased score. This show seems to be a classic hit or miss anime, which is very well reflected in the range of review scores given. Most of the reviews on this show award either a perfect score (10), or an absolute rubbish one (1-4). I think I understand why these ratings are given (and will give my opinions on this later on in thereview), but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to review this show objectively. People who read these reviews shouldn\u2019t be met with a bunch of bad ratings (and discouraged from watching it) just because a couple of people who didn\u2019t enjoy this show as much gave it a 1, because that is just not a rating this show deserves. You might not have enjoyed this show but that doesn\u2019t mean all those people will dislike it as well. The same goes for the people who gave the show a 10. This anime is personally one of my favorites, yet I don\u2019t rate it a 10 as opposed to the other anime in my favorite list due to the fact that I review the show objectively rather than the enjoyment it gave me. I won\u2019t include any hopes I had for this anime, nor my personal feelings towards it. But I digress.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is a 13-episode story about Yuu Otasaka, a teenager with a special ability: he has the ability to slip into people's minds and fully control their body for five seconds. When he uses \u2013 or rather abuses \u2013 this skill for his own good, he is caught by Nao Tomori, a girl from a different school who also has her own special ability: it turns out he is not the only one with powers in this world. Together with Takajou Joujirou she tries to stop every ability user from using their ability so they can live a normal high school life. Yuu joins Nao Tomori and together they try to stop the abuse of abilities in the area, day by day. While the start of this anime feels simple and just like any other \u201csupernatural\u201d slice of life anime (typical Key anime anyone?), Charlotte starts of quite well. The first few episodes introduce us to the characters and really introduce us to the darker story that follows. While the first part of the show should have been a bit shorter (it felt a bit stretched out), I wasn\u2019t too bothered by it as it didn\u2019t make the show boring or repetitive. From episode 7 onwards the show suddenly takes quite a few unexpected turns, and (sadly) starts to feel rushed. There is just too little time (episodes) to tell the story they wanted to tell. Honestly the story had a lot of potential and possibly would have been much better if it had been a 24 episode show, or if the start had been a little faster. I think episodes 6 up and until 13 (especially 13) are the reason some people were severely disappointed by this show. Whether you like Charlotte depends on how much you enjoyed the show up until this point and how much you mind the rushed feel of the second half of the show. Objectively speaking the story as a whole is definitely nothing to be praised, but it isn\u2019t as bad as people portray it to be (it\u2019s probably just not as good as most people hoped it\u2019d be, as like most Key titles it was highly anticipated). That being said, the story is still likely to pull you in from the start and you just might be one of the people who don\u2019t mind the second half as much and enjoy it a lot, so I definitely recommend watching these 13 episodes anyway. Overall I think the story deserves a 5.5; the minimal passing grade. The show could have been a masterpiece if the story wasn\u2019t this sloppy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte absolutely deserves praise for its art: even for 2015 the art is top tier. Everything just looks really clean, the characters look amazing, the colors are great and the art manages to portray the atmosphere of the scene well at all times. It never feels rushed or sloppy and the characters are drawn really well too. There are pretty much no complaints to be made here other than the fact that the animation could have been a little bit better. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and background music in this show is absolutely amazing. The background music is never out of place and really strengthens the mood the scene is trying to portray; the powerful and sad scenes will most likely hit you hard (they sure did for me). The only reason the show doesn\u2019t score a 10 on sound is because I think the OP and ED music weren\u2019t that special or memorable. All in all Charlotte did a great job on the audio of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the characters really are Charlotte\u2019s strongest point. The (main) characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them, but most of all care for them. This allows you to feel sad when something sad happens to the characters (and trust me, you will feel). Because the characters are written so well you keep wondering what will happen to them, which in turn keeps you interested in the rest of the story. All main characters have some very simple and recognizable traits, but this doesn\u2019t mean there is no character development at all. Yuu is the only character that really develops much over the course of the show (and he develops quite well), but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing that the other characters don\u2019t develop as much. The story is pretty short which would have left very little room for the main characters who get less screen time to actually develop well, so it probably would have felt rushed if they did develop a lot. I personally loved the character of Tomori, but I think all of their characters were very likable. The characters in Charlotte are definitely worthy of a near perfect score and really saved the show where the story/plot lacked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t take the enjoyment into account in my final rating, but to me Charlotte was incredibly enjoyable to the point where I rated the show a 10 on my MAL and it became one of my absolute favorites. I think the show is really powerful and is able to really play with your feelings: the sad moments hit me like a ton of bricks, I laughed a lot at the earlier episodes and I have been genuinely happy for the characters. I personally wasn\u2019t so bothered by the sloppy second half of the show because I was still hit really hard by the powerful moments of the show and still cared a lot about the characters. I couldn\u2019t refrain myself from watching all 13 episodes in a row. That being said, objectively speaking the show is far from perfect. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I honestly recommend watching Charlotte, as it\u2019s only 13 episodes and you definitely might be one of the people to whom this show is a masterpiece. Just don\u2019t go in with ridiculous expectations like most people did and you just might enjoy yourself!\\n\\n",

            "content": "What can I say about Charlotte. I will start with the art of this Anime. To which it was very well done. Honestly coupled with the characters, are the best points for this Anime. With the art you don't get the simple rushed effort kinda look from it. What stood out for me with this art was the eyes, they were very well done. As for characters, very good in it's aspect. They were well designed, simple but dynamic. As well the characters of the story had good development, allowed for quick attachment to each of their own. Fortunately the art and characters of Charlottesaved this series from a lower grade, from my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe story started promising, the first couple episodes were alright. Afterwards from around episode four to the start of seven it got stale, had some unnecessary events and so on. All the way up until a very confusing transition in the late parts of the series. Ultimately the few stale parts of the story lowered how I felt about the plot advancements. As a whole it ended well enough to earn a seven.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound on the other hand. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really a strong point. For a Key anime, I was fairly disappointed with this. A lot of the sounds seemed to be recycled to save time and effort. As can be said for the voice acting. It was good, but a lot of phrases and such were over used. To where the effect of such was redundant. The good about the voice acting was they really did seem to fit in with the characters quite well, a saving grace. I liked the OP.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Charlotte was an enjoyable anime. My personal ranking would put it around 8.5/10. Worth a watch if you are looking for a simple but powerful anime.",

            "content": "I am a big fan of Jun Maeda. While his style of characterization is always a bit direct, and he is a bit preachy with his themes, he's always been careful to try to weave fully-developed people into these fictional worlds of his. He's master at crafting characters that audiences are guaranteed to care about, making their eventual death all the more painful.\r\nFor these reasons, as well as the overall premise, Charlotte caught my interest. Unfortunately, as the series rolled on, I started to wonder to myself whether this show was capable of doing anything right as it slides like a derailed locomotive to itsinevitable doom.\\n\\n\r\nMinor spoilers for the first 3 to 4 episodes ahead:\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10): One thing I have never recognized Maeda as is a strong storyteller. His characters have always been the thing that keeps his rather simplistic plots together. In his romance dramas (Kanon, Air and Clannad), most of the big emotional plot turns had something to do with fantastical elements that either affected people's memories, or caused big changes in the plot. So, naturally, it would seem this is the first time Maeda has tackled a story that's almost as plot driven as it is character-driven (especially during the second half).\\n\\n\r\nDoes it work? No, it doesn't work at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt started off with the declaration that powers were temporary. I was disappointed by this reveal greatly because it meant learning to control your powers would ultimately be pointless, as one would just lose them once adolescence ends. It also nips the potential plot point of having to live with such powers for the rest of one's life in the bud. However, unlike my siblings, I was willing to forgive this.\\n\\n\r\nI could not, however, forgive the numerous other issues that cropped up in the series.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, our antagonists are a faceless void, a combination of government-funded research organizations and criminal syndicates. When they discover that these young people have powers, they forcibly take them from their homes and experiment on them to see exactly how strong their powers are. In fact, their experimentation is so torturous, it cause those who undergo it to become nearly lifeless husks of their former selves that are discarded once they cannot work anymore. Despite how controversial this would be if it was made public, not a single person blows the whistle on the fact that all of these teenagers are being taken from their homes and brought into facilities where they are treated very poorly. Maeda never tries to rationalize why these groups would do this instead of offering these people health care, extra cash, or an increased rep. to get them to work for them. Why earn these folks' disdain if you can get loyal servants through more diplomatic means? If they can find these super beings so effectively, why do they have to routinely capture and torture those who show up? Furthermore, where are the filmmakers who take advantage of these abilities and put them on the big screen? Where is the outcry of rage against this horrible mistreatment? Where are the dissentors at all? Why experiment with these super-powered humans until they became unable to function when you can use their present applications to great effect? All you have to do is test their abilities in safer ways, and if it doesn't work, you bring them back to their homes. But these scientists and syndicates never even try to act rational throughout the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Maeda does little to answer any of these complaints. There are no alternatives to the grand scheme hatched by the heroes near the end of the story; there is no non-linearity and there is no alternatives to the plot he's created. Everything feels so railroaded in this story; there was only ONE twist in this show that legitimately made me go \"Huh, that's actually pretty clever\" and that was the only time I felt that way about this show. Everything that happens in the plot is a result of stupid evil on the part of the villains, and chronic idiocy on the part of our heroes. And although I cannot speak about the latter half of the show in detail, as it is riddled in spoilers, the story consistently finds new ways to remind you of how unintelligent it is about resolving its conflicts.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10): After watching Tari Tari, Charlotte was a surprising disappointment for me in this department. The colors feel washed out, and the animation is surprisingly limited at times. There are moments where the latter shines, but for the most part, it's a rather lackluster affair.\\n\\n\r\nRedeeming it, however, are those BEAUTIFUL landscapes P.A Works loves to boast it has. Every layout is rendered with detail and care. Whenever the on-screen action wasn't catching my eye, I'd turn to those amazing backgrounds, and go \"Wow, this is what art is capable of . . .\"\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the character designs aren't great, but they get the job done. Na-Ga has basically settled on what design he likes for his characters, and they are quite appealing. There isn't a lot of variety, and our lead in particular has a boring design, but I still found them fitting nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10): It's rare for me to say that a soundtrack by Key is lacking in quality, but this one really is. None of the scores are memorable at all. I can only recall pieces of a couple of tracks that might have been decent. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening, however, has a really strong impact. It's well-animated, and the atmosphere of the music and the vocals sets the tone for this series very well. It's a shame the ED is nowhere near as memorable. There are a couple of insert songs that the show uses. One is particularly effective (despite its awkward English), but the others are rather forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10): As I mentioned before, Maeda's characters are normally pretty good. Here, unfortunately, most of them range from inconsistent to utterly under-developed.\\n\\n\r\nYuu Otosaka is our main character. He is a sociopathic teenager who uses his ability to posses others to his own advantage. He cheats on tests, sexually harasses his classmates, and beats up people he doesn't like. He even stages a car accident that has to be precisely timed, just so he can earn the affection of the school's madonna. Once his tactics are exposed by Nao and crew, however, he's forced to transfer to a new school and only use his powers when he's instructed to.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, this is actually a pretty interesting character. The marketing wasn't lying when they tease him as being the worst Key lead yet. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately . . . He shows very little dissatisfaction with his new state of affairs. He's only passively resentful of the fact he's stuck working with these new friends of his and warms up to them much quicker than one would expect. Need I remind you, these people came out of nowhere, and took him out of his self-indulgent lifestyle BY FORCE. Yet, he show little signs of really despising these people. This could have been played for drama as well as the gradual character development Maeda normally employs, but instead, our writer decides to change his demeanor into something much more reminiscent of our archetypal high school protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nPredictably, Yuu eventually becomes a much nicer person overtime. There is some continuity that recognizes his selfish nature from before, but the show is way too fast to turn him into a decent enough guy. However, the biggest problem with his development is one that's more subtle.\\n\\n\r\nYuu develops an EXTREMELY strong empathy for total strangers by the time we reach the last third of the series that's never really explained. While he has had time to grow close friends with the Student Council and to care for his school at large, he hasn't really been shown a solid reason to care for everyone on the same level. At the core of it, he's still a self-absorbed person who fights and does things either for himself, or the people he cares about. The only reason he willingly gave up his former lifestyle was because his friends (particularly his love interest) wanted him to. Yes, he has a soft spot for his little sister, but that didn't stop him from acting like a total jerk before. Maeda never adequately explains why he becomes such a chivalrous, boy-scout like hero, a plot point that comes up in a rather infamous episode late in the series. This inconsistent characterization was the central reason I never really felt invested in his character.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Nao Tomori is our only solid character in the class. She keeps a tight leash on our lead to ensure he doesn't misbehave. Of the cast, she's the only one I was truly captivated by. Her range of interests, emotions, and convictions really reach the par for the craftsmanship Maeda normally shows in his characters. Even better, she's rather unique for a Key lead as well. Not normally do we have a lead who defaults to a more blunt, rather abrasive demeanor without coming off as a tsundere. From her character design to her seemingly uncharacteristic (yet fitting) fangirling over her favorite band Zheind, Nao really was a joy to watch, and she MADE the romance between her and Yuu work.\\n\\n\r\nJoujiro Takajou is our next main character, and at the start of the show, he had a lot of potential. Since our lead was established as a rather over-the-top jerk, he's a foil in a much different way. He's polite, friendly, and rather calm about the awkward situations around him. He provides information about different aspects of the characters for our lead in an understandable fashion, and I couldn't wait for Maeda to elaborate more about his character.\\n\\n\r\nOnly . . . Maeda never does. Joujiro never gets a chance to become a fleshed out character. After episode 1, his dialogue tends to get drowned out in running gags that are only funny the first couple times, and he only has one especially meaningful conversation that reveals something about his character in episode 5. After the first half, he and fellow lead Yusa/Misa become very unimportant, and that's disappointing for people who were billed as main characters.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of, Yusa and Misa are two characters in one.  One is a giddy, super-friendly pop star, the other a hilariously abrasive older sister. The contrast between the two makes up a number of the gags in the first half of the series. Unfortunately . . . They don't get a lot of adequate development either. Much like Joujiro, her dialogue is overwhelmingly filled with gags that don't really expand on her character at all. They just repeat broad traits about her over and over again. Unlike Takajou, however, she does get an arc that's resolved. It's not as much as I'd like, but her resolution does remind me that Maeda can write convincing characters when he puts his mind to it.\\n\\n\r\nAyumi is exactly the type of character you'd expect her to be; she's a very childish archetypal \"onii-chan\" character who's only distinctive quality is how overbearingly happy she is. She never develops a significant character beyond this, however. It's rather depressing when we see a scene from when she was eight years old, and her dialogue sounds more mature than it does now when she's a middle schooler. Hah . . .\\n\\n\r\nThere are a decent number of supporting characters and episodic plot characters who encompass the \"find a super-powered being, and get him to stop using it\" part of the first five episodes' formula. While a couple of these characters get close to being meaningful, none of them ultimately stuck out to me as being effective. There are a bunch of other characters who I can't talk about in detail without spoiling certain aspects of the plot, but the ones who aren't painfully flat never have their potential fully realized, a flaw which seems to be a theme for this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10): What really upsets me about Charlotte, however, is I rarely found myself enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nThere were times I'd get excited about the once-a-week plots, only to find out they never lived up to what they promised they would be. I normally like Jun Maeda's sense of humor, but here, it just didn't work for me. There were too many gags that would only work a couple of times that were played ad nauseum with very little variety, and they did little to establish the characters and their interactions beyond what we already know. Worse, the plot didn't have a lot of luster for me because inside I knew many of the people I would see in the plot weren't going to get adequately developed. That feeling of anticipating failure is not a fun way to watch a series, and it really hurt my enjoyment of this show when I knew it wasn't going to meet my expectations in various ways.\\n\\n\r\nNow, every so often, there was an occasional gag that hit the mark, and Nao was a solid character that made the show a tiny bit palatable. But, the ridiculous number of plot-holes, the inconsistent/under-developed nature of the rest of our cast, and the underwhelming artwork made this feel like a show the creators didn't really try their best at.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there's one other thing about this show that really ticked me off; the thematic conclusion of the series. The super powers are treated by the main cast like they are disease. Despite the fact only a couple are activated subconsciously, the consensus seems to be the world would be better without them. Why? Because these uber-powerful evil organizations want to persecute us for them, so it would be best if they go away. That's right; these special gifts that can be used to help people are deconstructed into a sickness that causes trouble for no rational reason. These powers are even used to benefit others a couple of times in the show, but this is seen as not enough to justify them. Why would you take away gifts that can be used to benefit mankind? If someone can find a way to use a limited version of invisibility, or healing, or pyrokinises to help the world, why in the world should they have them taking away before its time? Has Jun Maeda heard anything of compromise? This is a rather important part of the show's theme, and it really ticks me off that the show reaches a thematic conclusion that I'd find wrong even in-universe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10): I wasn't asking for the next Clannad for this show; all I wanted was a well-executed series that delivered, if nothing else, solid characters that made a questionable plot worked. All the pieces were there, so there is no reason the series should have been much less than that.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, it was. Charlotte fails to deliver in nearly every category, proving itself to be the first work by Maeda/Key Visual Arts I can confidently say is bad.",

            "content": "The very first word that comes to mind regarding this anime is disappointment.\r\nWhen I first discovered this title, I skipped over it because the synopsis didn't intrigue me enough; and I wish that was where the story ended.\r\nAfter watching another one of Jun Morita's works, I revisited this title and decided to give it another shot. Initially, I was glad that I decided to return and watch this show as it displayed a lot of promise. But that's all this anime did. It rarely converted its potential into actual entertainment.\r\nThe first half of the cour focuses on the student council's primary activity: subjugating adolescents capableof wielding supernatural powers in order to protect them from dangerous third-parties. Certainly, these episodes are integral in developing the viewers' emotional attachments with the characters. However, the show fails in that regard as there is very little character development for the viewers to be able to identify with any of the show's characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the viewers have almost no emotional attachments to the characters when the second half of the cour arrives. Sure, when tragic events begin to befall the characters, there is some emotion present. But that emotion is only the result of the viewers' sympathy and not because of their emotional investment. In other words, the viewers pity the characters only because they themselves wouldn't want to be in the characters' situation. If the viewers were to emotionally invest in the characters, the emotional devastation that these events attempt to arouse would be realized completely. Unfortunately, this is not the case and the events that transpire in the second cour tend to fall flat in achieving this.\\n\\n\r\nMost of this is excusable and wouldn't warrant such a harsh rating. However, the final few episodes are extremely lackluster and frustrating. In these episodes, the amount of thought that the characters give to their decisions is less than or equal to the amount of screen time that they get to reach such a decision. Even when these decisions appear to take hours, days, and/or even weeks to reach, the characters fail miserably in remembering and utilizing their prior experiences to make competent decisions.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, information regarding the events that transpire in the final episode is omitted. The other characters warn the main character of the consequences of his actions, but not one of them reveals the source of these consequences. Is it because there is a negative side effect to the main character's ability? Is it because his actions may generate an internal conflict over morals? Would either of these even warrant such consequences? I don't know. It's easy for the viewers to assume that one of these possibilities is true, but I personally believe that this question requires at least a hint to adequately satisfy the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing I'll mention about the final episode is the pacing. Whereas the last twelve episodes take place over a few weeks at most, the final episode takes place over what should be months. That is way too long a period of time to condense into a single episode. Especially when the episode requires multiple successive time skips to achieve it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everything else, the art and animation were fine. It's modern; nothing really to note. Same for the sound and music. The only thing that's worth noting here is the first ED \"Yake Ochinai Tsubasa\", which I took some pleasure in listening to.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this anime fails to present relatable characters and to adequately foster the emotional relationship between its viewers and its characters. At times, it also fails to provide the viewers with information essential to their understanding of the characters and the universe containing them. All of this culminates into the production of an awful anime.",

            "content": "Being a long lasting fan of Jun Maeda's stories and him never actually having disappointed me before, I dived into Charlotte with high expectations; everything was his style: the music, the designs, the characters, the same formula used for the first episodes of random. I armed myself with patience knowing that after random-fun times, my heart will start breaking bit by bit for every character of the story...and I had that to a certain degree, though forced, till all the plot crumbled and hit its face flat on the floor instead (after episode 7 if my memory isn't playing tricks on me). Review might containminor spoilers, nothing big, but just to give an idea of what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because I tend to believe that Jun Maeda just sat one night at his desk and layered down all possible outcomes and ideas for Charlotte and then a storm came and ravaged his desk, messed up the papers of the original outline of the story and somebody went like \"f**k that! Let's make it all fit instead of sticking to one idea, even though we have no idea how to execute it!\". GENIUS!-not.\\n\\n\r\nFirst main problem was the execution of the antagonist (evil scientists). They weren't present whatsoever through the show, but we were shown the consequences of their work instead. That would have been marvellous, but then there's no actual consistency to it, though they try. Trying not to spoil, they appear only to once again disappear as if nothing ever happened.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the fact that Charlotte didn't know how to let certain dead people stay dead. I know that Maeda-san did something similar in Little Busters and Clannad but it was never that out of the blue, it was a consequence to a process, a consequence of the end of a journey or a parallel world. In Charlotte it was none of it, it was just convenience. And even after all that, we still do not know what happened to a certain yandere....Not the first time and not later either. \\n\\n\r\nAs a consequence of the story being quite fast and a whole load of ideas being smashed against eachother, I had no time to actually get attached to any of the characters. I didn't cry or feel sorry for neither of them, even though some moments had the right atmosphere to make me feel sorry (at lest Maeda-san didn't fail me on that), I almost WANTED to feel sorry, but looking at how they got there equaled in a big NOPE. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters had potential. I loved Yuu as a main character and his geass-like powers, I loved Nao as well for being quite unique, but that's where my love stops, since as I said before I didn't have any time to get to know Yusa or Takajou or the other side characters, but for some reason they were treated like important during the last few episodes, that they were part of something when the plot just shoved them to a side because TWIST= more important side characters.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the whole last episode. (or last two) It's a huge sin on its own. It's literally mixing together what could have been the premise of a whole season in only 25 minutes. I'm not joking. It's like when you make a character go visit, all of a sudden, every country in the world in the last episode and you see months go by, years gone by, your character grows, but you see not even a quarter of it all...oh wait. Hello, Charlotte! \\n\\n\r\nI didn't even appreciate the OST this time mostly because of the ZHIEND songs (I think it was LIA?) which were in a VERY bad Engrish with lyrics that were mostly nonsense. I do save some of the background tracks however. \\n\\n\r\nArt-wise it was really beautiful. The Opening had one of the best animations I've seen this year, shame that it didn't really count anything in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my enjoyment for it died at the first half when I started to try and put 1+1 together. I can forgive. Really. I can forgive maybe one disappointment, two, but Charlotte made me want to play CinemaSins by the end of it.\\n",

            "content": "I'll be blunt in saying this anime was such a major disappointment.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\n-Episode 1 started very well. I actually really liked episode 1, and the whole world-building aspect is done very well by Jun Maeda. However, the quality of the show is super inconsistent. It starts off well, and then just falls apart at episode 3. It slightly picks itself up at episode 7,but then the series just tapers off to being absolutely terrible.\r\n-Romance feels extremely forced, and there are many times in the storyline where the decisions made by the characters are just not common sense or realistic in any way.\r\n-Key is known forthe \"feels\". Nothing here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n-Great job here. No complaints. Characters move very well and look good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\n-Meh. Key has produced better stuff. I would like to direct your attention to Rewrite's OST. Compared to all other anime, the sound is still just meh.\\n\r\n-The opening is alright, but nowhere close to other stuff by Key again. Ending is alright in the same respects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\n-The problem with this anime is that none of the characters seem to show any character development, and there are too many characters to full feel a connection to any of them. Yu is incredibly inconsistent in his behaviour, and Nao, although would be my favourite key main heroine on paper, does not have sufficient backstory, development, or meaningful screentime. Really, the anime should not have just stuck with the five characters it began with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\n-I guess if you wanted to see an easy plot and good art that it would be slightly enjoyable. But no, this was just plain boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\n-Very hard to watch. Would not recommend. If you want Jun Maeda, turn to Kanon, Air, or Clannad, which at least are successful in tearing you up. This just makes you go wtf.",

            "content": "TL:DR. For someone who is a Key fanboy and considers Clannad as one of the best animes in existence, this one is a sad miss from Key and PA Works. The first half might be underwhelming but at least, it knows where it intends to go. In my opinion, the anime ends at episode ten and I am afraid to say that the cohesiveness of the show also ended there. It can be also noted that Charlotte is a fascinating case of how hype can crush a show towards the end. If you are looking for drama bombs that could blur your logic as youare bawling from those poignant scenes, this is not the anime you hoped to look for. Yes, I lowered my grade for this one. Rewatching it left a very sour taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the full review. Minor spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is probably the most hyped show this season for a good reason. Key is the reason behind Clannad and Kanon 2006 and it also collaborated with PA Works in the hit Angel Beats! last 2010. The two paired again this time yet it is not exactly as great like the last one.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of Charlotte was probably the one I liked the most from a Key anime. It was as if it peeked some from Kyoto Animation's joke book and implemented it PA Works style. The next two episodes aired and Charlotte was still coherent as we were introduced to other main characters. The jokes were still funny that time and Maeda did a commendable job for introducing us the world the characters have and their circumstances in a span of three episodes. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not at the level of other Key titles when it comes to artwork, this is one of the best looking animes this season. The character designs are pretty good to the extent that I can differentiate them from other PA Works show. The hues were also masterfully used in this show. Light colors are used during comedic scenes but when something ominous is about to happen, the shades change to very dark colors. Artwork is also consistent with only minor hiccups (some in episode 3 and 4) but not noticeable enough to distract the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also good and is mostly well timed with the jokes and crucial events. The background drawings also have good detail which can be said as one of their best. \\n\\n\r\nAs regards to background music, it has been shown in the past that Key animes are strong musically and this one is not an exception. The opening song of Charlotte is probably my most favorite this season. Even the story failed as a whole, it's the section where it tries to resuscitate its plot and it nearly worked. \\n\\n\r\nThen episode four came then it became the worst Charlotte episode which showed the dullest baseball match from Key and aired twenty minutes of nothingness. It has been erratic since then. Episode five is a bit better but could've been good if it focused on the interaction between the two main leads and showed some of their circumstances, especially Yuu's. In addition, it suffered from horrible fast pacing given that its preceding episode is a filler. My opinion is that these two episodes should've been merged as one because it did not add anything major in the show. One may argue that these are shown to focus with the character development of the four leads but Takajo and Yusa have only been used for comedic purposes so far and they did not contribute anything with Charlotte's legitimately good episodes. Worse, these fillers caused the show to cram its contents on the last parts, much to the viewer's chagrin and dismay.\\n\\n\r\nSome episodes were considerably better but Key has shown its glaring weaknesses in the past with its execution. Introducing a new character in the former to move the plot forward is a good idea in paper but Charlotte's execution was not good enough to warrant their importance in the series. The latter showed how good Maeda is in portraying depression but its effect was reduced because it has to be hooked with good past episodes for some sense of belief. Also, the problem presented in these episodes was resolved all too quick.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode eight is one of the better Charlotte moments but it is still plagued by some questionable execution with its first half. The humor feels off and I sincerely believe that Takajo was reduced to a comic relief that is a hit or miss. However, this episode benefited from some organic drama that somehow forged the main leads' connection further.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made me really frustrated with it is the sheer greatness of episode 9. That episode alone is enough to change my perception with this show from meh to something that has potential. It's perfectly executed, the plot is evenly paced and it gave answers to the fundamental questions the viewers have in this show. While the tenth episode continues to give us answers in a Charlotte universe, its manner of storytelling honestly killed the excitement I had the last episode. The same can be said with the penultimate episode. Although it's now late to save the show from being mediocre to good at that point, it forged touching character interaction that somehow made me invest with the leads. \\n\\n\r\nThe first ten episodes already told an already complete story that is not stellar but at least coherent. Then it suffered from a schizophrenic plot and told the last parts as if it came from its sequel. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not as bad as episode four, episode eleven is one of the worst Charlotte episodes which really hurt this series more. The show is now suffering from the fillers it had in the past because things are happening in a very awful fast pacing. Shunsuke was reduced to a panicking leader and it dropped a drama bomb that didn't feel anything in my opinion. Its worst flaw is it feels like an episode from a sequel and not as one of the climactic moments of this series.\\n\\n\r\nTo add more salt in its flaws, I sincerely believe that Charlotte has failed to incorporate the sense of possibility (or impossibility) when it tried to land for a grand ending. As a result, the finale needs to be patched because of glaring plot holes (seriously, how can a passport got powerful like that) and any poignant moment, was totally off the heads of the viewers now since they got more questions to ask as if we are still in the middle of a single cour series. The ending is also a typical Key ending with Deus Ex Machina being thrown for the sake of happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe way on how the characters are handled is the worst aspect of the show. Aside from Yuu, all other characters are sorely underdeveloped. They are mostly cheap plot device or they exist for comedic purposes. Even with its good episodes, I suppose that its problem with giving proper role and development with its characters is its biggest flaw. Take Shunsuke and the Zhiend singer for example, they only appeared at the latter part of their respective episodes but they practically stole the show from everyone else who made an appearance beforehand while Yusa and Takajo are relegated for Charlotte's comedic hijinks. The latter two also do not have prominent roles in the show's crucial moments which makes me question their existence for that long as Charlotte is concerned. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Charlotte is nowhere near the worst but the hype due to the writing staff as well as PA Works' visual prowess crushed it which will be forever remembered as one of the traits of 2015 anime summer season.",

A story full of comedic, sad, and tense moments that will rustle your jimmies.\r\nNow, I am not an anime reviewer. I'm not even a serious anime watcher. I am a casual. As a casual, I believe that any anime is worth the watch if there are any good points to it. It doesn't matter if the majority of the anime community claims that an anime is bad, if there areany moments in an anime that made you laugh, or gave you a ticket for the feels train, or gave you a sense of triumph when the main character did something cool, then it's #worf.\\n\\n\r\nThis especially applies to Charlotte. This anime has been the subject of hate to a lot of anime reviewers out there, mainly due to one thing: unoriginality. I've seen a lot of comments along the lines of: Dang bruh, this anime is just like Angel Beats! Special kids making an organization in their school? White haired heroine? WOW. It's basically a rip off of another, more awesome anime! It's even rushed at the end, just like Angel Beats! Fight me bruh.\\n\\n\r\nWell, sure, originality is a good thing for anime, but that doesn't mean unoriginality is necessarily a bad thing. Anime has come a long way, you can't really expect every new anime to be the newest, most original thing ever. In my opinion, when one anime is \"similar\" to another anime, especially one as good and well received as Angel Beats, it makes me more excited to watch it. After all, since I loved Angel Beats, the humor, the feels, and all of that, I knew that Charlotte would give me a good impression because of its similarities so Angel Beats. Its like how I knew that Pizza Hut cheese sticks dipped in tomato sauce were gonna be delicious because I like pizza.\\n\\n\r\nPros and Cons of Charlotte?\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Nao is a good waifu candidate.\\n\r\n- Protagonist isn't exactly a good guy in the beginning, and has a Ledouche personality. Most people don't like how he becomes a plain good guy later on, but I find his transition from douche to good guy pretty good.\\n\r\n- There's an idol!!!!\\n\r\n- Every single character has different flaws, which means that you'll find at least one to sympathize with. \\n\r\n- A lot of funny moments, like with Nao's sarcasm, Ayumi's shipping crusade and her quirkiness, and Joujirou's exaggerated stunts. During some of the jokes, especially with Nao, the art quality decreases A LOT which I find funny.\\n\r\n- Some of the feels parts are pretty unpredictable imo, though it could be my denseness.\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- The story is sometimes a viola player, and rushes.\\n\r\n- I wish there was more romance involved. (PLS)\\n\r\n- The timing on some comedic moments is... awkward...\\n\r\n- The last episode is like literally from Russia.\\n\r\n- This anime is less than 24 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nThe story is the worst part of Charlotte. The pacing is bad, the plot and premise are interesting but not special, but I still found it intriguing. Sure it's rushed, but by the end of it, I didn't really care. It started slice of life-ish, with the characters doing their thang. Their routine is pretty cool and I find it fun to follow. That's basically the 1st half of the series, and I think this is why most people find the pacing in this show to be pretty bad. The 1st half of the show is basically the squad meeting new characters, doing their duties, blah blah blah, and the 2nd half is where all the drama is, which results in all the actual plot being rushed. Either way, even when rushed, I found the drama part thrilling. Oh well, opinions, amirite?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nIf I can draw and animate this well, my life would be complete. The characters look either really cool or really cute, and the background art is like porn for the eyes. Especially in the ED song, with the city background and the night sky, it gave me a chilling sense of nostalgia, and that is one reason I enjoyed this anime so much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are really catchy, and as a songwriter, and I can personally say that the music in this anime was really good. The ED is my favorite piece in the anime, and just like the art, it gave me a lot of nostalgic feels for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nLike I said before, I love the characters. Some people say that they are one dimensional, but I actually think they have interesting personalities. They aren't original characters per-se, but I still had a lot of emotional attachment to them. Especially Ayumi, cause she is adorable af. However, the show didn't really introduce a lot the characters so well, like I said before, since the first half of the show was getting the main cast together, and Yusa didn't even do much anyways. I feel like the reason why a lot of people don't like the cast of Charlotte is because they don't really fit into the story to well, but I feel like on their own, they are pretty cool cast of cats.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nDespite the obvious flaws this show has, I watched each episode right when they came out, and I was always excited for the next episode. Even now, I still can't wait for the special that's coming out in March.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nLike all anime, it's not for everyone, but I loved it. In terms of a quality story, this show had a lot of potential but didn't quite live up to it. If it had more episodes, I'm sure it would have been 2x better.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, I have read a lot of reviews of this series, and I find two kind of people, the one that hates it a lot, and the one that thing is the holy grail of this year. I'm in a point where I think is good, but not to a fanboy level. Also there's going to be a bit of spoiler.\r\nStory: 7.5\r\nHere's where I found most hate in a lot people, and I think that they were looking for the most oustanding thing in the world...but also gotta say I understand them. The plot is really strange, that maybe the most demanding people will sayis the most stupid thing ever, that make no sence and got a lot of plot-holes. But, if you're like me and don't really thing about the plot itself but how is executed, then you also could found somethings that could piss you off.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem for me is that doesn't have enough exposition, there are lots of moment where you could think, why does that happened? how does that happend? specially in the last chapters, it go so fast that a lot of the time you couldn't follow it at all, to the point that there's a part where the main character travels around the world, spending a lot of time, and even get to the point of insanity. That sound so cool, but when you put it in a 20 minutes format, doesn't work at all.\\n\r\nAlso there are moment where you can notice that makes not sence at all. But I say, it doesn't have to make sense always, I mean, is series of young people with powers, not the fucking Godfather. If we try to find every flaw,  every error and every non-sense thing everything, then the super-hero genre would have died a long time ago.\\n\r\nSo, at the end, when you find the thread of the bad stuff, you're going to be in serious troubles, because you are going to find bad thing after bad thing. Basically, I say watch what is happening, because the why and the how doesn't make sense at all. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works animations is always outstanding, so, I'm not going to stuck here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe music in general was good, but I thing it needed a bit more of personality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\\n\r\nAnother difficult topic, because, I was really in the middle of thinking if they where great or awful, and at the end, I tough they were great.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to center in the main character, Yu Otosaka. In the first chapter, they put him like an arrogant, intelligent and even kinda like the bad guy, and I tough it was awesome, and in times of aweful main characters that are almost the same, it felt really fresh, but then in the next chapter, well, it's like another character, not a bad one, but, yeah totally different.\\n\r\nThis pissed off a lot of people, and I also would be angry, if there wasn't a little detail, PEOPLE CHANGE, and more when they're in a situation where they could lose everything they love. In fact, I think that it make him a more complex and human character, because he's worried that he could lose the rest of his family (his little sister), to the point that he could change his almost perfect life. Also, he became arrogant because he discovered his power, and use it without responsability, and start to think that he was better than anyone else. If I remember well, that's one of the most basic lessons in super-hero history, \"A great power requires a great responsability\", and when the big fist of reallity hits him, he does what normal people do, he CHANGE.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to talk about the rest of the cast, because I could do a bible of it, and I don't want that, so, let's finish this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is good, and I say it would get even better, but a lot of decisions were pretty bad, and also I think it was too short. Yeah, it can get awkward at times, and if you watch it as if you were watching a Kubrick's movie, then is not your type of anime.\\n",

            "content": "I really felt as if I needed to do a review on this one. This is probably the most moving anime I've seen since Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, and that's really saying something (I still cry about that show). \r\nI was actually drawn to this show by the art style. I take a great interest in manga/anime art, which is probably one of the sole reasons I still read manga. I saw how cute this art style was so I was like screw it, why the hell not. I'll go for it. \r\nThe first episode was that classic sort of \"Oh my fucking godI have a superpower!!!!11!1!11!! WOW!!!!!!!!!!112!!!12?,\" but I still enjoyed it, I wanted to keep watching. As the show progressed, the meaning got deeper, and I started to see the point. The way Yu's viewpoint changed was massive. He went from a selfish prick that used his superpower to make his life perfect to a boy that was truly concerned for others like himself, wanting to protect them and save them from their fate. \\n\r\nI really marveled at Yu and Nao's relationship. I mean, I'm a sucker for romance, I love shoujo, but these two had something different. It was romance, it was indeed, but it was different. It was a romance that budded from a friendship, or an alliance. And in the beginning, they didn't seem to like each other at all. Nao's charm and personality got to Yu, you could see he was slowly falling for her, and it was absolutely the cutest thing.\\n\r\nAnother relationship/dynamic I loved was that of Yu and Ayumi, his little sister. She was one of the only things he loved, and it hurt so much when she died. He fell into a depression, a dark world without the one person he's known, his precious little sister. Also, I think it's the way Ayumi returns these feelings. She loves her big brother more than anything. This is literally the best siblingship I've ever seen in an anime (no, Oreimo doesn't count).\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this anime was the cast and characters. I loved every single one with a burning passion, and that's super rare for me, I'm as picky as they come with anime characters. Yu, Nao, Yusa, Jojiro, Ayumi, Misa, Kumigami, and Shunsuke were the best ensemble I've ever seen. Bravo to Charlotte, I'd watch a second season in a heartbeat!",

            "content": "Honestly I wasn't planning on watching Charlotte just because the synopsis sounded not so special and the trailer wasn't too interesting either, but I watched it anyway just to see how it went as there was a lot of excitement surrounding it and I had absolutely no idea where it was coming from at the time. I actually did not find out the name attached to the series til I was a few episodes in having not watched any of Jun Maeda's stories. But Charlotte only proved that's it's possible to take a simple superpower story and completely botch it by getting too complicated.\r\nStory:\r\nKids getmagic powers which they some how lose when they grow out of adolescence. An organization is formed to protect these kids. A huge organization that is literally in broad daylight in the form of numerous schools in Japan. MC, Otosaka Yuu, uses his ability to advance himself throughout middle school with no one the wiser before being caught by the superpower police, the student council of the special school.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, the idea of hiding your abilities is frequently reiterated throughout the start of the series, but the main characters seem to try their very best to make sure that someone can find out. Partially this is for comedic effect, but nonetheless it completely disregards any notion of secrecy the show constantly mentions. At one point the head of the student council tapes someone using his ability and shows it to a normal who can't believe what just happened, but absolutely nothing comes of this. It's video evidence for Christ's sake. Can this really be called caution and secrecy?\\n\\n\r\nThe crew goes about collecting ability users and getting them to agree to stop being blatant idiots with their abilities so they won't get caught. This was the perfect time to make thoughtful cases of how kids used there abilities had to stop doing so. But they were all straight forward. The only occasion where someone used there ability somewhat discreetly in public and was forced to stop was MC in episode 1, and there was no somewhat controversial case in which you have sympathy towards someone perhaps needing to use their ability based on circumstance and the student council having to stop them anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe show later takes a absolute turn towards hell. Some ridiculous plot is revealed in which the cast's fear of being caught by researchers comes into play and is revealed in the most convoluted way possible. It felt like I skipped a good 5 episode when I watched that one, that was how hard to plot twisted. Since I could hardly take the show seriously before, I was definitely couldn't be bothered when things actually got serious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAnother point that fell flat, mainly because the MC was butchered for the sake of a terrible plot. The first episode was interesting as we got a main character using his ability like an asshole. It would remained interesting had he occasionally took the risk to due continue doing so, yet he does not.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization becomes inexcusable when MC has his little passage of character development after learning to continue living when his life hits the dumps. This is completely ruined when it was inevitably revealed that he could just use a time travel ability to fix it. What the hell? Why did we have to go through all the horse crap? His characterization is literally taking a step backwards in time. Why wasn't the time travel immediately revealed instead of yanking me around first, or better yet, not revealed at all? I'm sure most people are still busy thinking of the \"FEELS BRUH\" here. At this point I would drop, but I'm more than half way through and I finish at this point.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise there are no noteworthy characters. MC's sister isn't cute, she's damn annoying. Speed guy is funny, but nothing more than a source of comedic entertainment. Tomori, the student council president, hardly has a set character. She's too much at once, which simultaneously makes her too little with this number of episodes. This again has to do with the flipping from the serious side of the show to not so serious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI won't deny that I was somewhat entertained here but it wasn't in the most positive way. I said earlier that I would've dropped the show, but that wasn't because I was bored with it, but because I was becoming increasing dissatisfied with it's direction. But I wanted to see just how ridiculous it got.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the show seemed to be going down a solid path, but in the end they should've left the last episode up to viewer imagination. Even so, we got to this path by trudging through troughs of garbage. It would've been best had the show just stuck to whatever antics it wished and tried not to be serious, because it just turned out contrived. This show can be summed up like this. \\n\\n\r\nIt sure felt like summer.",

But I guess that shouldn't surprise me - Angel Beats was an equal mess when it came to the story and various story arcs. The ending was anti-climatic, so that's another negative for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'll give where credit is due - the relationships explored here were more organic and natural, than in AB (where I felt the relationships/love angle was forced just for fan service).\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, though, from now on I'll be avoiding any anime coming from these writers.

We were expecting a really strong protagonist from episode 1 and a really good anime, however Charlotte didn't deliver at all.\r\nThe plot had as lot of potential but they simply did not exploit it at all. \r\nThe art and the sound were good but this is just the minimum, nobody would watch a really beautiful show if it was boring as hell just like Charlotte is.\r\nThe character is what makes a good show a good show and this is where Charlotte is REALLYBAD. First we've got our potagonist that was supposed to be Lelouch number 2 but instead he literally is a carbon copy of 80 % other protagonists, a weak and meek guy who can't do anything by himself.\\n\\n\r\nAyumi is the single most unbelievable character I have ever seen. NO LITTLE SISTER WOULD ACT LIKE THAT FOR ANY REASON EVER. Not only that but she was really really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nNao was a really creepy stalker that followed the MC for no reasons at all or maybe because he was the MC.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast I have nothing to say, they are just boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was good in three episodes, episode 1.7 and 8. The rest of the time it was torture.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime just isn't very good, it could be worse like Nabari no Ou but still it's really really bad, it felt like none of these characters were believable or relatable to, it felt like they weren't humans.",

            "content": "Warning: if you haven\u2019t seen Charlotte and are planning to for some reason, do not read this review if you don\u2019t want to be spoiled. I will be talking about the plot, which pretty much involves me spoiling the whole thing. Also, if you are a fan of this series and don\u2019t like hearing other people hate on it, stop now, because you won\u2019t like what I have to say about it.\r\nCharlotte. How does one even describe this show. Some love it. Some sing its praises. \"Such a great show\", \"So feelsy\", \"I cried every time\". Hahaha.\r\nCharlotte is a show that fails on every level.The characters are awful, the story is pathetic, the pacing is terrible, the plot holes are more prevalent than they are in Sword Art Online. The attempt at feels is laughable and nothing in it makes any sense. It basically took every problem I had with Angel Beats and made them worse. And the worst part is that it didn't have to be this way. The plot had so much potential and it was wasted. I actually considered giving this anime a 10/10 just because it was so hilariously bad that I actually enjoyed watching it, but changed my mind after I started writing.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 1/10\\n\r\nThe plot starts off pretty okay. We have a lelouche-like protagonist (who I swear to god is an expy of him. He even has the geass). The show begins with an interesting premise, interesting power(s), and potential for development of characters and relationships. Unfortunately none of that actually happens. It seems to be a pretty common theme among Jun Maeda\u2019s works that they start out with a strong premise and interesting concepts and then fail because of garbage writing, leaving us with a mess of a story with plot holes and cardboard characters that falls apart the moment you start thinking about what you\u2019re watching. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about what the anime did right first. It had a good premise and interesting ideas. \\n\r\nOkay, now let\u2019s talk about what this anime did wrong. Where do I even begin\u2026 The plot starts out with the idea that \u201cwe need to save these teenagers from becoming subjects of scientific experiments\u201d. Now, there\u2019s a few problems with this. The first one is scientific ethics. It is actually illegal to do what those scientists were doing. And even if it wasn\u2019t, there are not very many scientists who would actually perform human experiments cruel enough to mentally destroy the subjects. True, there will be a few Dr. Mengeles out there, but not a whole organization of them. And second, if there was an organization like that in real life, the government would shut it down because IT\u2019S ILLEGAL. This is why Elfen Lied is one of the only anime that got this right. Nobody sees the Diclonius as humans, therefore it\u2019s deemed acceptable to experiment on them. And even then, there were people in the organization who didn\u2019t completely agree with what they were doing. Society does not feel this way about people with psychic abilities, at least not in this anime. The only reason they\u2019re in any danger at all is because of this mysterious group of scientists. But let\u2019s say for the sake of argument that it wasn\u2019t illegal and scientists could just do whatever they wanted to people who they believed to have psychic powers. Why is a highschool a safe place for them? In episode 10 it\u2019s made clear that they aren\u2019t safe even if they\u2019re gathered in a group, so why is the highschool any different? What\u2019s stopping this group of scientists from just marching into the school and taking people with psychic abilities? So right off the bat we have a plot that makes no sense. I initially also thought the idea that abilities disappeared after you became an adult was kind of cool until I realized that it was only an excuse as to why all of the characters were in high school. And maybe it was just the art style, but the guy who had the power to fly looked very much not like a highschooler. Maybe that was just me. Anyways moving on. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t much to say about this other than \u201cneeds more focus\u201d. At least, not until episode 6. Everything up to episode 6 was just boring Psychic Power of the Week that only served to introduce new steriotype- I mean new characters, which is something I\u2019ll talk about later. Something notable was that there was a baseball episode in this one too and, just like the one in Angel Beats, felt completely pointless. Jun Maeda must really like baseball. However, we get to episode 6 and I was just like \u201cWHAT THE FUCK\u201d. This is one of the worst episodes in the anime, not counting the last 4. At first it seems like a fine episode. They have a conflict that actually seems legitimate now. The MC\u2019s sister is in danger. So he keeps her home. But then she sneaks out. This entire scene is ridiculous. First of all, why is there a security guard sitting at a desk in their apartment building. I have only ever seen that in workplaces. Whatever. And why does she need to sneak out? Her brother isn\u2019t there to stop her. Did he say \u201che security dude, my sister is kinda sick so I need you to keep her from leaving the house\u201d? His sister should be able to just walk out. There is no reason for her to sneak. And of all the ways to sneak out, she used a window in a bathroom. I have never, ever seen a window in a bathroom that you can open. I have been in many bathrooms in many apartments and public spaces. Not once has there been a window that can both open and that is big enough for a person to slide through. His sister manages to make it to school all right, but then is intercepted by this crazy yandere loli bitch. This was a pretty sweet idea and if it was delivered in a better way, I might actually be praising this show. But given the content of the show, it feels like it was just thrown in there because it was an idea that Maeda had. Now comes the part that really, truly made me give up any hope that the show was going to be good. The little sister\u2019s death. This scene, I swear to god, was one of the dumbest and most avoidable deaths in any anime ever. The group of main characters in the student council realize that there\u2019s going to be an ability user at the middle school and that it\u2019s the main character\u2019s sister. They also have reason to believe that she may have gone to school today despite the fact that her brother told her not to. So they decide to hurry by running on foot. But wait, don\u2019t they have somebody who can teleport? He could have gotten them there in just a few seconds. The commotion he caused by crashing into the wall or tree or whatever may have served as a way to distract the crazy Gasai Yuno Loli Bitch, and even if it wasn\u2019t, they still would have gotten there in time to save the sister and hopefully kill Gasai Yuno Jr. But no, they decide to run on foot instead and what do you know, it resulted in the death of the little sister. So much for their plan to help people. This is not the only time in this show where you will be banging your head against the wall. There\u2019s so many problems that could have been solved with super powers and rather than find creative and interesting ways to work those super powers into the conflict and weave a story that integrates them in ways that don\u2019t feel stupid, the story chose to ignore the fact that they existed in order to kill off the little sister for dramatic effect. And it doesn\u2019t even matter because she comes back in episode 9 ANYWAYS. THE ENTIRE EPISODE WAS POINTLESS. This marks the place where the story gets darker and less episodic. It had the opportunity to focus on the little sister\u2019s death and show how it affected the main character and over the course of the story have him slowly come to terms with the fact that she was dead with the support of his friends. But that doesn\u2019t happen. No instead we get more pointless side stories.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 7 is actually a pretty great episode. That was another thing I noticed about Angel Beats. It had good episodes amidst all the unorganized garbage. Sadly, one good episode is not enough to raise the score above a 1. This episode is devoted to the main character\u2019s reaction to his sister\u2019s death. He basically goes crazy. At first he\u2019s depressed and just eats cup noodles (which I found kind of funny because I was watching Kokkuri-san as well and there\u2019s a lot of cup noodle jokes in that). He brushes off any attempts by people to help him. This, while dangerous and self-destructive, is not unrealistic. I know plenty of people who simply refuse help when it\u2019s offered to them. It\u2019s one of the sad realities of depression. One things that I did find kind of stupid about this episode was that Nao was following him being invisible the whole time. But she can only be invisible to one person right? So then when the one girl came into his house to see if she could cheer him up, why didn\u2019t she notice Nao. To her it would seem like there was just this random white haired girl in the corner of the main character\u2019s room. And what about all those times he was fighting the gangs of people. Did not a single one of them notice this random white haired girl watching? Why did she wait so long to reveal herself to him? It\u2019s almost as if the plot forgot she could only be invisible to one person. Whatever. It\u2019s not like that\u2019s the last time we\u2019re going to see something like that. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8 is devoted to this completely pointless side story about the main singer of Zhiend. She never shows up again after that episode. The main character learns nothing new, at least nothing that matters. We see her brother finally recognize his sister because reasons. But none of this ever shows up or is mentioned again. The entire episode could have been removed and the anime would actually have been better. Why am I even questioning this anymore\u2026\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9. Oh dear god where do I even begin with this episode. The only episodes that rival this are episodes 6 and 10. The episode starts off with the main character and his sister in some sort of prison. I assume it\u2019s the research facility or something, although it\u2019s never explained. Things are very confusing but that\u2019s fine because I\u2019m sure everything will be cleared up eventually right? Nope. It\u2019s never explained why they are there or how they got there. The plot seemed to just forget his sister was dead. We have the whole conflict of \u201cyou need to save your sister because she\u2019s going to be dissected.\u201d Um excuse me, what? Did you just say dissected? If that made no sense to you, don\u2019t worry, you aren\u2019t alone. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY would dissect a human being unless they were descended from Dr. Mengele. There is no way this is legal. Even Elfen Lied didn\u2019t go this far. This anime is basically ignoring any pretenses of continuity and realism and discarding them for cheap dramatic effect that falls apart the moment you turn on your brain and THINK about what YOU ARE WATCHING. If this had been going on for a long time, as it has been implied it has, then the government would have eventually found out and shut them down for inhumane experiments. Human experimentation is already illegal. Even if psychics were seen as nothing more than animals, there are still laws in place to protect animals from cruelty, which seems to be what is happening to the psychics, even the ones who aren\u2019t being dissected. It also is in this episode we learn about the main character\u2019s ability to \u201csteal other people\u2019s powers\u201d. Yes, you read that right. This whole time he has had the ability to steal other people\u2019s powers. But then how did he get his power? I suppose his power could have come with the ability to possess them as well, but he certainly used his power on plenty of other ability users. Why did he literally never notice anything different? He he had stolen so many abilities it would have been simple for him to save his sister. It\u2019s implied that Nao at least already knew about this. Why didn\u2019t she just tell him \u201chere take all our powers and go save your sister. While you\u2019re at it, go destroy that research facility since you\u2019re so powerful\u201d. I feel bad for this series\u2019 ass. It must hurt from all the things that were pulled out of it. So then we learn that the main character has a big brother. A big brother that we heard nothing about before. And he can time travel too, but he can\u2019t do it because he\u2019s blind and needs to see in order for it to work. Um excuse me? Why is this? This makes no sense. Then again, the main character needs to be able to see his victims before he can take them over, so many it\u2019s a genetic thing? But then his little sister doesn\u2019t need to see in order to use her ability. Whatever. We never learn anything about the research facility or why the main character\u2019s sister was still alive. I really think the anime just forgot she was dead.\\n\r\nEpisode 10 is basically episode 10 of madoka. There isn\u2019t much to say about it. We switch main characters and he goes back in time over and over in order to save the psychics from despair. The episode itself is pretty stupid because we have all these half-assed this set up. Like Mr. Drip doesn\u2019t actually have to be wet in order to use his power. It\u2019s just a disguise. Because nobody would ever recognize him with his hair in his eyes\u2026 Then the big brother is like \u201cI know, I\u2019ll disappear from the lives of my family. We\u2019ll just erase their memories.\u201d But how does he erase their memories? No power of memory alteration was mentioned up until now. The guy who goes in and does it is also never mentioned before.  \\n\r\nEpisode 12 worked fine as a final episode. All the problems felt resolved although we have this awful romance between the main character and Nao. Just because you have two characters doesn\u2019t mean that they will work together in a romance. This is exactly what happens in Charlotte. Even the characters themselves admit that they don\u2019t work together. I can even remember a scene where the main character watched Nao get beaten by a group of older students and did nothing, despite the fact that he had the power to control them and make them stop. It\u2019s just stupid and cliche. But why is there an episode 13 if episode 12 felt like a such a relatively satisfying ending? Well, your guess is as good as mine. What posessed them to include this episode is beyond me. It would have worked great as a beginning to a second season, but not as a final episode. It felt rushed and pointless. The story was already over. We didn\u2019t need more. Episode 13 is pretty much season two packed into one episode. It was a rushed progression of events that should have had a series all to itself and had no place in this season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nRight up till the very end we are presented with a cast of two dimensional characters who we\u2019re for some reason suppose to care about. We have someone who can teleport, has a creepy obsession with idols, and\u2026 that\u2019s about it. He never develops, he never learns from anything. He\u2019s just a cardboard cutout that things happen to. We have Mr. Drip who has to be wet to use his power except no just kidding it\u2019s actually a disguise (like seriously wtf). We have our main character who\u2019s selfish and self-centered only using his power for himself. He\u2019s pretty badass. But then all of that leaves in episode 2 and we never see any of that agian. It\u2019s like the tempted you into it with this pretty sweet MC and cool hook and then went and destroyed any semblance of what could have been good. We have the idol girl, Yusa who\u2019s basically Misa-Misa but with less personality. She can channel the dead, or more specifically, her dead big sister. Her dead big sister has the ability of pyrokinetics. But wait, her dead big sister is at least 20 years old, right? Why does she still have her powers? Whatever. She doesn\u2019t have much more personality than her younger sister. She\u2019s the Action Girl who talks like a man and insults you. It\u2019s been done so many times. Mr. Drip gets almost no personality. His major character trait was \u201cBig Brother\u2019s best friend\u201d, and he doesn\u2019t develop at all. They play his death off as if it were supposed to be super sad and tragic and all I could think was \u201cwhy on earth am I supposed to care if this guy dies?\u201d. The little sister was cute but could get annoying at times and had no personality other than \u201cgenki girl\u201d. Nao is the only marginally interesting character. She has an actual backstory. Sadly, she\u2019s the only good character in the show. I don\u2019t really feel like talking about this anymore, I said most of it in the beginning. The characters are just plain boring, about on par with Sword Art Online characters. In fact, these characters just might be worse.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nJust like with Angel Beats, the art in this was decent. The character designs were good, although there were times I couldn\u2019t tell some characters apart. Other than that, the general look of things was very pretty. Especially Nao <3\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting was fine, but nothing spectacular. The music was good and fit the scenes and tone very well, but unfortunately wasn\u2019t memorable enough for me to listen to it and say \u201cAh, that\u2019s Charlotte music\u201d. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr this is one of the worst anime I have ever seen in my life. Nothing about it was good. The plot was a mess with Deus Ex Machina and asspulls right and left, more holes than swiss cheese, and poor characters that I cared nothing about. There were more plot holes than I care to count and events so ridiculous that I\u2019m pretty sure an episode of scooby doo would have had more credibility. Watch this anime if you wanna have a good laugh, but don\u2019t expect anything special. \\n",

            "content": "Ever heard about those conspiracy theories that go about a selection of people having superhuman powers due to either radiation, extraterrestrial contact, or even going as far as claiming that the government injects experimental substances on our children's vaccines? The world is full of bullshit, the government isn't the least interested in planting micro cameras on your pets to spy on you while doing your creepy weeby shit, but hey, this is Anime. A medium that always entrust the greatest powers to characters in their puberty, the world could never be safer am I right? While the adults are laying on their backs it's alwaysthe kids that save humanity, but hey, speaking of conspiracy theories again, the cartoon \"kids next door\" might as well be a message from those who are aware of the dark truth, I'm going off of topic here, enough spilling bullshit and let's actually talk about Charlotte.\\n\r\nA series that not surprisingly enough relates to what I was just saying, an original work by studio P.A Works that gets a huge praise from the fans going as far as calling it a masterpiece, and hold on, that's a title very rarely to be obtained by modern works for how repetitive they can get. But does Charlotte fall into that same case? Here we're pealing off the fans' claims, dissecting this series and exposing it for what it is. Buckle up, get comfy, and let's hit the keyboard for some words.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\\n\r\nFirst and before anything, this is a story by Jun Maeda, the creator of the both critically acclaimed well established and praised series, Angel Beats and Clannad. Just so you know what you're in for, I for one didn't enjoy Angel Beats at all however digged Clannad so much that I consider the series to be a life changer for me, goes to show that one can only do so much, not all works of an author can be equal, and Charlotte is no exception here.\\n\r\nIn a world very similar to our own, some people through their adolescent obtain superhuman powers, like pyrokinesis, telekinesis, teleportation and so on. Otosaka Yuu, the protagonist was living his life like a big fish in a small pot, thinking he was the chosen one and the lone in the world to have powers until he gets exposed to the truth of the world, kids all over the worlds are blessed with very useful abilities, and now he's charged with the help of the student council members that also have powers to try and capture the ones that use their abilities for mischief. A very generic story structure right there.\\n\r\nIt does start very slice of life natured and slow, with a lot of focus on comedy until the feel train hits you like a damn \"Gamu Gamu no King Kong Gun\" when you least expect it, and let's be honest, Clannad and Angel Beats have made that very clear, I'm about to spill some spoilers for Angel Beats here so keep notice and skip the next few lines; there are even theories out there that the protagonist of Angel Beats is the protagonist in Charlotte after he was reincarnated for what they both hold in similarities.\\n\r\nAs I was saying, the story was very uninteresting for me for the most part, the score could have been even lower here if it weren't for that humongous plot twist nearing the final episodes, my God, I don't think I've ever been so skeptical and at the same time opening my mouth as a garage door from confusion and astonishment since I last saw the plot twist at the end of Mirai Nikki, shit can get pretty intense at the end, but it still doesn't make up for the poor start, that's where most people drop the series. But it does fill you with satisfaction when you start noticing the hints that were all over the initial episodes that led up to the big bang at the end, for that, I give my props.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\\n\r\nBecause Charlotte is another sibling to Angel Beats, Clannad, (and to drag on the list; Little Busters, Kanon and more...) they adopted a very similar art style in design only in a more modern quality and detail. I'm not a big fan on the massive eyes that take most of the face on the author's older series, but this at least was acceptable, not dragged way too much it's noticeable.\\n\r\nThe animation was beautiful, I can't complain about anything, but it was still nothing memorable, interesting enough to keep you visually interested in the story.\\n\r\nI would say that their focus here was on the male cast, the female characters weren't too flashy looking aside from probably a trio that has a lot of screen time, but the males were straight up from a model factory, sorry if that sounded a bit too dark but seriously, everyone looks at least like they could have a harem series with them as the protagonist, going as far as taking the spotlights from the protagonist himself. I surprisingly did enjoy the CGI scenarios in here, I'm glad they didn't over do it, it was very short and that was the charm of it.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (7.7/10):\\n\r\nThe voice acting was okay, with some annoying voices here and there, so glad those ones didn't have too much screentime or my ears would have started bleeding. The only thing I enjoyed was the opening theme song, I wasn't a big fan of the ending theme song but the opening one really did it for me, I know I have extra ammo for my conversation now *wink*. The soundtrack, well, it was too unexciting for me to remember, even the music, the story was a bit heavily focused on music and yet it still didn't hit the spot, even the terrible (Just my opinion) Angel Beats' music were good, at least I can spit that truth out.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (6.0/10):\\n\r\nAt the start of the series I was set to giving this aspect of the show a 3, probably a 4 if I felt generous. The characters were too shallow for me, nothing actually stood out from them aside from the flashy character designs, but I ain't letting any colors fool me.\\n\r\nI went through the whole show and I can barely remember 2 names aside from the protagonist's who himself gave me a hard time to remember his name as well, until I made it to the 10th episode or something, yes, that's how uninteresting the cast was, probably the story could have been even better with better characters.\\n\r\nBut hey, how did this rise up to 6/10 you ask? well, the protagonist went through a sigh to be seen of a development, I would show you clips from him at the beginning and him near the end and you wouldn't believe me if I told you they were the same person, the change was so massive and noticeable, but it didn't happen overnight which I appreciate. I don't think their names would survive for another day in my head though, the pacing has really dropped since Clannad.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\\n\r\nI was questioning myself when I got midway through the series as nothing special had already happened, but before I realized it, a certain happening occurred, character development started flowing, and a lot of plot points were explained which made the wait worth it. I honestly went from not being interested at all, something very frustrating that this could have been worse than Angel Beats for me, but the twists at the end made me interested yet again in the neck of time, this is something that I would definitely rewatch one of those days.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (7.4/10):\\n\r\nWell, before anything, please don't let my nagging about how bad I found Angel Beats or my praise on how good Clannad was for me deceive you or give you a clear image on both series if you haven't watched them already, remember those were only my experiences with them, who know, probably I just didn't watch Angel Beats in its respective mood or something, but this is an entirely different series with its own ups and downs. I can't guarantee that you will enjoy at least the first 6 episodes, I know I didn't, but if you could just hang out there at least till past the first six episodes you will have quite the payoff.",

            "content": "At first, I thought Charlotte was seriously going to be one of my favorite anime of all time. I couldn't have been more mistaken.\r\n like the majority of anime Charlotte starts with an interesting story. Maybe the idea of a school for teenagers with superpowers isn't exactly original, but i find that some anime manage to hit it of from a seemingly stereotypical start, to an entirely original and entertaining end. This process that Charlotte should have and would have done. THAT is the kind of potential that Charlotte showed.\r\nLet's start with the story. The first few episodes were nice. They were very humorous, andi honestly enjoyed more than i would like to admit. The faint smell of mystery hung in the air, which is always a good factor, and something that i find makes the story very attracting. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the creators tried to make the story more realistic. How? by making it sad and serious of course! Making a story sad does not necessarily mean that it will be realistic! Oh, and why do people think that the only way to make something sad is by killing people? Honestly! the theme of tragedy was a complete contradiction to the whole concept of this thing.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we're still not quite done from the drama yet! It is now time to fit an arc that should have actually been an entire season by itself, into 3 episodes. Well done! You have failed miserably! This part of the story was waay too rushed, the events were very confusing, and the progression of the plot was awful. It didn't fit.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it all, the last episode was the worst of them all.\\n\r\nThe ending was just very disappointing, and not well thought. I expected so much more. The beginning was beautiful but the ending was very lacking in depth. they had managed to extract all the comedy and fun the show had.\\n\\n\r\nThe only one worth mentioning when talking about the characters was Misa. She was The only one to show development if i recall correctly. I like the rest of the main characters, but they weren't special. they were very normal.\\n\r\nSome of them had the potential to be really well written.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art were probably the best things. They were noticeably good.\\n\\n\r\nI admit that i did enjoy the story, but only for the first part, so until around the seventh episode. That's the time the story started going wacko.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was literally half-and-half. The first part almost spectacular, the second catastrophic. Not exactly a show worth watching.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Just to be clear, this is not a recommendation to watch this show. The plot has no clue what it's doing, the characters are one dimensional, the messages the show gives are actually pretty bad, but despite all of that, I liked it.\r\nThe first thing this show did right is kill any expectations I had by setting up an interesting \"selfish anti-hero uses a unique power for personal gain\" story in episode 1, and then completely abandoning it in favor of a much less original \"high school for super powers\" setting with a reluctant hero that isn't actually reluctant beyond very minor complaining. At thispoint, if you have any illusions this show is going to be good, you're nuts, I stayed for one reason and one reason only: I thought teleportation guy was funny.\\n\\n\r\nThen, in episode 6, it throws its premise out the window yet again and at this point, I'm just in awe. It's like this was written by one of those kids that makes up stories as they go, it doesn't make any sense, but that just makes you want to know what they say happens next, and it does not disappointed, with no fewer than 4 random twists that are so out of left field I was laughing out loud at some points.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this level of inconsistency would not have worked if the show felt like it was trying to con me in any way. The reason I enjoyed it was because it made me believe it was actually trying, which led me to give it at least some benefit of the doubt. As an example, there were 2 1/2 cute high school girls in the show (and a little sister), and not a single time was there any attempt to try to set up a love triangle. That would've been an easy source of drama, but the writer just wasn't interested in telling that kind of story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's still a bad show of course, but my point is this show gets a bad rap, even a bad show can endear itself to you, and that's what happened for me this time",

            "content": "**May contain spoilers**\r\n(Before you read any further. This is a review based on my opinion. If you disagree with me that's fine, but if you were expecting an objective review then I suggest you stop reading right now)\r\n''The scars you can't see are the hardest to heal...'' ~ Nao Tomori \r\nI did some research before I started watching Charlotte and I came to the conclusion that people had mixed feelings about this show. One adores the show and the other thinks it's wasted potential. I mean Charlotte is composed by the same person who composed Clannad (After story), Angel Beats and Kanon. Nonetheless this reviewis about Charlotte and not about Clannad. I will use some examples in this review, but it will not influence my judgement. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the story the first seven episodes. In my opinion Charlotte started as a masterpiece, but they decided to do something different after episode 7. I can respect that, because it is hard to create something original in the modern world. I was still very interested where this show was going. Not much later the concept of ''time leaping'' is introduced and I thought that Charlotte was going to be another time-travel-story. Another episode later it became something different. While the story changes every episode the writers are trying to force a love-story down our throat. Now don't get me wrong I think the main characters are perfect for each other and their chemistry is spot on. There's one main issue with the story. Just like Angel Beats it should have been more than 13 episodes. If Charlotte had more episodes it coud have been much more. The special episode made me hunry for more and they should have used that to their advantage. Since Charlotte originally has 13 episodes and 1 special I can't give the story higher than a 7 much to my regret.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was amazing, but it wasn't anything special. If you want to see an Anime (movie) with an amazing art-style you should watch Your Name or the Garden of Words. There's not much else to say about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nI did like the OP and the OST for Charlotte, but just like the art-style it wasn't anything special in my opinion. I do like the songs by  the ''post-rock band Zhiend'' and the way they were used in Charlotte. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nI never hated the main character nor did I like him. I don't really like watching perfect people (even if it's an anime), but the character development was very noticeable. I enjoyed watching the main character changing from an emotionless jerk to a loving and caring person. It is a little bit clich\u00e9, but does that make it a bad anime? The other main character was very likeable. Their chemistry really works, but their romance seems a bit forced. I don't like to compare, but since the same person composed Angel Beats, you can't deny the fact that both Charlotte and Angel Beats rushed the romance between the main characters. Therefore the ending feels less nostalgic then it should have. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nDespite the rushed romance and lack of episodes, I still enjoyed Charlotte. Even though the story was rushed near the end, I still feel they handled it better than Angel Beats did. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the main characters and even the humor in some episodes. Like I said I don't wish to compair shows, so I will rate Charlotte as a standalone anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nI know I may seem a bit generous, but just like I said this is based on my opinion and I was never trying to be objective. I enoyed Charlotte, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. If you enjoyed Angel Beats or don't mind watching something incomplete then look no further. The ending is satisfying nonetheless, but it could have been much more. Now don't get my wrong. The length of a show doesn't always guarantee its succes, but in this case I'm absolutely sure it would have improved this show by miles. Therefore I can't rate Charlotte higher than an 8. \\n\\n\r\n(If you disagree with me or don't like my review then please let me know.)  \\n",

The plot was very good, and it had a good amount of romance without it taking the spotlight away from the actual story. It was an anime that I really enjoyed! So, if you're looking for an action anime with a hint of romance, I definitely recommendCharlotte.",

            "content": "There are reasons why I started watching this anime. My main reason is it feels somewhat similar to X-Men (the American movies) and as a big fan of X-Men, I just had to watch this. My obvious second reason is the fact that it's made by KEY and directed by Jun Maeda. Am I disappointed? Do I love this show? You'll find out soon enough..\r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (6/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nThe story centers around the special abilities that occur among a small percentage of boys and girls in puberty. Yuu Otasaka uses his powers without others knowing, and lives a fairly normal,average high school life. Before him suddenly appears a girl, Nao Tomori. Due to his meeting with her, the fate of special power-users will be exposed.\\n\\n\r\n*sigh* This is one of the most overhyped anime I have ever seen and I do understand why.. It's directed by Jun Maeda, the man behind Angel Beats and Clannad, and it's also made by Key. The company behind Angel Beats, Clannad: After Story and Little Busters: Refrain. Since this is being made by a company who made one of my favourite animes of all time, how could I not be hyped for this show? The first few episodes started out strong.  We are introduced to the MC who apparently has a special powers. He was then taken in by a girl named Nao Tomori and you now have a school full of teens who has a special power. I thought that at this point, they were going to follow the route of X-men where Charles built a special school for mutants. Not really..\\n\\n\r\nThen the 2nd half came (Ep. 6-10) which was honestly the great part of the series. It had a drastic turns of event where Yuu's little sister died, Yuu dealing with aftermath of her death and Nao saving him from his depression.  I was even happy when they found out that they , or rather, he can save Ayu from her death. That was one of the most sweetest moments evar! Somewhere around the 2nd half, you'll notice that the pacing is starting to become an issue. They even had to skip the openings but that still didn't solve the problem. \\n\\n\r\nThen the last 3 episodes came which was the most disappointing episodes I have ever seen in my life. After watching the last 3 episodes, I told myself that Charlotte should have ended on Episode 10 because Episode 11-13 felt unnecessary. They decided to add in this terrorist organization which ended up becoming stupid because they weren't even explained that well. Where in the mother of god did they come from? What was their purpose? The answer is....where's the answer? Oh that's right, it wasn't answered because the show is plagued with plot holes. That's right...plot holes and there are a lot of them. I'm going to give you guys a few examples. Who exactly were the terrorists? How did they know about Yuu's ability? Who exactly are these \"scientists\" that kidnaps teens with special powers? So did Ep. 8 happen or not? Yuu time leaped and saved Ayu which means he never entered a depression which also means he never met the ZHIEND vocalist. Which ALSO means she never sang for Nao's brother. Which also f*cking means that Nao's brother is still in a f*cked up state. \\n\\n\r\nThen came the ending... I'm going to make this short. It's VERY RUSHED. Who in their right mind came up with an idea to make Yuu go around the world and make him loot every ability in 1 episode? They could have made a second season and dedicate 12 episodes of him travelling around the world, meeting new people and plundering abilities at the same time and make the 13th episode of him getting saved by his older brother and returning to Nao. If second season isn't possible for them then they could have made a different ending. Instead we got a shitty lackluster and very rushed ending. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe anime was also created by PA Works who happens to have the 2nd best animation in the anime industry, behind ufotable. Anyways, the animation looks amazing. You can see that the environment is drawn well like the buildings, the ground, the roads, etc, and the glare in the sun is amazing, etc. The character design looks somewhat similar to Angel Beats but better. \\n\r\nLastly, the animation looked smooth and I didn't really spot any choppiness. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nMost of my soundtrack rating comes from the inserted songs, the OP and the ED theme songs. The show amazed me in 2 out of 3 categories. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is Bravely You by Lia and there are 3 ED theme songs which are \"Yake Ochinai Tsubasa\" by Aoi Tada , Rakuen made\" by Yusa Nishimori, and \"Kimi no Moji\" by Anri Kumaki. The OP theme song is awesome. Especially that soothing voice in the middle of the OP song. All the ED theme song sounds great but the 3rd ED theme is the best. Too bad, it didn't fit quite well in the show because of how rushed the ending is. \\n\\n\r\nThe Voice Actors did a great job with their characters. Especially Nao Tomori. I just love her voice!\\n\\n\r\nI'm probably the only guy here who hated the inserted song that was sung by one of the ZHIEND vocalist \"Sara Shane\". It sounded like someone was puking inside my ear. I just had to skip it when she sung it for the second time. Here's a tip, hire a singer who can actually sing in English.. I mean, Lia...the singer for the OP theme song have also sung some songs in English. Her English sounded fluent. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (6/10) (SPOILER)\\n\r\nThis is one of those shows that could have been a lot better in terms of Character Development if it had more episodes. Yuu is basically the only character who got a major character development. Nao and the rest of the supporting characters got little to none. Yuu from the start is this cheating asshole who uses his ability to......well...cheat his way up and get girls in the easiest way possible. Then after his sister died, we get to see him in his depression state which is, in my opinion, a great part to watch. You can feel what his going thru and it really depressed the hell out of me. When Nao gave him a rice omelette with a pizza sauce, I broke down at that point. Whatever, the point here is Yuu went from an unlikable character to a likable character because it shows that he really cares for his sister and he wants her back in his life. The last 3 episodes switched him back to an unlikable character, especially the f*cking ending.  \\n\\n\r\nI did say that the supporting characters got little to no development right? That's right. For example, Yusa's flashback ain't even that sad because it wasn't enough time to establish a dramatic feeling with that character. Same goes for Pooh's (Kumagami) death. He just didn't get enough screentime for me to feel sad about his death. I gotta admit, Ayu's death did depress me...a bit. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing, it's Yuu's and Nao's confession. In my opinion, it was hilarious and one of the best confessions I have ever seen in my life. If you know Nao then you should know that she's a cold b*tch..*ahem* I mean a cold chick. I wasn't exactly surprised at Nao's reaction because that's her personality from the start. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nTo be honest, I did enjoy this show quite a bit even though the plot in the end turns into a cluster f*ck. The typical \"baseball game\" is there since this is a KEY anime, the funny moments are also present (i.e Yusarin's hilarious moments), and etc. Nao is also one of my favorite characters so seeing her in action is quite enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7/10)\\n\r\n\"Charlotte\" seriously had the potential to become one of my favorite KEY animes but sadly, the 13 episode count ruined it. The story wasn't even that bad. The show just suffered from horrible pacing, little character development and a very rushed ending. If the series had 25 episodes then this would have been a great show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Decent Story\\n\r\n+Outstanding Animation\\n\r\n+Great OP and ED theme songs\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Decent Characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Pacing issues\\n\r\n-Supporting characters, including most of the main characters, got little to no character development.\\n\r\n-Show is plagued with plot holes\\n\r\n-Unexplained Terrorist group near the end\\n\r\n-Very Rushed Ending\\n\r\n-Pointless Episode 8",

            "content": "Story: 5/10\r\nArt & Sound: 9/10\r\nCharacters: 3/10\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\r\nOverall: 5/10\r\nIf you were a fan of either of Jun Maeda's previous works - be it Clannad, Little Busters, Air etc - or just a fan of Key in general, there was every reason to get excited for the release of Charlotte. This held especially true for me - Angel Beats! has been a mainstay under the Favorite Anime section of my profile, ever since I finished it in January last year. Despite being prepared to be astounded and amazed by what was arguably the most hyped anime of Summer 2015, I instead met with mediocre plot execution andsubstandard character development. So where exactly did Charlotte go wrong? \\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nBeing an ardent fan of the super power genre, I loved the idea behind Charlotte. A story about young teenagers possessing mystical powers and putting them to use for a cause seemed to be my ideal anime. Unfortunately, Charlotte was simply too rushed to truly appreciate. From as early as after the third episode, many parts and scenes in the Charlotte storyline requiring in-depth elaboration to enjoy was packed and compressed rather tightly into just a mere 24 minutes. And shall we ignore the plot holes and way-too-conveniently-timed incidents that seemed to poke out every so often? Although, overlooking it's dreadful pacing and somewhat ridiculous incidental occurrences, there were still various interesting bits and pieces in the entire anime. Having just 13 episodes does this anime a disservice, mostly because the fascinating plot behind it might have been a revelation if expanded into a 2-cour series or even more. \\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt & sound may just be two of the greatest, if not the best points of Charlotte. As expected of PA Works, the studio behind recognizable titles like Nagi no Asukara and Shirobako delivered, bringing the crisp animation and beautiful backgrounds that I had relished from their previous works. The soundtrack was largely on point as well, but I have to give special mention to How-Low-Hello, or rather, Maaya Uchida, whom I felt did a great job with the second ending theme 'Rakuen made', as well as the insert song 'Hatsunetsu Days'. The regular ending and opening themes are also fantastic and fit the anime very well. We can't forget about ZHIEND either, a post-rock band in the anime also responsible for a few of Charlotte's many insert songs. I can't profess to being a fan of post-rock, but I enjoyed ZHIEND's tunes and I'm sure I'm not the only one. All in all, Charlotte possesses some very splendid art and sound, and it is perhaps those that make this show stand out in a positive manner.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nCan the same be said about the people that make up the Charlotte universe? Far from it. The characters weren't bad, no, but most of them received little to no development and insight into their personality. As a result, most of the characters in Charlotte came off to me as extremely bland, forgettable, and plain uninteresting. This made it hard to feel emotional and empathize with the characters whenever they had tearful and dramatic moments meant to stir and make an impact on the anime's viewers. \\n\\n\r\nI shall refrain from going through every single character in Charlotte, but I can list one prominent example of a character not getting his deserved screen time and background information. Under this anime's MyAnimeList page, you will see a certain Joujirou Takajou being listed as a 'main character'. That, I can assure you, is one of the biggest lies I have ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're reading this at this very moment and you've already watched Charlotte, you may even question: who in the world is Joujirou? Indeed, this character was so easily forgettable that I had to look in the Characters section to remember his name. In spite of the other main characters receiving at least a decent overview of their backstory and history before the events of the anime, this guy suffered the fate of being the comic relief character from start to finish, and no one really knows who he is except for 'that one dude who runs fast'. Main character? Sure...\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the rest of the main cast either, with about half of them quickly losing their importance within the anime and fading out to become just another background character, which is a pity, because the entire set of main heroes and heroines really piqued my interest at first glance. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nFor all it's faults, I liked Charlotte and that is something I can't deny. I was thoroughly in love with it's first few episodes, save for a rather absurdly-paced Episode 3, and looked forward to catching it's latest episode every week. The quality of it seemed to drop week after week though, and the end of the anime culminated in a rather average 7/10 score for me. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nI rate the animes in my anime list based on my enjoyment of it and nothing else, but my unbiased opinion of Charlotte would be nothing more than just a bare passing grade. The animation, sound tracks, and cute girls are a big plus, but ultimately that's not nearly enough for an anime to be able to call itself great. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't something I would recommend to anime enthusiasts, but maybe to greenhorns new to the wonderful world of anime, who can't exactly differentiate between what's good and what's bad. Contrary to popular belief, it is very possible to get a kick out of average shows especially if you haven't seen enough actual good shows to make the necessary comparisons. Just look at how many people describe Sword Art Online as an anime masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this review. It's my first one and I would definitely appreciate constructive feedback on how to better them :)",

            "content": "You know, while I was watching Charlotte I really struggled to find the overall point of the whole thing. When it started I considered it to be a \"Boku no hero\" thing where the protagonist slowly realised he was the strongest of all the cast. Then, I thought it was going to be an Angel Beasts kind of thing, where the main cast was going to be a goofy set of predictable cast members where nothing really significant happens. THEN I thought it was going to be a sort of... well, nothing really, the plot at this point kind of felt typical of an animebut it really wasn't. I can't really explain it. Charlotte isn't really that typical at all. At best I could compare it to a discount Steins'; Gate with a touch of Code: Geass and a smidge of Boku No Hero: Academia. Very... Very... Discounted...\\n\\n\r\nAs to be expected from the devils that conceived the well recieved darlings that are Angel Beats and Clannad, this anime is an absolute bastion of unfairness and gimmicky comedy. From stage one you find yourself laughing at the simple interactions between the two main cast however you will also find yourself quite bored of the directionless plot and limited scope, it begins to feel a lot like the Mushishi plot, where nothing really happens despite the constantly interesting interactions between the constant and temporary cast. At stage two you find the \"stein's gate\" problem, where everything gets complicated however the stakes aren't really as severe, as the most significant problem in the series is solved and the whole thing is turned into an underdog movement despite very little build up or a very explosive conclusion. In fact, speaking of build up, There was no real segway from our first plot to our second one.\\n\\n\r\nDespite whatever I might say this is an incredibly enjoyable experience. with an unnaturally dramatic conclusion. It goes from 0 to 100 in literally 2 episodes, however, I find the difference between episode 2 and episode 12 a massive improvement, its gradual but it is indeed noticeable. If there's any advice that I can give to viewers of this anime then it has to be: Stick with it. Despite the fact the conclusion is in no way as dramatic or as tear-jerking as something as Clannad or as purely joyful as BnHA, you have to appreciate the intricacy of the storytelling involved here and the sheer abuse of the character development involved. There is also a lot of emphasis on sacrifice in this amine, from the least significant to the most significant (at least in terms of development and plot direction). It really is a miracle how much of an attachment is formed between two characters who seemed so distant from each other (but I suppose that's another trope of the industry). In the end, a subjective happy ending was pulled off and I can't be more grateful for it. The story became grim and the grim became great, I don't think you could ask anything more of a well-composed story, especially if you're someone who hates sad stories.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is good, worth a watch unless you haven't watched a total record breaker like Clannad. Be patient and enjoy the middle/climax of the story.",

There were some flaws, however, that stood out to me. I felt like there were a lot of deus ex machina instances. Some parts didn't feel realistic, for example, the baseball pitcher just accepting the fact that he has to pitch for real immediately after and the whole ending. What was up with that ending? The guy takes the abilities of everyone in the whole entire world? Tomori suddenly cries for him even though we didn't get any real developement intotheir relationship until the very last two episodes? He just continues his life like normal, but he doesn't remember anything?? How is he supposed to do that? Every single character besides main didn't change at all throughout the story, besides Tomori but take into account what I mentioned above. Some parts are still confusing as well. The whole thing with his brother, the plot hole with the ZHIED singer, etc. Story was interesting though, art was nice, OP was amazing, I got to see where the Charlotte meme originated from.

It's a comedy and romance enveloped by a mystery that keeps the story going. But there is one important factor that has deepen my interest, which is the chemistry between the Yuu, Ayumi and Tomori and their interaction where they complete each other.\r\nIt portrays a romance love where one stands by your side without you knwoing and kick you up fromthe abyss of despair when you're at the edge of losing sanity. A romance love of how deep simple words such as \" thank you \" can represent the whole grateful and complicated feelings that are bursting inside to reach your heart. Can you love someone if they do not have any memory of you?\\n\\n\r\nIt also portrays a brother's dedication and love to his sister, not the brother-sister complex type but a pure love of appreciating her and protecting her with all his might. A love that transcends words and could make you feel warm inside your heart but sometimes it can be so fragile that it could slip right through your grip without you realising it. Can you cry while eating a sweet omelette rice?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I love how the OST is constructed but the outro is more amazing for me as the song fits perfectly to the pictures and the art is simply beautiful and breath-taking, without any animation that attempt to interpret or explain a feeling in details. Overall, you can expect this anime to have some drama, superpower element, moments to laugh to, romance and of course, moments where your heart resonates with the characters'. \\n\\n\r\nThe two questions mentioned can be simply explained, but the answer itself contains quite some emotions and I'd rather you find it out your way. It's always that when we lose something, then we would regret not appreciating it. It's our flaw as a human, but it also makes us appreciate our loved ones more because we know how deep the pain can be.\\n\\n",

Its all over the place when it comes to development and it seems very rushed. I really did enjoy this anime and I would recommend it but I wouldn't get my hopes up. It leaves you feeling sad, happy, and empty at the same time. Because of this I give Charlottea 7.",

            "content": "I went into this show really wanting to like it.  I have enjoyed other works by Key such as Clannad, Air, and Kanon (2006), but this anime unfortunately falls into the meh category for me along with Angel beats.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nWhile I can't dive into plot too much without major spoilers think of something like X-men where certain people have abilities but are targeted for having them by organizations, syndicates etc. This leads our group of characters to try and stop others from using their powers so they are not targeted.  Plot-wise it felt kinda generic and none of the \"sad\" Key moments reallygot to me all that much.  I feel like they had a good idea, but the execution could've been better, especially in the later half of the series when the plot gets more convoluted and generally just feels like way too big a jump from the start of the series.  I liked the mysterious nature of the plot in the beginning, but as I figured out more and more, the less interested I became. \\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the \"darkest\" Key work I've seen to date, but beyond that I don't have much else to add for story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 and Sound 7/10\\n\r\nThe artwork was fine.  No complaints there.  The music was alright.  Lots of Engrish later on in the series but that's typical of a lot of anime anyways.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters, on the other hand, were nothing special save for the protagonist.   Most of the seemed like generic anime stereotypes, and the focus shifts from the main characters and his buddies to a whole new cast of characters halfway through, leaving little room for development.  The main character is the only saving grace here, as you see all the events that change him as a person throughout the story.  Don't expect anything revolutionary here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nI did generally enjoy this for the most part.  I knew this was probably not going to be a life-changing show going in, and I was right.  I was interested in the plot in the beginning, but at the series went on it was more just \"sure why not?\" moments for me.  Again on par with my enjoyment of Angel Beats (this shows seems almost too similar in a lot of regards to it actually).  I'm not sure if I'd watch it again, but it was a fun little show that kept me hooked enough to keep going at the very least to find out what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nIf you liked Angel Beats, you'll probably like this.  Definitely not my favorite work from Key, but it was worth the watch at least for my curiosity (this show is pretty popular on this site so I wanted to know why).  I'd say give it a watch.  You might end up liking it a lot, and their are definitely some touching and emotional moments to be had if you get into it enough.  If you hate it, well it's short anyways so you didn't waste that much time anyways.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nTo be perfectly honest, it's hard to come to a definite conclusion about this show. Is it good? Is it terrible? Could it have done better? Or, more accurately, SHOULD it have done? For now, I'll leave that judgement to you, whether you've seen it or not. If you haven't, just bear in mind that there's an awful lot of debatable things about this show. With that in mind, let's get on with this.\r\n(Scroll to the bottom if you only want a summary)\r\nMain review:\r\nI had semi-high expectations going into this show. The writer, Jun Maeda, has written some pretty excellent stuff in the past. Thevisual novel \"Little Busters!\" is the main one that springs to mind, as well as Key's other visual novels \"Air\", \"Kanon\" and (as much as I may hate it) \"Clannad\". There's definitely potential for something good. However, given that it was 13 episodes, I feared it may take the same route as \"Angel Beats!\", an anime also written by Maeda; completely rushed and incomplete. Unfortunately, it looks as if I was right.\\n\\n\r\nIf we dissect the show apart, the base story is sound - it had the potential to be a classic Maeda masterpiece. Sure, you might argue that it's not totally original (I'm looking at you, \"Angel Beats!\") but it hardly matters if it differentiates itself and is amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe base story, however, is where the positive part ends and where we move onto the main flaw with this show - its painful rushing. There are a fair few completely illogical scenes throughout the show; I won't spoil anything for you but here's an improvised example of what it might look like:\\n\\n\r\nPerson 1: -crying- My dog's been put down! I loved my dog so much I don't know what to do! Help me!\\n\\n\r\nPerson 2: Just move on and get on with your life. Don't worry about it.\\n\\n\r\nPerson 1: (suddenly filled with enthusiasm) Wow you're right, thanks!\\n\\n\r\nDoes it make any logical sense? Not really. Given the proper time and effort I'm sure scenes that look like this would be ironed out. Unfortunately for us, there's a 13 episode time constraint and we have to live with it.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, there's very little time for character development. It mainly just rushes straight through the story leaving no time for anything else. That's not their fault, mind you, but regardless it is hugely detrimental. There's a tiny amount of it, but not enough to consider \"acceptable\" no matter what your definition of it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe other massive issue that ties in with the above point is its inane comedy. It occasionally detracts from what could possibly be a good scene for story/character development and, in other situations, simply wastes the already limited time they have synthesising the show. This is not the kind of show that needs heavy comic relief. Maybe in very small quantities - definitely not the ubiquitous presence it was given. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering all these flaws, you might think it mad that I've given it a 7. For whatever reason, I still really enjoyed it; I managed to watch it more quickly than anything else I've ever seen and I'm still trying to figure out why.\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from the story, the artwork makes this show shine more than it probably should. Personally, I really liked it and it's probably one of the main reasons I got through it so quickly. Its great aesthetics are worthy of its potential - it's a shame it never got realised. As for the OP/ED, they were alright. Nothing worth paragraphing about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, this show is seriously full of potential. It's not the most original, but it doesn't have to be. Unfortunately, it's very poorly executed due to time constraints and makes the show a bit of a mediocrity rather than the masterpiece it should be. Its artwork holds a lot of value and is probably the best thing about the show since its story isn't fully realised.\\n\\n\r\nDo not be disheartened, however. \"Charlotte\" may still live up to its full potential. With \"Angel Beats!\", there's a visual novel version being published in parts by Key, the visual novel studio that Maeda works for. I haven't read it, but I'm willing to bet that it brings out what \"Angel Beats!\" should have actually been. Hopefully, at some point, the same happens with Charlotte. Thank you for taking the time to read this.\\n\\n\r\nAny comments/advice are appreciated so that I can write better reviews in the future.",

            "content": "First of all I wan't to say that this show was not in anyway a masterpiece but I still found this anime to be enjoyable. I saw a lot of disappointment related to this series before and almost didn't watch it at all. So thinking there might be other people like me out there who might consider not even trying this because they only see the bad stuff written about this in the internet I felt it was needed of me to write this review.\r\nFor me the biggest problem was the start. It was prolonged a bit too far just to set up the basisfor the 'student council work' that in the end was not all that essential for this anime. However it did give chance to get to know the characters better and around episode 6 I felt like they had finished \"laying the foundation\" and the plot started to really progress. I was hooked and just had to see it all the way 'til the end. \\n\\n\r\nI was thinking that I'm not going to focus on every aspect (art, sounds, characters etc.) separately but just try to express my feelings in words for the series as a whole. Though maybe I should mention few pointers that I noticed. \\n\\n\r\nArt: if you've seen Aniplex shows before you pretty much know what to expect. Nothing all that amazing but solid animation all the way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I liked both OP and ED but in some of the background music sometimes had these weird sounds on regular intervals that at least for me disrupted the feeling of the situation and got me annoyed. Still just a minor annoyance that didn't happen more than few times. \\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking: Though having some clich\u00e9 elements I found the way this story was told to be to my liking. I have always enjoyed this \"situation based\" humor that is typical to anime and what the first half of this anime offers a lot. Staring glowing eyes under a dark cloud from other guys who feel jealous, people rambling about their target of admiration and then getting treated accordingly for this overly stupid behavior are some of the small things I enjoy seeing in so called school-anime. This show delivered that but if you are expecting only school anime that has, synopsis quote: \"The student council of the school, led by Nao, is tasked with secretly tracking down adolescents who abuse their powers.\" you should brace yourself because this show will turn a bit more drama focused around the halfway point. \\n\r\nThe second half of the show focused on dealing with the problems that the characters have mostly because of these abilities and how they are trying to deal with the situation. There was also more than one plot twist that I did not see coming and they made this show more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to ramble for too long and accidentally write spoilers so for short conclusion: Despite a bit slow start that had some wasted screen time I think this story was well told in 13 episodes. The main reason why this anime got 7/10 from me instead of better score was that there could have been more focus on character development and that there some rushing in telling the story which was even more evident flaw after slow start. Despite these problems I still found the overall enjoyment to be 'good' hence 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMy first ever review. I hope it will be helpful to somebody",

            "content": "When I first heard of this anime i was interested to start watching it , it was written by the same team behind Angel Beats ! one of my favorite series as well as being an original title. When i finished the anime all it did was leave a sour taste in my mouth. \r\nStory : \r\nThe first 8 episodes were actually decent and enjoyable for me , there was actually build up  and character development throughout those 8 epsiodes with tons of interesting character interactions among the characters. Not only that , there was actually a sense of progression which was sorely lackingin the second half. However i really felt like the encounters with the other ability users could have been cut shorter instead of dedicating an entire episode to it but that might just be me. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the episodes after 8 or what i would like to call the 2nd half , the 2nd is actually a lot darker which was a change i personally really liked , but was it executed properly ? Hell no, everything was off in the 2nd half. The pacing was incredibly poorly done , everything was going so fast that it left you overwhelmed with question it never truly answers. It also undoes everything the first 8 episodes were building up for and then proceeds to throw all the character development down the drain. This was personally something i couldn't look past , why make something major that changed all the characters then proceed to take all the impact that it had away by undoing it ? \\n\\n\r\nNext is the ending , Oh. My. God. How could someone actually write an ending like this  and release it is beyond me. I have no idea how to describe it to you since this is an entity on its own. Go watch it and you will know what i mean. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : \\n\r\nMy main problem with this anime actually lies on its characters and while i enjoyed the main characters and their interactions with others i have to say that aside from 2 characters which was Nao and Otosaka none of the others were given enough development to make me actually feel attached to them at all and this is due to the massive influx of characters that the show keeps on pouring in as the episodes progressed. An example would be Ayumi , being a major character that played a part in progressing the story , she was given so little screen time and development that i really didn't care or felt attached at all to her character. She was the typical little sister character that was there for the sake of being there , same goes to the majority of characters in the anime , they are given so little development and was just there for the story to move forward which is disappointing coming from the people who made Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nOne of the saving points of this anime is actually its art and animation , the characters were designed pretty well and backgrounds were beautifully made. There were some scenes where i just paused and observed how beautifully drawn the background , some fighting scenes were insanely well animated as well so kudos to the people behind the art and animation you guys deserve a cookie.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe voice actors actually did a really decent job in voicing the characters , all of them sounded like i expected them to sound which was a huge plus for me. The OST and songs that were used for the OP and ED were also pretty amazing and this is definitely one of the merits of this show\\n\\n\r\nOverall : \\n\\n\r\nWhile i enjoyed some parts of this show I couldn't look past the faults to give it a score higher then 5/10. I left the show with a ton of questions and was given an ending that left me unsatisfied , perhaps it could have done a better job with 24 episodes but at its current state a 5/10 is all i could give it. \\n\\n",

Charlotte is an anime where you go in expecting something nice, but come out being more than satisfied as everything is not what itseems. \\n\\n\r\nfor the first 1 - 5 episodes at first you expect this series to be light hearted and very comedic, Charlotte knows when to be serious with drama and action and when to be comedic, therefore it doesn't create awkwardness. \\n\\n\r\nOn the 6th episode said event takes place and changes the anime completely, although the problem is resolved within one episode that is why some people are upset with the story progression, as it could be better.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the 6th episode, the story progression becomes amazing, it is not something you expect, and it is written out so good, it is mainly the story which captured me into watching and loving this series. \\n\r\nSome people criticize this anime saying that it is unoriginal, it may contain some elements of angel beats or Clannad at some times, but it is still an original work of art, the story is more than original I haven't seen or heard a story such as this before with the plot twists and the progression, its amazing.\\n\\n\r\nPros and Cons:\\n\\n\r\nFirst lets start with the bad, the character development for some said characters could be better, as after some event takes place on a certain character the writers don't take much time to connect you to the person, but instead it shows the main character eating and enjoying food, no death flags at all. \\n\r\nAnd some characters don't get enough screen time, and lastly it is slightly rushed, the series would be even more perfect if they spent more time developing characters and making the series longer.\\n\\n\r\nNow the good, the art was beautifully drawn,\\n\r\nevery scene had me very satisfied, and the music, when the scene is tense or sad, the music would capture you into the scene,\\n\r\nthe story was original and had me at the edge of my seat the whole entire time. Again I come to the music, the ED and the OST are stunning, I've even after finishing the series gone back and listened to them and downloaded some of the OST's.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

            "content": "I was looking for a fun short anime to watch while bored one weekend, instead I came across charlotte an emotional rollercoaster with all its twists and turns at every corner. When you expected one thing to happen the complete opposite happened. This anime had it all from romance to time travel. Personally I enjoyed it much more than expected. \r\nThe story at times felt as if one thing was supposed to happen but the producers changed their minds at the last moment. I think that it would have been better to drag some themes out a little more than having them resolved in 1or 2 episodes like when Yuu was grieving over a loss of someone. Most things that happened had little explanations and kept you guessing what could happen next or how it got resolved later down. Charlotte may have been better as a 25 episode anime in my opinion which would have made the pacing a little better. The way that the story concluded was nice as everything was wrapped up leaving only some minor plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nYuu started off as a guy who would use anyone and cheat his way into life but he quickly changed when he was forced to leave his school and join another school and the student council. His power was originally to be able to control another person for 5 seconds. Nao, the character who forced him to join the student president often wondered around recording things, having the ability to turn invisible to one person at a time was the main love interest to Yuu. Yusarin is a pop idol who has the ability to be possessed by the dead would often get possessed by her dead sister Mira who had the ability to create fire, she had an interesting concept but the character could have had more development alongside Joujirou who can sort of teleport. Joujirou comes across serious at first but is supposed to be more comedic than comes out to be as I found it funny at the start every time he'd crash land or fanboy over Yusarin but it got old quick. The final main character is Yuu's younger sister Ayumi who also served comedic purposes when interacting with her brother but later on she seemed more like plot armour for the series than an actual person. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art style was pleasant to view and the opening was really good along with the ost.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the anime and would recommend it to someone looking for a short dramatic, emotional anime to watch for a couple of hours\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 9\\n\r\nArt 9\\n\r\nSound 8 \\n\r\nCharacter 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I started Charlotte, as usual, because the opening was nice. I haven't read anything about it and Lia had a great song. I didn't expect a lot, and with that in mind I decided to give it a chance.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIt's a nice story, for me it has a new concept (faulty superpowers) and that was good enough. The story itself is quite entertaining, it has some interesting moments, touching and funny. It's not Hamlet or Othello, but it's good enough to binge watch it.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nNot bad, not memorable. A nice color pallete, dark when it must be, light and happy when needed. The characters arewell designed, it does not abuse fanservice to cover flaws. There are not missed frames, there's no abuse of CGI. It's a nice anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the opening caught my attention, and the BGM is nice. But it's not wonderful, you won't be singing or mumbling anything from Charlotte in the shower\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point for me. Every character has it's own trauma, it's own agenda and a nicely developed personality. The MC has a decent growth and it's not perfect, but not in the \"MC is a boob obsesed guy\", more likely in a \"what the hell do I do with my life and superpowers?\".\\n\r\nEvery other characters has it's place and it's needed, there are no wasted characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to enjoy, even the darkest moments let you enjoy the anime. It's not something heavy, has some messages and let you with a few questions. It's not a \"Anime's over, lets grab a burguer\" thing, but it won't traumatize you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAn anime worth watching. Don't expect a memorable masterpiece, but don't expect some time filler piece of crap. It's a god series, it's a good story told in 13 episodes. It has a close ending.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend Charlotte.",

            "content": "\"What do you think happened to the first person who ever voiced a different opinion?\" - a quote from Charlotte I found to be quite fitting.\r\nBeing a fan of Angel Beats! I was excited to hear that Jun Maeda was creating another anime original that was described as the spiritual successor to Angel Beats! I was even more happy to hear that Jun Maeda planned on fixing all the problems that plagued Angel Beats! with Charlotte.\r\nAfter finishing Charlotte all I can say is their attempt at fixing Angel Beats! problems just brought a whole bunch of new problems to Charlotte. Despite my rating for Charlotteand its problems, I still actually thoroughly enjoyed Charlotte, at least for a majority of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\n---Spoilers Below---\\n\\n\r\nHere's a list of pros I found:\\n\r\n-Good concept. The idea of a world with some teens developing unique super powers really intrigued me.\\n\r\n-Good soundtrack. I especially like the ED: Yake Ochinai Tsubasa\\n\r\n-Good art and animation. As expected of P.A. Works.\\n\r\n-Interesting two main characters introduced at the start. (Yuu and Nao)\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Bland side characters. They get almost no development whatsoever.\\n\r\n-Yuu's character development is a mess. \\n\r\n-Rushed pacing. One minute everyone is playing cards, the next minute someone has been kidnapped.\\n\r\n-The story feels like a jumble of ideas that they tried cramming into 13 episodes.\\n\r\n-Deus ex Machina ending. How did they find a single lone person in China? It's never explained.\\n\r\n-Running jokes that are almost never funny.\\n\r\n-The characters have some idiotic moments just to get the plot moving. Let's approach some highly prepared terrorists that have hostages with hardly any plan at all!\\n\r\n-Many things left unexplained. Ever wondered why Nao is bullied? You have to read the freaking MANGA to get a vague explanation on it: http://i.imgur.com/yzNPJid.png\\n\r\n-Random unexplained events appearing to move the plot forward. Terrorist appearing without any foreshadowing at all?\\n\\n\r\nTo expand on some of the above. Yusa and Takajou have almost no importance to the story at all, we hardly learn anything about them and they don't make any large lasting impact on the story other than continuing to be friends with Yuu after everything.\\n\r\nThis is especially obvious with Takajou since he's pretty much there as Yuu's friend and comic relief with no actual development at all. \\n\r\nSpeaking of character development Yuu's personality is... confusing. Despite showing signs of being quite cunning and described and introduced as a narcissist he never really shows these traits after the first episode and acts like a generic MC with a bit of snark. The only defining trait I found that sticks with him throughout the whole series is... having a sister complex.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

SPOILER FREE REVIEW\r\nStory 8/10 \r\nThe story of this anime I think its pretty basic, teenagers gather superpowers or abilities out of nowhere, which can cause different types of problems due to being just teenagers or because of people going on a hunt for them. \r\n+Basic story but the way the manage the of use this is really good\r\nArt 10/10\r\nReally good art, great colors, in both landscapes and smalldetails. Amazing\\n\r\n+One of the main features of this anime\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nReally good cachy soundtracks. The OP is decent and the ending is very good. but the music that is played on important parts such as Sad/Comedic/Romance moments its really good\\n\r\n-If you dont like the way Japanese sing in english, you will cringe for 2/3 ep but nothing too bad\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nWe have decent development on the main two characters but the other characters were missing just a bit. Really enjoyable characters, really unique in a way, the tsundere isnt a tsundere, the brother sister relationship is just that and its amazing, one of the only anime that i like the sis-brother relationshop, the supporting characters were really great, it's sad they lacked development\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nOverall i enjoyed it so much, because it felt unique in a way. The first episodes would make you hooked to this anime. \\n\r\nThere is an episode where you think of dropping it but dont do it, it helps the MCs to get development, so just give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nSo in Summary\\n\\n\r\n+A basic story that was done right\\n\r\n+Really good PLOT TWIST\\n\r\n+MC is not a loser but has decent development through the series\\n\r\n+Really good supporting characters\\n\r\n+Makes you tear at least 2 or 3 times\\n\r\n+Really good animation\\n\r\n+It has a good ending \\n\\n\r\nIt didn't become a masterpiece because it was\\n\r\n- Rushed in so many ways, the 6 last ep should be a complete series.\\n\r\n- although there was development, it just lack more even on the supporting cast, that were really good\\n\r\n- There is romance, but it doesnt feel like its special enough due to the lack of development.\\n\r\n Nao is one of the best female Mc on anime, but their relationship lacked development\\n\\n\r\nBasically if this story were more develop in Characters/Romance/Story, with at least 12 episodes more, it would have become a Masterpiece it had everyting but still.. \\n\\n\r\n Its Worth It, you get emotional, you laugh, cry and feel love in the Mcs, you got an intersting story with good characters and an outstanding animation. If you are looking for that Give it a Try!\\n\\n",

            "content": "I watched this anime without reading on what it was about, what was its genre, etc. Just watched it on a whim, so I didn't know what should I be expecting.\r\nSo the story starts as a casual, normal school life comedy, with the exception that the characters have superpowers that have terrible twists. The main story seems to be interacting with others who also have superpowers and convincing them to not use theirs for their own safety. Other than that, some comedy here and there, some student bonding, etc. So far, so good. This was going on for almost half of the number of animeepisodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, after that, a cruel, terrible plot twist suddenly appears. Don't get me wrong, there was some drama from the first six episodes regarding one of the main characters, but it seems small compared to the sudden despairful tragedy that befalls one of the other main characters. There was almost no buildup to the suddenness, it just came out of nowhere out of this sweet, relaxing slice of life school comedy about a group of people helping people, that turned it suddenly into a drama. Okay, so this seems to be a drama anime after all, but I totally did not like this plot twist when the anime was a completely different genre an episode ago, or actually for the first half of the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, now that is out of the way... The rest wasn't much better. It actually got worse from that moment to the finish. There was some character development going on with the MC after the tragedy which was pretty decent, the secrets about the whole world was revealed, relationship development between the main cast. Which is cool if it wasn't done under three episodes. I feel that all of these data dumps and development dumps could have been done better if they were more spread out and done in five to six episodes or so. Also, that tragedy was able to somehow reverted because of some deus ex machina stuff.\\n\\n\r\nBy this time there were three more episodes left. One episode for introducing more drama and removing that deus ex machina, one episode for resolving the stories of the other people, and the final episode that could have been made into a whole anime series. Albeit a shitty one because everything that was happening in that final episode was unbelievable. Although it IS unbelievable that all those content were somehow fit in inside one final episode, with the makers thinking that this was somehow a brilliant idea. Oh well.\\n\\n\r\nI don't judge much on art and sound, but they were pretty decent by my standards.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, so far so bad. So we had a terribly made and terribly paced story, with decent art and music. I should add that the characters were also terrible too. The main character was initially interesting in the first episode, but somehow turned into a bland protagonist in the second, and never came back to that entertaining guy from the first one. The rest were just terrible clich\u00e9s without real depth. Also, with all the mundaneness of the first half of the anime, there was no development with the main cast. And at the second half of the anime, three of the main cast were basically irrelevant to the story already. Absolutely horrid and dreadful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a damn waste of time. It had an amazing premise, I actually like stories where regular people have superpowers. And I didn't mind the school comedy slice of life from the first half since I actually enjoy a lot of anime like that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the rest: the sudden and out of nowhere drama genre shift introduced at the middle, the terrible pacing, the comedy that pops out every now and then to ruin everything, the episodes that could have done better if they were spread out in more than one, the terrible characters (those in the main cast and those in the second half of the anime that they force you to care about), and that BS finale. These was just all too much. And these will be the reasons why I give this anime a low score.",

            "content": "If you want a series thats an absolute emotional roller coaster and has one of the most satisfying conclusions to an anime in recent years then this is the anime for you. Episodes 1-5 will build up your interest in the series only to have episodes 6-8 rip your heart out only for things to get better, Then get bad again at episodes 11-12, with finally having a well tied together satisfying end to the series in episode 13. More happens in these 13 episodes than what happens in many 25-50+ episode series and is somehow well executed without seeming too rushed. Overall this animehas one of the better character progression/growth throughout the anime as many newer anime lack real character development (imo) but are rather cliche and just flashy with the main protagonist being the same guy in the last episode as they were in the first episode. Charlotte however is a different case in which we get to see the main character go through a lot of development to seemingly find his purpose for existing. In conclusion l i give this series a 9 and would recommend you guys watch it for yourself.",

            "content": "Charlotte intrigued me quite a bit at first but gradually got better, typically near the end.\r\nThere were many things that felt overused and dried the anime out such as Takajou over-obsessing and fawning over Misa, and I actually really used to like his character at first. A lot of the comic scenes were repeated too often for my liking. I'm also not a fan of the main character finding a lover in anime that isn't listed under the romance genre, because they most likely always give some random reason for a character to have feelings for the main character to the point that it justdoesn't work and appears dull and unreasonable, and sadly a lot of anime do that. Examples being Owari no Seraph, Noragami, and Boku no Hero Academia. I'm just not a fan of forced relationships that don't develop naturally like how love should develop. It shouldn't be just some random crush out of nowhere, however, I'll let Charlotte slide because it was the ending. I still didn't see that much bonding between the two of them and her persona wasn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nThe abilities that people have aren't all that creative, however, their side effects can be, and it's nice to see characters having weaknesses and how differently they use them. That didn't fail. Yuu's \"hidden\" ability is immensely overpowered and in the final episode they didn't leave out any good use of abilities in the world, which was lovely yet melancholic to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe many plot twists worked perfectly and the backstories and deaths were deeply depressing. The anime executed the time travel quite efficiently, and time travel is an easy thing to mess up. A few times, the time travel scenes didn't mention that much, while others mentioned a load. It all really depended on how much you looked into the gaps between what they repeated and what they didn't.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime made a drastic change to Yuu's character in episode 7, but for some reason, they decided to discontinue it like it never happened. The comet was also mentioned once and never mentioned again and the English voice acting in the sub was sub-par. The Engrish being spoken by Yuu and others was hilariously adorable though.\\n\\n\r\nYuu appears to be quite sadistic. Very sadistic. Hella sadistic, and I like it. He still feels human but that little twist of insanity that continues all the way from start to end, switching on and off, is something that I'm definitely a fan of.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was... alright. Although after having him wanted by the whole world with them all trying to kill him, they never mentioned what stopped them from attacking him anymore. Everything just became normal. And what about the vaccines that they mentioned? Who did that?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's not the best of anime out there, but it most certainly isn't the worst. With slight improvement, the anime would've been amazing.",

            "content": "Charlotte is an ongoing manga from Maeda Jun, the same writer as Angel Beats. He also did some work on Air, which was considerably less impressive. Last year, Charlotte got a thirteen episode anime adaptation from P.A. Works. The same studio behind both Angel Beats & Another. Knowing nothing else about the series, that's a couple of good signs. We've got a writer who's shown skill in another work and the same studio that worked with him on it. On the other hand, Penguindrum also had a writer and studio that had both shown great ability before and we all know how that turned out.I'm still cautiously optimistic for this one, so let's take a look.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open with our protagonist, Otosaka Yuu, explaining that he has the power to take control of other people for five seconds when he's within visual range of them. He uses this power to cause trouble for people he doesn't like, peep, manipulate events to his advantage and cheat at school. With the only disadvantage being that his regular body slumps over while he's doing it. One day, he's approached by a member of the student council who sits him down to retake a test. Otosaka tries to take control of him to get the answers, only to find that the supposed answer sheet is something entirely different. He finds himself being chased by two students from a different school, Tomori & Takajou. Both of whom exhibit strange abilities like his own. They explain that the abilities manifest at adolescence, like Marvel's mutant powers but, unlike those, they fade away with time. The two compel him to join them at their school. That's where the meat of our story begins.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few points that act to the series' detriment. The first is that it has some tonal problems. We start out with things keeping a fairly light-hearted and kind of silly tone but, not quite halfway through, things suddenly get pretty dark and a lot more serious. It's more than a little awkward. The second issue is with the very final episode. This episode crams in enough material that, well-paced, should be at least three or four episodes. As a result things that should get developed more strongly or that should be built up or that should have some time to develop tension, end up getting rushed through as everything gets wrapped up. Finally, we have a slight problem with the romance. To Maeda's credit, I do like that the main romance in this is built on mutual respect and that it does drive both characters involved to be better people. However, the romance arc itself unravels in a pretty clich\u00e9d way and it's not one that develops particularly naturally.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are a lot of strong points to the series. The more light-hearted moments are really enjoyable and funny. There are also some really strong emotional moments. If the series had done a better job of integrating both from the get go, both would be handled nearly flawlessly. As is, the execution is still very impressive. The story itself is also strong at introducing hints about the main narrative throughout the more episodic content, which allows for some strong tension as things progress further and you get more curious about where they're going with certain things. I also do like the way the series handles its super powers. It's a refreshingly unique and clever take on the way those kinds of stories are usually done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMaeda actually takes a pretty significant risk in introducing the main character in this series. Namely, there's nothing likeable or even that interesting about Otosaka in our initial look at the character. He's petty, pervy and just generally terrible. Only after we get this initial, bad impression does the character start getting fleshed out and his positive aspects start coming through. First impressions mean a lot and this could have, in the hands of a less skilled writer, killed any potential for us to identify with him. However, in this case it works. For one thing, the first positive traits we're exposed to are the result of his affection towards his little sister, which does have verisimilitude. We also see the character gradually change as a result of his interactions with the student council. Not only that, but his negative traits are still present, just less pronounced. He also does suffer consequences for all the nasty things we see him do. The other major characters are pretty compelling and developed as well. There are some really strong interactions among the characters in this. The side characters vary quite a bit. Some are pretty fleshed out while others are stagnant and flat.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI have to give P.A. Works credit on this one. The animation in this is pretty fantastic. The backgrounds are very nicely detailed. It's a very nice looking series.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWe get some really strong vocal performances in this. Especially coming from Sakura Ayane, Uchiyama Kouki, Uchida Maaya & Ono Daisuke. The music from Anant-Garde Eyes & Maeda Jun is really well done. Which isn't really surprising since they also worked on the music for Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere is a little bit. When Yuu's sister, Ayumi, talks about Yusa she tends to get hearts in her eyes and nose bleeds which kind of indicate that she has a crush.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nSo, with everything said and done this anime is great. There are a lot of narrative and character strengths with really strong acting, music and artwork. While there are a few factors that do hold it back, it's still a great watch. If you were a fan of Maeda's work on Angel Beats or the premise sounds good to you, check it out. My final rating is going to be a strong 8/10. Next week, I'll look at another requested anime with Rakudai kishi no cavalry.",

            "content": "(Vague spoilers ahead)\r\nIt has a very appealing concept. There was so much potential, but the overall execution bogged the series down.\r\nCHARACTER\r\nThe characters aren't exceptionally great. They're entertaining here and there, but they won't stick with you. Characters are too flat, or characterization is all over the place.\r\nExample of the former: Yusa. She stays her happy cute self from beginning to end. Sure, there are steadfast characters, but she barely shows other personality traits. And when she DOES show other sides, say, when she's sad because of a personal reason (and it was only once), it's not built up to it. It came out of nowhere,and I felt nothing for her. The same goes for her sister, Misa.\\n\\n\r\nExample of the latter: Yu, our main guy. I can't assign a word to his personality. For the first episode he comes off smug and ambitious, next he's apathetic and standing around taking orders, then he gets too nice (I see the reason why, but it was so fast) and suddenly intimate. By the end he's determined to save the world because he's obligated to save it (he doesn't have to be, even if it's for the person he cares about). Around the middle-end, he brings up his reason behind his smug and ambitious traits in the beginning of the series, but by that point it's irrelevant to mention. It's very out-of-place and unsuccessful. His motivation is not narratively strong.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nThe story is a gigantic mess overall.\\n\r\nAt the beginning it seems to build up well, but halfway in plot devices come in out of nowhere, and at the end all answers and resolutions are harshly thrown at you. The major turns ask for a lot of suspension of disbelief from the audience. There are side stories that are tossed in for about 5-7 minutes and suddenly it's over. So there are pacing and build-up issues.\\n\\n\r\nOne example of the side story is Misa's background. In one episode, they set you up so that you can bond with her, and then the next moment, the climax of her story happens and you are expected to feel sad for her. After that the plot continues on as if that didn't even happen. Things move fast, and the audience doesn't emotionally follow.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example is the Shun's entrance to the story. They try to establish his presence in the first episode via Ayu's mention, but it's ineffective because 1) they've set up the trope predictably, it wasn't surprising when he was revealed and 2) he is never mentioned again for the next five or six episodes, therefore putting down their efforts to establish his presence. Again, no gradual build-up, and it's paced weird.\\n\r\nNext, they shove him in your face, and then proceed to explain EVERYTHING about why he's in the story at all. It's poor exposition, which adds onto the list of issues for why the story fails.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, this plot could've worked. It failed because of poor preparation; it could've easily been executed better if they outlined the plot well. They could've picked a different point at where to start the story. Why did the story begin after the events? The only reason could be for plot twists. But that's unsuccessful because they hinted the missing important character from the start, and didn't build up to the backstories well.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of important characters, this brings another issue I have: the main cast is wrongly picked out. The main cast is considered to be Yu, Tomori, Yusa, and Takajou. The first two are indeed main, but the other two had nothing to do with the events beforehand. Whereas, the missing character at the start, Shun, is very important to the plot. He's the man that knows everything that's going on, and yet his entrance to the story has no impact? As aforementioned, he's shoved in with lost build-up, and so he feels forced to be significant. He doesn't feel like a main character at all. In other words, characters that aren't important are shown significant, and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nMy point is: they should've picked a starting point in which Yu, Ayu, AND Shun are the main focus for the entire duration of the series. Kumagami could've been a main character too since he is Shun's right hand man, but he's a supporting character and portrayed not as important as the others, for example, Tomori. Tomori could arguably be taken out. The story can easily hold if Yu's character motive is rearranged.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion for the story: terrible build-up, terrible pacing, and terribly disorganized in presentation.\\n\r\nThere were some nice moments, such as the episode in which Yu goes off on his own for a whole episode (but it's not perfect). I even praise the last episode for presenting events concisely, but looking at plot wholly, it's not good. What does it matter if one part is contained well when other parts are messes? In the end, the acceptable aspects don't override the bad.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nCool concept. Loads of potential. Poor characters, poorly executed story. Can still find enjoyment and good aspects.\\n\r\nI didn't bother to elaborate on writing (main criticism is dialogue is unnatural and funky sometimes) because it is minor in comparison to the disorganization of presenting the story. You can't write well if you don't have the plot exposition ordered well in the first place.\\n\r\nThe final score is 3-4, I'll fluctuate between those two.",

            "content": "I'll try to keep this one free of spoilers.  Because I'm trying to get you to watch this anime.\r\nAfter seeing more 3's and 2's than I see in a basketball game, I decided to write my very first review.  Bear with me if it's trash.\r\nIn all honesty, I thought Charlotte wasn't too bad, unlike how the reviews suggested.  The best way I can sum up how I feel about Charlotte is that it had potential, but didn't take that potential and do anything.  But still, it was an enjoyable show.  Here's why.\r\nThe story wasn't necessarily something revolutionary or anything, butit wasn't bad.  Imperfect people get imperfect superpowers, and they must live with them.  Not bad.  My biggest problem with the storyline was that it was...fragmented.  Or maybe rushed is the better word.  There were a hundred ideas and backstories to cover but it wasn't done well in 13 episodes, and they didn't quite connect well.  The first several episodes were almost like fillers, where each person with a superpower gets briefly introduced and then never seen again.  And then, when the plot really starts to take off around halfway through the show, there are only 7 or so episodes remaining to cover what was the more interesting part of the show.  And the ending (I won't say anything don't worry) was really something that should have been a second season.  The concept behind the ending was spectacular in my opinion, but they covered a huge amount of substance in only one episode.  Disappointing.  But when the show really started to go somewhere halfway through, I was hooked.  I loved what was going on, and I wanted to see more.  All in all, a story with potential that isn't realized.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good.  I'm a sucker for sexy artwork and Charlotte does a fine job.  The sound is good too, nothing super memorable but still good.  These aspects of Charlotte don't really affect my opinion of Charlotte all that much.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters.  I get some mixed feelings here.  I'm going to start by saying this:  I wasn't really attached to them. Sure, they were likable, and sure, they were somewhat amusing.  But they just didn't quite seem real, and it's not just because they weren't as developed as I would have liked.  The main character Otosaka's personality unrealistically switches between polar opposites.  Tomori's personality is just strange and clunky.  The characters never felt realistic or relatable.  I didn't get their motives, or their feelings.  So when tragedy or romance struck, I wasn't really all that moved.  It wasn't genuine.  Another problem with the characters was that not all of them really were well focused on.  It's understandable if some characters just don't get development.  That's to be expected.  But there were so many characters that seemed interesting, but only were relevant for one or two episodes.  Too much for a small anime.  But the characters were interesting enough to pique my curiosity, even though the ones I was curious about never got really developed.  Again, there was some potential that wasn't realized.\\n\\n\r\nI can say that I enjoyed this show.  I enjoyed it enough to get curious about the characters and the story, and to get interested in the world of Charlotte.  But the show never answered by questions, nor did it really absorb me.  It was rushed, clunky.  The characters didn't really get fleshed out, and neither did the storyline.  And the ending episode, with so much potential to be an entirely new series, was crammed into one episode.  \\n\\n\r\nSo much potential, and so much of it lost.\\n\r\nA 7 for mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the questions left unanswered...\\n\r\n*dont read past this if you haven't seen the anime yet.  they aren't really spoilers but still dont do it* \\n\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n..\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nwhy is otonashi (otosaka?) actually kinda OP, even though one of the premises that the beginning of the story focused on is that no one is truly OP.\\n\r\nalso why are the otosaka siblings so strong?  what makes them special?\\n\r\nwhy invest in a vaccine when you need a solution? you have 75 years to make a vaccine...\\n\r\nwhy didn't they approach otosaka faster? why even send him to the school?\\n\r\nhow did he regain his memories? is ZHIED like some magic memory stimulator?\\n\r\nhow does the government not realize there's a school of superkids\\n\r\nwhy is it just superkids and not adults?  well this is kinda briefly explained but I call BS\\n\r\ncan i say 1/10 for romance?  \\n\r\nwhat was the point of joujirou or the idol girl?  they literally got no backstory and served no purpose\\n\r\nhow does otosaka not realize his op-ness\\n\r\nwhy pizza sauce?\\n\r\nhe can stop bullets but not a crossbow?\\n\r\nisn't the power of courage kinda dumb?  and more to the point, what determines what power you get?\\n\r\n*END",

            "content": "MINOR SPOILERS:\r\n~~~~\r\nThe plot is wasted potential. So much wasted potential. I'll list the reasons why it's just so crap later on. First, let's get the good stuff out of the way:\r\nTHE GOOD: ART + SOUND\r\nThe opening song was so good it was stuck in my head. Trust me when I say it's rare nowadays. The voice actors are good and give life to the characters, particularly one character who had a split personality of sorts. The voice actress really made the two personalities feel distinct.\r\nThe art is beautiful, with plenty of beautiful environments. The last stretch of the anime had the main character roaming theworld, and the art team really showed their talent there.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to the crappy part.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD: STORY + CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThey were fantastic in the first 8 episodes. The main character started out as a power hungry jackass, but you could see him mellow throughout the first half. There were lots of feels as well, with episode 2 and episode 7 being the standouts. The characters were interesting, and you could feel them becoming closer throughout those episodes as they worked together over and over. Even though they were just archetypes, they were still likable because of their interactions together. \\n\\n\r\nThen episode 9 hit. Jesus christ. You could tell the writing team panicked at this point and threw any sort of good pacing and storytelling out the window to fit the grand scheme of the story in properly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThree characters were introduced, but all they did was introduce their abilities then were regulated in the background. They never use their ability onscreen after they show what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThrough a convenient deus ex machina, they gave the protagonist the ability to completely undo a key part of his character development, and erased two episode's worth for every other character. A villain was introduced then immediately dropped IN THE SAME EPISODE (what the f*ck?). \\n\\n\r\nAnother character dies, forcing an emotional response from his closest friend (which has one scene's worth of development). Two of the main cast from the first eight episodes were all but ignored. One of them was given a proper ending to her arc...but since they barely developed the arc, they tried to develop and end it within a four minute scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe romantic arc came to a close so fast that it was a slap in the face. There was practically no payoff for any shippers around the world. At this point, you might as well not put in a resolution and let the fans speculate.\\n\\n\r\nThe journey around the world happened in ONE EPISODE. A single episode. Timeskip after timeskip after timeskip. There was so much potential to be had here, but they just condensed him literally travelling to every country in the world to a mere twenty minutes. There was so much missed here it hurt.\\n\\n\r\nThe last four episodes completely ruin the story of the anime. Just thinking about it is disappointing.",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I'm not sure what to think about this anime... I like it, I want to like that I like it, but I feel like something is missing... And I shall explain:\r\nThe concept is great, in my opinion. People being chased because of their powers is nothing new, but imperfect supernatural powers gained by teenagers during adolescence and fade away with time is something I haven't seen before.\r\nAs for the story, the pacing is really weird... It starts off nice and slow. The first six episodes of the anime are stand-alone episodes that have no significant plot points (except for a little foreshadowing),but after the mid-season climax everything feels so rushed and you feel like some parts could be so much better if the characters had more time.\\n\r\nWhen the main plot line begins, the show goes really dark (unlike the cheerful slice-of-life school anime it was at the beginning), and you get to see many new sides about the main characters. That was the part where the anime really shined, but the ending still felt rushed, lacking and somewhat disappointing.\\n\r\nThe story as a whole was very funny, yet very touching (although it was a bit cliched sometimes) and I really enjoyed watching it overall.\\n\\n\r\nIt is said that the anime industry is running out of ideas, but any old idea can be carried by good characters. That statement does not apply to charlotte. The story is very original and unique in a somewhat familiar setting (highschool), but the characters are not. It's not that they're bad characters and they do develop over the course of the show, but they bring nothing new to the screen and they started off a little bland in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was very fitting to the show, but it didn't stand out so much and didn't do more than just complimenting to the show rather than adding something. I can't point out any particular piece from the soundtrack that I really liked and went searching after I finished watching the show, including the opening, the ending and the inserted songs (that were probably the most notable part of the soundtrack).\\n\r\nAs for the voice actors, they did an amazing job portraying the characters (especially Kouki Uchiyama as Yuu Otosaka and Daisuke Ono as Shunsuke Otosaka, who both showed a large variety of emotions in a very believable and enjoyable way).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was absolutely breathtaking and is the only part I have no complaints about. The anime excelled in the art department both in quality, design and special effects for the supernatural powers.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up: this anime could have been a perfect 10 if it had more episodes. The story felt so rushed towards the end and the final episode felt like the writers tried to condense an entire season into one 26 minute long episode, which made it a bit disappointing (there are other reasons too, but spoilers...). But even though it was rushed and cliched sometimes, it is still a very entertaining and highly enjoyable show. I definitely recommend to check it out.",

If you have seen that or that kind of genre you will find probably have some interest. \r\nI really liked the idea of Charlotte. And I think the author did too, but he just wasn't able to execute the events in a way that could truly engage the viewers feelings. It had the potential for more romance, for more sci fi, for more everything but it just didn't deliver.\r\nThis is not an original story, it has been done, but thatsokay when its done right.

Id say \"what a stupid idea, totally unrealistic\". But its an anime and i'm suppose to roll with it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Loved the art, specially the backgrounds, skies, space, stars, graphics in general. All very pretty background material. The animation was average modern quality art though. \\n\\n\r\nsound: Im going to make this the music section. The soundtrack wasn't that special but I did like the band songs. Zhiend!!\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the ending... they had the right idea, but golden time did it 10x better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Charlotte wasn't that bad, it did have its moments, but there is no feeling of attachment or lingering emotions of  \"its ended now, im sad\".  Its more like a feeling of nostalgia that you've just watched it and only think of certain ideas on the authors ideas + a little time lapse.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte would have been a cool steins gate / heroes mix, but there was just very little weight behind its punches. I was more disappointed than anything because it had lots of potential. Its a shame really... Everything was just shown in a way that just didn't really make you care too deeply about it. The emphasis wasn't there, and you didn't get a sense of bonding with anyone, nor do they make you feel like backing up the characters goal. Serious parts felt brushed by when everything just returns to normal again within an episode. And the character growth was insignificant. It could have turned epic in so many ways, but failed to do so in all of them. The end also felt really rushed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Probably one of few who thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It started slow, and ended abruptly but it was solid for what they managed to cram into 13 episodes.\r\nThe powers became more and more appealing as the anime progressed and so did the character development. There was a lot of mystery and tragedy as expected from the guy who wrote angel beats and Clannad (shout out to the angel beats cameo around episode 8). The problems they incurred were sort of over done - they either over expanded or under expanded on each problem and it wasn't too annoying but it was avoidable. \r\nMC is aweird character and I like that. He has about 3 different personalities witchin the entirety of the anime but it's to be expected. His past and his future were very well done. Would I say he is OP? No, but he could have been which I am glad they didn't over do. The other main characters all possessed different traits but very typical. Mid level tsundere, borderline yandere, undercover muscley skinny guy with glasses, mystery guy who's actually a badass and every other side character .... Lol but it's not necessarily a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nStory wise, I think it was well done. Aside from the rushed ending and avoidable conflict it was interesting. The ending had my heart sore for a while. There was something piercing about it that was weirdly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nArt style was well done as usual and modern. Nothing more to say ^.^\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth a watch - there was a lot of pressure on the winter anime season but I think Charlotte was pretty good. Would definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I went into this show with no idea of who directed it, and even if I had, it would have made no difference seeing as how I was never really that big of a fan of Angel Beats. People praise it like it\u2019s the second coming of Christ yet I only see it as an above average show that barely managed to pull on my heart strings. This of course is by no means a stab at the show, but rather a stab at the people who glorify it. However that is a topic for another day. Charlotte'soverarching plot is about a small group of humans with supernatural abilities, and their struggles fitting into human society, as well as the conflicts between them and humans that come as a result. The story focuses on an Otosaka Yuu, a boy with the ability to temporarily take over someones body, a power with which he uses to cheat in life. However when he is introduced to Tomori Nao he begins to change for the better, and instead joins her in her quest to stop other people who abuse their powers.\\n\\n\r\nSpoilerWarning\\n\\n\r\nCharacters  7\\n\r\nCharacter Development  7\\n\r\nThis show wants you to believe that there is a large cast of interesting people before you, but in all honesty I found most of the cast to be rather bland. Our main protagonist Yuu is introduced as being a very complex character who is filled with many traits that most of us would consider to be quite negative, and while this may not make him a very likable character, it gives him individuality. However this changes almost immediately in order to make him a character that the audience can more easily relate to. An idea that might seem good on paper, but should have been obvious during its execution, was not. Instead it would have been a more interesting approach to make him eventually open up to Tomori. So while he maintains a slightly devious attitude, he shows a softer side only to her. I feel that the idea that he is only truly kind to his sister, who he cares for extremely dearly, and Tomori who he is supposed to grow to have romantic feelings towards would have been a much more intriguing approach to his character development.\\n\r\nOut of all the cast, there were only two characters who I truly cared for or liked, and that would be Otosaka Ayumi and Takajou Joujirou. The later was the only character who personality I truly enjoyed, a type of stupidity birthed from too much kindness. And then the little sister was just the most likable character in the whole show, maybe even the only one. It was her death that really drew me into the show, and also what made me slightly like Yuu. Her death acted as a way for him to grow as a person, which was a surprising approach I didn't expect seeing as how the show felt too happy go lucky to kill off any of its main characters; technically i was right though as I later found out. With the introduction of Otosaka Shunsuke her death basically lost any of the weight it previously had, at least in my mind it did. Any weight that death might have carried was almost gotten rid of. Otosaka was the only character who I truly believed had to live through a life of pain and suffering, as he had to in fact live through several, and did so in order to save and help others; and in doing so damaged his own life.\\n\r\nNow regarding the relationship between Yuu and Tomori people say that it\u2019s done horribly wrong, and to that I would strongly disagree, at least regarding Yuu\u2019s feelings. At first Yuu and Tomori share this sort of loathing for each other, and this continues but lightens with time as they grow closer to each other. The height of the romance in my opinion is during Yuu\u2019s fall from greatness, if you can call it that. It is at that time where they truly exhibit true worry and emotions towards each other. However with Yuu\u2019s jump back in time, he maintains his feelings for her, feelings which she doesn\u2019t share, and will never reciprocate. This is one of the more saddening developments in my mind, however these emotions of mine are later made out to be pointless as he woos her in the most ridiculous way at the end of the show, with a mere promise. So it is to my belief that in making Tomori return his feelings, a second time, that they went wrong in the romance aspect. His unrequited emotions could have been a driving force instead of a secondary emotion that the writers use as a sort of symbol for his perseverance.\\n\r\nPlot  8\\n\r\nPacing  7\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know where people get off saying that the story is uninteresting, perhaps a little clich\u00e9 (super powered people are alienated due to being different and have to fend for themselves by fighting off an evil corporation that wants to do so and so to them). Aside from that however I really like several ideas used, however overall the show tried too hard to be a tragedy, and in the process seemed to lose some of its genuine feels. Each episode was a new sob story with a quality equivalent to that of a harem character\u2019s backstory, in other words for the most part they are uninteresting and bland.\\n\r\nThe show is divided up into several mini arcs, each of which tells the backstory, or leads up to the backstory of one of the characters, in that sense the pacing is done pretty well. However that is all up until the ending of the show. If you have seen the show then you know what I am talking about. The atrocity that is the end of this show is so bad that it made me drop the pacing grade from a nine to a seven. The final episode is choke full of moments of deus ex machina, plot holes, extremely convenient coincidences, and just straight up nonsense. If they really wanted to go forward with that ending, which in my opinion should never have passed the brainstorm session from which it was crapped out, then they should have ended with a cliff hanger and eluded to a second season. Because while I definitely would not have watched the sequel, many people would. All in all the ending was overly rushed and poorly executed.\\n\r\nMusic  8\\n\r\nArt  8\\n\r\nIt is in my opinion that the chosen art style, like in angel beats, does not fit the flow of the show correctly. This took away from my immersion on multiple occasions, however this was most prominent in the arc after Ayumi\u2019s death, with the serious atmosphere that they set up, the concept of drug addiction and other real world topics, the animation just didn\u2019t seem to fit. The music as a whole was alright, nothing amazing. Good atmospheric music that managed to at least engross you in the story, even when it got bad.\\n\r\nEnjoyment  8\\n\r\nWhile people may hate on this anime and say that it doesn\u2019t live up to its legacy, while true I guess, that doesn\u2019t matter as the show is still ok. You will enjoy your time watching this show, a lot more so than other shows with the same rating. So it is for that reason that I still recommend watching it, I would have to place it as the fifth best show of the summer season, not including OVA\u2019s and movies.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFinal Verdict   75/100\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed this review, I had fun analyzing the show, and even realized that I had given the show too high of an initial rating. Before writing this review I had given this show an 8, which is now changed to a 7 after doing this review. This was the first time this has ever happened and I look forward to other similar cases that\u2019ll do the same and intrigue me in the process. Thanks for reading and have a nice rest of your day.\\n",

            "content": "When I first saw the description of this anime I wasn't expecting very much from it 'A group of high school students, who have superpowers'. With that in mind this anime surprised me, it was executed almost perfectly. And its easily one of the best anime I have seen.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe plot is by far the best part of the anime, instead of the standard shounen anime where every single character would be really OP, these characters had imperfect abilities such as only being able to time-travel when light enters your eye, and with each use you become more blind, or being able to speedup a disease from occurring. These characters had to work with their abilities to prevent other ability wielders  from being captured, and experimented on, a short while in the anime some very tragic events unfold once you get a good feel for the anime, and it completely changing the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nThe art isn't amazing, it was just what I would consider above standard, it focused on the background a lot making it look lively, though it never really caught my interest. But it fit into the anime so well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe music is basically on par with my standard bar, didn't enjoy it, didn't hate it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nThis is another big factor in which I LOVE this anime. Each character, even a lot of the side characters had a good amount of character development. The main characters stages went through Total douche > A hard working slacker (Odd comparison, I know) > Total douche V2 > Nice guy > Batshit insane (Insane enough to be called the 'One-Eyed Reaper').\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 12/10\\n\r\nYes? I ****ING LOVED THIS ANIME.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nAlmost perfect. Much better than Angel Beats, and Clannad in my opinion.",

            "content": "WARNING: SLIGHT SPOILERS.\r\nWhen I picked up Charlotte, I didn't know what to expect. It looked promising. The show itself is breathtaking in its art direction and design. The opening and ending themes are beautiful. The animation is great, in my opinion. The main reason why I was hesitant is the writer: Jun Maeda. On the one hand, he wrote Clannad, a show that recieved praise for being really good. On the other hand, he wrote Angel Beats: a show that suffered from having not enough episodes and too many characters to actually fully develop in those episodes. Unfortunately, Charlotte is another Angel Beats. A goodpremise that suffers from horrible execution with a plot so convoluted it can be described as a rollercoaster ride, but not the fun ones with excitement and terror and anxious feelings. This a ride that makes you feel empty and cheated.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's main character is a young boy named Yuu/Yu. Yu seems to be a perfect student. Perfect grades, perfect manners and perfect looks, the usual. However, this isn't the case. Yuu/Yu is an ability wielder, his ability being to take over a person's body for 5 seconds until he's thrown back into his own body. Because of this ability, Yuu/Yu has cruised through life easily by using his ability to cheat on tests as well as manipulating others to do certain actions, like taking over a person's body to punch another person (ALSO, BE PREPARED TO SEE THIS ALOT). However, his life changes when he meets a girl named Nao Tomori. Tomori is the Student Body President of a nearby school that secretly houses other ability users like herself and Yu. After catching Yuu in the act and threatening him, Yuu transfers into Tamori's school and joins the Student council, where he helps Tomori stop and gather more ability users to keep them safe. And so begins, Charlotte. Overall the story is a mess. Essentially over Charlotte's 13 episode long season the plot starts off as the poor man's X-Men, with the main characters tracking down others like them in the hopes of either getting them to join the academy or forcing them to stop using their abilities. However, as the story progresses, the plot devovles into the poor man's Stein's Gate, with completely unnecessary time travel that makes the plot really complicated for no reason. And finally, the story devovles into the poor man's Darker than Black, with the main character becoming a black trenchcoat wearing badass going around the world, \"saving people. During the last episode. For no reason whatsoever. Honestly the show started out strong, but unfortunately like Angel Beats it tries to fit in too much in too little time causing the show to feel rushed and causing character interactions to feel nonexistent or forced. And even more unfortunate is the shows plot holes. Oh god, the plot holes. Be prepared to say, \" What? \" and \"How did that happen?!!\" and \"Why didn't he/she/they do that!!?\" ALOT. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Charlotte is just disappointing. Don't bother with it, unless you enjoy seeing terrible shows trying to be edgy and serious. \\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n",

And I have to say, I loved it to bits.\r\nThe story is about a teenager who uses his abilities to help himself get ahead. What he doesn't know is how drastically his life is about to take a turn, and how deeply rooted he is to everything that's going on.\r\nWhile it does have a slow start (filled with humor, so it's not all that boring), the story really picks up about halfway into the show. From then on out it becomes a roller-coaster that takes you allover the place, both in terms of the show's themes and in terms of your emotions.\\n\\n\r\nComing from the people who made Angel Beats! and Clannad, I expected no less of this.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, while some might not appreciate this, I for one feel that more of a good thing is not bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciated the story and the art, and while some of the characters were pretty much one dimensional, that in itself has become a trope in Anime.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and would have given it a higher rating if the first 6 episodes had more than just some humor now and then to liven them up (the build up was worth it I suppose, just wish there was more content).\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone looking to give this a try, it's quite good. If you like Angel Beats!, Clannad, Death Note (the main character would use his powers to help him succeed in his goals, \u00e0 la Light), or just stories that start light and end heavy, this is an Anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy. ^_^",

            "content": "Key, as the king of visual novel adaptations, has in recent years, brought us many a story that have brought people in the anime community to tears and/or just a rather nice story.  So, in partnership with P.A. Works, a godly animation studio known for fantastic animation, what kind of story comes with Charlotte, Key's newest original work?\r\nStory: Otosaka Yuu is a boy with an amazing ability.  Born with the ability to take over someone's body, he is able to control that person's will and make them do whatever he wants.  However, he is only able to do so for five seconds.This has been able to as a result, help him cheat in tests at school in order to make him seem like a smart guy.  In an attempt to try and woo over the school idol, Yuu comes in contact with Tomori Nao, a girl who has an ability just like him, the ability of invisibility.  (Though only against one person.)  He is then told that he will transfer into a school built for the sole purpose of housing ability wielders, and that Yuu will join the student council in the hunt for saving people with abilities.\\n\\n\r\nThe main story of Charlotte follows Yuu's journey into the world of abilities and ability users.  With the rest of the student council president, primarily Nao, Yuu goes episode-by-episode dealing with various ability users and the impacts that they as people have because of the ability they have.  The obvious issue with this is the fact that the Charlotte becomes very repetitive.  For about half of the entire series, Charlotte is basically the same story with just a rehash of who the ability user for the episode is.  As a result, the show doesn't really have much variation in its first half and the idea of slogging through six episodes worth of what is essentially the same story, isn't a very exciting prospect.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, beyond episode six, the story becomes very...different as I should say.  From the start of episode 7, the story makes a complete shift on what it was doing before, and made a complete turn on what it's focus was.  Making Yuu as the primary focus for this section of the anime, the show elevated what it could do for a little while, but...then fell down to some explanations that while kind of make sense in the grand scheme of the anime, didn't really fit in because they weren't integrated correctly.  The main issue with this is the sheer convenience of some points that they leave behind.  Especially in the last few episodes, a couple things don't make sense and as a result, leave quite a bit to be desired.  They add in a lot of factors to the equation of this anime and because of the time crunch, weren't explained and as a result, failed to add anything but confusion and questions to the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in Key anime is generally one of the more sought after things in a Key anime.  Since the shows are relatively solely character-based, a Key anime is a Key anime if it provides a lot of character development and growth of the cast.  Charlotte does this rather successfully primarily with Yuu.  Since the show completely focuses on his perspective, most of the character growth appears in Yuu and turns him into a pretty good character, channeling as much of the screentime that it can possibly allow to shape his personality, sometimes spending entire episodes to shape him up, which helps the series out immensely.  However, as a result, unlike Yuu, the rest of the characters either get some to help shape them up, or are simply just non-existent.  Aside from the main female protagonist, Nao, the other characters don\u2019t really get that kind of development and as such, are kind of left in the dust in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Charlotte\u2019s story is a lot like the way abilities work in this show.  It\u2019s good, but there\u2019s always some kind of heavy drawback for it.  For the story, there was always some kind of drawback for the show whenever it decided to be good, which made the show less glamorous than it could be.  Still though, the show ended on a very soft and nice note that brought the story to a relatively sweet conclusion.  Still raised quite a few questions questions, but a good ending nonetheless.  (I'm talking about the last few minutes of the show.  Everything before that, don't even mention it.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Lots of character development (though only for one character)\\n\r\n+ Good midpoint\\n\r\n+ Good bittersweet ending\\n\r\n-  Episodic first half  \\n\r\n-  Lack of character depth for a lot of characters\\n\r\n-  Rushed ending\\n\r\n-  Many plot holes\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Characters in Charlotte go into one of two camps.  Either they\u2019re important like Nao and Yuu, or they\u2019re there to aid the plot like everyone else.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the main protagonist of the series, Otosaka Yuu.  As a boy with the ability to possess someone\u2019s body for a grand total of five seconds, Yuu is very proud individual as he utilizes his ability for nothing more than dirty, dirty cheating.  As a bit of a narcissist, Yuu takes full pride of his ability and uses it as nothing more than a way to make himself look good in front of the populous.  As the main aforementioned protagonist of the series, Yuu is the character that absorbs most of the character development in the series.  As the series moves along, Yuu stats to change out from his narcissist personality and turns into someone who genuinely cares for the people around him and wishes to help people out.  This turnaround is one of the pinnacle moments of the series and one of the reasons why it's good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Tomori Nao, the main female protagonist of the series with the ability of invisibility.  (Though she is limited to only being invisible towards one person.)  As the character that becomes most often associated with Yuu, Tomori is a girl who bears a similar personality to the man she meets and learns about.  She's a bit narcissistic herself and doesn't hold back on anything in order to get the job done.  She's a great character because she actually feels like a character.  While she doesn't have the same volume of character growth as Yuu has, she stands alone as her own person and as someone who really helps Yuu, both traits which make her a great character.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast mostly falls into the \"plot device\" section, due to the fact that the show really doesn't put much character development into them.  Emphasis on any characters that play a key part in the series really only serve as a way to provide more development to the main characters, primarily Yuu, and as such are generally related to plot progression rather than actual characters.  Hell, the other student council members are shelved off for half of the series, and they are supposedly main characters.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great character development\\n\r\n+ Good main characters\\n\r\n-  Every other character is either plot device, or only brought up or involved when needed\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Charlotte was made by P.A. works and Key, and due to this combo, is GLORIOUS.  The art for Charlotte is by far one of the best qualities of the series on account of its sheer detail.  Every scene in Charlotte is made with a stunning background and fantastic quality, making each part of this series look like a work of art.  (I mean, dat sunset though...)\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the characters in the series are also rather well designed, as they flow very nicely into the style of art and host the same kind of quality that the backgrounds and the rest of the series has.  It's a breathtaking style that really brings a lot of beauty to the series, overall making it a very good show aesthetically.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ FANTASTIC ART  (That's all I have to say)\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Similarly, the soundtrack for Charlotte is a group of tracks that are great pieces to hear.  The OP gives off a very whimsical feel and tie into the series' more serious tones in the latter half of the series while also creating a bit of a pleasant tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED in Charlotte plays off as a very hopeful and calming song that ties into the character ties that the series has.  With this, the show brings a wonderfully whimsical group of songs that add to the aesthetics of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good soundtrack\\n\r\n+ Decently memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Out of the entire summer season, Charlotte was one of the few shows that I was really looking forward to.  As it was a Key work with P.A. helping out with its production, one could only hope to see what could come out from that combo, and in the end, I was pleased.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes, in fact, I did; far too much, in fact.  Its character development for Yuu is one of the best parts of this series and seeing him change was a nice storyline to follow.  Plus, Nao-chan is an amazing character; she really brings quite an interesting thing to this series.  (Also Ayumi's nano-desu.  Nano-desu!)\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint with Charlotte is how it didn't completely explain itself.  The last few episodes focused on a plotline that had an outside group going against our characters in the series.  They didn't explain this all too much so that left a bad taste in my mouth.  They also didn't really make use of a lot of the cast members since only Yuu and Tomori took the brunt of the screentime and the story, making those two the only true characters in the story, and as a result, made everyone else a bit lackluster in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, it's mixed.  On one hand, we have great aesthetics with its soundtrack and artstyle, as well as refreshing main characters, but at the same time, we have a spindly story with a resolution for the last episode plotline that seemed completely out of the ballpark, as well as an entire cast that doesn't really show themselves to be anything more than plot progression.  So really, it's your choice.  If you want a great looking show without caring about specifics in the plot, then you might like this.  However, if you plan on watching for a good story, then, you might be out of luck.",

            "content": "Spoiler warning.\r\nThe premise: What if you, as a young man, find out that you have a special power? What will you do with it?\r\nThis is, chronologically, the second anime since Angel Beats to be produced by Key creators of Kanon and Clannad fame, and the second original anime for that matter. Key is (in)famous for creating melodramatic stories that induce crying in the audience, and also for creating computer games called \"visual novels\", a sort of a predecessor to the \"gal game\". Often times such games (Clannad for one) have multiple \"routes\" or storylines the player could pursue, and if you screw up you couldgo back to a previous save point, and when you complete one story you can go back and pursue other stories. Some gal-ge based shows like Yosuga no Sora make this obvious, Key-based productions less so.\\n\\n\r\nSo perhaps this is why I wasn't really fazed when the time travel trope came up. It felt like a \"bad ending\" came up in a gal game (though this wasn't through any fault of the main character), and we got to go back to a previous save point in the game. In fact, this would be a rather cool way of going about save points in actual games. I can understand if people got confused by the time travel element-- it certainly feels as though there are at least 3 stories in the production (which is true in some way, though most are told via flashback). Admittedly this part of the story is a bit of a sharp turn from the \"mutant du jour\" episodes that preceded it. I think the final arc of the show made up for it, but your mileage may vary. To the suggestion that maybe the final arc should've been its own season, well, that's what happened with Grisaia and Rewrite, and IMHO Charlotte was better written because the production chose to condense the story. Honestly, do you want to watch the hero's mind slowly disintegrate over 1 cour or even 1 movie? I don't.\\n\\n\r\nI like the character designs and the characters themselves. Sure, the main character starts off unlikeable, but going back to the premise of the story, if you found out you could grab control of someone else for a few seconds and you're a young teenager, wouldn't you try to have some fun with it? Wouldn't you be tempted to cheat? I rather like how he turned his life around (more than once) with the help of the heroine.\\n\\n\r\nI also like how the show addressed, \"What would everyone else do, like governments?\" The answer is pessimistic, and yet, if even one country or terrorist group seized a strategic advantage through superpowers, every other country would either do the same or seek to eliminate those with such powers. The way the show addressed that might not be entirely realistic, and yet it's important because it points to how we treat fellow humans. Should we discard civilized treatment of someone just because he's a potential threat? Or only perceived as a threat but is really no threat at all? It's amazingly relevant these days, isn't it? Key productions tend to have strong, deep themes past the slapstick comedy and tear-jerking melodrama, and Charlotte is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is by Lia, who also sang the opener for Clannad: After Story. I wasn't terribly keen on the Clannad theme, but I liked the one for Charlotte a bit more. The ending themes... Can't remember them. Or the soundtrack. I need to rewatch.",

            "content": "A power to possess anyone in your line of sight for at least 5 seconds.\r\nSeems intriguing, right? But before that, I will warn that this review might contain minor spoilers because for some reasons, I think I can't keep myself from sharing what I want to share with the community. Even spoilers are sometimes parts of reviews, isn't it?\r\nThere are many things which you can do when you have powers like this. You can take revenge against bullies, you can see a girl's underwear, and even cheat off your tests and exams by possessing the honor students and looking at their test papers. Such aconvenient power can make you break through life, am I wrong?\\n\\n\r\nAnd that would be the initial setting of the anime series \"Charlotte\".\\n\\n\r\nLike my review for Mirai Nikki, I was disappointed when I watched it. Why? It was recommended to me a year ago. Know what stopped me? Skepticism. I thought that the anime was no good and ignored. But then I got no more anime to watch and remembered Charlotte. I watched it and guess what I found? Another masterpiece, an original salutation for me. So let me say something: If someone said that the anime is worthwhile to watch, it is. Because I have experienced that many times already. Poor me.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my classmates said, \"Alex, have you watched Charlotte yet?\"\\n\\n\r\nWhen I answered negatively, he told me why haven't I watched it even though I am the most avid fan of anime in our class. One of the factors that I came to watch it. Once again, poor me.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was created by the same creator who credited for Angel Beats!, Jun Maeda. Knowing that made me watch it in an instant. Huh? Skepticism? What's that? Screw it and let me watch! And so I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on supernatural powers. The protagonist, Otosaka Yuu, has it. As mentioned above, he has powers to possess anyone for five seconds. He uses it to get good grades, to apply to his dream school, and even save the girl he wants to have (although he nearly failed). However, the course of his life changes when he was called to the student council office for he was alleged of cheating. He disagreed, but was forced to accept. Then he was caught by Hoshi no Umi Gakuen (Ocean of Stars Academy, or in the anime Star Ocean Academy) student council president, Tomori Nao. As a result, he ran away, but to no avail as he was caught by the Nao's partner who is literally as fast as sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in itself was splendid. The material was original, so I also commend the creator for that. Lots of comedic routines dramatic scenes to boot. Those had the ability to make you laugh, as well as to make you cry. That makes the story interesting. There were also battle scenes, which escalated my expectations for this series. As usual, from my other reviews, this anime has all the things I had been, have been and will have been expecting, which also is a contrast in itself. \\n\\n\r\nArtistic implementations.\\n\\n\r\nThose were also truly splendid. I found the artistic qualities utilized in the series to be greatly satisfying, as it met my expectations. I can also stress about those dramatic scenes with art so great. The scenes that shows a power's activation are my favorite, be it telekinesis, breakneck movement, levitation, and some other more. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs that went with was also very satisfying in my terms. One reason is for that I can't draw very well, all the more reason to commend the creations. Regarding on how the characters were drawn to perfection, I would give it outstanding compliments. Especially the main characters. They were irresistible to the point that I screenshot some of them, edited, and made it my background. It was worth my while.\\n\\n\r\nTonal qualities.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, OSTs and the themes were utterly excellent. I will be comparing the OP for Angel Beats! and Charlotte for this one. Why? They have many similarities like the composer. I also found a striking discovery that the styles of the music was breathtakingly VERY SIMILAR with the execution of the piano and others. In other words, one would remind you of the other. One more similarity is the key used, according to my hearing. However, even if that's that, the sounds were still fantastic. Again, from my many reviews, I commend the way Nippon uses to create music. It's fantastic. Nippon, banzai!\\n\\n\r\nCharacterizing characteristics of the characteristical characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters? They were fine...I guess. Various characters with various personalities...nothing too different from the usual anime that I watch. However, that doesn't stop me from praising the characters I've grown to love as well as to remember! They were great as they each functioned their role as intended. Especially when something bad happened to one character, causing one of my classmates to drop watching the series. As for me, though, I had hope that that is something reparable. In anime, nothing is impossible because the writer decides what will happen. That's a nice one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment factors.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a no-brainer. With the genre of comedy, romance, drama, superpowers, sci-fi, and school combined, they can easily make the ultimate anime that I will remember for the rest of my life. This is one of the few anime that I would rate 11/10 from excellency alone. Overall enjoyment is 200%. Sure I must be jesting, but I'm not. This would be easily enjoyed by fans of the same genre. Trust me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that concludes my longest review yet. Do you know why? This anime is so good to the point I wrote this review in one go without any stopping, possibly not even minding the spellings. \\n\\n\r\nReview #12. Anime: Charlotte. Got to keep up, right?\\n\\n\r\nAFTERWORD.\\n\\n\r\nI do not know why I write reviews while suffering from writer's block. Wait. Maybe that's the reason why this review became longer than usual. Or is it something totally different? I wouldn't know.\\n",

            "content": "STORY - 5\r\nART - 9\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nCHARACTER - 6\r\nENJOYMENT - 8\r\nTo be drawn in by an original work from Jun Maeda and P.A. Works, there's bound to be a sizeable anticipation coming from me. Now that I have finished Charlotte, I behold to you the power of conflicting feelings.\r\nWith the concept of supernaturalism overlooking a modern society, a breeding ground for drama and oddness was spawned into the story. Following highschoolers who each shared the similarity of possesing a unique ability, this was a telltale sign for interesting things to come. And that was actually given. An interesting narrative. But meddled to discomfort. Seemingly everynon-audiovisual aspect was interfered to a certain degree by a sole perpetrator, which was the reckless balance of elements. Pacing, along with convenience, became an issue down the road, leaving behind questions and confusion that weakened future emotional scenes to a lesser scope. Character focus for some became unfairness. Again, removing emotions as there were little attachment and questioning whether some existed only for awkward comedic purposes. There's this certain disconnection throughout my time watching that fumbled around with my ability to enjoy the show. But despite criticisms, a force of attraction beckoned me and conflicting feelings emerged. It's mainly because the first half was solid, due to heartfelt interactions between the main characters that gradually changed and influenced a certain narcissist. The family dynamic and subtle romance were the more meaningful contents that added a deeper conflict revolving around preciousness. Although not huge, a couple of moments in the later half were heart-tugging while the last episode, even with deus ex machina, told a moving story of psychological distress. So finding fulfillment in this show was too non-linear. Erraticness is a blade infected with rust. You really can't be comfortable wielding such a weapon in the face of danger.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is still a survivable situation. After all, the visual was yet another great showcase from P.A. Works, coming in with a clean quality to polish off that rusty blade. Their amazing talent in lighting, which can be seen to a full degree in the opening, is one of the reason why they are a favorite studio of mine when it comes to art. Illuminating realism to deliver a modern stellar work, everything looked outstanding and to an extent, felt like an intentional reminiscence of the night sky. The twinkling black canvas was shown multiple times throughout the show, beautifying the nightly moments and raising their significations. Striking eyes drew form to the haziness of an aurora, along with attractive character designs that gave off a cosmic vibe. With supernatural powers, there will be action. Animation at these scenes were fluid with flowing movements, and the comical slow motions were no exception too. Talking about the opening again, the song came with a ghostly sensation, fitting for the mystery side of the show. It's praising too much if I said the background pieces were an unforgettable album but they supported the changing moods well. Out of all the insert songs, Kimi no Moji resonated the most with me. Arguably the most memorable part of the whole show, listening to the beautiful vocal backed by the angelic instruments was just too intense for my own feelings and honestly, having that in the last episode almost teared me up. With all the issues presented or my conflicting feelings, I won't lie when I say that song healed me, ending everything with an emotional satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nIt's obvious that too many elements and ideas brought a one-cour Charlotte down. More length and better planning could have unlocked all these feelings kept away, toppling the industry with a touching masterpiece. Alas, the damage had been done and even though one could only imagine the full potential for enjoyment now, at least enjoyment for me was still graspable in the grand scheme of things.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SOME SPOILERS\r\nCharlotte was one of those anime\u2019s that I can\u2019t help but enjoy, most people criticise it because of its bad pacing and plot holes but they obscure its positives by focusing on its negatives too much. This reviews will mostly consist of the positives of Charlotte.\r\nMany viewers will be turned of by the first few episodes because of the god-awful pacing and the fact that the plot seemed to not be going anywhere at all but the first few episodes majorly impact the ending of Charlotte and it also creates a certain attachment for the viewers to the characters byshowing all the characters in different lights and developing each and every character individually by showing us their backstories to make the viewer feel more sympathetic  with them. But the pacing starts to pick up after the 6th episode when Ayumi dies and Nao helps Yuu to deal with his grief, this episode marks the dramatic change to Yuu\u2019s personality and acts as the catalyst for Yuu\u2019s and Nao\u2019s relationship to develop into something more instead of being like every other generic high school anime, this is a major stage in this anime as this is the part where Yuu starts to develop feelings towards Nao and this is extremely relevant to the ending as again Nao indirectly helps Yuu again through their bond. I also like this anime\u2019s use of foreshadowing by involving the side characters to foreshadow events that will happen to the main cast. Another reason why liked this anime stems from it\u2019s OST, the writers now exactly when to use it and how to use it to make the experience an emotional rollercoaster, even at the end using music to symbolise the bond between Nao and Yuu. To end with this was one of the very few anime that I felt had a quite satisfying ending and this anime was an emotional rollercoaster even if sometimes the comedy was a bit bland, but you can see the writers efforts into making the ending the most emotional ending that it could be.\\n\\n\r\nI would easily recommend this anime to anyone because even if it has a slow start it\u2019s makes up for it in its amazing ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so I apologise if it is sloppy.",

            "content": "\u2026and now ladies and gentlemen, in the glass case to your right we have a fine example of what I like to describe as \u2018single-cour syndrome\u2019. Please gather around while I go into some detail into the hideous but occasionally brilliant mess that is \u2018Charlotte\u2019.\r\nSo I have no problem with single-cour shows in general terms. I think it probably provides an opportunity to have stuff animated that a studio wouldn\u2019t risk the budget of a full 24/25 episodes on, and when you break it down you\u2019re looking at at least two long movies worth of content, which is more than enough time to tell acomplete and structured story (even accounting for each episode having a definite beginning middle and end). What I think of as \u2018single-cour syndrome\u2019 is when the creators clearly had 24-25 episodes of content in mind (and I strongly suspect possibly even written and/or storyboarded) and they just try to cram as much as possible into the limited runtime without appropriately re-writing the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI would bet heavily and confidently on this being exactly what\u2019s wrong with Charlotte. It\u2019s littered with vestigial subplots and abandoned or truncated character arcs, and there are places where you could almost plot out entire missing episodes based on jarring shifts in characterisation and tone throughout. \\n\\n\r\nThis is particularly and immediately apparent between episodes 1 and 2, where the main character Yuu\u2019s personality changes enormously for no apparent reason from a machiavellian antihero to a laid-back passive observer for no readily apparent reason. You could simply explain this as being bad writing, and while that is literally the case, I\u2019m highly suspicious that he did have some character development left on the cutting-room floor that would have connected the dots. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character of Nao has similar problems. Or perhaps I should say \u2018characters\u2019 because I became convinced quite early on in the show that Nao was actually a set of identical triplets with three distinctly different personalities. There was Nao 1, the cold stoic, Nao 2 the aggressive, angry delinquent, and Nao 3 the cheerful and outgoing one. \u2026you know I\u2019m being silly there, but it\u2019s a show with supernatural elements and if someone had told me that she actually did have some kind of deliberate personality relating to her powers I probably would have believed them. Again, I suspect that her weirdly fractured personality is likely a result of important character development being sacrificed to make everything fit. \\n\\n\r\nThe primary supporting cast (who are both very entertaining) get unceremoniously abandoned two thirds of the way through the show and barely appear again until the end. There\u2019s a really odd bullying subplot for Nao that gets kind of set up in an early episode and then is literally never mentioned again. A mysterious character that\u2019s clearly linked into the overall superpower world-building shows up, has half the episode devoted to establishing her backstory and teasing her importance and then? You guessed it! Never comes up again. The subplot relating to Nao\u2019s family? Oh, so we were just done with that?\\n\\n\r\nI could do this for some time, but I think you get the idea. \\n\\n\r\nYou might be wondering at this stage If I would recommend watching this, and you might well be surprised to find that on the whole I\u2019d say \u2018Yes\u2019. I think it\u2019s because I feel that Charlotte was originally a good or quite possibly even great 24 episode show, and there are still places where that shines through. Episode 7 by itself made me feel like the whole show was worth watching - I don\u2019t want to spoil what it\u2019s about in a review, but I\u2019ll say it\u2019s one of the best introspective single character episodes of an anime I\u2019ve seen in quite some time. Episode 13 is also extremely interesting and exciting, although it suffers from feeling a lot like a really good episode from a completely different show.\\n\\n\r\nSo on the whole, I\u2019d say if you\u2019re willing to delve into the horribly mangled structure that is Charlotte, you might end up finding a pearl or two of something worthwhile.",

I'm also writing this review against the surprising amount of negative reviews.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis anime's tone was very strange.\u00a0 I didn't read the description of the anime before going in, and only saw a few pictures.\u00a0 I kind of thought it was going to be a bit of a darker story...whichwasn't exactly wrong, but the first episode completely threw me off.\u00a0 The anime started out seeming like a cringe-worthy slice-of-life comedy anime.\u00a0 And if the anime continued like that, I definitely would've stopped watching.\u00a0 In the next few episodes, the anime got interesting enough that I didn't leave, but they weren't spectacular or anything.\u00a0 It still gave off that slice-of-life feel.\u00a0 However I got really interested when the anime suddenly took a dark turn, turning the anime into a completely different genre...and then it changed back again.\u00a0 And then it got dark again.\u00a0 Basically, the tone of the anime was rather inconsistent, which, in most cases, I dislike.\u00a0 But for some reason this sudden changing of tone didn't affect my opinion of the anime in any way, and I really have no complaints about it.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story.\u00a0 The first half was nice, the second half made me cry (just a little bit at the end!).\u00a0 Being the kind of person I am, I enjoyed the second half better.\u00a0 My only are with the first and last episodes.\u00a0 The first episode, as I mentioned above, made me cringe.\u00a0 As for the last episode, I think it should've been stretched into two episodes.\u00a0 I don't have as much of a problem with the pacing of the final episode as other people do, but I think they should've extended the beginning of the finale and the ending of the finale, putting it into two episodes.\u00a0 However, I've never seen a 14-episode anime, and honestly I'm pretty fine with the last episode being how it is.\\n\r\nYes, this show does have minor plot holes and convenient occurrences.\u00a0 But, seeing as this is mainly a drama/slice of life anime, none of this should affect your experience greatly.\u00a0 The purpose of this show isn't to create the next Steins;Gate.\u00a0 It's to make you laugh, to make you cry.\u00a0 The show wants to use drama to entertain you.  You can't watch a slice-of-life drama and then call it stupid for having bad mystery elements.  You can't watch a shounen action anime and call it boring because it has no romance.\\n\r\nCharlotte is most definitely not a ripoff of Angel Beats!, despite the numerous similarities.  Calling Charlotte a ripoff of Angel Beats! is like calling Log Horizon a ripoff of SAO, or Kabaneri a ripoff of Attack on Titan.  Despite having similar tones and events, Charlotte is most definitely not a ripoff of Angel Beats!.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe main character's personality was a bit strange, as his personality is a bit obscure at times - but, he really does have a personality.\u00a0 He is not some bland, boring male protagonist, and I thoroughly enjoy how he changes throughout the series.\\n\r\nNao, the female lead, has an enjoyable personality as well.\u00a0 The way she reacts to different things helps you understand what kind of person she is.\\n\r\nHowever, the characters in Charlotte are definitely not the best.\u00a0 A lot of them are lacking in character development and are mainly defined by one or two traits.\u00a0 If some of the main characters got more screen time and character development, this anime would've been a lot better.\\n\r\nEven so, the characters were, for the most part, interesting and it's not like I hated the characters or anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nPretty darn good.\u00a0 It's not the best animation I've seen for a show, but it's still really good.\u00a0 Enough for a ten.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nWait, let me go listen to everything again.\u00a0 Brb.\\n\r\nSorry I'm back.\u00a0 For some reason I only tend to enjoy the music after I finish the anime, unless I really really like the music.\u00a0 So the OP was actually quite fitting for the anime, more so for the second half than the first half.\u00a0 The ED for most of the anime, 'Yake Ochinai Tsubasa' also really fits.\u00a0 I'm definitely getting both of these songs on Osu.\u00a0 The rest of the music was nice as well.\u00a0 The second ED, used for episodes 3-4, fits those specific episodes quite well.\u00a0 The third ED, episode 6 (geez this episode...) was just beautiful instrumental music.\u00a0 The fourth ED, for the finale, was a nice, mellow ending for the series.\u00a0 No complaints, really.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nFinal Notes:\\n\r\nMy rating for this is actually lower than how I would rate it if I just based my review on purely how much I enjoyed it.\u00a0 It's a really nice anime.",

If you don't want to go through the trouble of reading each part skip to my overall for a summary. Arrigatou Gozaimasutell you, there was nothing amazing about the plot, probably the music, the ZHEIND \"arc\" if you would call it was very touching and touched me but overall it  wasn't horrible.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT:\\n\\n\r\nUntil Yuu's younger sister Ayumi died. Now from this point in time the anime began to deplete...ARGHH It just angers me because there was so much potential, and once Ayumi dies Yuu goes on a tantrum and starts becoming some villain that the audience knows he isn't. It was just a stupid plot twist. Many people would say \"how would you feel if your sister died\". Well, I dunno, but it was just ridiculous and cheesy. The NEXT PROBLEM THAT REALLY GRINDED MY GEARS was the creation on an older brother. Yuu has an older brother. This was so stupid...Why introduce a brother a few episodes before the end?? Ontop of this trying to take all the powers of everyone in the world, all done in the final episode. Talk about a rushed plot!! It would be impossible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:6/10\\n\r\nThe art was clean and crisp I cannot really complain, there was nothing wrong with the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6/10\\n\r\nI won't write about this because I feel it isn't necessary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was poor. Almost zero backstory or depth to the characters, I struggled to sympathise with any characters, mainly because I didn't know them, I couldn't grown with them. Bare in mind its a 13 episode anime, which I hate because I feel anime's with only one season are often rushed and poorly executed due to not enough time or planning. There was no substance or bond in the friendships, the only connection I felt was Yuu and his sister Ayumi, but even that...\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nGuys just don't watch this anime, it is a waste of time, you all deserve better...Many believe MAL ratings are wrong or exaggerated, and animes that are good these days are only rated 6/7, which although is rated good people will really only watch an anime if its rated 8+ . But I'm not exaggerating, I'm the type of Otaku that doesn't mind if the plot has been rinsed, or the sound isn't the best, as long as its blooming enjoyable and has me hooked Im satisfied. But this anime had major flaws. And Since I've seen soo much anime, (trust me not as much as some people) it got really annoying.",

But that still saved me.\"\r\n--------------------------------\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story was good, the story revolves around a boy named Y\u016b Otosaka a boy that has super powers. He thought he was the only 'special' person in the world and used his powers to cheat and do things for self benefit.\r\nHe then ran into a bunch of students from another school that forced him to go to their school full of people with powers.\r\nCharlotte had a not-so-generic plotin my opinion. The main characters were pretty well-developed. I stress on \"main characters\". \\n\\n\r\nEach character had pretty generic superpowers but some with pretty cool powers that have weak points to make them seem less powerful and at the same time less generic.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is also another case of the main character showing his true powers at the later part and being an overpowered indestructible force of nature but somehow still sane.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime provided a comedic slice of life that made me grow along with the characters not to mention make the anime funny and make me 'feel' them more, kudos for that!\\n\\n\r\nHowever... When it came to around half of the anime, everything just became extremely rushed, many new characters were introduced at one go and I was literally pondering (who is that... wait.. who is that... wait... what kind of power is that!!! wait...) I think  you get the gist.\\n\\n\r\nNearing the end of the anime, the characters are faced with a huge dilemma and the death of close friends which was honestly extremely heartbreaking for me but... The sadness in the anime is honestly trash.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad parts are very unmatured (not fully developed) and I feel could have been done much better and give everyone the same feeling I got.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is also absolute trash... What kind of person tells a girl to wait for him to come back but eventually forgets who she is... The best part is she's not even a tad worried or sad and just tells him \"I am your lover\" bitch pls...\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic, the design of certain physical prowess and facial expressions are simply fascinating.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLove the OP and the music in the anime is well chosen, it builds up the feelings for the audience and we sort of \"better understand\" the character's feelings because of the music.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has been one hell of a ride and I love it despite the back being rushed. I highly recommend it. I won't mind using Time Leap to leap back in time and watch it again",

            "content": "I'm reading some of the other reviews, and it seems that Charlotte receives some mild hate. Why? Because they compare it to the other works of the producer - Clannad and Angel Beats. This isn't wrong, per se, but I feel to do this show justice you need to look at it solely from the watcher perspective. Though I have to say some of their points were pretty damn true...\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThroughout the first half of Charlotte I was wondering if this was going to be some typical slice of life school anime with no substance. It really was going nowhere. But then the hugereveal happened. Honestly, I felt that they rushed through it so much it's insane. There's no build up, just a big crushing reveal that left me stunned - 1) for doing that to that specific character, and 2) how poorly the studio made that scene. I have to say, I did enjoy the following episode with the lead vocalist of ZHIEND, she was probably the most interesting character out of the whole cast, in my opinion. Oh, and Yusarin's sister as well. The rest of Charlotte after that was weird, only because they introduced a handful of tropes and recurring themes in supernatural anime. The show at that point was giving off this vibe of the producers desperately trying to fill in episodes to finish the show, which is probably why they brought in so many common themes. TIME TRAVEL. Come on, be different, is there any supernatural anime that doesn't have aspects of time travel?\\n\r\nAside from that, though, I feel that the show itself had a solid premise and executed fairly well. I liked the pacing of the descent episode. Also, I found that the comedy wasn't as obtrusive as it could have been, which was nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nEverything was beautiful in Charlotte, from city landscape to mountainside to stars to character design. And animation too. The colours were bright and vivid, but at some times, were gloomy and dull. The colour use matched the mood of each scene, which not a lot of anime can pull off well. High quality characters kept me engaged and their movements were well animated. Basically all the art was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nI don't get why everyone is saying that the OP is great...I don't see it that way at all. By itself, the best I can give it on a scale of \"crap to amazing af\" is an ok. The problem is, during those middle episodes when it got dark, they would introduce the scene, paint it black and gloomy, then you get this happy guitar + piano line which contrasted completely with the mood of the introduction. It was really offsetting and I found it hard to really get invested in the atmosphere because of the juxtaposition of sad intro and uplifting OP.\\n\r\nAside from that, the rest of the sounds - idol music, sound effects, ED - were all great. They set the stage well and didn't detract from what was happening on screen; alternatively, they enhanced the scene as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Yuu Otosaka, is kind of dull and stupid. Let's be honest, he's not much of a main character, preferring to sit in the background and let things play out. He's a jerk in the beginning but he grows to be kinder and I think that was one of the upsides to this anime, watching Yuu's character develop. Nao Tomori, the main heroine, is a slightly unorthodox tsundere, in that she will hurt Yuu, but not to the extent of a regular tsundere, only if the scenario calls for it. She's impulsive and funny, and can really brighten up the scene. It's evident that she cares for everyone close to her, and even sacrifices herself (no, she doesn't die) if she knows that it will help others. Truly a pitiful character and I love her so much LMAO. The other characters are supporting, I guess. Takajou is decent, being the comedy relief often, but he gets dismissed a lot by Nao. Yusarin is boring, but her sister was a great character, and enjoyable. I even felt myself tearing up when she ate soba... I guess the only other character worth writing about is Sara Shane, the lead vocalist of ZHIEND. If you split the story into arcs, I really liked the arc about Nao's brother, and how Sara is involved. She's a touching character, empathetic and understanding. I wasn't really too interested in the singing, but I was sad when we didn't see any more of her later on...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI think the fact that I binge watched all 13 episodes in one night says something. I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers* \r\nYuu Otosaka is a high school student with a strange supernatural power. He thinks he's the only one with this power, but he discovers many more teenagers with powers at Hoshinoumi Academy, which is led by the student council president Nao Tomori. He discovers that these powers were awakened by a comet called Charlotte, which exposed some children years ago to a mysterious material that activated a normally dormant section of the brain. He and Nao, along with the rest of the student council, uncover a huge plot to apprehend all people with powers, and they team up with other teenagerslike themselves to stop it. \\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is created by Key and Jun Maeda, who is famously known for his tragic anime like Angel Beats! and Clannad. However, he is less famously known for his shoddy pacing and filler placement. Those flaws are prevalent in Angel Beats!, and they return to haunt Charlotte. Maeda pull a risky maneuver, just like in Angel Beats!, by wasting the first half of the 1-cour series with filler episodes. Suddenly, the end of episode 6 changes everything. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot twists in Charlotte are intriguing; there is no doubt about that. What seemed like a light-hearted, occasionally dramatic school life story turned into an adventure story with time travel and tragedy. However, the tiny plot that episodes 1-6 focused on expanded into a VERY large plot that simply could not be done justice in the remaining 7 episodes. I'm not sure it could have been done properly in 2 cours either; the plot was just too shaky. Even at its modified breakneck speed, Charlotte left far too much to the very last episode, leaving viewers exhausted, skeptical and unfulfilled. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated above, Charlotte's largest plot twist (in my opinion) dealt with time travel, a very engaging topic that is one of my favorites to watch/read. However, time travel is tricky. It's very easy to mess up. And it's clear that Charlotte's creators did not think the time travel aspect through, as the plot has quite a few holes. Charlotte's plot holes aren't limited to time travel though; the last episode alone had many inconsistencies. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Charlotte's issues did not stop at its pacing problems. Charlotte also suffered from a lack of proper character development. This show had the potential to show a lot of development, if only for Yuu, but it failed to do so because it tripped over itself. And while it is evident that Yuu has changed since episode 1, none of the other characters have changed. None. Nao has not indicated any change in her philosophies or feelings toward Yuu. Ayumi is just a means to Yuu's development; she herself is a shallow character. Yusa and Takajou exist simply for comedic relief, and while they functioned well in that sense, they had no depth. Yusa's only show of non-bubbly emotion occurs in episode 11, and it feels extremely rushed and fake. Konishi shows up out of nowhere as a violent yandere middle schooler, which is just ridiculous. And Sara Shane appears for one episode, only to push along Yuu and Nao's relationship, since it couldn't seem to gather any traction on its own. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Charlotte is even more disappointing than the rest of the show. In just 24 minutes, including 90 seconds for the opening theme, Yuu travels around the entire world, steals thousands of abilities, goes crazy, massacres people around the globe, nearly goes insane, gets rescued by his brother who somehow knew exactly where to find him, is vaccinated and loses his powers, DOESN'T DIE, and lives happily ever after (but not before the most uncomfortable romantic confession scene I have ever witnessed). And in just 24 minutes, Charlotte wins the award for \"Biggest Asspull Ending in the History of Anime.\" \\n\\n\r\nI would, however, like to point out the [few] things Charlotte did right. First and foremost, as expected of PA Works, the art is beautiful. The character designs are detailed and pretty. And as expected of Jun Maeda, of the feels scenes, especially through episode 7, are quite poignant. The voice acting is decent; while Uchiyama Kouki complemented Yuu's voice at first, I don't think he fit Crazy Yuu well. I also don't think Ono Daisuke fit Shunsuke well, but that may be because I prefer his derpy roles (Handa Seishuu, Kokkuri-san, etc). Aside from those two, I have no complaints with the voice acting. The soundtrack is great, just like that of Angel Beats!, and I really enjoy listening to the OP and ED. Even if the anime they accompany is no good, I will definitely be downloading them in the near future. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Charlotte is very interesting. But instead of using that potential properly and focusing more on characters, it bit off far more than it could chew with a ridiculous plot that, in my opinion, probably would not have been successful even with twice or thrice the number of episodes. Had the series been better paced or better planned, it would have been much more successful, even bereft of character development. Pacing was the biggest issue in this series, and it disappoints me that Jun Maeda didn't learn his lesson after Angel Beats!. This series had a lot of potential, but as I feared, it didn't live up to that potential. \\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 5/10 \\n\r\nDo I recommend it? NO. Just watch Steins;Gate, or read Reimei no Arcana or Shinobi Life if you want some GOOD time travel content.",

            "content": "Charlotte is an anime that I was relatively excited for going in. I had heard some good things from people whose opinions I respect. Unfortunately, I walked away regretting the fact that I sat through the entire 13 episodes.\r\nMost of the show's first half is not even dedicated to anything resembling a story that knows where it wants to go. Instead, we spend the majority of our time accompanying our characters on side quests that mean basically nothing and accomplish little in terms of bringing depth to our cast of characters. Unfortunately, this simply leaves the viewer wondering what the point of it all is.Most conflicts are resolved in the space of a single episode. Even a major conflict that our MC struggles with that could easily be explored for a few episodes is somehow resolved in a few minutes. The final episode was exceedingly tragic. A conflict that could have comprised the premise of an entire show condensed into 20 bumbling minutes.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as our characters, there is not much to like. For an anime in which the plot is an utter disaster, the characters must pick up the slack in order to retain some level of an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, Charlotte didn't get the memo, or just threw it in the trash. Bland, flat, uninteresting, indistinguishable, archetype, these are just some words that can sum up practically everyone in Charlotte. Each character fits squarely into one of the many abhorrent, overused tropes used in anime today. There is also a major problem when our two leads (in this case Yuu and Nao) are practically as one-dimensional as our list of supporting characters. It's quite a feat too, considering Yuu actually started out as a pretty interesting character, yet somehow managed to completely lose all of those qualities by the end of the first episode and never recovered.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is, as mentioned, a mess. Not only does it fumble over itslf for about 7 episodes, when it finally gets going the result is nothing to write home about. If you've read other reviews, you'll probably already know that Charlotte is filled to the brim with plotholes and deus ex machinas, well most of these come in the second half so if you somehow make it that far, be prepared to get even more frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the worst part is that Charlotte never succeeded in making me care at all, and when you fail to make the viewer care, you've essentially failed. The show makes several attempts to deliver emotional moments, for example, but they fall short of eliciting any of the emotional response they were aiming for. Not only were there clear problems with how the scenes themselves were delivered (e.g. emotional build up is nonexistent) the show utterly failed at developing any of the characters; a necessary component to successful storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, Charlotte is interesting. The actual result though is an underwhelming, uninspiring, mess of a story with even worse characters.",

The animation was stunning too; vibrant characters and scenery. However, the execution of the show was one of the largest problems of it. \r\nThe plot progression was atrocious, 90% of the entire story happened in the last 4 episodes; it felt like everything before hand was almost like a filler. Almost as if nothing happens in the first 5 episodes, a little bit of plot occurs in the next 4, and EVERYTHING happens in the last 4 episodes. Honestly, the final episode couldhave been it's own episode; it contained literally a journey across the entire world, and a reunion with a lover condensed into 20 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte introduces several characters, far too many for it's length. Many of the characters are quickly forgotten or thrown aside. Along with it, Charlotte tries to give tragic moments to characters who the viewer doesn't even have a chance to connect with. It's hard to feel bad about the death of a character when you hardly know anything about them. \\n\\n\r\nCharlotte tried too hard to be many things: action, romance, comedy, sports, school, slice of life... it just didn't work out too well in the end. The last episode could have been its own season really. It lacked proper direction and a clear goal in mind; as stated before it muddled around for what felt like half of the series and didn't begin to let the viewer what was the aim or objective of the characters until the late second half. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Charlotte was a nice idea that could have been better had it had more direction, and better writing. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Interesting premise\\n\r\n- Nice animation quality\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Plot progression is horrible\\n\r\n- Many characters are 1 dimensional and quickly forgotten\\n\r\n- The show lacked progression\\n\r\n- Wonky conclusion\\n",

I wish they could've decided for a season 2, at least they can make that anime into an action anime.\r\n+ I wish they had made more scenes of Yu and Nao after his return. \r\nand also the episode 6 was kinda useless after Yu went back in time to save her sister, that part right there was actually the best scene but I felt really, disturb because of that. I wish they could've stick to the story that her sister is dead.\r\nBut overall the anime is superb, Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment 10/10. Butoverall is 9 for rushing the ending.",

            "content": "When I first read the synopsis for this show, it instantly piqued my interest.  It reminded me of another series by Key and PA Works, Angel Beats.  While I didn't necessarily like Angel Beats because of reasons that you can probably find in a different review of mine, I was sure that PA Works would learn their lesson and fix the problems that Angel Beats had.  The result.....was something even worse.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nWhere to begin.  I will try to spoil as little as possible so bare with me.  So the best way to describe the \"Story\" is to split it into3 parts.  The first 6 episodes, and the last 6 episodes.  Episode 7 will get its own section.  We start off with our MC, Yuu, who is surprisingly, not a cliche goody too shoes, but an asshole.  He has the power to take over somebodies body for about 5 second intervals, which he uses to abuse his way to popularity, high grades and even attempting to win over a girl.  You know he is a dick when his plan calls for him putting his crush in a life or death situation just to get her attention.  So after this all occurs, he is suddenly confronted by a strange girl from a different school, Nao.  She tells him that she knows what he is up to and blackmails him into transferring schools.  This new school is for kids like him, with powers.  Nao recruits him to the Student Council where he and the other members, have the job of finding other people with powers, and persuading them to never use said power again.  This is basically the first 6 episodes.  Their quality ranges from enjoyable, to down right boring.  They all seem standalone and there is even a Baseball episode, cause you know, anything written by Jun Maeda has to have some evidence of his probably unhealthy Baseball fetish.  Then, we hit a big high point in the story.  Episode 7, which follows Yuu as he runs around on his own, being as Emo as possible due to the events in the previous episode.  An event so bizarre that it had me laughing when it was trying to be sad.  You know that isn't a good sign.  This is by far the best episode of Charlotte, because it shows a return to Yuu being a dark character, instead of just becoming generic as soon as he joins the student council.  It even leads to some great character interaction between both Yuu and Nao.  Too bad that is short lived, because the 2nd half of the show just goes downhill.  The story tried its hardest to have a Steins;Gate time travel plot, introducing a bunch of new characters that never get a enough screen time for you to care about them.  They even go so far as introducing a no name terrorist organization as the villains, then get rid of them the very same episode.  But the final nail in the coffin, is the finale episode.  What a giant cluster fuck of an ending.  Basically what happens is Yuu has obtained the power to steal other powers from people.  He is then sent on a mission to steal every power in the world.  Note, this is all done in ONE EPISODE.  Like what the fuck?  The final episode had so much going on, that it could have been its own 12 episode series.  Well the ending is what you would expect.  Yuu is successful and rescued at the exact moment he gets the last power, he gets amnesia which ruins a relationship in the making.  THE END.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf Charlotte has anything going for it, its in the Art and Animation department.  This show is what you would expect from a PA Works show.  Its gorgeous, from the character designs, to the background visuals, to the powers.  A higher ranked team from PA Works were chosen for this series for sure.  If only the Art could save the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only other good this this show has is the music.  While there weren't that many stand out pieces, some of the background music went well with the scenes and portrayed the emotion that they wanted the audience to feel.  The opening was enjoyable to listen to as well.  As for the ending songs, they were pretty forgettable.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile having a good story is always important, do you know what is more important?  Having good characters.  At least if the characters are well written and enjoyable, you can still keep interest.  Charlotte unfortunately failed hard at this aspect.  Lets go through the list.\\n\\n\r\nYuu at first comes off as a unique MC, for his evil and dark personality.  It was an instant turn of in the first episode.  Too bad he throws that all away to become just another generic MC who does whatever he is told, despite not being that interested.  The one thing I commend him for, is that he did feel real and believable after the events in Episode 6.  The way he went into a deep dark depressions and started acting up felt like something that somebody would really do.  He actually started to become enjoyable again.  Too bad he goes back to being generic soon after that.\\n\\n\r\nNao is probably the only saving grace in the show.  She is enjoyable to watch and has a personality not used much in Key's other works.  She can come off as interested in something for one second, and then not care by the next.  If there is one criticism I have, its that her backstory with her brother seems not that fleshed out.  I actually forgot about her brother for a majority of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nNext we have the other Student Council Members.  First is Takajou.  He is the typical glasses wearing comedic relief character.  Only problem is that his comedy is the same unfunny gag on repeat.  He can run at super sonic speed but hasn't controlled stopping very well.  So he crashes into things and gets hurt.  Isn't that so funny?  it isn't?  I didn't think so.  Next we have Yusa.  She is the cliche moe idol who every male character wants to worship.  She has the same repeated gag of chanting moe spells that make the guys go weak in the knees.  Once again, it gets old really fast.  She has a condition where she swaps personalities with her twin sister, the way better Misa.  Misa can create fire out of thin air.  She has pretty much the exact opposite personality as Yusa.  She is a foulmouthed tomboy.  Seeing as how I hate moe blob characters, she was easily the better half of the two.  \\n\\n\r\nFinally we have the last important character.  Yuu's sister Ayumi.  Actually calling her a character is way too generous because she is basically a plot device.  She is the cliche moe imouto who has the same comedic gag of always adding \"pizza sauce\" to her meals, making the food taste terrible, which she makes Yuu eat.  She is the most overacted character in this entire cast.  Sometimes she would sound so cute that I feel like I was about to cringe.  So why is she a plot device?  Because she is the cause of Yuu's depression in Episode 7.  Without spoiling anything, something involving Ayumi happens in Episode 6 that was so out of nowhere and forced that it became laughable.  Yuu was at the scene and then depression ensues.  If you want a spoiler, type in \"Charlotte Pizza Sauce\" on your browser and you will see what happens in Episode 6.  The picture is literally funnier than the comedy in the actual show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI think the only thing that kept me from dropping this show, was the fact that I wanted to believe it would improve.  Episode 6 was so forced and dumb that I almost did, but Episode 7 saved it.  Unfortunately that didn't last and we instead got an extremely rushed ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend watching this show?  No I don't.  Or maybe only as a way to show you how not to write a story.  Charlotte has so many different plots happening left and right that it just becomes a huge mess.  As far as Characters, only Nao and emo Yuu are done well.  The comedy is extremely repetitive.  The pacing is extremely fluctuated between slow and rushed.  Its just what I would call a bad show.  Whats ironic, is that it had the most BD sales out of every other show in its season.  Talk about quality story telling not being important.",

            "content": "Charlotte is a simple yet enticing anime. This is an anime about super powers, school life and a mix of drama. Now, don't get turned off by the mention of 'drama'. I'm the kind of guy that likes awesome bad-ass scenes, panties, lolis, basically your average guy. To put it simply, I like this show. Maybe, you should too. To get on, Charlotte is about Otosaku Yuu in which whom was bestowed the power to control people for five seconds. Man, the things I could do with that kind of power. Let's just say he uses those powers for 'undecent' kind of reasons. No, notlike controlling an entire terrorist organization called 'The Black Knights' and pretty much ruling the entire world kind of undecent. Unlike some protagonist of another show we know. No, he does not use his gifted powers like that. He uses it like any teenage guy would. Yuu had used his power, at one point to look into a bra and at a girl's panties. This show's pretty damn interesting.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nPretty good anime so far. This anime is like another diamond in the rough. Just waiting to outshine its predecessors. To sum this show up in as little detail as possible and as little spoiler content as possible, Yuu Otosaka, our beloved and unhated protagonist is inducted into the student council to hunt other super power wielders! Why, you ask? I can't go further into details until you watch it yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nPretty outstanding and amazing art. I really liked the way they drew everyone. Personally, my favourite female character in the series is Ayumi, Yuu's little sister. She simply looks adorable. Oh and the other characters are drawn pretty well. Their eyes are pretty shiny as well. The art really is something else. It feels like without the art of this magnitude, any other kind would just not make Charlotte seem 'alive'.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nAll voice actors are pretty good and the character voices are well suited to their counterparts. Well done. I also liked the opening. The ending song sometimes switches from time to time. Although, I don't mind but I would have liked one ending song for the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nYuu Otosaka really had some good ideas at the start. And I mean, some really good ideas ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). Our protagonist is not naive, nor is he incompetent. He is one of those lovable protagonists that I can most definitely relate to. He is a rather good guy ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). I like all of the characters. Especially Ayumi. Ayumi, in Charlotte is like your moe relief. She's adorable. Tomori Nao, the student council president is like the realist in this anime. Joujirou Takajou is the comic relief, pretty interesting guy. Yusa-chan is our idol relief ( \u0361o \u035c\u0296 \u0361o). There are some characters you may dislike in this series however. I won't name them as it would be giving the story away.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI loved this anime. A little advice from me however, you might want to brace yourself in this anime. It is a most definite roller coaster of emotions. Happiness, laughter, hatred, anger and most definitely sadness.\\n\r\ni cri erry tiem\\n\r\n1 like 1 prayer for a certain moetagonist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nPerhaps one of my favourite anime this season.\\n\\n\r\n-REVIEW TO BE UPDATED AT THE END OF EPISODE 8-",

            "content": "Everyone is so hype for this show. One, it's by Jun Maeda - the creator who gave us shows that hits us right in the feels like Clannad and Angel Beats. Now, he presents a new show and does it live up to the hype?\r\nWell, Charlotte starts of mysteriously. Some humans of this world have superpowers but it isn't perfect. For example, Yuu Otosaka can take over humans but he can only use it in 5 seconds. Then, there is this group of friends who stopped Yuu from abusing his powers as scientists can capture him and tells him that this superpower cannot be usedwhen you're at your adolescent stage.\\n\\n\r\nPretty engaging? Sounds like it but from the second to it's fifth episode is really pure character development between Yuu, Nao, Yusarin, Joujirou and of course, Yuu's little sister, Ayumi. If you're not a big fan of slice of life then, there are higher chances that you might drop the show around there but, I would advice not to. Episode 6 is really where it starts to engage and the current episode (7) is hitting us right in the feels.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I don't like from most people is that when they cry buckets, it's a great show. Well, to me, we should keep in mind on how well executed was that dramatic scene. Clannad was executed very well however, Angel Beats wasn't. Did Charlotte did it well?  You see, here's the thing. There are some executions of this show that throws in a plot device in order for the plot to progress and the character to develop A LOT. For me, this is kind of forced. For example, throwing in some random Yandere and some random terrorist to progress the plot -  I thought it wasn't executed very well.\\n\\n\r\nOh yes. The ending. Was it good? No. The last episode of this anime was very fast-paced that I began to question on how was he able to do this thing in the first place. Not to mention, the ending is bitter. I felt like it was lacking.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't a 10/10 but, it is still great. P.A. Works did a great job on the animation giving some detail. For the soundtrack, Charlotte's OST isn't the best. It isn't as good as Angel Beats and it isn't as great as Clannad. However, it isn't really that bad. I mean, the OP theme and Yake Ochinai Tsubasa are really good and it fits the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, well, I'll explain the main characters first.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll get a Lelouch-like feeling from Yuu Otosaka at the beginning of the show but that feeling fades away once you get to know him. He acts smart but really, he isn't that smart. He has this sense of pride. Same goes to Nao Tomori but, the difference between the two is that, she is smart. Her ability is invisibility.\\n\\n\r\nJoujirou Takajou has the ability to teleport but can't land where and Yusa Kurobane seems to be your typical kawaii girl but she has a possession of her old sister (Who is dead) and has pyrokinesis.\\n\\n\r\nWho could ever forget the imouto of Yuu - Ayumi. She's a girl who has this cheerful personality. \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that these characters are enjoyable in my opinion but, they are kind of cliche. Not all cliche are bad though. They are on this show because they have a purpose on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, that's for the positives. I liked the characters a lot. However, by around episode 10, they started throwing more characters that I do not even know very well. Sure, there were flashbacks but, I wish a lot of them were properly developed. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, Jun Maeda repeats the same mistake he had from Angel Beats! and that is how fast-paced the show is. Again, 13 episodes isn't really enough and I do not know if this is really his style of writing.\\n\\n\r\nThough, despite these flaws, I enjoyed the show. My enjoyment kind of ignored a bit of it's flaws but sometimes, we have to admit it. These flaws were really big and I cannot just score this show around 9/10. I mean, during the 12th episode, I cried a little because of the characters mainly between Yuu and Nao. So, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the show. Though, what killed my enjoyment factor is the ending. Really, it sucks.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this show to anyone? Well, yeah but, it's best if you lower your expectations.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 6/10",

            "content": "To sum up how I feel about this anime, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHO/WHAT THE FUCK CHARLOTTE IS. Maybe I blinked and missed the part where they gave significant information an insignificant amount of screen time. Okay, I'm being sarcastic, they did mention it but not in a tasteful way. It's like a lot of events felt very sudden and were missing a strong build up.\r\nStory: 3/10, The way this anime's plot played out made me feel as though I was unaware of certain important details that were crucial to the eventual plot development. It wasnt like the potential wasn't there, the idea that childrenare able to break beyond physical limitations so that they have hope to cope with their biggest struggles is a topic I would've enjoyed every bit of. However, the light hearted feel from the first few episodes are later twisted into a melodramatic tragedy. The lack of substance in the effect of the series as a whole might have been caused by the attempt to cover too many topics in a short interval. In the end, I think the plot only succeeded in shocking me as I never would've expected it to go that direction when I started it. Now don't get me wrong I didn't skip any of the episodes especially because everything is drawn so beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 I would rewatch this anime just for the visuals alone. It is one of the most visually appealing pieces I've seen so far. I'm a huge fan of PA Works and their anime usually have excellent art. I especially love the scenes where you can see a view of the city or stars because the detailing is mezmerizing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 I really enjoyed the soundtrack for this. Props to music that is actually soothing to the ears. It really relaxes me every time I hear the theme song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10, I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode as the protagonist had a bit of character but then charactor development is largely lacking. The anime features creative side characters but the main characters lack depth that would give them a memorable persona. Props to Nao and her music tastes though and she did have a background story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 I can't say it was terrible because there were definetely parts that made me feel some type of way, but it all felt like they rushed to wrap up the series, thus events that wouldve been impacting were not displayed in a way that would make the audience feel the most out of what's happening.",

            "content": "POSSIBLE SPOILERS\r\nCh means Charlatanry\r\nThus a new creation of famous authors - Jun Maeda and studio P.A. Works is in front of us. Even before relise fans were rubbing their's hands, cause it's the maestro Maeda himself - author of Angel Beats. This will necessarily be a masterpiece. That's why it is Must Watch. I pecked at the bait, though I'm not a fan of Maeda's creativity, but I thought it would be interesting to look at a good drama, cause AB left the most positive impression.\r\nThe first series left mixed feelings. On the one hand the protagonist, being a Usual Japanese Student, tries to moveaway from the canon. How, you ask? Simply - the invisible hand of the director pushes a button at the right moment and our ward begins to behave like Lelouch British, i.e. pose different faces, devilishly smiling and devilishly laughing in some cases. Though, all of this looks foolishly, but surprisingly quite interesting especially given that the hero also fully uses his power for selfish purposes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat power, you ask? Oh, I forgot to say - a world where the action of the show will take place is not quite common. Some teenagers in the anime, who have not reached 17 years have super powers. But not simple, and with shortcomings. For example, our hero Otosaka Yuu can move in the body of every person at which he looks, but only for 5 seconds. Wherein his body will solidify in various positions.\\n\\n\r\nSo, he could have lived and not grieved -  he entered a prestigious university, went on a date with the beauty of the school. But that was until the blonde Tomori Nao - the head of the student council of another school designed for gifted kids, have noticed him. And with the help of her assistant, a classmate Takajou Joujirou, they forced Yuu to transfer to their school. And at the same time a guy has to leave the beauty of the last school.\\n\\n\r\nAnd why? It turns out that it was a secret haunt on teens Espers. They are caught and put under experiments by evil grown scientists. And a Nao's brother was caught and put under expirements by these guys. As a result, the guy turned into a vegetable which periodically tears the pillow. Actually, this is the essence of the first two series. Where is the catch? Sort of an intriguing outset where the characters are not so simple.\\n\\n\r\nBut the catch follows next. Because after the 3rd episode a completely normal everyday life flows where it seems as our team is looking for other owners of super-powers, but the story does not ABSOLUTLY move. Heroes go fishing, playing baseball - everything is just as usual.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, a fan of Maeda's creativity might say: \"you're wrong, because the author reveals his characters.\" Indeed, there was something like that in the same Angel Beats, but not in Charlotte. A couple of words can be said about the drama, which starts from 6 episode, to describe the heroes - such flat characters thay have.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it was watchable, with a disabled brain, sometimes eyes, but watchable.\\n\\n\r\nBut then a drama began, no, a bacchanalia began. Number of pianos, disguised as \"this is a twist\" stupidity, idiocy began to grow exponentially. Sometimes you think that everything is so bad that it can't be worse, but no, Maeda manages to surprise and to make matters worse and more stupid.\\n\\n\r\nTo somehow stretch the story out of the deep hole in which it was for 5 episodes, the author introduces some syndicates, time travel, obscure characters, about which no one cares. Instead of answers to various questions arised in the course of the 5 episodes, he only responds to a few, but wherein he adds a bunch of new ones.\\n\\n\r\nDo you think that someone will respond to them in the end? It's a spit from a high tower for the entire studio. And why? Because the viewer guesses everything himself, and then writes that is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAlso pay attention to the development of the character of the protagonist, because it simply does not exist. There is only toggle \"Lelouch mod\" with two states. There is only toggle \"Lelouch mod\" two-state \"on\" and \"off\" and the director takes his turn between these states when he pleases.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance also takes place in the end. Just to be there, nothing more. At the same time I would like to talk about the local humor. Hmm, humor ... So the humor consists of two things. \\n\\n\r\nThe first - to repeat the trick as many times as possible. Probably, so it becomes funnier according to the director. Or not? But these are the flowers in comparison to the second point... \\n\\n\r\nThe second - a stupid joke, which has even been repeated more than once, ATTENTION, during a serious dramatic moment. Frankly, I was specifically surprised here by Maeda. I have never ever seen such a disregard for the audience. As the analogy, let's take the same Code Geass - the last series of the last season, the viewer is close to tears (or not close), Lelouch, dying, closes his eyes and then... runs a cat wearing a helmet of Zero and everybody rushs to catch him. Can you imagine that?  Here we can see a degree of interest of the author that the audience were imbued with drama.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do we have in the end: the series with a hideous scenario, zany humor, cardboard characters and the only one disclosed more or less, phony drama because of the cardboard characters and happy ending, which crosses all the possible development of the heads of the hero on the vine. And a beautiful opening, which is the more interesting than the series. The title of \"grand piano in the bushes\" deservedly goes to the previous owner of the Code \"yet not grand piano\" Geass.\\n",

It was good anime, i was really moved by the end, even if it is nothing new to me, after watching few other similiar animes.\\n\r\nStill, i really recommend you to see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOP - It was sung by the same author as Angel Beats, which gave me again\\n\r\nanother look at this, but it is really nice to listen to, also Lia's voice is really nice, so you might like it.\\n\\n\r\nED- Animation for it wasnt anything special, but voice was not bad, and i listened to it once or twice, i recommend doing the same\\n\\n\r\nArt - It was good, and i dont have anything to say here\\n\\n\r\nSound - It was as good as Art\\n\\n\r\nStory - Few twists, and a lot of drama, but im ok with this\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - I think that all of them were well made, with good backstory behind them.

            "content": "Oh, P.A., you have suprised me once more. \r\nP.A. are known for its slice-of-life drama animes so when it came to Charlotte, a show that is specialised in the mystery genre, I was concern of whether P.A. would suceed or not. Luckily, in my opinion, P.A. did suceed and brought us another great piece of work.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is simple, a group of high-schoolers with special powers grouped up and was finding other teenagers with special powers. The plot was so boring that for the first half of the season it is literally the same thing repeated over and over again. And this is thepoint where I was worrying that P.A. might not have pulled this off. UNTILL the second half of the season came along. Where things decides to take a sharp turn to what P.A. is most comfortable with : Drama. The second half of the season was so dramatic that within a few episodes, the anime has already taken my breath away, and even though I was watching the anime while it was airing, each episode still felt intact with the previous ones and I was blown away. The sudden switch between the slice-of-life and the mystery drama served the anime very well, as I was not expecting a giant mood swing to hit me in the face.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUnless you haven't noticed yet, I am a big sucker of P.A., I loved all of their work, let it be Hanasaku Iroha, Tari Tari or Nagi no Asukara. P.A. have the art style that this anime needed, a  giant contrast between the warm colors and the cold colors. We already know that P.A. can do such things with the previously said three animes and the Charlotte was no exception. The art style is a typical P.A. art style but with a clear theme between 'light' and 'dark'. With 'light' consisting of warm colors and 'dark' containing cold colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track was well made. And Charlotte's op is amazing, not due to it being a catchy song or any famous singer who sang it. It was because the op fitted the anime so well. Started plain and progressive into the bridge where it showed the flashbacks and the memories of the main character, Yu,until the strong chorus hit and we were greeted with the main characters and the drama hits the scene. Oh, did I mention that P.A. was showing off its skill during the OP? So not only does it sound amazing, it looked amazing as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of supernatural powers are not one that has not been exploited before, in fact, it is probably on of the most used features in anime because it gives each character a reason to be 'original'. So what's different from Charlotte's character and other anime's character? It is what the characters decides to do with their superpowers. For example, Yu, who has the power to take control of anybody for 5 seconds. So he uses to cheat tests, or make a girl fall in love with him. It is what a person WOULD do if they had the power. But in most other supernatural animes, the MC decides to 'conceal' the superpower because it is too dangerous or it is not fair. And that is what differs between Charlotte and other anime's characters: in Charlotte, you are not interested about the superpowers but how will the characters grow with their superpowers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyments: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, I really am glad that I watched Charlotte untill the end. I knew that I can believe in P.A. and their art style. If anyone asks me what I would recommend for summer 2015, one of them would definitely be Charlotte.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a P.A. work's work. I would whole-heartedly recommend you to watch this anime, along with any other P.A. work's work that you've not watched yet. But you can only fully enjoy this anime if you manage to convince yourself to watch the first half of the season without dropping it. Trust me, the suffering is worth it.\\n\\n\\n",

Perhaps a bit? ****** \r\n-I think this anime is astonishing! \r\n-I'll keep things short\r\n-WATCH IT , its quite interesting\r\nStory (7)\r\nWell this anime is just like what others had stated. About group of high-schoolers or rather people in their teens with super power. However, it's not a good thing as there are bad guys known as \"scientist\" who wanna capture them and further study them. Then there's a specially built school and dorm to prevent the people who have the power from being captured by the scientist.  As days goes by, something incredible happened . Then therest is what we have know. Go watch it if you've not done so.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\r\nWell the art is not bad but not really outstanding as well. It's just typical 2015 anime art style. Hence , FINE , therefore (7) . \\n\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\r\nWell i skipped the OP and ED so i don't really care. But well, just as we know Maeda, Jun  have created lots of \"tear-jerking\" anime and games. Which means Lia being the singer of most of his works is nothing to be surprised. \\n\\n\r\nHowever , putting aside the OP and ED the bmg is rather good. When there's sad moments there's sad music , which is totally normal . BUT the music he created for that part is rather good and sad. What im trying to say is that the bmg fits the anime . \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7)\\n\r\nWe have our main character called YU ! He has a VERY surprising power which i won't reveal. Then we have his friends who are in the same school as him (of course they have super power as well). Then they gather together and are in \"school council\" which they skip class and go outside and prevent other super power user to use their super power to prevent from being captured by the scientist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (7)\\n\r\nI find this anime rather funny and cliche. I did not shed a single tears at all. I wanted to give this anime a (8) considering this plot is not bad. However, there's a character who \"died\" so suddenly and makes me laugh. WHY? It happened in the middle of the anime . And there's another half of the anime.Knowing that this is a super power anime i know something for sure that the character which died would some back. If not, WHAT will happen to the second half of the anime. But putting that aside, this anime is quite interesting. I do not want to spoil anymore just watch it. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is REFRESHING! Watch it for fun, i wonder why this anime have such low score despite it being quite a good anime. I know people have different opinions but i just want to support this anime a bit by letting potential viewers to have the feeling of wanting to watch this. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER: this ain't like angel beats AT ALL . But rather steins gate.",

Charlotte. \r\nPrimeiramente, a hist\u00f3ria:\r\nA hist\u00f3ria de Charlotte n\u00e3o \u00e9 o ponto que fez eu me apaixonar pelo anime, \u00e9 uma hist\u00f3ria simples, sem muitos detalhes, ent\u00e3o \u00e9 de longe o menos importante no anime, pra mim o mais importante \u00e9 os personagens, o enredo e o seu desenvolvimento vindo de uma hist\u00f3ria simples, transformando em algo incr\u00edvel, o anime passa por v\u00e1rias situa\u00e7\u00f5es em poucos epis\u00f3dios, consegue aproximar e ter uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o com os personagens e consegue ser perfeito em todos os epis\u00f3dios. \r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nTecnicamente Charlotte \u00e9 lindo, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o feita pela P.A \u00e9 incr\u00edvel, os personagens s\u00e3o vivos e bonitos. A trilha sonora \u00e9 muito boa, em alguns momentos, principalmente o final a trilha sonora \u00e9 perfeita. As m\u00fasicas que tocam no anime realmente s\u00e3o lindas e emocionantes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nTa a\u00ed, o motivo de eu amar tanto Charlotte: Os personagens. \\n\r\nTodos eles s\u00e3o incrivelmente perfeitos e vivos, tanto na quest\u00e3o com\u00e9dia quanto emocional. \\n\r\nOs personagens tem uma balan\u00e7a perfeita pra saber o quanto pode ser engra\u00e7ado ou n\u00e3o naquele momento.\\n\r\nEu amo todos os personagens, muita gente odeia o \"Vil\u00e3o\" de Charlotte. Vou abordar no final do texto sobre o que eu acho sobre eles. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nA sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de assistir \u00e9 muito boa, o autor consegue meio que brincar com as suas emo\u00e7\u00f5es e eu amo isso, de repente acontece coisas que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o esperava e o anime inteiro \u00e9 assim. As pessoas geralmente n\u00e3o gostam do come\u00e7o de Charlotte por ser lento e meio que epis\u00f3dico, mas eu acho muito bom, porque \u00e9 perfeito pra introduzir os personagens e fazer uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre elas, as situa\u00e7\u00f5es que o anime passa \u00e9 perfeito pra voc\u00ea se enturmar com os personagens e ter uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre eles. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\n10, o anime \u00e9 perfeito, o feeling de assistir \u00e9 muito bom, muito emocionante e muito engra\u00e7ado. O autor consegue fazer muitas coisas diferentes e interessantes em 13 epis\u00f3dios.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSobre o \"vil\u00e3o\": Cont\u00e9m SPOILERS\\n\r\n[Spoileeeer]\\n\\n\r\nEu j\u00e1 vi muita gente criticando o anime, falando que n\u00e3o tem vil\u00e3o, que o motivo deles fazerem aquilo \u00e9 extremamente bobos e sem sentidos, e eu discordo muito, porque al\u00e9m de ser um neg\u00f3cio muito forte, por exemplo, o que aconteceu com o irm\u00e3o da Nao, os cientistas realmente queriam fazer experimentos, ai eles falam que n\u00e3o tem sentido. Eu gosto de comparar os cientistas de Charlotte com os Pol\u00edticos, eu sei que n\u00e3o tem nada a ver em quest\u00e3o mas por exemplo, na vida real, no Brasil, no mundo, existe o governo que rouba, faz covardia, e muita coisas que eles fazem que n\u00f3s n\u00e3o fazemos a m\u00ednima ideia e a gente n\u00e3o sabe nem quem \u00e9 os caras, \u00e9 a mesma coisa com Charlotte. Ent\u00e3o o argumento de falar que os cientistas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o bons vil\u00f5es e que n\u00e3o tem argumento para fazer o que eles fizeram, compare com os pol\u00edticos e vejam se eles tem tamb\u00e9m. \u00c9 \u00f3bvio que n\u00e3o da pra comparar totalmente, mas d\u00e1 pra ter uma no\u00e7\u00e3o de que n\u00e3o precisa ser um vil\u00e3o fod\u00e3o com super poder imortal pra ser um bom vil\u00e3o. \\n",

            "content": "Today is a critique of the anime Charlotte, from the studio P.A. Works. Keep in mind that this review is mainly my opinion and in no way am I dismissing other people's view of the anime. Whether you like the anime or not is your own right, just keep that in mind so we have an understanding and respect of each other's opinions.\r\nI'm gonna be breaking my reviews down to 3 main sections, though MAL gives you more options. I'll be talking about the art style, sound, and story.\r\nArt Style: 8/10\r\nThe art style, from a personal perspective, is definitely pleasing. Nothing short from the sameproducers who animated Angel Beats! which is another anime I admire and is something that I will actually mention later on. There are certain scenes where they use 3D backgrounds which I found amusing though a little bit off, but hey, just my personal preference. There's not really much to marvel about the art style. Although I did say it is good, it's nothing I've not seen before. I guess you can call it traditional in this modern era of anime. That's not something to complain about though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow you have to keep in mind that in no way am I a professional when it comes to criticism, especially with music. So I'm basing this off of whether or not I enjoyed it personally. Well, did I like Charlotte's music? To be honest, I'm conflicted about that. It's definitely something that struck my interest. Of course, that's probably that \"new anime\" vibe that it gave when I first started watching the series, but for me, the ED is really the only song I actually enjoyed when it comes to the series. An OST, in my opinion, is supposed to make you feel something special, especially in those intense or dramatic moments. I didn't really feel it with some of the songs in this anime, in fact they didn't have much impact on some scenes and sometimes I never noticed them. Again, this is just personal opinion, some people might be big on music but I only really notice them when they give huge impact on the characters or the story. (As an example, if you've watched Clannad, take a listen to the song \"A Place Where Wishes Come True\". You will feel the emotions right away. That's just the kind of impact it has, which a good song should do.) As for the voice acting, again, nothing special. I think there could've been times where the actors could've put more emotions into scenes, other than that, it's mediocre. I am a big fan of Kouki Uchiyama since he also voiced Raku Ichijou from Nisekoi, another anime I love.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, here we go. Before anything else, let me ask you this; have you heard of Angel Beats? The anime about a group of supposed high school students banded together to solve their conflicts about life and supernatural events where there's this one feisty girl leader that doesn't get along with the protagonist at first? Well I basically described Charlotte AND Angel Beats. That does sound like a bad thing to some but surprisingly enough that actually kept me company. Like I said, Angel Beats is an anime I admire, and to find an anime with a similar story line is a guaranteed bonus. Of course, there are complaints. There are some elements that Angel Beats were able to deliver better than its twin and vice versa, but if an anime even remotely touches that moment where I clench my fist and make me really emotional, I won't judge it poorly. This anime made me feel sad, excited, sad, and excited again in a span of 13 episodes. A lot of plot twists and is sometimes surprisingly dark and brooding. For an anime that presents itself goofy in the beginning, I didn't expect a bunch of plot twists that are emotional. Since it only has 13 episodes however, the story line feels a bit rushed in my opinion. If given enough episodes, I think the story could've been progressed a lot better, especially the romance between the main protagonist and girl protagonist, though if the writers did not have enough material, then I can understand why. I wouldn't want fillers anyway. Still a pretty interesting story though, unless you're not a fan of a repeated story line if you've already watched Angel Beats or something similar.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, what's the verdict? Well, I like it, and I think you will too. I think this is something a casual fan will enjoy, though if you're really heavy on analysis, you might find a lot of flaws, but that's only if you're really nit picky. I think the best way to enjoy an anime is to forget about criticism for the first time and analyze it a second time. This anime is going to take you on a rollercoaster of emotions so if you're gonna watch it, which I recommend you do, well you better be ready for that.",

            "content": "*May have minor spoilers*\r\nI feel that I'm a bit unique when I watch anime. I love pretty much any kinds of it, any genre, but I especially like the genre Drama, and love watching about the Supernatural. I heard Charlotte had a smidge of romance bundled up with it, so I decieded to watch it.\r\nI watched all 13 episodes + OVA in one sitting. I felt that I wanted to keep watching, keep watching it. Even if Charlotte had a crappy storyline stretched over 200+ episodes, I would till waste my time bingewatching this. I rarely write reviews, but this anime, it left a permanentscar across my heart.I'll probably never forget this. I'm a big Charlotte fan, so a LOT of the reviews below may be biased. Also, this might be a late review as this review was completed over 2 years prior to the show's screening on television.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\r\nLooking around in the forums, everyone says that the final episodes are pretty rushed, and Charlotte could have been potentially extended to a 24 episode show. But I believe that although Charlotte's second half had a lot of potential to be extended or possibly a Season 2, the show was already impactful enough. The final 5 minutes of the show just broke me. The waterworks started and no matter how many times I watch the last few episodes, my heart just breaks again and again. The first half was equally enjoyable as it was comedic and funny. Overall, through Charlotte, the show just plays around with your emotions, that's why I loved the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nIt was pretty generic, but I like the generic style. Really loved it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP really did fit along with the theme of the opening video itself. I could go on Loop and watch the Opening forever. It was crafted so well, introducing the four main characters and making me realise who the other people in the opening were.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nMost people have different opinions on this part, but Nao was the spark for me. Her personality just, is amazing. Even though the rest of the characters were pretty generic, I really liked them and they pushed the story and made it better\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nTears and laughter throughout the show. What more can I say? This show strings up all sorts of emotions in you. To me, it's the show that when I think of it, my heart just starts beating. \\n\\n\r\nI would love a sequel, but it doesn't even matter if there is one or not. I'll just re-watch it again.",

            "content": "Alright, so I'm gonna try and make this review pretty quick.  As nearly everyone else has mentioned at this point, this is EXTREMELY similar to Angel Beats!.  That's all that I'm gonna mention about Angel Beats!, by the way.  Now, on to the show that's ACTUALLY in question, Charlotte.  The story starts off pretty uninteresting, in my opinion.  For the first five or six episodes, it was either really cool and intriguing or just plain uninteresting.  Around midseason, the show flips what you previously have come to know as Charlotte on its head and completely changes the show around.I love when shows do this.  Some great examples of shows flipping what they first show to you around would be things like Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, RWBY, and most recently Re: Zero.  Anyways, the plot twist was genuinely interesting and I loved it, but it suffers from being extremely rushed.  This could've been a 25 or so episode series and it would've deeply benefitted from that.  So, despite the cool plot twists and interesting developments toward the latter half of the series, I have to give it a 7 for how uninterested I was for the first few episodes and how rushed the great parts of the story were.  As for the art, PA Works has done a great job with making it look good.  It may not be on the level of Madhouse or ufotable and some of their more recent shows, but it looks great.  I would say it's deserving of a 9.  It's been about 9 or 10 months since the show finished, and I cannot really recall much of the soundtrack.  I know that it did fit the scenes, but that's about all I remember.  For being a bit forgettable, I have to give it a 7.  The characters in this show were well done.  To be honest, I think this is where Charlotte shines and becomes better than that other show Jun Maeda wrote and PA Works animated (so I lied, I mentioned Angel Beats! again, after all).  Yuu was much more interesting than Otonashi, and I personally like Nao more than Yuri.  The rest of the regular characters were either fun, interesting, or both except for Yuu's little sister who was kind of \"eh\" for me.  She definitely added some more energy to some scenes, though, so I'll give her that.  Overall, I'd round the characters out at about an 8.  I personally really enjoyed this show.  Out of the 2015 summer anime season, I watched Gangsta, Monster Musume, Charlotte, and Prison School.  I think that it ranks at number two out of those four.  So yeah, I believe it to be well worth the watch, especially if you are a fan of Angel Beats!, because, in my opinion, it's like the better version of that (although it is 100% just as rushed).  Overall, it receives an official 8 from me.",

It starts out as nothing special, has a short span where the writing, visuals, story, drag you in and make the story as engrossing as almost any other anime I've seen. Then it's all downhill.\r\nlight spoilers ahead:\r\nIt abandons it's typical school comedy romance, which was enjoyable but nothing special, and heads in a dark direction, this being that great two episode span I mentioned above. If this were to end at episode 8 or 9 or so it would likely be one of my favorite anime. But itdoesn't. It slags onto a blown up, weird, over powered MC, drama action thriller that just felt so out of place and ruined the pace and direction of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are likable and well written in my opinion, though there are some plot holes and loose ends. The character designs aren't bad, music is nothing special although with some in-show songs in English it gets and sounds off a bit.",

Ok, I try this:\r\nCharlotte - is not bad anime, but ... but there are many buts. I can't say that it is a failure, but many bad details (big and small ones) almost make it one. But there are many good things, and furthermore, it was a pleasure for me to watch this. \r\n==Story==\r\nYou will not be bored. There are many events in anime, the story is fast, emotional and interesting. Sometimes cool funny momenthappens, sometimes really serious drama shake the plot. One can create a nice story with this. \\n\\n\r\nWe had the world where kids with super-abilities exist. For the security of this kids (and the world around) special school was created, and our heroes look for new members. Pretty good, right? Just look for one kid in one episode, then small \"boss\" kid in the several last episodes, and do average anime. But...\\n\\n\r\nBut no, the more complicated plot is needed! So add time-travel, the secret organization, and... how many episodes left? Just one... so it is enough for some world-saving. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of that story become so fragmented and un-smooth. Like in one episode heroes fight secret organization, next - time travel, with minimum explanations between. Fragmentation of plot creates fragmentation of anime mood. Really tragic moments immediately is followed by funny one, then tragic again, then some dumb (but funny) scene, and then drama again. Sometimes it looks really stupid. \\n\\n\r\nAbout different DeusExMachina and others coincidences I will not talk much, there are plenty of this stuff, but they are ok, just ok.\\n\\n\r\n==Characters==\\n\r\nThe main hero, Yuu, maybe could be nice, but because of a fragmented story, his is fragmented too. Or maybe he is just bad. Either way, probably you will not care about him much, but in some episodes, drama is really high, that you may. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are better, and it is because they are really simple (even if the story wants to say something else). Nao is really coldhearted all time, Ayumi and Yusa - all time moe and kawaii, and stupid friend. They are good for their roles but do not expect even little development of them. \\n\\n\r\nRelations between characters - absent. Well except Nao and Yuu, but... you probably will not believe it anyway.\\n\\n\r\n==Art and music==\\n\r\nAbout Nao eyes I wrote in the beginning - they are just beautiful. And at all: art here - is almost perfect. That is why we love the 2D world. Good job.\\n\\n\r\nMusic also is nice, but not perfect. Both OP and ED are average, but inside of series really cool music are (especially one episode). \\n\\n\r\n==Enjoyment==\\n\r\nI enjoy watching this anime (I don't ask for much at all), but I suspect that there is better anime for watch, so think about it. But \"Charlotte\" is interesting, simple and beautiful, good for some lazy evening.",

            "content": "Ok, a lot of my friends talk about how they think the story of Charlotte is rushed and inconclusive. That may be true. I do agree that the grand conclusion of saving the world should've taken more than one episode. Nonetheless, I think that the rushed conclusion doesn't effect Charlotte's ability to portray a very truthful side of human nature -- the main dynamic being Yuu Otosaka. \r\nI believe many viewers of this anime can take away something from Yuu, who is a high school student obsessed bout nothing but his self-importance. He wants to date the cutest girl in class. In order to doso, he abuses his supernatural power of possession, an ability that allows him to possess someone else's consciousness for a few seconds, to view other people's answers during a test and get top grades to accompany his already-natural looks. As a result, he gets what he wants, but only for a short time before some cunning club members from a different school than his discover his secrets....\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we go through a journey of Yuu trying to change his selfish view upon the world, as he learns the meaning of gratitude before loss and gratitude after loss, as he learns the meaning of appreciation, as he learns the meaning of life apart from keeping an appearance. \\n\\n\r\nThus, does it even matter how much time the characters spend saving the world? Even if the anime went through the process of of saving the world, does reading a story in the style of a lab procedure play any relevance in your journey to save the world? Anime inspires you to start a habit, to live up to an attitude, but not help you learn. You have to take those habits and start learning, and I think that's why Charlotte was fine with jamming the message of worldly causes\\n\r\ninto one episode. They were fine with just leaving a reminder for the viewers to think about how to save the world, to inspire thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nAside from my main argument, I'd really recommend this anime to anyone, because of how much life hacks it teaches you.\\n\\n\r\nAppreciate the happiness you have in front of you! Do something about your problems, or regret not doing something when time has run out! Be fascinated by all the crocodiles and bananas in the world! Oh yea, dangling like monkey bars on grapevines is also fun. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, here's to my entropic review. Cheers! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, yet another Jun Maeda story. I didn't realize there was so much of it xD.\r\nI was surprised to see that many bad reviews of this anime, but I do get what people complained about. So why do I give it a good mark anyway? Because most of what we can complain about has one and only one root : the shortness of the show.\r\nSTORY\r\nCharlotte is about an institution gathering teens who developed superpowers, in order to protect them from other groups that could use them as experimental subjects (or worse). While the concept is far from unique, the way they handle superpowers is actuallypraiseworthy: each and everyone of those \"super-teens\" have limited powers.\\n\r\nSome can't control it, others have powers with actual limitations, others are just so powerful that they have to hide it because they would be main targets otherwise.\\n\r\nThis is a point people seem to neglect: the concept of superheroes is handled brillantly and in a unique way.\\n\\n\r\nBut Charlotte is also a pure Jun Maeda story: of course it starts with a club (the Student Council in this case) living their everyday life, until the story takes a dramatic turn with a lot of twists and tearful scenes.\\n\r\nAnd I think we can pretty much say... these troped have been overused. I like Maeda, but it would be nice that he tries writing something else.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part of the story (the Slice of Life part) totally conquered me. The comedy is silly and repetitive, but I was fine with it, and the stories this part tells are actually well thought. And of course, I won't mention episodes 6 and 7, who are definitely worth it.\\n\r\nThe second part is where things get messy for a lot of people. This is basically a bunch of ideas taken from other shows and thrown altogether. Suddenly, the story talks about overseas terrorists trying to gather superheroes for evildoing, and somehow time travel is involved.\\n\r\nI did get a bit bored during this part. What it tried to tell was definitely interesting, but I really felt things were too rushed. Many characters are introduced out of the blue. Many decisions are taken out of the blue. In fact, everything happens out of the blue, because there is no time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because there is no time, the whole story is full of plotholes and twists that seem forced. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, Charlotte is full of brillant ideas, that are all rushed because there was simply no time to tell all of them properly.\\n\r\nAnd and this point, PA Works and the other studios should understand Maeda CAN'T tell his stories in only 13 episodes. Angel Beats had the exact same issue! Air and Little Busters Refrain also had this issue! Maeda tells wonderful stories that need TIME to build up.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nCharlotte is wonderful in every way. Smooth animation, wonderful light effects. I expected no less from PA Works!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe OST didn't really appeal to me... except the opening, which I find marvelous. I do feel like the opening changes direction too much (starts as rock, keeps going as emotional, then suddenly becomes hip-hop, and gets J-Pop during the refrain...).\\n\r\nAs for the seiyuu... I do have an issue with the main character. The dude sounded off for my ears.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThis is something people complained about, but frankly, I don't find the crew that catastrophic.\\n\r\nTomori and Yuu are an original MC couple. For once, we have a girl who doesn't blush and acts over the top anytime love is mentioned! And frankly, that makes her character so much more believable than many other anime girls.\\n\r\nThe same for Yuu: the fact that he is kind of a d*ck but acts friendly on the outside makes him very believable. He looks a lot like Lelouch from Code Geass (who is much, much more charismatic and clever, but Yuu was still enjoyable to follow anyway).\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are quite pointless for the plot, it's true. But it is justified, so I had no complain about that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThe first part of the story is definitely worth it. The second part is rushed but is full of brillant ideas regardless. The characters and the overall show are not as deep as, say, Clannad or Kanon, but this is due to the shortness of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can accept the fact that 13 episodes is way too short to tell a decent story, I think you can fairly enjoy Charlotte for its wonderful art and funny characters.\\n\r\nPersonally, I did enjoy it despite the numerous plotholes and the lack of impact during most of the dramatic situations (though these can obviously be a deal-breaker).",

            "content": "I started this anime because a lot of people had requested me. And after Angel Beats, I was really excited because they are from the same creator. And I really liked Angel Beats so I had high hopes. I was disappointed. Really disappointed.\r\nCharacters were\u2026 To be polite, I will say it was okay. I really didn\u2019t feel like I have a connection with these characters. They were trying to make me feel something for some character but I was like \u201cWell, that happened.\u201d It had a lot of different character types- at least the intention was that-  but it feels like they don\u2019t havethe deep characteristic. They were generic characters\u2026 They didn\u2019t have anything special about them. I mean, it feels like a lot of the characters were there just to be there. To fill the gap or to give a feeling that there is a lot of characters. And Yuu\u2019s personality has changed at least three times in 13 episodes and it bothers me.\\n\r\nWhen I watched the first episode, Yuu was smart, manipulative, a little bit evil kind of character so I was like, \u201cYeah, finally some character that I would enjoy watching.\u201d But then\u2026 He became really dull, boring, flat character. He changed fast and hard. And don\u2019t get me started about the romance between Nao and Yuu. I don\u2019t even want to think about it. It was inevitable because \u201cmain characters SHOULD have some kind of romantic relationship.\u201d clich\u00e9 but\u2026It can be the most forced romance that I have seen in my life. It was cringy, it was bad. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the pacing of the anime... At the first episodes, it feels like it was going really slow. The story hasn\u2019t developed yet and the reason why they gather the \u201cspecial ones\u201d, what are they fighting against was unclear. It was kind of episodic, a little bit like Angel Beats. Then it had u turn and started to rush the story. And last episodes had the speed of Usain Bolt. The story developed so quickly. The developers only continued the story just the sake of the story continuing. It was ridiculous. It didn\u2019t make sense. And after I finished the anime, I looked back to the first episode and I didn\u2019t recognize the anime. Yeah, the characters were the same- the appearance at least- but the story was different. Really different. I mean, you can change the characters appearance and boom. You have a new anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, it wasn\u2019t good. But I guess I had really high hopes after watching Angel Beats and this anime feel like it is very flat and rushed. It was like Angel Beats but a very bad version of it. But I guess you can watch it if you don\u2019t have any other anime to watch or you are bored and don\u2019t know what to do. But before you watch this anime, don\u2019t get high hopes or you will be very disappointed like me in the end.\\n\\n",

I think it is a very unique story, with magical powers. The people have to keep their powers a secret. This is a fantasy genre. The voice actors were fitting for the character's imagines. Overall, a great anime.",

Little does the student body know he achieved this by using his secret ability taking over someone body for 5 seconds to cheat. He enjoys this supremacy in school until he encounters other ability users, and is introduced to the harsh reality of his situation. \r\nCharlotte is an enjoyable story that has more to it than you would think. The first half is your typical action/adventure/school life story that is entertaining enough. I was almost going to pass if off as an average story with not much unique or meaningful about it, that isuntil about halfway through there is a serious change of pace, which was an honest surprise to me.\\n\\n\r\nSome of events of the latter half are some intriguing and rare moments that most anime simply don't do. The second half really changed my mind on this show, for the better. However, this didn't help the incredibly fast pace of the second half that ended up hurting the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is a decent watch, with a few great emotional moments, fun powers, and interesting story lines, but also having a many generic premises and characters that will turn many away at first. The story missing its potential and is rather cluttered and inconsistent. This anime could have been a lot better if it was given 26 episode to develop its story rather than 13.\\n\\n\r\n I still recommend giving Charlotte a shot, and personally found some enjoyment myself despite its obvious flaws.

Not a masterpiece, but it was good nevertheless. Which brings me to the disappointment I felt with Charlotte.\r\nFirst, let's get to the positives. The art style was extremely gorgeous and fluid. The soundtrack was great. I love the opening they used. The lighthearted take on the superpower genre was also an interesting concept.  The first few episodes was a really great start for the series.  Throughout the entire series, I didfind myself enjoying it quite a bit. However, the same cannot be said for the character development and the 2nd half of the story. The 2nd half was trying just to be too much at the same time. It had too much going on and the plot twist and the ending was just too rushed. Same goes for the characters, most of which aside from the protagonist had little to no character development at all. And the limited run time does not excuse that, because they wasted earlier episodes on a bunch of unneeded filler.  The last episode had so much in it that that episode alone could have been told in three seasons worth of runtime.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I did enjoy the anime overall, but it felt lacking in many aspects, and was generally rushed. 6/10",

            "content": "Well, I was genuinely surprised by some of the ratings this show got as I expected it it be pretty high up there, however after reading some other reviews I believe I can understand where they are coming from. Note this is my first review. Apparently most people who had watch Angel Beats and Clannad are familiar with Jun Maeda, so they were pretty hyped for the show; however they either overhyped it and were let down or they saw too much of Angel Beats in it. Now I have never seen any of Jun Maeda's work so I just picked Charlotte up because Iwas bored. After watching the first Episode I thought it might be like Code Geass, but only with the high school setting. After watching everything I thought about the things I enjoyed and didn't enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I gave the story an 8. Overall, I liked the story it wasn't a bad one despite being a bit unoriginal; it gave me some feels here and there and some laughs. The art was nice as well, but I usually grade art based on if I'd be able to memorize any of the characters just from their silhouette and I can't do that from any character in this anime. The sound was also good and had a very good OP and ED, but it probably won't be memorable to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the one thing that drove me up the wall about this anime was how poor the character personalities were. I mean, usually there are anime character tropes like a Gothic Lolita or School Idols, but the main characters of this anime had none of that. I could not tell you what their personalities were like even after watching the entire show. For instance, when I watched first episode the main character Otosaka Yuu could probably be identified as a shrewd and cunning person but after that episode he basically becomes a pushover.\\n\\n\r\nThe next character is the main heroine Tomori Nao. I could not place her personality anywhere. At first I thought she might have been a tsundere, but she wasn't; next i thought she was a tomboy, but she wasn't that either. And lastly I thought she was the unexcitable straightforward type, but she wasn't that either. In the end, I honestly don't think she had a personality and it was horrible to watch. I never liked her character or attitude in the anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBesides the characters I enjoyed the anime Overall and give it an 8. Honestly it might be like 7.5 barely and I understand it had only 12 episodes but if the characters had personalities and then they got some character development this show could have easily been a 10 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch Charlotte? Well, I guess it's okay if you want to pass the time, but I don't think it's something I'd recommend to friends.",

            "content": "- REVIEW -\r\n1. ART & ANIMATION\r\nThe character designs are like your typical Key show, some look ok, others look generic, but to be honest the character designs look like a bland Angel Beats re-hash/palette swap. Artistic background and designs are amazing, as expected from P.A WORKS everything is touched upon from the smallest details and feels lively and colorful... Never a dull moment when they do their backgrounds.\r\nAnimation-wise the show lacks it in later episodes where time just stands still most of the time and characters seem to sit in stone talking for a decade while the episode just flows until it ends. It feelssloppy at times, but at some others it looks good. But overall the characters distract you from paying much attention to the animation errors so you probably won't notice them.\\n\\n\r\n2. SOUND\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Charlotte is great, like all Key shows, but of course. SAD MUSIC DOES NOT MAKE THE SHOW ANY BETTER THAN IT SHOULD BE! Just because it made you cry.\\n\r\nIt has a certain charm to it that it'll never get tiresome if you're a fan of relaxing tunes and insert songs. OP & ED's are great aswell, it just proves to show how Maeda knows how to handle his audience when it comes to music.\\n\\n\r\n3. STORY & CHARACTERS\\n\r\nJun Maeda is known for making the script of most if not all key shows, and just proves how lously he does it, it focuses more on the moment when you're suppose to feel bad or cry and not developing the actual characters to make you feel like they are a part of the cast. In most cases they feel like wooden planks who cry for the sake of depression, and that he has no idea what character drama or how a character could be written without feeling like a plot device.\\n\r\nThe directing is somewhat better because Maeda isn't directing it, but that isn't saying much. There is almost no tension because it gets killed by a predictable outcome, character interaction feels like they are loafs to be loafs so people can laugh along side them.\\n\r\nSTORY-wise the show lacks any decent outcome and through the most basic things it's as predictable as ever, and like every key production it ends with an overblown ending that either, makes the viewer facepalm from stupidity asking why? Or making them cry a river just because the song was sad. Or these blobs got sad because someone died, the story lost its tension and interest after the first episode. It wasn't surprising it was just over blown for the sake of making ISFP's or people who like goofy characters because they could relate to them.\\n\\n\r\n4. PRODUCTION VALUES & ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nProduction values are great, yes they are that good. Detailed put alot of work and heart put in All key shows look great and sound great but that's all.\\n\r\nEnjoyment-wise unless you're a fan of stupid things and goofy comedy or a crybaby this is for you, for me this is boring, uninspired, dull and boring.",

            "content": "Watching Charlotte,  I expected great things from a Key anime, and all I can say is that it was ok. It wasn't too good, but it definitely wasn't bad. Charlotte is an anime about superpower-bearing teenagers; now that sounds familiar. \r\nIn terms of storyline, there are a number of plot holes that, if noticed, can ruin quite a bit of the anime. I won't point out any for the sake of spoilers, but it should be clear enough once you watch it. Although most of these plot holes have plausible explanations, it feels wrong to know that something happened without you knowing. Other thanthe plot holes, the storyline was good and unexpected to say the least. There were just enough twists and turns to keep someone interested. Romantic development between the characters is a kind of romance that isn't easily felt. It's more of a deep kind of caring rather than just a random highschool crush.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, they could have done better. Each of the characters was remarkably well defined, but none of them really showed major character development aside from Yu and Misa. \\n\\n\r\nArt-wise,  Charlotte is juuust avove average; it has cute but sensible graphics. Other than that, there isn't much to say.\\n\\n\r\nSounds. Bravely You is definitely one of my favorite openings, as it makes sense only when youre near the end of the anime, and the melody is good overall. The ending wasn't as good in my opinion, and the background music went mostly unnoticeable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Charlotte is a good anime to add to your list. It isn't terribly good but it can give you a few good hours of anime. I'd recommend this to anyone who is particularly fond of the high school setting.\\n",

            "content": "Well, we've finally \"got home.\" It's been a good run, folks; 13 episodes of ups, downs, Key Magic\u2122, and Maeda Feels. After watching, and in some cases rewatching, the entirety of this show, I can say, without reservation:\r\nFAILURE OF THE SEASON CON-BLASTED-FIRMED.\r\nThis review will be structured into an unspoilered section with overall impressions, followed by a link to an archive of the midseason review along with some spoilery opinions. The linked document has FULL SEASON SPOILERS, so read at your own risk.\r\n===================================================\r\n//The Quick and Dirty//\r\nCharlotte is a profound disappointment. Its story begins promisingly before alternating between mundane filler, nonsensical twists, and Angel Beats \"oh crapwe only have 3 episodes left\" syndrome. Its characters begin promisingly, but soon delve into forced archetypes to fit the checkboxes on a \"Jun Maeda Feels Trip\" roster, with pointless interactions given entire episodes and with meaningful ones abandoned at the drop of a hat.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is Angel Beats 2.0, and not in a good way - it did everything Angel Beats did wrong, and nothing that Angel Beats did right. It promises the world - deep characters, feels-jerking twists, and a grand story - and delivers nothing.\\n\\n\r\nI wish it was better. I honestly wish I could praise this show like it was the masterpiece it had the potential to be - but to do so would be lying. \\n\\n\r\n===================================================\\n\\n\r\n//STORY - 2 [9]//\\n\r\nAt its core, the plot of Charlotte is a solid one. It offers an interesting angle on the industry-standard \"highschoolers with superpowers\" premise by throwing in a bit of reality: What would a *real* highschooler with body possession do? Go save the world from evil alien invaders? No, he'd use it to peek at girls' boobs, cheat on tests, and generally be the brat teenagers tend to be. Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and absolute power in the hands of hormone-addled children is terrifying. Into this core theme we throw the plot hook - Lelouch, er, Yuu gets caught by some goody-two-shoes ability wielders who use their powers for GOOD, to protect those with powers from the mysterious, evil, all-powerful scientists that would sooner vivisect you than give a damn about basic human rights. \\n\\n\r\nThat's episode 2. It's all downhill from there.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Charlotte is disjoint, and that's being generous. If I *wasn't* generous, I'd say the plot of Charlotte is as rushed and disjoint as one of my infamous \"I have two hours to write 10 pages on a topic I know nothing about\" papers. Those papers are shit, and Charlotte's plot is worse, veering from one theme to another and jumping between arcs without a trace of narrative transition. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a LOT of good story ideas. The student council's quest to find and warn others from abusing their powers. Yuu's emotional struggles. The ending arc alone could very well be the basis for an entire anime in and of itself. The problem is, none of these ideas are given an appropriate measure of time - the first few episodes of Charlotte feel slow and repetitive before it realizes \"Oh, I have 6 episodes left to tell the rest of the story.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte wants to have the character investment of a Slice of Life, the spectacle of an Action show, and the suspense of a Drama. However, these elements are neither balanced nor executed properly. Several episodes are absolutely WASTED on boring, poorly written SoL-esque episodes, where the obvious intent is to build rapport with our characters before ripping your heart out, and later episodes don't give their elements enough time or detail to be effective. Story elements that should have been half a cour long are compressed into a single episode, and story elements that should've been 5 minutes of the pilot episodes take five episodes. \\n\\n\r\nWhat strong story moments there were, Charlotte wasted. There are moments within Charlotte that I have previously described as being \"The biggest waste of emotional capital since Aldnoah Zero S2,\" though unfortunately describing them would be spoilers. So, imagine a show where the Episode 6 twist is that the pre-OP scene is the MC's house burning down. The OP plays, and the next scene is a continuation of a battle scene from the previous episode, and the whole \"Your home, possessions, and immediate family all burned to a crisp before your eyes\" is never mentioned again. THAT'S the kind of waste Charlotte commits over, and over, and OVER.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte had the POTENTIAL to be a 10/10 story. However, and yes this is a buzzword, ABYSMAL pacing dropped that all the way down to a 2, salvaged only by the quality of what good storytelling there was. \\n\\n\r\n===================================================\\n\\n\r\n//Art - 8//\\n\r\nThere's little argument that Key Visual Arts and PA Works are among the best studios around when it comes to sheer quality of animation and character design. I've little to really say here besides \"It looks fantastic\" - animation is consistently top-tier, even when other elements of the show faltered. I salute thee, animators of Charlotte, for maintaining quality of work even whilst your writers and directors did fuck all.\\n\\n\r\nI would, however, like to point out that Charlotte's OP is my undisputed BEST OP OF THE SEASON. There's more to animation than making the drawings look good - there's stylistic choices, framing, and raw imagination that makes a well-drawn picture into an amazing animation. Charlotte's OP is prime example of that. Words alone can't do it justice - just watch it. Even if you don't want to watch the whole show, watch the OP - it's just that good.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to knock off points for a few egregious technical mistakes, at times, which can largely be attributed to piss-poor storyboarding; it's notsomuch the animators' fault for animating poorly as it is the producer's fault for ordering them to animate a shitty scene. As I just mentioned, there's more to animation than pretty pictures; cinematography, the art of framing camera angles and effects, is an art unto itself that requires considerable attention. There are several times where, in order to accommodate extra dialogue or to stretch out a scene, the camerawork is flat out SHIT. There's one instance of a camera shot from the perspective of something falling onto someone (no spoilers: it could be a girl falling onto our MC in a classic comedy setup, it could be a meteor sent by the hand of god to smite some side character for drama). This camera angle is *very* common in both animation and live action. You quickly pan into the victim's face just long enough to register the look of surprise, then cut - whether it's to a humorous scene of the standard \"MC groping heroine's breast\" shot or a display of blood and gore that'd make Tokyo Ghoul cringe. In this scene, however, it lingers - it cuts to a pan of a closeup, rather than cutting away. It was one of the most disorienting moments I've ever experienced just from watching anime, so much so that I STILL am ticked off by how bad it was weeks after the fact.\\n\\n\r\n===================================================\\n\\n\r\n//Sound - 8//\\n\r\nAs is a specialty of Jun Maeda and Key Visual works, Charlotte uses music from its pet band, with an obligatory concert scene to boot. The soundtrack is, save for the OP and ED, largely forgettable. Application of music to scene is hit or miss, with some scenes having very well matched music and some scenes feeling totally disjoint. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, however, deserves praise. With a mix of veteran and newcomer seiyu, the vocal performances manage to carry through, even when required to deliver some really crappy lines. Of particular note, a shoutout to Uchiyama Kouki for his performance on Yuu, with a fantastic range of emotional delivery; and to the VAs who delivered the English lines in a certain later episode. Save one, that was some TOP NOTCH English impersonation - for once, it actually sounded like English, rather than a Japanese person reciting English words. Heck, the worst lines in that episode are actually the fault of what (as far as I can tell) is an *American* VA.\\n\\n\r\n===================================================\\n\\n\r\n//Character - 5 [8]//\\n\r\nAs collateral damage of the show's abysmal plot pacing, the character development of the cast suffers immensely. To start off with, we have some very well designed and intriguing characters, who are archetypical in some aspects but with enough unique aspects to be interesting. However, as the show progresses, so-called \"character development\" reveals flatter and flatter personalities in all but Yuu's case (who has his own problems). For instance, Joujirou, who at the start has a good hold on a comedic character element with his own quirks, is quickly relegated into a purely gag role, and an unfunny one at that, before fading from the show entirely - he stops being relevant a few episodes in, and then he turns up in a later episode being treated like he's somehow just as important and developed as our MC. What character development there IS for the cast is either ineffectual or counterproductive - the episodes devoted to Slice-of-Life esque interactions offer no lasting developments. What's worse, the show pretends like it's being totally effective in building up a connection between the viewer and characters, and because of this assumption a lot of moments in the show have absolutely no impact - \"So, this guy's sad for some reason, why, and why should I care?\"\\n\\n\r\nYuu is a whole different demon when it comes to HIS character. Yuu has an odd mix of being intriguing one minute to being more passive than a harem protagonist the next. He only seems to act in-character as the plot demands - something bad just happened, so Yuu must be angsty! Something weird just happened, so Yuu must be confused! Several elements of his progression of his character come from nowhere, and others are gone like the drop of a hat. There is one episode that deals with certain psychological trauma Yuu endures - ONE episode. He experiences trauma, he has a depressive period, then he's redeemed by the power of friendship and it's NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN. Y'know how, in Pokemon, Ash goes through all these adventures and hardships yet still reacts to every experience like he's fresh out of Pallet Town? That's Yuu's character development. \\n\\n\r\nCharlotte, again, has GREAT character design, but utterly wastes that potential with sloppy storytelling and sloppy character interactions. \\n\\n\r\n===================================================\\n\\n\r\n//Enjoyment - 7//\\n\r\nTo be honest, in the long game I enjoyed Charlotte. I don't finish anime that I don't enjoy in some way, shape, or form (looking at *you,* Glasslip). For all its flaws, Charlotte does manage to be entertaining from episode to episode. It bears testament to what the show COULD'VE been that the elements of the good that managed to shine through were enough to carry me through the entire show. \\n\\n\r\n===================================================\\n\\n\r\n//Overall - 4//\\n\r\nCharlotte is Angel Beats 2.0: doing everything Angel Beats did wrong, and none of what it did right.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, I almost imagine Charlotte as being the product of Jun Maeda sitting down and asking \"What did people like about Angel Beats? I'll just do those things, and make them even BIGGER, which will make it better.\" The influence is obvious - we have the (attempt) at building rapport with interesting, human characters, we have a midseason tearjerker that changes everything, we have a blossoming love between two complementary souls that's tensely built before reaching a heartwarming confession. Everything about Charlotte is tangibly formulaic - this scene is meant to make you laugh and like this character; this scene is meant to show this character's secret weaknesses to make you sympathize with them; this scene is meant to TEAR YOUR SOUL OUT. Jun Maeda's formula worked in his previous stories to varying degrees - Clannad, Little Busters, and Gunslinger Girl all spring to mind as examples where it was wildly effective.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte checks all the boxes and fits all the requirements of what, historically, should be another masterpiece from Jun Maeda. However, good fiction, almost by definition, CANNOT be a checklist - in meeting all of those requirements, Charlotte ceased to be an organic story and became a mechanical slog. Characters were left to waste, because they'd done their job in ticking off the \"genki girl\" or \"stoic heroine\" requirements. Fantastic plot hooks were left unused, since once they completed the \"dark and troubled past\" mark they were discarded like throwaway gags. \\n\\n\r\nIt's disappointing. Charlotte should, by all respects, have been a masterwork. All the elements were there - talent, ideas, resources. But just having all the parts available doesn't mean you'll assemble it right - and Charlotte, be it through hubris, negligence, or honest screwups, is broken even beyond the capacity of Key Magic to repair.\\n\\n\r\n===================================================\\n\\n\r\nFULL SERIES AND FINALE SPOILERS BELOW. READ AT OWN RISK.\\n\\n\r\nMidseason Review archive, plus finale thoughts. Also, more f-bombs dropped than an average Panty and Stockings episode.\\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1RpwYMTnBp69zp7MSMQ70t2M9Hf1LFbwFpvTwrXeE3XE/edit?usp=sharing",

            "content": "I'm stumbled Charlotte long time ago, but only watched it until yesterday. At first I was reluctant because of lots of negative review about it but as the saying says A man's trash is another man's treasure so I give it a shot\r\nStory = 8\r\nThe story is simple and straight forward. It's about people in his/her puberty period who develops special powers, though these powers will be gone the time you finished your puberty, There's nothing new about that, there is other anime have similar plot where the setting is school with superpowers. However I'm not viewing Charlottte on that. I'm viewing it on thevalues and lessons its sharing. It is kinda subtle but there are things in life you can learn with Charlottte . I guarantee you that.\\n\\n\r\nArt = 9\\n\r\nThe art is refreshingly good, the animation gives this refreshing and light feeling about it. I personally prefer that style because it feels like you can be engulf on the setting itself. That's the feeling I getting from it.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 9\\n\r\nFrom the Background music, opening song, ending song and even insert song it never manage to disappoint me. I love how the sound fits on the anime and how spot in the timing when they pull it off together with the scene. Ahh.. The voice acting is superb too that I can get enough of Tomori and Misa's voice in my head.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 7\\n\r\nI've read in another review that the characters are \"shallow\" though I'm not going to argue with others because its their preferences but for me it's not the case. Sure they don't fill us with any more information about the characters but that kinda give Charlotte the atmosphere it needs to be unique. I mean that triggered my curiosity at them and made me crave for the next episode. So I'm saying this they are not shallow but the opposite, they are much more than what they are. If you take time to analyze them you'll see what I mean. I hate getting character development when the anime just push the spoon on our palate, and that's not Charlotte do so that's why I like it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall = 9\\n\r\nAhh I can't believe how late I was to watch this anime.  Charlottte is one of those anime that when I remember, it makes my heart flutter and put a smile on my face. If you're fond of something light but can be heavy at the times it needs to be then Charlotte is spot on for you. What can I just say as a piece of advice is, \"Observe and just enjoy it. Don't think about it's negative review just sit down and try to feel the anime.\"\\n\\n\r\nThen if you are still reading then Thank you and Have a nice time in watching!\\n",

            "content": "This anime is about this good looking teenager called Yuu Otosaka who happened to have supernatural powers. He misused his powers and as a result he had to join a group of teenagers (led by Nao Tomori) to find those who use their super powers wrongly. And save them before scientists find them and experiment them.\r\nStory (10)\r\nAnyways, the story itself was changing its direction with every episode. Although, the first few episodes were fairly the same idea but then it started getting more serious. Yet, still important for the story to actually go through all these changes to give the ending its meaning. One thingkept on happening from the beginning which is\u2026 THE EXCITEMENT! I enjoyed this anime so much! They never failed in surprising me or making me cry or even laugh. It was super well made! The first thing I said to describe this show to my friend was \u201cI haven\u2019t been feeling this much excitement in too long.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCons? Well\u2026\u2026 I think its great but if the last 3 episodes weren\u2019t too packed with stuff it would\u2019ve been better. Like.. the last 3 episodes did what you would like to see in a whole season.. not even exaggerating. By the 12th episode I thought its the ending. Right there. Until I realized there is one more episode to go. It wasn\u2019t horrible but I would\u2019ve loved more details and emotions\u2026\u2026. and tears.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4)\\n\r\nCharacters, ugh too many characters in this anime which makes it hard for some main characters to actually develop. Lets just focus on the development of the main characters.\\n\r\nNao and Misa had minor changes in their personalities by the end. While a mine character like Takajou was the same from the beginning. He actually didn\u2019t have so much to do unfortunately. Yusa wasn\u2019t really a useless main character but she wouldn\u2019t be that important if not for Misa (Her sister). Ayumi (Yuu\u2019s sister) was very important for the story but she didn\u2019t get so much focus and her development was too small that you can even ignore it. Yuu, on the other hand, who is the main protagonist, was really shifting personalities and went from bad to good to better to worst to terrible to everything! He suffered the most, I\u2019d say. The story was focused a lot on Yuu and Nao to the point where even more important characters to the story didn\u2019t get much to do. Weird?  Yes but I really was able to love every single character because each got to show what makes them lovable. You might think that this anime is full of clich\u00e9 characters but well\u2026 at least you\u2019ll enjoy the story cuz its an enjoyable clich\u00e9 to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nShout out to Jun Maeda, creator of Angel Beats and Clannad. Who also happen to be the creator of Charlotte, and all our tears, broken hearts and laughters. \\n\r\nJun Maeda, Whats good?\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nAnimation?  Exactly as if you\u2019re watching Angle Beats (Thats why I brought it up lol). If you never watched it, then go what are you waiting for? \\n\r\nCharlotte had an amazing, amazing, AMAZING animation! I loved the colors, the eyes, the skies (it rhymes). It also had an amazing opening and closing that I don\u2019t skip not for the music but only to enjoy the art. You see the 2015 advanced animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack (10)\\n\r\nIt was really beautiful. I didn\u2019t really like the opening and closing but THEY WERE NOT BAD. They were fair. I just have a weird music taste. But honestly the background music did a great job making me enjoy every and each emotion that the story made me feel. It was perfectly  composed to fit right there. To be honest, the story, animation and music were all in harmony.. a beautiful rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\r\nLOVED IT!!! But I have to mention.. some episodes might really hurt your soul.. You might feel a hole in your heart for some time. imagine I had to feel the pain for a whole week untill the next episode is out.. you guys (who haven\u2019t watched it while it was airing) are lucky lol. Enjoy it and please let me know what you think about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\r\nAll in all, Charlotte was a great anime. Not suitable for everyone. yet, really entertaining. Yes has clich\u00e9s but it was perfectly hidden till you actually take time to analyze it. (I didn\u2019t realize till I started writing, honestly. although I am known to be a clich\u00e9 alert person.) The amazing scenes and all the ups and downs were just amazingly put together. \\n",

            "content": "Well, i dint expect anything when i added this series to my list this season, nor was i aware it was from the studio that brought us clannad. At first i thought it was a high school comedy, and while it has its moment, with time it hits with a sudden rise in plot development, where tension and mystery to the point that it hooks you up ot the point that you cant wait for the next chapter. Indeed i was surprised and i must say that this series has its hidden gem that can be seen upon its initial superficial look. Its a seriesthat slowly wraps you up with its slow well done development. Sure it there are a lot lighthearted funny moments, but there is also a ton serious moments that make the plot move at the right moments, without leavng plot holes in the midst. \\n\r\nIn the end i do recommend this series as it feels like a real slice of life, it has school drama( bit cliche but its kept to a minimum) with pieces of supernatural phenomenons, which make the series all the better.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I t develops well, and when it has to. There are no plot holes as the plot moves slowly while explaining everything, which means that patience is required, as it wont give you everything from the get go. In the end this series is everything you don't expect as it tends to get serious really fast, and cliffhangers appear, as it is a series as hole and not a bunch small arcs. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Awesome, at times cute, but why expect anything else, when its Aniplex and PA WORKS the ones that are involved, and they never fail at delivering high quality entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Again Aniplex is involved, so of course it is good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well the developments of the character is well balance, like i said before, this is a series that develops at balanced precise pace. Bits of information for each character are given at their own time in ways that are not to obvious, and it was that does not get in the way of the story development, as it wont stop progression just to show you a hole episode of a characters past, Besides it's a 13 episode series so they cant afford to do that, since plot is primordial. Like i said this producers are making this series in a very smart way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: well i love mystery as of recently, and i have always been a fan of slice of life series, as they tend to give simple yet fun stories. And if plot twists are right in your alley that this series will do you good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. It is a fun series, and is worth watching. I cant give it a perfect score as the series is not without flaws, but in many ways it makes up for  its flaws by providing a main character, that evolves really well toward the end. \\n\\n\r\nIts a 8.5 in my books",

            "content": "This is my first review so go easy on me ;)\r\nSo, where do we start? Charlotte, the first time I saw this anime on MAL and read the synopsis I thought to myself \"ok, this one is definitely worth watching. It probably will have a fair amount of drama and deal with serious issues regarding the plot elements\". However, after watching the first few episodes, I saw that I was completely mistaken. The anime had a slice of life feel to it, and many episodes ( Like the baseball game or the hunt after a random ability wielder) didn't give the story a big push.And then suddenly episode 6 came, there was a huge shift in the story progression, where a lot of things happened in a single episode and sometimes you were left wondering why did they include filler episodes when they wanted to deal with such stories and drama? I felt it was rushed. New characters were introduced but none of them (except maybe one I'm not going to name for spoiler reasons) had a decent amount of character development. They could've either gone with a complete slice of life/comedy story or started the anime from the beginning concentrated on the drama and the serious parts of the story. They also could've gone with a second season/2-cour anime, but the way the last 2-3 episodes were rushed, It's very unlikely. That's why I gave the story a fair 6, It had A LOT of potential, but in my opinion, a large chunk of it was wasted. \\n\r\nThe art was great. The combination of a great usage of various colours and a good drawing style created a great anime in terms of art style. Most of the characters were drawn beautifully and I couldn't find anything wrong with the art or the drawing style.\\n\r\nThe music and songs were great too, they made a wonderful use of the music, especially the timing. One example would be episode 13. I just felt really drawn in by the music of this anime.\\n\r\nCharacter development is another section I found some errors with. Some characters were not given much time to shine, others came and went as they pleased, with one character being completely absent from a few episodes. The main characters had decent development in my mind and I found myself liking their personalities. \\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime, but I can't help thinking how much of a better show this could've been. Still, I recommend you to watch It because overall, this is a good show.",

            "content": "We could have had it all, Charlotte.\r\nThis series started off great. I enjoyed it a lot and for the direction it was going for. I assume I don't need to tell you what it was about, but it was going great for the first half. I didn't mind the episodic format that it took to get us settled into the world of Charlotte. If you're reading this among the many Charlotte reviews already, then you must already know that the second half did not do any justice to the second. \r\nWay too rushed, way too many things going on -- there are just a lotof factors that lead to it being a disappointment, at least for me. There were interesting characters all throughout the series. Some, if not most, get the unfair shove to give others more screentime (people who don't like moe or idol-like characters, I guess you should stay away from this show). The art was beautiful, too, and the seiyuus were pretty top-notch. I'm not familiar with the creator's previous work (Clannad? Yeah, I tried but not my cup of tea) but he sounds like someone who knows how to do his job. So in theory, everything should be able to work, right?\\n\\n\r\nNope. Somehow, I feel like it had all these elements going for it but it just didn't play out well. Maybe it's the 13-episode format? It had major pacing issues. Charlotte will inevitably turn up in various discussions in anime, I believe. So I will stop this rant-filled review from there.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, would I recommend this title to anyone else? Yes, if you're into stories of teenagers with extraordinary super powers and anti-heroes in general. It's quite a ride and despite its many MANY flaws, I enjoyed watching it as  well. (I seriously got angry at some parts but that's all part of the ride.) I would not recommend this if you're looking for something with tighter and much more coherent storytelling and arguably something much more substantial or if you're just looking for something mindless to watch. It's quite polarizing in a way.",

I was flat out wrong. And here's why:\r\n_____________________________________________________\r\nFirstly, the characters were more round and dynamic, especially Otosaka Yuu. From a cheater to an OP superhero, that's not something you see everyday. Also, he showed how we humans can also turn bad when aware of our capabilities. Fortunately, he didn't end up evil because he had his resolve. He is definitely a character that we can all relate to, even though we don't have his ability.\r\nOthercharacters were well-rounded as well, such as Nao, Yuu's brother, etc. They were really given detailed personality, as if they were real people. If there's one thing that caught my eye, it was this. Good job, Jun Maeda!\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________\\n\r\nNext, we have the art style. PA works really outdid themselves. It was just as good as KyoAni, if I do say so myself. The background looked so realistic and detailed to the last spot (except some small exceptions).\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________\\n\r\nThe story was good, although it had flaws here and there. I could see so many plot holes in some episodes (naming them would be spoilers) but other than that, it went well. The flow of the story was quite different from other anime in a way that each episode can stand on its own while still preserving continuity of the plot.\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________\\n\r\nOverall, I loved Charlotte. If I could, I would give it an award. It really is a great series. I recommend it to all those who want something different and unique.",

            "content": "Well this is my first time writting a formal review of an anime online as i usually done it on facebook or any other related social websites. So back into business. The anime Charlotte is one of the newly released animes that was being released as a summer 2015 anime and it has a total of 13 episodes. The story tells us about a young boy who develops superhuman abillities which he used it for his general purposes until he met another group of people who also posessed those special abillities too and that is when the storybegins. Thus,they are many aspects that i want to stress and to make you comprehend completely about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly,is about the storyline. To be honest,the whole plot is mainly about the characters' depressing and painful life stories as they continue with their lives along with their superhuman abillities. The episodes are fit together neatly into a continuous story but if we talk about the ending,it is way too rush.There are whole lots of unexplained things and questions and they are plot holes too that is supposed to be explained in the next season but i dont think that will happen. However,the story is actually pretty interesting and unique too but the suspense after one episode ends is really huge. Also,some of the comedies made by the characters can sometimes be funny and hilarious. Most crucially,every episode will harbour tons of feelings and sadness. \\n\\n\r\n     Secondly,the artstyle is simply a masterpiece. I mean just look at the graphics of the sceneries and even the characters,are quite marvelous! to be honest,the first time i watched the first episode i was really flabbergasted by its flawless graphics and this makes the anime,the story and the characters well suited. When in terms of the characters' designs, i sometimes find them not that appealing as some of them had really huge eyes and sometimes the nosebleed of Ayumu isnt necessary in the anime. Overall, their appearance did match their personalities and attitudes.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore,all I can say that the opening and ending songs are really superb! they really fit well with the atmosphere and the storyline of the anime and as well as the characters. You got this fantasy feeling as you are listening to these songs in a fantasy realm. Next is the seiyuus. Well some of them really fits the character like Nao with her light-kuudere but deep voice (I dont know how to describe it). There is this band called ZHIEND which Nao really likes and i am surpised that they also made outstanding music and as a result, i really love their music!\\n\\n\r\n  To make a review about the characters,I will start with the worst and the best. The first is Ayumi Otosaka. After her first tribute in the early episodes,I already cant tolerate her extreme\" loliness\" personality,her overused \"desu\" words and most obviously,her nosebleeds but im glad that it was over before i knew it. Next are the protagonists and Im going to start with Yuu Otosaka. His personalites had a lot of negatives like using his power to cheat in exams,doesnt wanted to listen to other's opinions and the like in the first early episodes but as he met Nao,the Student President Council,he gained a lot of things and before he knew it,he had done of of the most generous and heroic attributes in his life. The minor characters arent that many but some of them did play their own roles like the mysterious girl who wanted to kill Ayumi. The narrators are the characters themselves but only appeared at the first and the end of the series if im not mistaken.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude,Charlotte is an interesting and delightful anime as it upholds the depressing moments and flashbacks of the characters like losing someone you love, protecting your family members by any means and being kidapped as lab mice for greedy needs. Personally i really enjoyed this anime as the genre of the anime are supernatural and fantasy and those are the things that are compulsory in any anime that i watched although not every single one of them. In my opinion some of the people will dislike this anime because of the major flaws but at the same time Charotte can teach you lots of valuable lessons and moral values. If you like tragic and sad moments,not to mention supernatural related things, this anime is for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nothing gets me more excited than new content from KEY. That being said, when I heard about Charlotte, my emotions ran wild and my happiness-meter went through the roof (Which sucks because I had to buy a new one). What excruciatingly sad, yet sometimes obnoxiously joyous story could they have in store for me this time around? Will Lia sing the opening song again? What lessons are there to be learned? And more importantly, what adorable girls has Na-ga Rindou drawn for us this time around? Well, suffice it to say, all of those things happened. But this time, they felt a little different. NowI am forced to decide just how different and whether that difference is good or not.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is brought to us straight from the mind of none other than Jun Maeda. It is directed by the talented Yoshiyuki Asai, which explains a lot considering this show felt almost identical to Angel Beats! The cast was impressive as well, bringing us names like: Maaya Uchida, Ayana Sakura, and Kouki Uchiyama. Right off the bat, we have tons of elements that should be able to, even by themselves, make an anime extremely enjoyable with a hint of familiarity. And if reviewing came down to literally just that, Charlotte would have been a perfect success. But there are some holes that the all-star cast and staff couldn't fill. The biggest of these holes being the one that was left by the overall length of the show, finishing at just 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe star of this anime (Even though I wanted it to be the wonderful Nao Tomori so, so much) was the narcissistic and broody Yuu Otosaka. Just like in most KEY stories, there is phenomenal character development. There's just one problem -- all of that development was used on Yuu. And it worked, don't get me wrong. I think he is one of the greatest KEY creations so far. He felt real and went from extremely unlikable to totally likable and then back to unlikable all over the course of the short series. Even though that seems sporadic and odd on paper, it was great. You really got a feel for who he was and how easy it was for traumatic experiences to shape him into a new person. But everyone else was kind of static for the most part. The list of characters were great in every way apart from their development. Design was flawless, dialogue was high-tier, and the acting was spot on. That just once again reinforces what I said from earlier about too much time being used on Yuu. If viewers had just a little more time to get to know what was behind the rest of the characters, this could have been spectacular. Even Nao, who is essentially the second main character, has almost nothing revealed about her past. She just kind of mentions it in passing and then shrugs it off. That isn't the way KEY normally goes about something like this. And you can say that can be attributed to her cold, disinterested character, but that doesn't satisfy me. It just makes it harder to care. (But I still do just because she's so pretty, oh my god).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, we have something here that I believe could have been in the top three for KEY, had it been done the way I (And so many others) thought it should be done. That once again brings us to the controversial issue of series-length. This isn't your average anime story, folks. We have a main character who joins a sort of witness protection program for adolescent superheroes, has to deal with a traumatic, life-changing event and falls into an untimely despair, GOES BACK IN TIME, fights off terrorists, and SAVES THE WORLD all in just 13 episodes. The first four or so of them were exposition, by the way. It's a general rule of thumb that saving the world needs more than one episode. So why did KEY execute the final arc of Charlotte in this manner?\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to dedicate this whole paragraph to the Yuu x Nao relationship, but specifically what happens in the last few episodes, starting with his confession to her. That is the one thing that I feel was executed perfectly in terms of them as a couple. It's evident in the last few episodes that Yuu is coming to terms with his feelings for Nao. Hell, it becomes evident as soon as she appears and saves him from further harming himself during his gangster-esque fallout halfway through the season. And her reaction to his confession? Priceless and spot on. She reacts exactly how you would imagine her reacting, and that tightens your heart-strings to maximum extension. From that point on though, it starts sloping downward, yet still containing that tinge of curiosity and hope the audience is clinging to, the same way that Yuu is clinging onto his flash-cards from Nao -- even when he forgets how he got them. It's just...his whole journey thing happens in a 20 minute period and he forgets all about her within that time. Had that been stretched out over several episodes and had his memory started slipping away little by little, it would have created an extremely depressing turn of events that would normally be synonymous with KEY work. In the end, their reunion is equal parts miserable and happy. I just wanted more than the brief moments of semi-love that I got to experience.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the plot was convoluted and the pacing was a bit \"All over the place,\" I think Charlotte still hits hard. Just not as hard as it was supposed to. The tonal shifts, though some people have a problem with them, create a way for viewers to become more attached to the characters over a short period of time. Those lighthearted moments that shape the bulk of the episodes quickly turn sour at the drop of a hat, and instead morph into something that winds up causing your jaw to drop. However, the pacing of this show in particular sometimes accelerates those moments and instead creates more of a confusing effect. A lot of the time, I was uncertain how to feel. But there were still elements that were extremely above-average. One of those being the use of vision.\\n\\n\r\nThink back to the characters that were blind -- Sala Shane of ZHIEND, Shunsuke Otosaka, and eventually half of Yuu. What Sala and Shunsuke have in common is that both of them, despite being unable to see, somehow manage to see more than anyone. Those two could easily be considered the wisest out of the entire cast in terms of doing exactly what they need to do at all times -- and not just for themselves, but for everyone. Yuu, on the other hand, loses one eye (Obviously resulting in losing half of his vision). This could wind up being a metaphor for how torn up his personality became. Even though he knew what he must do, there was that level of uncertainty and hesitance that kept dragging him down. In my opinion, that was one of the best uses of symbolism that I have seen from KEY.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nCharlotte isn't your typical anime. It has a lot to say, but doesn't have time to say it. It is yet another perfect example of how length of a story versus airtime can cause even the most skilled of writers to rush certain aspects. There are elements of Charlotte that far surpass other anime out there. There aren't, however, many elements that surpass the ever-expanding portfolio from KEY. The high standards they set for themselves wound up unfortunately causing this show to be a step or two under their average. Does that make it bad? Not a chance. Charlotte is still one of the most hard-hitting shows of the year and brings viewers a warm, nostalgic feeling through ambient, emotional music and a sentimental color palate. I'd recommend this to anyone.",

            "content": "Charlotte is a mixture of supernatural, drama, comedy and a little bit of slice of life anime original written by Jun Maeda, the man who innovated the \"will make you cry\" or in other words the 'Nakige' genre with his Visual Novels like Kanon, Clannad, Little Busters and production by P.A Works, the studio behind the beautifully animated Nagi no Asakura and Angel Beats.\r\nStory: The Premise And The Positive.\r\nCharlotte started promising with how the story was presented. The concept of the story is kind of like from Marvel comics where superheroes need to hold responsible of their powers but with a little twist, our maincast are on a mission to convince other teenagers with powers to never use them until they reach adulthood where their powers will just vanish. Why are they doing that? Well just like any other story with super powers, there are scientists who will do inhuman experiments on you when they find out you're a freak.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the premise is kind of typical from a westerner's point of view, it still manage to be different as their powers has some kind of limit. Like the main protagonist, Yuu has the power of taking over other people's body but it will only take affect in 5 seconds. With the limitations, the characters are doing what they can to use their powers cleverly and with the help of one another they always manage to accomplish their goal.\\n\\n\r\nEverything is relaxed and episodic in the first half of the series. Each episode was about searching for teenagers with powers and convince them to not use their power again through either blackmail or beating them to their own game (like a baseball player with powers, the main cast will compete with him with a game of baseball). Surprisingly, they are always successful. I kind of question of how they convince these people will even work if it happens in real life. But hey this is anime we are talking here. Still, seeing the group collaborate using their powers without exaggerated violence, and replacing it with a funny event is kind of amusing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: The Negative.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte went downhill in the second half of its 13 episodes. But first, I'm going to talk about what is the issue with the first half. I have mentioned the first half was episodic and yeah it was entertaining but then I began to question where all of this is getting into. And it started to feel like the value of the show is getting less interesting with overuse gags and similar outcomes of what they are doing. But then finally something big and serious happened around episode 5 or 6 and my interest rise up again, but after that......\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nthe pacing got rushed like Usain Bolt running for his life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen things have gotten serious is where everything has gotten worse. The turn of events was all so sudden, resolving main issues turned out to be as easy as solving kindergarten math, and the drama felt empty like your wallet. The story is not built for 13 episodes, but far more so the pacing could have done right. Jun Maeda made it anyway and the director improvise and messed things up, instead of making Charlotte great, they made the show look pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to mention names but Charlotte turned into romance in the second half. Anyone doesn't mind romance, if done right, but not here. Yeah the cast spend much time with each other in the first half but there was no indication or hint a romantic development is happening. In short, the romance is vague and felt unnecessary. Then again, it was because the pacing was rushed.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Charlotte turned out to be a MC centric show, opposite of what was happening with a collaborative group effort in the first half of the series. Yuu had a big revelation with his power and did everything himself. Why even bother making characters around him then? To be his determination to accomplish his goal? Yeah and One Piece is successful because Luffy doesn't rely on his crew.....\\n\\n\r\nOk enough about that, I'm getting tired of discussing how bad the direction went in the second half of the series. I'm now going to discuss the other, slightly positive elements Charlotte can offer you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The Positive.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime is fun and eccentric. The cast seems to be normal looking but each of them have their quirks when a gag happens. Not the most memorable bunch but still likable and can hold the viewers attention with their hyperbolic interactions. The cast did earn my affection a little, seeing how they work together and bonded with all those happy moments in the first half of the season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The Negative.\\n\\n\r\nOnly the main characters receive a little character development. The supporting cast are one dimensional and only a handful was given a backstory. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Production:\\n\\n\r\nP.A Works did a great job portraying the visuals and animating the whole series with full effort. The visual looks crisp, bright, and colorful and it's a feast watching it in HD. Not as good looking as Nagi no Asakura, but it's close. Also, the music is download worthy except for those Engrish songs, well our opinion varies in that category.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I dislike about the Overall Production? Again what they did with the pacing, and the fact that they decided 13 episodes was enough to cover all this. So much potential got wasted because they ran out of episodes to work on. Which sucks. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nCharlotte was ambitious and had potential, but ruined by their own implemented limitations. It has drama, but not worth being depress or produce a tear in your eye. Though I give credit to P.A Works that they did a fantastic job with the visuals. Finally, I see this as Jun Maeda's most disappointing project in his portfolio, as great as he is, he should just stick with writing Visual Novels.\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: MILD SPOILER  \r\nCharlotte marks the first entry of Maeda's work for me (most notable for the one behind Angel Beats and Clannad), but I'm already quite familiar with how his writing works thanks to to several people in my social circle. His character writing, his pechant for melodrama, etc. So it does quite surprise me to see Maeda's writing kids-with-superpower story considering its not exactly the usual vehicle for the things that's often found in his writing.\r\nAnd after watching all 13 episodes, its....I'm not going to use the word good, but its certainly an interesting thing.\r\nCharlotte's starts off strong with the introduction ofour charismatic villanous protag, Yu, doing various shenanigans with his newfound superpower before he was caught red handed by a special school student council members, Takajo and Nao. After that, he was transferred to said special school and got forcefully joined into the student council. What's entertaining about this intro is how campy everything and with such flair everything executed.\\n\\n\r\nFrom then on, at least for few episodes or so, Charlotte was structured as sort of slice-of-life episodic cases with each week we got introduce to a new power user, Yu and his friends confront them and told them to stop using their powers, and conflict resolved. That is of course until both drama and dark twists occurs surrounding the origin of Yu's special academy.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic cases themselves are generally solid and well-made, if a bit formulaic and repetitive on the comedy front (the slapstick is hit and miss), but drama often fell pretty short. Often feeling unearned and emotionally lacking because the culprit in these cases often lack characterization themselves. Opting to just dumping the entire motivation right in the end of the episode instead of subtle characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also problems on both how the twist and few of the singular dramatic moments. The former lacks foreshadowing, build up and it undermines the series any meaning both in thematic and in emotional resonance, while the latter starts of well with slow development but becomes slightly too overblown. But both suffers through the fact that it ultimately doesn\u2019t mean a whole much in the place of overall story, which arrive at an ending that\u2019s\u2026\u2026..like the show itself, I could only describe as a thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because it seems like it was made for entirely different shows and heck, you could create an entirely different show through that ending alone.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m trying hard not to give spoilers, but to talk about this more accurately, while I\u2019m afraid have to give an example, so\\n\\n\r\n   ---------------------------------Mild Spoiler Alert----------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nIn the middle of the anime, through a very contrive drama, someone important to Yu, died. And in the following episode we see Yu going through mourning/grieving period. The moment starts off well with Yu beginning to withdrawn from the world. But as the episode goes on, Yu began to starts to channel his sadness into aggression. First, through shooting game, then to beating up thugs, and before he descend further, he was stopped.\\n\\n\r\nLogically speaking, the way Yu act may well understandable, but the portrayal of the act are too overblown and slightly exaggerated to take seriously. He wasn\u2019t portrayed as channeling aggression, he was becoming a straight-up psychopath.\\n\\n\r\nAnd ultimately, it was all meaningless, because through series of twists (that, like I said, lack foreshadowing and build up), that someone important was brought back to life just because. This undermines any emotional development Yu\u2019s going through before.\\n\\n\r\n    ----------------------------------End Spoiler--------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters that you\u2019ll be seeing, they\u2019re at most endearing, but not exactly memorable nor given much development. The most stand outs being are our main protag Yu and our main heroine Nao.\\n\\n\r\nNao, in my cynical interpretation, are pretty try-hard subvertion of Maeda\u2019s female character writing. In what I\u2019ve heard, Maeda often wrote female characters as either solely as being love interest or just baby in a teenage skin. But in here, Nao\u2019s competent (overly so), always in control, and pretty non-chalant. So while that\u2019s plus point for her, is she actually well-written? Eh\u2026..not really? Her core personality are three characters trait that barely have anything to do with one another. Sometimes she\u2019s a hardass no-nonsense lady, sometimes she\u2019s overly fangirl-ish, and her tragic backstory doesn\u2019t seem to matter much to overall character.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yu, well all I could say that he was wasted potential. His charisma and supervillain-ish tendency are underutilize in the cases (Nao took the spotlight, most of the time), and his development from selfish jerk to a nice guy feels unearned. While we were told and shown his development, the how of his development isn\u2019t clear. He just sort of hang around with his friends, we were never shown how that influence him.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of them are mostly two dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nOn the aesthetic front, Charlotte has a pretty gorgeous production, as expected of P.A Works. Bright and vivd colors. Lots of pretty singular shots and background. The animation are fine, consistent and pretty expressive, especially in the facial. The character design are also distinct. So if you\u2019re in this for the eye candy, Charlotte got you covered. The music are mostly pleasant and enhance the atmosphere in many case, but otherwise not particularly stand out.\\n\\n\r\nSo while Charlotte are an anime with many flaws, the passion and the earnest behind them are undeniable. The drama can dragged off, but its certainly an interesting watch, even though it wasn\u2019t particularly good.",

            "content": "Hmm, I don't know where to start with this anime. I thought that there were pros and cons to this anime, but overall, I think that I have to say something about it. It kinda sucked. Not too badly at least. The anime was able to bring some enjoyment to my life and able to keep me semi-satisfied.\r\nStory: The story was about a stereotypical highschooler...who had magical powers. Yes, he has this unique ability that sets him apart from most of his peers. However, he is captured and sent to a school, along with his younger sister, to a new school. There, hilarity ensues...sometimes. Thestory focuses on the student council of the school finding the various students around the city where they live in and in a somewhat small part of Japan. This sounded fine, and was actually starting to shape up to be a semi-good anime. That is until...shit happens. Basically, without revealing too much about what happened, basically there were twists to the story that were just...all over the place. They tried fixing the problem that occurred with Otozaki Yu's little sister by adding in a plot element that just didn't make sense, because apparently there was another sibling involved that apparently is very important, and they just pulled it out of their asses as to why things happened the way they did. Then, they do another plot twist and don't really try to think logically about the situation. They just wanted to try and justify the fact that \"Oh, love story. Let's roll with that\" *Hint Hint: It is kinda obvious once you see the anime. It is between Yu and another character* Overall, it had its fine points, but it REALLY should have rethought how to do basically the second half of the story. Rating: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: This may surprise some people, but I actually didn't like the art style very much. Don't get me wrong, the art style was very beautiful at times, where it showed very realistic backgrounds and some good special effects. However, there were times it tried to look modern, but end up just looking like someone forgot to put their creativity caps on, and resorted to much older styles of animation. For example, the scenery during the episode where the student council goes to the forest is breathtaking and just so well done. Then, when it comes to the final like 2 episodes, they try to show bullet holes, bullets being fired, blood that is supposed to be from fresh wounds, but for some reason, looks very stiff, etc. It just didn't hold up to what I expected. Rating: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Overall, it was mediocre at best. There were some songs in there that just simply beautiful, like some of the piano solos, but even then, it was very limited to a few episodes, particularly the last few. The sound effects were decent enough, but the explosions didn't sound very realistic and they sounded very generic. Even crumbling and bullets being fired sounded very generic. Also, the voice acting was actually not bad, but it wasn't a stellar performance either, and there weren't really any bad characters and bad voices. Overall, they were decent and there wasn't much of a problem.\\n\r\nRating: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay. Here is where it REALLY falls short. The Characters in this show were largely not that great. Nao was probably the exception, because she was the most enjoyable character and she was the one that went through the most development, surprisingly. Because she had experienced things outside of her comfort zone, and she was willing to think outside the box with a lot of things, displaying an untapped potential for intelligence. However, I must really say that the main character of Yu really pissed me off overall. Now, there were relatable moments with the guy, and that was great, but he seemed very arrogant at times, especially at the beginning. That even plays out in the last episode, where instead of LOGICALLY thinking things through, he still continues on his \"journey to insanity\" I would call it. He would have saved himself and got some brownie points back from me, if he just used his head for once. Even though he wasn't the smartest character, he still had a good amount of cunning, which would have brought him a long way, but instead, he went WAY WAY overboard in the last episode, and didn't really think things through. He even had a dilemma about being logical and smart, because if he went back in time, since he gained the power to do so, it would have solved everything. Sure, the drawback to the power of time traveling would cause him to lose a little eyesight, but COME ON, you are expending more energy than you should have, and you would already be sacrificing some of your eyesight to fix the problem, but not all. *sigh* He is not as bad as Makoto in School Days. Trust me. He still has to cross another ocean to do that, but so far, he is probably in a hotly contested second position there with various other characters. Rating: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is going to be the shortest part, because it is much more simple. I enjoyed the anime for its attempt at being great, but I also was using my head in this, while thinking things on the level they were in the anime, and I still was baffled. There were things that made me smile big, but there were plenty of things that pissed me off. I overthink things, but really, who doesn't. Honestly, if they had just kept the same formula, but added different variables to the equation to get different answers, it would have been a great anime. However, what they did was start with one formula, then erase that formula, and try a new one, then go with that one for a little bit, then change it again. It just didn't work, but it was still enjoyable. Rating: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I will give this anime a 4/10 for trying. Now, if they went off the deep end to begin with, and did so many bad things, this anime would be a lot lower, and maybe as bad as School Days. However, it did have many more redeemable qualities, and it was almost a 5/10, but the last episode was just not...necessary to do the way they did it... In fact, it would have been like  7/10 before the halfway point even, because it was actually fairly well done, but the plot twists were just not that great... so if you want to check this out, go ahead, but if I were you, I would stay away from this, because it was just a mess of an anime that could have been great but fell flat on its face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 4/10.\\n\r\nP.S. If you liked this, that is great. We all have our tastes, and in the end, this was not part of mine, despite having genres I liked.",

            "content": "Being a huge fan of Studio Key, I was really looking forward to Charlotte. They contributed to many amazing pieces of the past such as Clannad, Air, and Angel Beats. This is a re-review after watching the final episode, and then re-watching the series again after. \r\nStory(7): The story of Charlotte is a confusing one. Like most anime, there is one goal where the character(s) work toward. In Charlotte, there are many goals here and there. Once the character(s) complete a goal, a new goal arises, etc, etc, etc. I myself, as well as I can assume almost everyone else can agree that this typeof story + 13 episodes = rushed to the max. I am not sure why any studio, especially Key, that has the potential to create an amazing anime would condense it into 13 episodes. I honestly was very excited while watching this series till episode 12, because it felt like these 12 episodes were leading up to this point. Something \u201cmajor\u201d was going to happen in episode 13 that would defy my logic and Key would mindf##k me yet again. Unfortunately, it didn't and I have to admit that I was awaiting a waterfall of tears. I was greeted with depression at how well \u201ceasily\u201d this show ended (really the amnesia card?). Nevertheless, although the story wasn\u2019t played out well, it had meaning. And hey, we rarely get anime that contain a special meaning, and we are lucky to have studio Key to bless us with that. \\n\\n\r\nArt(10): Amazing. What else can I say? The opening was beautifully animated. Each scene looked almost real to me. If you think Nagi No Asukara was awesome, this is one of the few animes that can compare/exceed it. If you were to watch an anime just for its beautiful animations, throw this on your to watch list immediately. \\n\\n\r\nSound(11): Haha I wish there was an 11 button, but screw it Im making my own. The sound\u2026\u2026\u2026damn it doesn\u2019t get better than this. I have bought all 6 CD\u2019s already because of the amazing soundtrack. The op and ed songs are sung by the Lia and Aoi Tada, the same artists who sung the op and ed for angel beats and many other Key works. The translations to the every song in Charlotte portray the anime so well. Each track thrown into each scene matches perfectly, and Im surprised the songs made me tear up more than the actual anime. Jun Maeda, whatever you do, stick to making the soundtrack because you are a beast at it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7): This was a tough one to grade because i never really felt any attachment to any of the characters. I mist say that I felt a slightly better attachment to the two mains in this one than Angel Beats at least.\\n\r\nYuu Otosaka: Yuu is the main male lead of Charlotte, and is your typical highschool student. He has the power to possess any person for 5 seconds(although his real power is OP as F), and gets through his days by cheating. He was a total jackass in the beginning and I didn\u2019t care for him. But damn his character development XD Throughout the show, the amount of character development he goes through is tremendous, and at the end (or at least episode 12), the majority will have finally liked him. Spoiler: (Dude at least heal your brother XD)\\n\r\nNao Tomori: The main female lead, and another tough character to like. An almost mix between Kanade and Yurippe. I honestly really loved her character, not because of her personality, but her determination. Her love for her brother, and her reasoning for saving the users of special abilities were her strengths. Spoiler: (On episode 12 when she tells Yuu the only way to save the world is to loot everyones abilities. I found this task well like\u2026\u2026..wtf XD I don\u2019t know why she would force like the craziest thing on him. Her and the rest of the case barely supported Yuu along the way on Ep 13 as well? Ahh I dunno XD)\\n\r\nAyumi Otosaka: The little sister of the Yuu and well she is pretty freakin adorable. She loves to look at the stars, as well as make Omu Rice (with Pizza Sauce) for her brother. Spoiler: (really wish her character was better developed so I felt more of an emotion in episode 6 and 7).\\n\r\nYusa Nishimori: A side main character, and the band singer of How Low Hello(her songs are awesome btw!) I can\u2019t say much because she didn\u2019t have any big role in the story. If anything, she served as a comic relief with Takajou. Spoiler: (Her other half was a much more lovable character. I really wish when they did part ways, it was spread out more. All of the emotional scenes felt so rushed).\\n\r\nTakajou Joujirou: The second side main character. Sadly he has no backstory whatsoever, and I was really interested in his past. He is the comic relief punching bag, and has a major crush on Yusa. \\n\r\nAll the other characters I won\u2019t spoil. I feel like Key decided to develop just the main male, which worked to some degree. The main downfall was that when tragedy did strike the other characters, there was little attachment to them already, meaning little to no emotions were felt.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10): I must say that I really enjoyed this anime. Although the flaws were very noticeable, it didn't bother me too much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(10): Yes I am giving it a 10. Not because I am a big Key fanatic( which I am XD), but more because of just the messages being portrayed here. This anime has taught me that no matter how hard life is, I must keep trying. Hardships await each of us, just like Yuu and his struggles, yet if we push through them, then we will succeed in the end. Another great message I got from this was the simple promise to come back home. This reminds me of my future, I will have to leave my home for school in the future to try and achieve my dreams. But I will always come back home no matter what, because this is where my life started. Yuu made a promise, and he fulfilled that. \\n\r\nRarely nowadays do we get anime that aren\u2019t made for entertainment, but more for a message that the creators want portrayed to the audience. Just as Clannad emphasizes family, Little Busters with friendship, Angel Beats with life is short so live it to the fullest; Charlotte has successfully portrayed these new messages to me. Of course it has flaws, but when I look at the bigger picture, we are pretty damn lucky to have studio Key. \\n\r\nI am looking forward to Rewrite, the Charlotte Ova next year, and many more works to come! Thanks again Key for a great ride (and please make the next one at least 24 episodes :\u2019( )",

            "content": "To still be able to come up with an almost decent ending, given all the circumstances, is truly a testament to what Charlotte could have been if it only had at least one more cour of episodes to properly tell its story. \r\n(Big spoilers about the ending ahead, so avoid this review if you don't want them)\r\nI want to start with the things about Charlotte that I disliked and then conclude with the things that I actually liked. So here we go:\r\nStarting with the series pacing. It was downright horrible the entire time. People who watched Charlotte complain that the first 6 episodes were prettyslow. In all honesty, i don't really think they were that slow, since most of them were pretty eventful in their own way. It`s not that they were slow paced in itself, it's just that the time constraints demanded the episodes to be much more fast-paced than they were.\\n\r\nThe thing is, they ended up becoming waaaaaay too much of a burden on the rest since they had to finish it in 13 freaking episodes. So, here's the thing: if Maeda really knew that beforehand, then the pacing for the first 6 episodes and the \"monster of the week\" format is utterly nonsensical and unreasonable. \\n\\n\r\nBut my question is, did he really know he only had 13 episodes to work with from the very start?\\n\\n\r\nI don't know, i may be giving too much credit to Maeda, but i don't really think he planned the series to be this short. Rather, I can't bring myself to believe that. Perhaps i just find hard to believe Maeda actually hasn't learned shit since he wrote Angel Beats. Because Charlotte was even more rushed than Angel Beats and the pacing problems were 10x more serious in here.\\n\\n\r\nStill, it's not like all problems stem from the series lenght. While I do think it was the show's main flaw, I don't really think it was impossible for it to be at least a bit better than what it was if only they had managed to do things a bit differently, mainly by using the first 6 episodes in a better way. It would always feel quite rushed given how large the scope of the plot was, but at the very least some of this series blatant pacing issues would not be... well, as blatant and so in-your-face as they were. And hopefully an abomination like episode 11 would have never existed in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nSo, pacing issues aside, let's talk about mood swings. Suddenly switching from silly comedy to heavy drama every 2 minutes. That's Charlotte for you. Well, if i recall correctly, Angel Beats was a bit like that, too. And even though I dropped it very early, Little Busters was also like that. So I don't think it would be a stretch to say that this is part of Maeda's writing style, so at the end of the day you either like it or not. Personally, I think it worked as a bit of a double-edged sword in Charlotte. While there were some episodes where the mood swings happened more or less smoothly (episodes 8 and 10, for example), there were also episodes where it was an absolute disaster (episode 11, most noticeably), so it's naturally unavoidable that there were times when I couldn't help but feel disconnected with what the show wanted to make me feel in certain moments. There was also episode 7, where the drama felt mostly comedic, but in that case it was mostly the portrayal of Yuu's emo phase that made me laugh more than I should have.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, the rushed nature of the show obviously didn't allow side characters to get some proper development. And what little attention they got was mostly an afterthought, something that it was added here and there without much care or attention simply because there was just no time for more. Takajou remained a mistery the whole time and as likable as he was, he was also remarkably one-dimensional. He was the wingman/bro of the series, and that is all there is to his existence. No information about his past, zero character depth, literally nothing. \\n\r\nAs for Yusarin/Misa, well I suppose it worked out surprisingly fine. Even if her development was also rushed, most of the serious scenes where Misa appeared were actually meaningful. The resolution to her conflict was still truly touching and possibly one of the best things about this show. As for Yusa, there was just no time to give more depth to her character other than the \"genki idol who's kind to everyone\" persona. Likable but ultimately shallow and forgettable, like Takajou.\\n\r\nAs for Nao and Yuu, they got a lot more screentime than everyone else, so it's only natural that they also got more development. Their relationship was the driving force of the show after a certain point in the story, so the series success ended up being highly dependent of their chemistry and interactions. Maeda decided to throw a romantic subplot for the two main characters and so the romance became a key element in the series' overall enjoyment. Honestly, I think it could have been much better. But it also could have been much worse, as well. Once again, the main problem was how rushed everything seemed to be.\\n\\n\r\nSame with Yuu's brother and the scientists' plot. It was awfully rushed and there more holes in there than in a planet-sized swiss cheese. It all happened too fast, most logic got thrown out of the window and the end result is what you see in the last 4 episodes. It's like the show was aware that it was free falling deep into a giant black hole but even so, it still tried to grow some magical wings and bullshit their way out of the mess it was in.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hence the reason why we still got a happy ending, even if it was mostly thanks to a thousand deus ex machina plot devices. I think Maeda knew that if we didn't get a happy ending, the whole series would be even more of a waste than what it already was. I think it was a good decision, all things considered. A couple loose ends were tied thanks to it (Nao finally showing some emotion, Nao's brother getting better in this timeline and most importantly, Yuu getting rewarded after the unbelievably unfair task of having to save the world completely alone). To be honest, the promise Yuu made with Nao and with his brother was so maddeningly unreasonable and even outrageous that a part of me wanted Yuu to give in and say \"fuck everything and all those bitches who made me do this alone, imma be the king of the new world now that i am basically a God!\" even if that meant we wouldn't get an happy ending. Seriously, the whole thing was so stupid that I couldn't help feeling frustrated. Luckily for the protagonist, Maeda had other plans and didn't want the train to completely wreck so we got an happy ending where everything was forgiven and Yuu still got the Nao after conveniently losing his memories. Everyone is happy and all is right with the world. Well, other than the massive guilt Nao and his brother must feel after basically sending Yuu to a suicide mission, that is.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of good and happy things, the animation quality was pretty good and consistent the whole time. And that was certainly a good thing. The soundtrack was great. The episode with the Zhiend singer was good. The side characters were pretty likable. The SoL parts were much better than the serious parts. It also had that unpredictable/trainwreck quality to it from start to finish, and that was a good thing, too. Misa's backstory and the resolution to her conflict were pretty good. The story's premise had tremendous potential, despite 98% of it being completely wasted. Nao was cute. Yusarin was cute. Takajou was funny. The imouto was ok, I guess. All things considered, both Nao's and Yuu's development was somewhat consistent and mostly well done if you don't think too hard about it. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum things up, Charlotte was definitely enjoyable if you don't think too hard about it. The last minutes of the final episode were still touching if you don't think too hard about it. Happy endings are always good if you like the characters. And despite all its obvious flaws and while it's not a show I would openly recommend to other people, I still don't regret watching it at all, especially if I... well, don't think too hard about it and just enjoy it for what it is, without letting the bad things overshadow the good things. Which is not exactly an easy task, but hey, it can be done.",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**\r\nUpfront warning: Review contains decent amount of profanity. Read ahead on your own accord. \r\nIt just so happens that I was out of my house, descending into madness due to cold, wasting away hours of my life on things that aren't anime (BLASPHEMY!) and, as all of us, at one point I came back home, saw that the last episode of Charlotte was out and decided to check it out for shits and giggles. By episode 9 you already realize this is a major clusterfuck of raid-wipe proportions and you kind of stop giving a single bird for it. So, why amI writing this review? Uhm ... dunno, because I can? \\n\\n\r\nStory. Fuck this story. No, seriously, Fuck.This.Story. Here's a thing about storytelling: everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, can come up with AWESOME, SPECTACULAR, BALL-DROPPING ideas on the fly. Thing is, only 1% of them are able to make something off of it. Sadly, Charlotte falls in 99% category. The story has no direction - and by direction I mean it litearlly doesn't know what the fuck to do with itself so it just kinda starts throwing random things in your face expecting you to just go 'meh' and look the other way - from a small-scale, let's save a couple of people from this 'death machine' that is goverment, to a motherfucking 'SAVE THE WORLD' idea? Erm ... what? No. No. No.\\n\\n\r\nAll the aspiring writers out there, here's storytelling 1 'o 1 for you: the scale of your story should be set up immediately. Why? Because sudden outbursts of your egoistical personality where you make your character a fucking prophet destined to save the world don't work. And that's exactly what this anime did. Out of nowhere, literally 1 episode before the ending, they decided 'oh fk it, we have 2 more episodes let's just throw in random shit'. Don't get me wrong though; it's not the last 2 episodes that are the reason I gave the story of this show 1, it's just the overall damn thing. It has no purpose. The reason, the goal, was never set from the beginning. Instead you're strung along for what feels like filler after filler, with a bunch of \"OH IT BE SAD YOU MUST CRY HUR DUR\" moments. Foreshadowing, twists and any resemblence of actually good storytelling cannot be found in this clusterfuck. I don't know who wrote this thing, or who directed it, so I can't compare it to his/hers previous shows, but damn, if the supposed 'drama' moments are exactly the same, I better watch out. Drama? Does this guy even know what drama is? Say, your sister dies, right? It's obvious you're gonna go down the spiral of utter self-destruction while also harming others, 'cause, you know, it's the first thing that comes to mind. But, you know what you need to be saved from that whirling chaos? A single line from a cute girl. Yup. All the shrinks of the world, learn from this show. If your patient is about to kill himself, bring in a hot model and have her say 'You still have reasons to live' and bam, one more saved human on your record. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a bit serious for a moment, jumps from moods are so often and so ... unnatural that it's mind-crapping how terribly they were executed. You can have laughter and tears in the same episode, no one is saying you can't, but the transition between the two moods can't happen so abruptly that no viewer can understand why the fuck it happened. And that's my main problem with this show: lack of balance, both in characters and in story. Either they go full drama queen on us, or they're like \"oh no, this be funny show, no tears here man\". People can be depressed and happy at the same time, you guys know that, right? Anyway, if you're still not sure that the story is bad, answer me these questions: \\n\\n\r\n- How did the scientists figure out it was a meteorite that gave them powers? Who thought of that? How did they test it? \\n\r\n- How did the scientists learn about their powers in the first place? How long it took them to build the facility? \\n\r\n- Why does everyone in the show assume that the scientists are bad people? Because they do experiments on the out-of-the-norm kids? Yeah, it's a moral issue, but from the logical standpoint it makes complete sense. But no, story claims they're bad through and through and leaves no openning for dispute. \\n\r\n- During Yu's amnesia days (fuck me that's stupid), why did none of his abilities trigger on their own? We've seen that the emotional state can have a huge impact on casting certain powers out of your will, but is it just 1 power out of millions? And why just that one? And if not, why did no other ability activate? Like, if he'd just randomly ran into the wall, why didn't he fly through it? Amnesia doesn't explain it because he still had time travel ability by the time he had recovered it. \\n\r\nAnd so on ...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, moving away from the shitstorm that's story, let's look at the production. Art design is okay I guess. I mean, there's really nothing unique about the characters' designs, and no mind-stunningly-beautiful scenery, but it does its job well enough for you not to care. Animation, on the other hand, is crap. If I had to take a bet, I'd bet my entire livelyhood that whoever directed this has no fucking clue what makes action exciting. Yes, if you're going to have action in your crappy anime, at least make it so I don't feel like skipping each time it comes along. Outside of action, barely any decent animation occurs (outside of the teleport ability I guess, that was kinda cool) and you're just sitting there going 'meh' alongside the show. Sound department ... well, let me lay out this first: a lot of the composed songs were actually pretty good, some even bordering amazing. The problem? Say you have a sad song that should accompany sad scene, right? Key word being 'accompany'. But nop, creators of this thing just went fuck it again, and made the music be the main part. Even me, who's never directed shit in his life, knows that's a terrible thing to do. I don't care how good your songs are, if you use them terribly, I'll point it out. Voice actors are probably the best part of this anime, and that's saying a lot. Each gives good enough of a performance, but damn the VA of MC was kind of off-putting. I don't even know why. It just seemed like the voice and variations of such just didn't fit with this character. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of chracters ... aaaaaaaaaaah.  Does anyone have an bottle of acid? Or lithium? Or anything that could potentially kill me in large doses? Like MnM's? Characters are godawful. Characters are terrible. Characters are disgusting. And here's the catch: they all started out great, and turn into complete fuckups within 2 episode. How? Please tell, oh the mighty one, how the flying fuck do you even manage to do that? How do you take an interesting character with a truckload of potential and turn him into shit? Are you Jap version of M. Night? His long lost child perhaps? \\n\r\nAnyway, what's wrong with the characters? Everything. Everything is wrong with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOur MC, I think they call him Yu or something. Starts out great. Really interesting. And you think to yourself: damn, this guy could be fun to explore more. But nop, 15min later he's running away like a little bitch, crying and whimping for his mother's tit. And he gets even worse. Honestly, and I mean honestly, this dude is just flat out crazy. Yeah, if you're fanboying over this show you're going to say 'but hur dur he had hard life and hur dur it's understandable' ... no, just no. It's fine if he acts depressed, but goddamn it at least make his transition back believable. Don't make him act like a 15 year old girl on Xanax. \\n\\n\r\nRest of the cast doesn't matter, they're irrelevant. Yeah, they kinda matter for like 5 episodes and then it's like \"fuck them, hit dat thing Yu!\". They don't get any development. They don't have anything relevant for you to even give an inkling about them. They're your standard tropes of comedic relief, mysterious, love interest, full-on young sister (I'm just waiting for a day when young sisters are portrayed real-life like in anime; I bet about millions of dreams would be broken at that very day) and bunch of other shit that doesn't matter. Man, fuck the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, first like 3-4 episodes maybe were good enough to bump this score up to 4. Otherwise this show is a failure on every layer. I was even bored writing this review. No, seriously, if I had a mirror I'd probably look like Hawking but with looks instead of brains. That's how impressive this show is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, in essence, that's what the show really is: boring. Everything is boring: characters, story, dialogue, action, art - you name it. It's like no one put more than a flipping fuck of effort into making this thing. Well, aside from composers. Man I feel bad for them, like, I'm so sorry your pretty good scores were used so terribly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall? I exploded, and spread virus called boredrom. Now every teenager in the world will eternally be bored until they're of age. (by the fucking way, why does the virus just leave our body after high school or whatever? viruses don't just fucking leave; they either kill us, or we develop immunity system ... man, fuck this anime)",

            "content": "Charlotte is the typical kind of anime that starts off very unique, but then the second half of the anime slowly plunders to something very cheesy and typical. I was keeping a look on the rating as this anime aired and it did indeed go up until about episode 7, but then it started to slowly go down. \r\nStory - 9\r\nThe plot of Charlotte is the one thing that made the anime unique. A story about child-teen ability-wielders and their life. It was definitely interesting to watch what kind of ability would be discovered the next episode and how it would be used. Later on,however, it revealed that the story had many plotholes. It almost felt like the writers were focusing on pressuring the feelings of the viewers instead of explaining many missing things. At around that point Charlotte started to really go down.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nIf I was to give an example, I would say Charlotte has the highly upgraded Clannad art, or the style is similar to Glasslip. In any case it was quite gorgeous. The opening especially is one of my favorite openings because of how well-done the animation is. Sure at times the art seemed very simple, but at the same time it didn't really bother me too much. It still looked good and that's all that matters.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nOkay, now ZHIEND is like the best thing of this show. Everything else you could hear was good too, but ZHIEND. That group was also one of the good things about this show, I'm just sad they couldn't be mentioned a bit more near the end of the anime, but other than that I'm probably going to get some of their songs on my phone because they're just that stunning.\\n\r\nIn any case, the music was a key point for this anime. At the perfect times it would come in with the glorious melodies that made your feelings swoon, and that's the kind of thing you definitely need in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nTHIS is the point where the anime started to crumble down. (Here comes the ultimate rant) Now let's start from the beginning. At the start we have a cool character who seems like he doesn't listen to anyone, a typical Lelouch, but at the end he transformed into a very cheesy and I will dare say cowardly person. \" But Kitty, did you not see what he accomplished at the last episode and blah, blah. \" Yes, but was his accomplishment even satisfying enough? It was so rushed in the first place and his personality had already taken a huge turn before and then he suddenly finds himself the predicament he was in at the very end. It just seemed so cheesy and sad to ruin a character who had potential in the beginning.\\n\r\nNow for the girl. To be honest I did like her a bit, but I feel like the writers tried to focus on making her the 'potential love interest' that they ruined her personality along the way as well. Or they just abused her all the time (I see you episode 11). \\n\r\nHonestly this anime had one of the best characters ever, but some were quickly forgotten about and not even put in some episodes which ticked me off a bit. What's the point in 'Main characters' if you don't plan to show their side of the story or put them in just to 'make fans have feels and then forget about them'. So many amazing characters simply wasted.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nNow in total, did I enjoy this anime? Well, it was alright. In the end I can't say Charlotte was absolute garbage, but... It was close to the border of that, let's be honest. They just barely managed to 'save' it. \\n\r\nIt was very rushed. If for the first 6 episodes they took their sweet time then for the last few they rushed it faster than a cat running away from a dog. A second season to focus on the idea Yuu had at the end of episode 12 would have been much more favorable, but alas, I don't know how it all goes in the anime industry. These are just my thoughts.\\n",

            "content": "Oh Charlotte... You really know how to mess with my feelings towards you.\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nNow, before I get into any details, let me explain a few things. The concept behind the story of Charlotte is really good. Everything in this anime that is actually present is pure 10/10 material, and would have gotten a 10/10 in my eyes. The reason why I'm giving the story a low-ish score is because of the simple fact that there aren't enough episodes to execute Charlotte to it's true potential. No matter how you look at it, there is absolutely NO possible way to make Charlotte into what Ibelieve could have been one of the greatest stories of all time in just 13 20-MINUTE EPISODES! While watching episodes 1-8, I was convinced that Charlotte would turn out to be the best anime I've ever seen. But as soon as episode 9 finished, I grew worried. Even before the series was over, I knew that Charlotte was doomed. I knew that in the remaining 4 episodes, it wouldn't be possible to fit in this suddenly insanely heavy plot. And to make matters worse, Charlotte just kept introducing MORE and MORE and MORE plot points that even the creators had to have known would only be able to work out if it was a 24+ episode series.\\n\r\nBut in all honesty, like I said before, the material of the story was truly 10/10, so I can't give it too low of a score. It was exciting, emotional, and generally fun to watch, especially during the first 8 episodes, which are some of my favorite episodes of any anime I've ever seen so far. And I actually REALLY wish that, even though I'm 99.99% positive it will never happen, that Charlotte is re-made with more episodes, and therefore more exploration of the story's characters, world, and plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nDoes anything really need to be said? This anime is fucking beautiful to look at. Everything from the animation, to the color scheme, to the details, everything is astoundingly beautiful, particularly during the opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nAgain, nothing really needs to be said, but I'll say it anyway: this anime is fucking beautiful to listen to. The voice actors seem to have done an absolutely stellar job (aside from some of the \"engrish\" spoken by supposedly english-speaking characters, but that's the very least of my concerns). The soundtrack is incredible, the opening and closing themes sound absolutely AMAZING to the point that, when combined with the stunning art and animation of the themes, make you actually look forward to them throughout each episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nI loved the characters in this anime. Each and every one of them was a joy to get to know and to watch interact with each other. The only reason that I can't give them a 10/10 is because there wasn't enough time to flesh out and explore many of the characters. The only characters that were actually explored in detail were Yu (who's characterization was actually done perfectly. Bravo), Shunsuke (who didn't appear until near the end of the series), and Misa/Yusa (the most useless characters in the entire anime). We dabbled a little bit into the characters of  Nao and her brother, and Kumagami, but it still felt like there could have been so more to the characters in this anime. Especially Nao's older brother. I get that the whole subplot with him and ZHIEND was the key to unlocking Yu's memories of that \"alternate universe\", but I do wish that a little more would have been put into his character. \\n\r\nBut at the end of the day, it was a joy to watch these characters (from what we got to see of them). I'm going to stick by my position that Charlotte NEEDS to be re-made with more episodes to give more to both the story and the characters (but mainly the story).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Charlotte. Like I said, the story has all the making of a 10/10, it just needs more episodes to unlock just how incredible it has the potential to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.5/10 (But MAL won't let me give it an 8.5, so I'll have to go with an 8)\\n\r\nI definitely would recommend Charlotte, even though it has its ups and down. Charlotte's high points are some of the best work I've ever seen in anime, and its low points aren't even bad. Just disappointingly unexplored.",

            "content": "There was a lot this anime had to live up to being the spiritual successor of Angel Beats. Like Angel Beats, this anime has a rather interesting concept, but the characters and the story pacing really slow it down. \r\nLike always the Video Review is up on my channel, but here is written.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe concept of this anime is based on an alternative universe where a certain small percentage of children gain superhuman abilities upon reaching puberty. Now you would think having super powers is a good thing, when in actuality it\u2019s more of a disease. Because of these powers, there a people outthere in the world, who want to experiment on these kids with super powers, often causing the patient to lose their sanity. Knowing this, a group of other kids with super powers, also known as the student council of a school dedicated to those with abilities are on a mission to stop other kids from using their powers recklessly, so they won\u2019t get caught and be experimented on.\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime brings up and interesting concept, and puts it in realistic way. Because there is that element of being experimented on if you have unusual powers. However the story begins rather slow as it felt like more of a super power of the episode kind of thing, where each episode they try to stop a kid from using a new ability. However after episode 6, things get hectic and in a good way. After episode 6, the tone of the show goes towards a much heavier darker tone, and it sort of becomes a mystery and thriller. After we learn more about how abilities are passed on, and the past of the main character. However towards the end, the story starts making little sense and the ending is completely rushed and felt awkward. Literally the last episode could\u2019ve been a split up for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist is Yuu Otosaka, as for a first impression he came off as the biggest selfish douche in the universe. His power allows him to take control over someone\u2019s else body for 5 seconds. Using this ability he cheats on tests and becomes an honour student and fakes an accident to save a girl, who rejects him afterwards, but he had it coming. But after he is discovered by fellow ability wielders, he is forced to transfer school and they force him to join the student council in order to stop others from using their powers recklessly. Over the course of the series he learns to be more caring and selfless towards others. And we see him go through many phases, such as the douchebag, caring, insanity and many more, which is really incredible, because here is a character you initially dislike, then accept. Because of his interesting development, he literally carries the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main is Nao Tomori, who\u2019s power is to turn herself invisible, only to one person though. She is the student council president and is the leader of the group who sends them on tasks to stop the ability users. Now her character is quite a sharp, but her personality is very awkward and self-righteous, as she pretty much just likes to get straight to the point. She unfortunately has very little character development, because of her personality, she barely reacts to anything significant. The only time we get a slight development is towards the end when she starts opening up to people, but still her character served more of a driving force of Yuu, and her past is never really explained on how she has very little friends.\\n\\n\r\nAyumi Otosaka is Yuu\u2019s younger sister. She is the complete opposite of him portraying the energetic, pure and innocent type providing care for her brother and support by preparing his food. Her character starts off having relatively low impact on the plot, however towards the second half she starts playing a bigger role as a driving force for Yuu.\\n\\n\r\nThe other 2 mains, I wouldn\u2019t really call them mains and they were barely seen in the second half. Plus they felt really irrelevant to the story and that is, Jojiro Takajo, Yusa and Misa Kurobane. Now Jojiro ability is to let him move as super-fast speed, but he can\u2019t control where he stops. Yusa is an idol with a power that actually allows her to be possess by spirits, but she can\u2019t remember and using this ability her decease sister Misa possesses her and is the polar opposite of her idol personality. Now these characters main purpose are to provide entertain comic relief for us, and that\u2019s not really a good thing, because there a times when they can kill the mood of the show. Sure the characters are entertaining, but they provide very little with the overall plot and become irrelevant later on.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more characters that make and appearance in the second half of the anime and again some of them aren\u2019t really fleshed out, and is just there, for the sake of having more characters. However there are 2 other characters where we do learn interesting backstories, and they become more interesting than the majority of the mains.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 7/10, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is good, and the animation is smooth, but nothing really stands out as amazing. The only really noticeable is the way it uses its colours. As there is almost a different colour that lights up every time abilities are used. Probably the most notable is Misa\u2019s fire effects, which look rather nice for some reason, compared to almost everything else. One other highlight of the art is the lighting which really adds to mood and setting depending on the scene. And when the show gets dark, the lighting really adds to the atmosphere showing the contrast between of good and bad times.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, nothing against really stands out. There really is no original score that really blows me away. It\u2019s does it job, like how most ost does, but it\u2019s nothing special. There is a track in the anime where it\u2019s performed, however it loses its value, when the Engrish pops up. Even the song by Yusarin, that we get in the middle is nothing special, the instrumental part of it is great, but the vocals don\u2019t really fit it. If there is one thing that that the soundtrack does well is its opening and ending song. PA Works literally got the same artists who did Angel Beats OP and ED to do Charlotte.  The opening is really good at setting up for the upcoming episode, and its backed up by nice vocals. However the ending is what I loved the most. It\u2019s such a calming relaxing track, that makes you fill so at home after listening to it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Charlotte? At points yes, but for the majority of the time, it was hard taking anything in. What I mean is the show doesn\u2019t know how to set the tone, it frequently changes tones from comedy, to drama, to tragedy back to comedy. It doesn\u2019t keep consistent, so it\u2019s really hard to care for anything that\u2019s happening. The best parts would have to come during the dramatic parts, as those parts are the ones where the characters get most attention to story. The first few episodes were pretty slow and generics, as they felt very episodic as in the power of the week, but after episode 6 the drama kicks in that\u2019s when things become interesting, as it becomes more of mystery drama. I also like the fact that we got to see so many different side of the protagonist during this anime, as his development is actually rather entertaining, we start to hate him, but start to like him as well. However with that being said, this anime needed another second, rather than rushing the last episode which could\u2019ve been a new season. It was hard to take that last episode seriously enough with so many changes, which makes you not care in the end.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Charlotte gets a 7 from me. I quite liked the concept of the anime, but the execution wasn\u2019t great, the start was slow and the ending was rushed. But that middle part was the most interesting thing that happened in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound they both get a 7 from me. The animation is nothing new, it moves smoothly and there is nice colours to it, it doesn\u2019t do anything bad, but at the same time it doesn\u2019t do anything too special. The soundtrack is nothing special as well, with no original score that really stands out, and some of the vocal performances are hindered by the vocals itself. However the OP and ED, I thought were pretty good especially the ED which calms me down after every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get a 7. This anime did a really good job of having a really interesting protagonist, who went though many different phases and has a lot development. However it seems they put so much work into him, that they forgot about the other characters, because the other characters felt like they were lacking a lot, not to mention there were 2 mains who\u2019s purpose was pretty much for comic relief, which I think was kind of unneeded, don\u2019t get me wrong I loved them, but at times they would pop up at times which I thought were unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment I give it a 6. At times the anime will leave me on the edge of my sit waiting for what\u2019s going to happen next. However for the majority of the time, it left me without a care for the plot and characters, because the constant change in tones. The switching from comedy to drama was really distracting, and I couldn\u2019t take the anime too seriously towards the end. The middle was enjoyable, which was needed after the slow start.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score of Charlotte, I give it a 7/10. The anime has parts where it does really good and some parts where it falls below average. The concept is interesting, but the execution could\u2019ve been done way better. I recommend this anime to supernatural fans, and drama fans, but be weary of some of the odd instances of comedy. The production makes to anime to be successor of Angel Beats, but it\u2019s really not, compared the epicenes of Angel Beats.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free!\r\nSo I just binge watched Charlotte and I have just so many opinions that I need to talk about. I'm also a freshmen in highschool, so I may be of a different demographic than you.\r\nStarting with the art, I really enjoyed the effort put into the animation by P.A. Works. The artwork seemed extremely fluid and that's really great considering this anime is all about capturing people. The one thing I don't like about the art is the characters designs, the main character looked like the average anime protagonist of every anime, and the main character's friend reminded me of Kitamura from ToraDora! Otherwise,the artists drew cute girls (and this isn't because I'm a hormonal freshmen that I'm mentioning this, every anime needs cute girls), the scenery was amazing, and they really payed attention to the details of when characters would eat. So I feel like the anime deserved a 9 for art work.\\n\r\nNext, the sound, I really didn't pay attention to the sound, but from what I remember, the voice acting was stellar, though, I don't know japanese, I can still feel the emotions that the actors portrayed.\\n\r\nCharacter, though I came into this anime with me initially hating the main character, I ended up actually caring for him. The main character, Yu, was an obnoxious pretty boy, who didn't need to do anything for himself, but his character development seemed to be the best in the series. I wish I could go in depth but I don't want to spoil anything within the series, but Yu went from obnoxious to an actually tolerable character. Other than Yu, the only characters that showed development are Maya and Tomori.\\n\r\nThe story repulsed me for the first episode, I really didn't want to follow an obnoxious Light Yagami clone, but as you delve further within the story he grows to be a more respectable person rather than his past self. The whole plot of capturing people with incomplete powers made me think that it was going to be a slice of life anime of a student council, but as the series progresses I was proven completely wrong, the story actually shows more than just a slice of life because it actually has a plot. Near the end of the series there's actually a time travel arc, but the arc seemed really rushed and ended up putting off a lot of people who were really annoyed by it. I personally just went with the flow (watching it and not actually analyzing it), and I ended up enjoying it. I mean, I binge watched it so I could have been just too invested into the story.\\n\r\nLastly my enjoyment, 10, I went into this series expecting a super powered slice of life, but I actually was pulled in by the progression of the plot, thought it was rushed to end well, the series actually was able to make me feel for the characters and go through their rollercoaster. It may have just been my mindset of binge watching, but I actually was anxious for the 4 seconds between each episode that crunchyroll makes you wait between each episode. The anime left me feeling uneasy when characters were actually getting worse and worse for the characters. The series just kept me enjoying almost every moment that I watched. \\n\r\nSo overall I would give it an 8/10 because of its lackluster pacing, and its weird character design.\\n",

An interesting premise, nice plot twists, entertaining characters, and a great music ensemble, but the execution was too lacking compared the previous Key anime.\r\nEverything in this was too damn rushed. There's many incidents that weren't well explained, too many things been glossed over and certain characters making stupid choices to move the plot along. \r\nThere was one surprising good plot twist in the show, after which the episodes pick up in tempo and intensity. I was thinking it had the potential to fix the previous failings, but no. The creators decided to rushit yet again and jam everything into one or two episodes. If this was any other anime, it could of been enough material for one or two seasons at least. *sigh* Makes me think this could of been handled sooo better if this had more episodes or done in visual novel format.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway it's not as if this show wasn't entertaining or anything. It was still fun to watch. If it had been more polished and better thought out it could of something truly great. Oh yeah and hopefully next time Key can employ people who can speak accentless english like in their prev work! That terrible Japanese accent is just too distracting in serious scenes.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Another Anime by P.A. Works that had a lot of potential but sold itself short and played it safe.\r\nThe main problem I noticed about Charlotte was the same problem I noticed at the end of Angel Beats, For the first 7-8 episodes the progress of the anime is mostly irreverent to the story arc and they waited until the last 3-4 episodes to cram all the character development and important scenes together in a way that leaves no room for a smooth transition. I don't have a problem with the actual story concept but I believe that the biggest problem P.A. works has is thatit has poor delivery.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story was great in concept and if done over a longer period with more consistent (if any) character development it would have been much better. The few scenes that seemed like they were supposed to be meaningful gave no feeling because the scene felt forced and poorly timed. I think that the scenes may have been more meaningful if it wasn't for the bad character personalities, Nao being the most pertinent example. I won't spoil anything for those who STILL haven't seen it but considering the life that Nao Tomori has lived up until the main characters transfers into the school you would believe that she would have internal conflicts that she needs to resolve but instead she spends the ENTIRE series avoiding it and chooses to stay as the bland, emotionally deprived, ass that we all know and love. Speaking of love, let's not forget the awful romance bombshell that takes place out of nowhere and ends up being based off what was essentially a bet.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept for Charlotte was amazing and the ending would have been more heart wrenching if it wasn't totally forced, I love this anime for it's idea but hate it for it's delivery. Shame on you P.A. for taking another almost-finished masterpiece painting and topping it off with a bunch of splattered paint. Bravo.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6 sound 6 characters 3 blah blah.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nCharlotte is a bumbling pile of shit that does not know where to go for half of its runtime, then suddenly sprints at a breakneck speed towards a completely over-the-top and ridiculous ending. Its writing is a hackneyed and cliched joke; its characters are horrendous, its pacing mind-boggling, and its plot progression fucking hilarious, if nothing else. \r\nAs you may have guessed, the biggest problem with this anime is that for the first 6 episodes, it went absolutely fucking nowhere: it introduces its basic premise and characters in episode 1, then runs in place for the next 5 episodes, with each episode presenting a new\"problem\" that is always resolved by the end of the episode. Then, from episode 7 onwards, it rapidly pulls organizations, backstories, and institutions out of the fucking air and jams them all into what is already a hot mess of undeveloped and unlikable characters in a hackneyed \"scientists are evil\" setting.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more, Charlotte shoehorns gratuitous amounts of edgy violence into its plot to try and evoke cheap sympathy from the audience. It feels as if Charlotte is perfectly aware that it has written itself into a corner halfway into the story, and cannot get the audience to care for a character through any means other than brutally torturing him. Later, when this character dies, I think the show meant for that moment to be a tearjerking scene, but all it did was make me laugh at how retarded the show is for thinking that it I even care for a character (that the show has barely bothered developing) in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR Many characters. No development Overuse of \"scientists are evil\" trope. Asspulls galore. Gratuitous violence. Over-exposition. Incompetent pacing. Laughable plot. Cheap emotions. Bullshit ending. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nCharlotte is like a white hooker from Hollywood: it looks really good, but gives head like a grapefruit.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI really like the ED.\\n\\n\r\n\"Character\":\\n\r\nTopkek\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe ending is actually somewhat entertaining cuz it felt like the writer either ran out of ideas or fucks to give.

            "content": "WARNING: Review Contains Spoilers of the show. (won\u2019t reveal anything big like a character\u2019s death, but I will mention some plot twists in the show.)\r\nCharlotte is in my opinion a show that is not necessarily great, but isn\u2019t bad either. There are some things the show did great, but there are also many flaws. To give a short understand of the story, a meteor in the sky crashed into Earth and gives children special powers that won\u2019t develop until they reach teen age. So some of you might think that this is similar to X-men, copying the idea of having mysterious people with powers. Infact, the plot of this show is not something you would call \u201coriginal\u201d or unique, as we can also see a huge similarity between this show and Angel Beats (well they are both created by the same studio). However, I do think this show is a lot better than Angel Beats. Well we\u2019re not here to differentiate the two so let\u2019s move on.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did like in the show is that it kept me entertained throughout all 13 episodes because of some of the interesting elements in Charlotte such as  plot twists and plot confusion being added throughout the second half of the show; which is good in order to avoid the repetitive of events in the first half. They even added some time-travel to it similar to Steins;Gate and Madoka Magica, thus adding an interesting shift of tone to the stor . Although the concept of \u201ccontinuously going back in time to save someone you love\u201d had been used plenty of times in other shows, it\u2019s still great to see it in something like Charlotte where it is kind of necessary in order for the show to be somewhat unique.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the show is definitely episode 7 because this episode did a 180 degree on Otosuka\u2019s character and I can feel the despair out of him of losing someone you love most. His depressed state and his limitation of nutrition were presented brilliantly and somehow it was the most enjoyable episode for me. Seeing this different personality of someone you know can be unusual, but at the same time fun and it improved my overall experience of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nLast good thing about the show is the beautiful art style by P.A Works and Nao Tomori as a character, especially the student council room; it is probably the most nicely decorated room animated I\u2019ve seen so far. The characters themselves were also pleasant to look at, the best character design being Nao because I like her unique character\u2019s design with the white hair and a Lolita but not exactly body shape. Her personality is also unique as well and I had a hard time telling if she is either a Kuudere or a Tsundere. This proves that she is so unique that you can\u2019t even classify her as one of the \u201canime female tropes\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nWell I ran out of good things to talk about, so time to get to the critque (which is way longer). For me, there are several  problems with the show and the story. In the first few episodes, the show follow a more episodic slice of life compared to what happens later on. Every time, the four main characters (watch the show to know who they are) would complete the mission by the end of the episode and a new one will be given to them the next one. The show basically repeats itself like this until around episode 7; it makes the show incredibly repetitive and feels like it doesn\u2019t progress the plot or develop the characters at all. Additionally, the show tries to force some contrived emotional moments that doesn\u2019t really affect me because they tends to introduce a character and kill it off on the same episode. A good example of this would be Misa from episode 4. She is a character that wasn\u2019t even introduced in the beginning but at the MIDDLE. With only 12 minutes of screen time, no wonder why I didn\u2019t gave a shit when she died. So yea, the first 6 episodes can be kind of boring, especially comparing to other anime, but it is not necessarily \u201cboring\u201d as a media in general.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is that the contrived plot twists and the immense amount of plot complexity also hinders the experience for me. Everything after episode 9 felt like a coincidence with no previous hints or mention of the event and there was a lack of  build up into meeting someone important like Yu\u2019s brother. He kind of just appeared out of nowhere and said: \u201chey I\u2019m supposed to be the brother that Yu never mentions before, but since I\u2019m here now and I can also time travel, therefore you should care about me.\u201d. As I said earlier, the time travel part did add an extra kick to the show, but it\u2019s not the best they can do because it\u2019s too fast paced. Same as other parts of the second half of the show where many events happened way too quickly for me to grasp on to the show and care about it much. And now I ran out of bad things to say, so I guess I will conclude this review.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is an anime that started off as a rather generic show, it is a slice-of-life of 4 high school students saving other people lives. The highlight of the show is definitely the shift of tone at episode 6 and 7; also the mass revelation of the origins behind the \u201cspecial power\u201d. Although the later of the show did get more dark and dramatic, the pacing could\u2019ve been better and the story should\u2019ve been less contrived and sudden. Despite my review being filled with criticisms, I personally enjoyed Charlotte quite a bit and at the end, anime is all about having fun while watching it. So, I will be giving the show a score of 7/10 and would recommend this show if you\u2019re interested in an anime with intriguing plot twists and shock values or want something similar to Angel Beats.",

            "content": "Spoiler free review!\r\n-------------------------------\r\nCharlotte is a beautiful anime. It\u2019s one of those that stuns you with visuals, yet lets you down story-wise. This slightly dramatic comedy is something you\u2019ll want to watch more for visuals and characters rather than for what\u2019s happening.\r\nThe story is the most lacking feature. It starts off good with a lot of promise, but in the end it lets you down, throwing together elements that make little sense and leaving you confused. The premise of having these imperfect superpowers that they have isn\u2019t unique, but it is still an interesting concept to see play out. If the creators decided to take outthe last half of the anime and simply leave the fillers, it might have been one of the best out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe short story fillers are the most impressive features of this anime. They are typically condensed to 1 episode each and give a lot of character background. These stories are what give viewers hope for the series, but it sadly doesn\u2019t follow afterwards when the real story kicks off.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well crafted, something lacking in Angel Beats, the studios previous animation. Yuu Otosaka is the main character and your typical cheat; with his power he can take over anybody within his sight, making it easy for him to get through life. Well, until he meets Nao Tomori, who's been following him! With her camera she discovers his ability and tells him to come to their school for people with these powers. Later on they meet Yusa Nishimori, one of my personal favourites. Her story is the most intriguing of all, involving a lot of drama and entertainment, as she\u2019s a singer. However her power is the most interesting, because she doesn\u2019t even know she has it!\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are absolutely beautiful. If a viewer ever wanted to find peak visuals in an episodic anime, this would be the one to watch. Much of it is moe art style with great attention and detail to the setting. Everything has had massive attention and the creators worked hard to make this one of the best looking animes out there, even by today\u2019s standards. Hell, even the cover looks better than most stuff out there now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s not a terrible anime, it just has its shortcomings story-wise. The creators improved on characters since Angel Beats, and made one of the greatest looking animes out there. This is definitely one you don\u2019t want to pass up on watching!\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: A dramatic comedy that falls short story-wise, but makes up for it in visuals, sound, and interesting characters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a very nice, supernatural themed anime, many think it's another generic supernatural anime with no mixed up story, but that, to me is wrong. So sorry if a spoilers slip out, it's hard not to with this type of anime. \r\nHere are my ratings:\r\nStory: 9- This anime has a very unique story to it, if it was a little bit more not chopped up I would give it a solid 10. This anime is emotional, love, death, blood, depression, this anime has a equal amount of it, now since it's only 12 episodes I couldn't really dig my teeth into it butya know, that's how it works, leaves you wanting more, the way I like it.\\n\r\nArt: 8- This anime has some really good animation and details, deserts, to cities, to buildings, building destruction feels like it's actually happening, I love it, the characters move so smooth, I really like the art and animations.\\n\r\nSound: 7- I liked the sound the characters had, especially the main character (yu) had a very special voice Iv'e never heard, because mostly all animes, every girl has the same, kawaii hi-pitched voice, and the male the slightly high pitched voice as well, but these characters don't have that, these voices are unique that Iv'e never heard.\\n\r\nCharacter: 10- I think all the characters have a nice personality and story behind them, I really think the makers put lots and lots of time into making them.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9- I had fun watching this throughout the day, I really like the story and enjoyment this anime has, suspenseful and nail biting!\\n\r\nOverall: 8- this isn't my favorite no, but it's by far not the least favorite, I mean if I'm writing a review for it it means it holds a special place in my heart so ya know.\\n\r\nIf you liked this anime I strongly recommend:\\n\r\n*High School Fleet\\n\r\n*Hibike! Euphonium Season 2 or 1 \\n\r\nBoth have good stories and such. ^~^",

            "content": "A high school for children which powers...\r\nSounds like the most generic, overdone premise ever, right? This anime nails it, almost getting a perfect score from me.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe thing is, most of the shows with a similair premise focus on fights between overpowered characters. This show changes it up completely, definitely for the better if you ask me. All the abilities in this show are far from perfect and the story focusses on our main cast trying to safe ability-users from the police and scientists that would love to use these children for their (life-destroying) research. The story is really well written for the most part,often leaving you being happy but it also has it well executed dramatic scenes. Unfortunely the writing drops a lot in episodes 11 and 12, and i really hated these episodes. I still think the 8/10 is fair though because the show recovered in the final episodes, which was, although very rushed, still really nice in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like the art style, and i couldn't find any bad quality animation. The animation doesn't stand out enough for a 10/10 though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I think the voice acting for every single character was spot on. I can't find a single mistake in voice acting except for the 'engrish'. But I really liked that, cause it was hilarious :). Furthermore the opening was really unique and nice and the ending is one of my all time favourites. Last but not least, the soundtrack was really good and especially the sad pieces really resonated with me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOn to my favourite point of this anime: It's characters. Our main character has his 'asshole' moments and he has his nice side. I don't really know which side I prefered to be honest, but i really liked them both. The only problem with him is that he switched between the two unrealisticly fast from time to time. The main heroine, Tomori, is not only my favourite character in this show but one of my all time favourite characters, too. An S-class waifu and an amazing character for this show! All of the other important characters where really good too and I even loved most minor characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nExcept for episodes 11 and 12, I absolutely loved every second of this anime! It was really refreshing, because I hate pretty much all the shows with a similair premise, that focus on generic fights. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9(9,2)/10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to everyone that wants more than just action-shows!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Rushed and wasted potential, that is Charlotte in a nutshell. You might be thinking what do you mean by \"wasted potential\" well i mean that they literally wasted serveral episodes. Basically nothing happens in the first half of the anime. The only thing of some importance that happens in those episodes is Tomori's backstory. Thats it! You might as well skip all those episodes.\r\nI mentioned that the show was rushed and i mean it. Almost every conflict in this entire show is solved in just one episode. If you watch episode 7 you will definetely understand what i am trying to say here.\r\nNow wikipedia statesthat Jun Maeda (the creator of this anime along with, Angel Beats, Kanon, Clannad and many others) \"narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel Beats\" Well i can tell you that is complete utter bullshit! It was true in the first half of the show but not in the second half were they just kept introducing new characters. Doesn't Jun learn from his mistakes?\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem with this show is the story. The story is all over the place! In fact there is no real story, Charlotte feels more like a supernatrual slice of life anime. There are smaller stories here and there but they aren't really connected. It is basically just messy and it really frustrated me.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said Charlotte does have some redeeming qualities. For instance i loved how the MC changed. He went from being a total asshole to becoming a caring and loving person. Another good thing about this show is Nao Tomori. She is a really interesting and cool character. The great thing about her is that she has so many different sides to her. In one moment she is acting like a little girl and in another moment she is acting like a complete psychopath. I honestly really loved her character and it was also really heartwarming to see how she started opening up to the MC as more time passed.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the music in Charlotte was really good and the more i listened to the OP song the more i liked it. I also liked the fact that they paid attention to details, I don't think i saw a faceless person in the backround even once in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo whats the conclusion? While Charlotte isn't a bad anime it is certainly not a good one. This is a shame since it could have been Angel Beats 2.0. If you are a huuuuuuge fan of Key or Jun Maeda then i suggest you check it out. However if you are unfamiliar with Key and Jun Maeda then i recommend that you watch something else.",

            "content": "This review contains slight spoilers, but I'm not going deep in the plot itself. \r\nSo I was glad to see Charlotte had appeared on Netflix, I had it on my plan to watch list and I had heard it was very similar to Angel Beats, a show that I really enjoyed. To start things, premise was interesting, main character who did seem to have that Yagami Light like evil genius streak going on. Art looked good, nothing special but pleasant in my eyes. OP was good and ED was awesome. Strong average score of 7.9 on MAL. This must be a good anime, right? \r\nTheshow started rather strong in my opinion, as it's only a 13 episode one, it didn't spend too long with build up, just kicked things going right away, which suited me. First 5 or 6 episodes were rather enjoyable slice of life comedy, characters and humor weren't as good as Angel Beats's for example, but I had a feeling that the show was going to end up being a good one. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc, of tragedy and redemption that takes 2 episodes felt kinda rushed, but was still understandable, and didn't bother me with a sudden tone shift too much. But then, the main plot started to reveal. \\n\\n\r\nThe main plot, starting in episode 9 adds in time travel, dementia, under ground facilities filled with evil scientist and terrorists is the point where this far a decent show starts to go downhill incredibly fast. So much total nonsense is happening in these last 5 episodes that I don't even know where to begin. With incredible plot holes, plot conveniences, edginess and an totally out of place rushed romance pack this sequence so full of shit it manages to beat what some other garbage shows are able to fit in an arc of full 24 episodes.   \\n\\n\r\nA sudden tone shift, and out of place edginess were a problem for me when watching Angel Beats, causing me to only like it, instead of loving it. But Charlotte takes these aspects of a whole another level, and that isn't even the worst of it. \\n\\n\r\nI was totally overwhelmed by the amount of stupidity this second half provided, and I was honestly getting numb with how bad every moment I watched was. By the final episode, I was sure I was watching a parody of some sort, but apparently that isn't the case. This show is supposed to be taken seriously? \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning, I stated I enjoyed the first half of the show. Some light school life drama comedy with a developing romance with generic, but still adequate characters and a dash of sci-fi would have been an OK show to watch with not too much thought. But the mess that was main plot, sudden tone shift, some of the worst type of tries to be overly edgy, gaping plot holes and absurdly horrid pacing in the second half left a total taste of shit after the show ended.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter this nonsense, it doesn't really matter that half of the show was enjoyable, that would have deserved at least a score of a strong 5. The second half screws up so incredibly bad it just blows away all the redeeming qualities the show had. \\n\\n\r\nThis is clearly a 1/10 show on my scale, and out of 100+ animes I have watched one of the worst ones yet, and I have seen quite a bit of shit shows already. \\n\\n\r\nIf one cant turn off their brain completely, or has even a slight bit of critical sense towards shows/movies, I really cant see them being able to enjoy this crap.",

After that episode I got extremely impatient and somehow with a very heavy heart finished the rest of the show. ALSO there were a lot of unanswered questions and no explanation anywhere. Annoying. Also the main character was an idiot. Extremely extremely hated to watch whatever he was doing later on in the show.I'm not saying main characters should be PERFECT. But come on! Anyways, this is just my opinion. There are people I know that really liked the show. Honestly, in the beginning I did too. But the way things ended. Just awful. I need time to recover...\\n\\n",

It fits  \r\na lot of genres and creates a well balanced overall story. The characters are lovable andyou'll get immediately attached to them.

I watched the first episode as a test to see if it is worth watching and after completing 1 episode, I got myself into it and could not quit watching it.\r\n I have not seen any other anime like this one. They concept and plot was great and story was also pretty nice. However, I don't think that the ending was meant to be like that and it could have been a lot better than this. The characters in this anime totally correspond to the superpowers theygave them. Specially, the character of Yusarin and her multiple personality disorder was so accurate it could not have been any better. If you want a supernatural genre anime with a highschool twist and no ecchi stuff, I totally recommend you to watch this..",

            "content": "I' ll try to keep the spoiler at minimum in this review but I cannot make a proper review without revealing some details so be warned.\r\nFirst, a word to the man behind this anime...\r\nWhy Maeda? You said you learned from the Angel Beats semi-fail and you won\u2019t make the same mistakes again! Yet, not only you made the same mistakes all over again but this time it\u2019s even worse, this anime is such a mess that it will be hard to find some good points to talk about.\r\nSo let\u2019s procced:\r\nStory: 5/10  \u2013 When I first read the plot synopsis for this one I thoughtit was kind of mehh but then again I said...people with superpowers...ok, not my cup of tea but this has big potential for deep characterization of each character, it will be interesting to see how their powers affects them on physical and psychological level, to see if the power will corrupt them or not, to see how responsable they are with their powers, on what purpose they will use it and all that stuff that can create good character development and maybe a good drama. This is what I expected. What I\u2019ve got it was an entire other business.\\n\r\nI  find myself forced to say the same things I said on AB! review (a sign that Maeda screw up again). He tried again to tackle a cross-genre story and failed without a doubt. The story is a complete mess and all over the place from the start to the end, with a clear lack of direction. Two full seasons worth of content (you can see clearly that ep. 11 and 13 could have been expanded easily to an entire season) is compressed in a half season format which resulted in a rushed storytelling filled with plot holes, alot of unanswered questions and almost no character development. The first 6 episodes are filled with random or side-stories which are meant to give us some background on characters, making us empathize with them and prepare us for the drama that kicks in later but unfortunately it adds so little to the story that it make it seems like Maeda didn\u2019t care about Chekhov's Gun principle at all. Although the drama kicks in after episode 6 and things get on a very serious note, not matter how you look at it, it dosen\u2019t blend well with the action/fantasy element of this anime and all comes out very flat. On a side note, what\u2019s with all the gore and violence present in Key\u2019s latest two productions ? It\u2019s so diferent from all their works until and not in a good way.\\n\r\n If you are still looking for that lost magic that Key\u2019s anime used to have you\u2019ll find a tiny fragment in episode 12. I\u2019m refering to Misa/ Yusa scenes. This is the goldfish JM had in his hands and let it slip through his fingers. If only Misa would have been the main heroine and this whole story would had been about her, her sister and her \u201emoving on\u201d instead. It would have been exactly in Key\u2019s area of expertise, good drama with a tiny bit of supernatural elements.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10 - The first episode gave me the impression that finally we\u2019re gonna have strong male character lead in the person of Otosaka Yuu and we\u2019ll get to see how the power will corrupt him and if he manage to reedem himself in the end.. Unfortunately, starting with the end of the first episode, all hope was gone as he, gradually, by each episode, becomes the clich\u00e9 MC, we all are used to see. In episode 13 we see a failed attempt to that deep characterization I was talking about previously but by then it\u2019s kind of useless. As for Nao Tomori, she has quite an unique personality, which we rarely get to see in a Key anime. The problem is her character is so little explored and so little fleshed out, making it hard to empathize with her to the fact that in some episodes she could\u2019ve been literally replaced with a punching bag without us noticing the difference.\\n\r\nThe others characters are so undimensional that\u2019s now even worth talking about them. Don\u2019t even get me started about the annoying imouto. In essence , poor character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8.5/10 - Except from some animation inconsistencies between episodes, PA Works did a solid job on this one and maybe this is the strongest point of this anime.\\n\r\nOn the other note, I know that this it\u2019s not really studio\u2019s fault but it\u2019s a fact that Key\u2019s anime lost some of their magic since the departure from Kyoto Animation so now I\u2019m sure that the art style PA Works use, don\u2019t work that well with Key\u2019s anime.\\n\\n\r\nAudio: 8/10 - Decent sound work but nothing that stands out much. The Bravely You OP theme is yet again singed by Lia and it fits the overall theme but it\u2019s not on even close to the same level as My Soul, Your Beats from Angel Beats or the epic Toki Wo Kizamu Uta from Clannad AS. The ED theme - Yake Ochinai Tsubasa singed by Aoi Tada, it\u2019s a beautiful song but easy forgettable. As for the voices, I liked Ayane Sakura as Nao voice and  Maaya Uchida does a pretty good job being voice for both Misa and Yusa. Almost forgot, Insert song from ep 13 - Kimi no Moji singed by Anri Kumaki it\u2019s worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 - Not really enjoyed watching this. It was kind of sad watching Maeda failing again, especially after he promised to correct the mistakes he made with Angel Beats! and he kinda promised to gives us an anime more focused around it\u2019s characters. If you are a Key fan you\u2019ll probably watch this anyway so it\u2019s useless to warn you, but if you are new to Key\u2019s productions please go watch some of the older works first or if you really want to appreciate more the older ones and have the time, watch this first!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Charlotte leaves the impression of an anime that suffers from an identity crisis. It doesn\u2019 know what it wants to be and because of that it goes nowhere. I think Maeda should\u2019ve stick to what he does best \u2013 80% drama, 20% supernatural  and let the action/fantasy genre for people who know what they are doing. He tried and kinda fail with Angel Beats! and he totally failed with this one. I\u2019m disappointed but don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ll gladly wait for his next title. I know he can do better!\\n",

            "content": "\"By the way, who are you? I am...Your lover.\"\r\n(This is my first review... Don't judge.)\r\nActual Rating : 8.5\r\nI have been anticipating this anime since it was first announced. I loved Angel Beats and I had hoped that Charlotte would be able to provide me the same amount of 'feels' that Angel Beats did. It sort of did, it didn't make me cry as much, but I still liked it, even though it wasn't as good.\r\nStory (6) :  \r\nCharlotte may be your typical high school superpower, but it has something else to it. When you watch it, it may seem like a lighthearted slice oflife anime, (if you don't count the fact that they have powers.) How light it may seem, this anime has some dark moments. Where the main protagonist, Yuu Otosaka goes through some depressing moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending itself is pretty straight forward, but touching at the same time. I wish the plot of the anime had more originality to it, but I can't complain since there aren't many original ideas out there. \\n\\n\r\nI admit, that this anime had A LOT of potential if the plot was used well. The story started slowly at first and even funny at times, I was waiting for the anime to make me feel the feels. (Since it was created by Key, where their anime are famous for making the viewers cry. Like Angel Beats did.) It didn't really hit me, but halfway throughout the series the pace of the anime quickened a lot. It felt really rushed, which was this anime's main weakness. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9) : \\n\r\nThis anime can be very pretty at times, very pretty. The colors are quite vivid. The stars in this anime looked very real and added a unique touch to it. In the end, I really liked how the OP was animated, and I thought that the animations for the OP suited the anime very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8) : I\\n\r\n really liked the OP, maybe it was because it was created by Lia, who also created more of Key's OPs. Or maybe it was the animations that were paired up with the OP. Or maybe it was because it reminded me of Angel Beats. *Sobs* The OSTs didn't really pop up to me in any way but it suited the anime quite well at times. \"Bravely You\" might just be my favorite opening of this season, (if you don't count the fact that Gangsta's OP made me dance each time.)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was fine, but it felt annoying at times. Ayumi and Yusa's voice acting can be high pitched and a little annoying, very annoying. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6.5) : \\n\r\nThere isn't much to the characters. For the protagonist, we have any high schooler that is too overpowered for his own good. Though I liked that Yuu had his limits, unlike most overpowered protagonist out there. It was nice to see the protagonist's breaking point. His character development wasn't the best out there but not quite the worst. He started off as a typical high schooler that cheats and is obsessed with the \"madonna\" of his school. He then ends up as this okay protagonist that you don't mind cheering on.\\n\\n\r\n I also really like Tomori, she's sarcastic, snarky funny and caring at times. She is definitely my favourite character of this anime. Especially when Yuu was depressed for a moment. it made me tear up a little when I saw how much she cared for Yuu and friends. YUU AND TOMORI FTW.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.5) : \\n\r\nI really really liked watching this anime. It made me laugh, it made me cringe, it made me smile, it made me cry. After watching this I wanted more. I needed the speacial now, which is coming out March 26, next year. I need more anime like these, funny, light hearted anime with a little more hidden inside.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.5) : \\n\r\nI can't say I'm disapointed, after staying up till the wee times of the morning a few times just to watch the new episode. This anime disapointed me a little, maybe it was because I set my hopes to high. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime really reminded me of Angel Beats, a lot. Maybe it was because both anime were made by Jun Maeda. The plot was quite similar, but I didn't cry as much in this one. It really warmed me up seeing Kanade during the anime, it might have been months since I rewatched Angel Beats but I still haven't gotten over it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this anime, I am certain that I need to rewatch Angel Beats, again. I would definetly recommend this anime who need a little feel trip or who liked Angel Beats. But don't say I didn't warn you if you feel a little disapointed comparining it to Angel Beats. I should stop comparing this anime. If you need a something light, funny and sad anime, this is the anime for you. \\n",

            "content": "Great premises, outstanding background story, terrific artstyle, top-tier sponsorship\r\nMediocre execution\r\nBut this anime worth a 'Very Good' kind of point\r\nJust because it doesn't meet its expectation doesn't mean it is bad, i myself found this anime worth consuming\r\nThis anime to begin with, has quite a good Opening song. Not one that's 'not worth the skipping' but one that s 'not bad, i'll download it later and hear it when it shuffles'.\r\nAnd the story of this anime is, if treated carefully, quite good.\r\nYuu Otosaka, An abnormal highschooler with his power to control others mind for 5 second, which gave him all advantages to become popular. Handsome isa plus tho. For minus, sis-con.\\n\r\nHe then being observed by a group of his 'same beings' that goes to another school, one that is suited for young guys like him.\\n\r\nAnd the student's prez that's observing him? A cute, mini-sized pale girl with ability to become invisible from her target's sight. And together (along with 2 other) they try to find out what exactly happened to them, why, and what organization that's going after them.\\n\r\nSounds promising right? clear goals, amusing supernatural power with quite well distributed power.\\n\r\nBut this kind of anime should take longer airing time. Because it's so hasty in story development and too small time to see the character's development. Therefore we can quite follow the story, but not exactly with the characters. But as long as you just enjoy it, this anime is savory and good to watch.\\n\r\nThe characters, on the other hand, is never a good aspect. Typical Male MC you can almost find anywhere(insensitive, plot-driven developmental with little amount of witty sense and great amount of cool-ish kind) and the female MC that's not being his 180degrees different subject but instead, almost a perfect copy. The supporting casts is actually a good addition to the gang, but their screen time doesn't collaborate so it's a big minus in character department. The seiyuu, which is quite an all-star cast, does their job well tho, despite the lacks of verbal story development.\\n\r\nThe artstyle is one to praise. Great graphic works, good attention to small details. Art speaking, they don't lack too much, 9/10.\\n\r\nThe etc part is not so good tho. The humor is tacky, the in-anime(manga MC been reading, game being played, current idol culture, etc) facility doesnt get representated well. and the fanservice, eventhough not expecting so many, is too little.\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a Very Good one, worth to watch, and worth to be fan-ed to. But it's not a 'FUCKING WATCH IT DUUUDE, IT'S SOOOOO GREAAT!' type. Just classic 'you might find this into your liking' type.\\n\\n\r\na wobbly,if not solid 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Worth to watch, but less the expectation you build before watching it.",

            "content": "One of the best examples of why you should never rush a story.\r\nWhen I first saw the cover for Charlotte I thought it was just another slice of life anime with the typical high school setup. However, the synopsis intrigued me and I decided watch it as the episodes released. \r\nThe art and sound is very well done and the anime seems have a high productions value. The character design on the other hand seems a bit bland as the biggest differences between the characters is their hair color and style which unfortunately is rather common from slice of life. \r\nBut you should not andI repeat should not expect this to be another slice of life anime as you can also see from genres it is everything but that. The story starts off great but over the lenegth it becomes rushed. I think it could have easily have spaned over 25 episodes instead 13. The ending is kind of mixed of both good and bad which sadly makes it rather bland. Yet it had so much potential as it could have been up there besides some of the best anime have to offer. But for what it is the story is still good. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is very interesting as the creators takes a rather unique approach. The MC's development over the course of the story is also intriguing but it suffers from same flaw that the story suffers from. The supporting cast feels very underdeveloped and because it is so rushed it is hard to relate to any of them.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy Charlotte a lot but I do feel unsatisfied because of the rushed plot and the somewhat underdeveloped characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall while Charlotte is rushed it is still one the better animes. It's just disappointing that it could have been so much more given more time and better development.\\n",

            "content": "The two studios responsible for Angel Beats have once again teamed up to create the next great baseball anime, this time sure that they will able to avoid the same issues with pacing that plagued their first collaboration, what could go wrong?\r\n\tThe most praiseworthy part of Charlotte has to be its premise, as it is offers a unique approach on the superhero genre where every power has a very apparent flaw. The premise sets up an approach that allows us to laugh at some the ridiculous powers and their readily apparent flaws, but also opens up the door for the feels that we all loveso much as those with powers have to face the reality where they are treated as a useful anomaly. \\n\r\n\tNow onto the characters, which for me felt fairly undeveloped except for the main female lead, which is a real shame, as the main male lead Yuu is introduced in the first episode as a much more deep character, but towards the end of the series it seems as if he has been changed to some everyday nice guy devoid of any personality, a stark contrast to his introduction. Besides Yuu\u2019s sister, the \u201ctwo\u201d other characters of the show are plagued by some otaku jokes that stop being funny the first time they\u2019re uttered, and lack of any development. The other character Yusa, doesn\u2019t do much but provide some the musical content similar to Girls Dead Monster, and honestly doesn\u2019t do much but provide some humorous moments due to her status as an idol. Basically all she accomplishes is to provide the story of another character, who is much more interesting than she and seems to dominate the duo. Tomori is easily the most developed on the show, and provides some of the funniest laughs due to her blunt personality. But wouldn\u2019t you know it there\u2019s a lot more to her than initially appears, and the narrative relentlessly points out how well Yuu and Tomori would work as a \u201ccouple\u201d, needlessly holding the hand of the viewer. \\n\r\n\tAs I already touched on the initial plot of the narrative is really interesting, and I felt that the first episode was executed very well, but unfortunately this show has a tad bit of a pacing problem. After the first episode it instantly jumps into a school setting, which offers some really great humor, but lacks in almost all forms of plot development. Essentially the first few episodes are monster of the week segments, which is way too much time to be spending in a 13 episode series. There episodes aren\u2019t awful, in fact I found them to be very humorous and provide an enjoyable school setting, while still being able to fit in some serious epitomes of what happens to those with powers. However, after a few episodes I felt I had to remind the creators that they kind of have this really interesting plot and lore they created that they should get to. Then all of a sudden the pace picks up toward the middle of its run and things start changing, offering an episode showing some of the inner emotions and the downfall of our main character, which is a nice change of pace, but almost immediately after all of this is immediately negated, and then the plot starts to get a little wonky. I felt that the latter half of the series really offered some insight into what was going on in a world of super powered children, but the plot device used to do so\u2026 has its limits, and is very tricky to execute properly. I presume this is the point that will make or break how much enjoyment you derive from this anime, as it opens up a whole new can of worms that seem promising, but still results in a lackluster ending. The pacing of the last episode is honestly on the next level of bad pacing, and had my scratching my head of why this was how it ended, the whole thing felt forced and really did not do the series justice.\\n\r\n\tAll in all Charlotte is tough to recommend, as it has a really fantastic premise and is able to offer some great humorous moment\u2019s as well serious ones. The series fails to deliver them in a timely manner as the pacing of the show is quite bad, with both the funny and the sad sandwiched far too closely together with a plot that takes the series in a new direction, but opens up several pitfalls and confusion. Charlotte is a show that ends with a lot of promise, but its execution leaves a lot to be desired, so it is best to proceed with these things in mind.\\n\\n",

I have seen some really big s**t and this is not one of them. oh and a bit of a spoiler alert.\r\n      Story 7/10: The story had it's ups and downs. It started really good and the whole power thing was presented in an interesting way, but then they messed with death a bit which I liked because I am a bad person and I enjoy it when unnecessary characters die, and then they undid that which I found extremely annoying! But apart from that itwas nice, it wasn't very unique but it wasn't the type that you could tell what was going to happen the next minute either. It was an enjoyable plot that had me waiting eagerly for the next episode.\\n\r\n      Art 7/10: a usual good art nothing special nothing particularly wrong with it.\\n\r\n     Character 6/10: there were interesting characters like the student council president and there were boring ones like the little sister. There wasn't really a VERY interesting character throughout the series although I REALLY REALLY liked Yu at the last episode where he was playing with madness it was nice.\\n\r\n      Overall it was a good anime that I would definitely recommend!",

            "content": "Sigh.\r\nCharlotte is a good anime...up until around episode 7 or so. 8-13 however just ruined my love for this anime.\r\nIf we base it off the first seven episodes, the main 4.5 characters(if you watch the anime you'd understand the half lol) are realty interesting. Yuu is our central character and he gives you a definite Lelouch from Code Geass feel(and even Light/Kira feels from Death Note). Unfortunately, that pretty much goes away after the 1st episode and he more or less becomes the sarcastic guy who is annoyed by his new team. Nao is the sassy leader who is always ready to kick butt. Takajo(myfavorite) is the nerd who has a knack for hurting himself and is obsessed with celebrity teen star Yusa who is annoying but sort of interesting.\\n\\n\r\nVery funny at first with some pretty tender moments and even dark moments that you didn't expect or see coming.\\n\\n\r\nHowever as soon as episode 8 rolls around, this anime becomes something WAY different. It is trying to do many things at once and it does nothing well.\\n\\n\r\nSo many different plotlines come out and yet they either are not resolved, are rushed OR literally make zero sense. \\n\\n\r\nOur four main characters literally become Yuu featuring Nao and Yusa and Takajo become extra who show up just to remind you \"hey we're still relevant even though we aren't\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get zero development aside from an episode that centers around them and then the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it has plot holes galore or things that are just convenient somehow to make it easier for the main character.\\n\\n\r\nTwice this anime goes in a dark direction where you expect something great is going to come from it only for it to immediately to go \"Oh just kidding.\"\\n\\n\r\nI was let down immensely by charlotte....The first 6 episodes felt decent and easily could be rated an 8 out of 10. They weren't perfect but they were fun and consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe last 6 episodes however hover at a 2...barely and altogether than anime to me makes up a 5.\\n\\n\r\nThat ending was....so insulting to us as a viewers because it literally tried to fit what could actually be a season's worth of plot in one 23 minute episode.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Charlotte? Sure if you seriously don't mind stopping at episode 7. \\n\\n\r\nJust a disappointment really.",

            "content": "When I first heard that Jun Maeda was returning to make a new anime, that too with Key Studios, I was ecstatic. I imagined the series to be at least close to what Clannad After Story had been in terms of quality. Now, after completing all 13 episodes of the run, I can say it turned out more like Angel Beats, but not in the way I had imagined it to be. Here's why.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe concept of Charlotte is interesting, to say the least, and unique in terms of presentation. Many high-schoolers in Japan have been getting various superpowers, but the interesting thing is that theshow portrays what the teenagers would do in real life. Take our protagonist, for example. Le - Sorry, wrong anime - Yuu has the power to take over the bodies of other people. Does he use it to fight evil or anything? No, he simply benefits from it by cheating in tests or trying to get a new girlfriend. He is then forced to join the student council of another school which tries to protect all such superpower-wielders from 'evil scientists'. This is just the first episode, though. The whole thing becomes a train-wreck here onwards. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem of the anime is the pacing. For the first 6/7 episodes, the pacing of the show dreadfully slow, with a mixture of fillers and forced tearjerkers trying to keep the viewer hooked to it. And when all this is over, we only have about 5/6 episodes left for the main chunk of the real story. From here on, the show becomes extremely rushed. And the plot at the end is good enough for a standalone 13 episode anime, but Maeda, for some reason, crams it into 2 episodes. Laughable, really.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte's story had THE potential, I'll give you that. But the dismal pacing and the generic story-writing, at times, make it a not-so-good-after-all type of experience.\\n\\n\r\n ART:\\n\r\nThe artwork of Charlotte is undoubtedly its main highlight. Almost all the scenes are rendered pitch-perfectly. The animation is consistently fantastic, but isn't that pretty much the norm when it comes Key and P.A? The opening sequence is one of the best I've seen in recent times; not because of the song but how well the whole sequence is shot. The sequence was mesmerizing and only a handful few of other openings can claim to be just as good.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, of course, a few instances when there are some technical mistakes, but that is mainly due to poor production and below-standard story-boarding.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nCharlotte's soundtrack is mediocre at best. The openings and endings were forgettable in my opinion and the background music was consistently a hit-or-miss.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-actors, however, deserve a lot of credit for their performances. Although some of the lines are terrible, the vocal execution of the dialogues made the situations a bit more tolerable. Special shoutouts to Kouki Uchiyama and Ayane Sakura for their great performances with Yuu and Tomori respectively.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, I was expecting much better in this category when it came to a work of Jun Maeda. The character development of Charlotte is simply horrendous. Take Takajou, for example - For the first two episodes, he's a key member of the student council, accompanying the main characters in their visits and plays a pretty decent role, almost like a protagonist. For the next handful of episodes, he's demoted purely to a comical role, appearing only to be ridiculed and relieve any heavy/tense atmosphere. But that's not it. He doesn't even appear anymore, albeit his cameo at the absolute end of the last episode. And this is treated like something normal in the show. Like, what the hell, Maeda? WHAT.THE.HELL?\\n\\n\r\nLe - Sorry, again - Yuu's transformation is also a big thing. He starts off being a very I-don't-give-a-damn-about-you type of a guy who only thinks about himself ad his sister (to an extent), but tat the end becomes your generic, selfless, all-caring protagonist and I have to say, I really disliked this transformation of his. At one point of time, he's your average, caring protagonist. The next moment, he suddenly becomes angry and starts losing control over himself. Yet, there's no indication throughout the whole anime that he suffers from any form of mental instability. Maybe that's just me, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are pretty good, but what good are characters without any proper depth in their personalities?\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI didn't hate Charlotte. In fact, I DID go through the whole show without dropping it at any point. But I won't say that I exactly enjoyed it so much. Nor was it a dreadful waste of time. Average is how I'd put it in one word.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI had very, very high hopes for Charlotte. I was expecting it to be another Jun Maeda classic, if not a masterpiece. In the end, however, the only things that prevent the show from becoming a train-wreck are the excellent voice-acting and the marvelous animation and artwork. When it comes to recommendations, I wouldn't be recommending this to many.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES IN BRIEF:\\n\r\nStory - 4/10\\n\r\nArt- 9/10\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\r\nOVERALL - 6/10",

            "content": "When I saw the announcement for this anime, I saw two words: \u201cKEY\u2019\u2019,\u2019\u2019P.A Works\u2019\u2019, 2 of my most favourite producers are going to adapt one anime, I was so hyped I was tempted to watch it as soon as the first episode aired, but I like to take things slow so I basically avoided this anime page like a plague. Yesterday, I 'marathoned\u2019 it throughout the night. Was it enjoyable? Absolutely. But to be fair, I cannot deny this show has its flaws, and not minor ones at that.\r\nThe anime\u2019s setting in the beginning was refreshing, the MC uses super powers for his own gain,which is more realistic compared to the usual saving-the-world or protect friends motive which the typical shounens have. Then, he gets caught by the female MC and now joins her and the others to stop people that are just like him from using their powers. One of the series strong points that it looks into how people would use their given powers; some do bad deeds with good intentions, while others are genuinely good while others are just downright greedy.Meanwhile, Charlotte doesn\u2019t neglect the normal ones either, the show fleshes out slightly the aspect of how in reality, if our world has people with supernatural abilities, what would the normal ones do? Manipulate and Research. The plot is slow, and it is very subjective to judge whether it\u2019s a good thing or not, but to me I enjoyed the first few episodes where it shows how the MC\u2019s group stop the others from using powers. It may look episodic at first, but instances of flashbacks and conversations show character\u2019s backgrounds to understand why their personality is as such. Around episode 6-7 the pace picks up and the drama/action begins. One more point that is repeatedly stated by the MC is how almost if not all the powers in the show has a certain weakness, or as he calls it, incomplete. You wouldn\u2019t see the general super strength, super speed, elemental types of powers much, they are still there, but more refreshing and odd ones also come to the surface.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are done well, at first I thought the MC was like Lelouch, a genius who uses his powers to manipulate situations, he was the most developed throughout the series, and we can see him struggle with his powers, his relationships and even get to know his background. For a 13 episode series, it\u2019s very surprising to see a character fleshed out well. Besides that, and I might be a bit biased here since I am a fanboy, but Nao is very special, be it in her dialogues and reactions, she isn\u2019t the usual \u2018dere\u2019 steoreotypes and I can\u2019t really put a finger to her straightforward and cool attitude, which is why I like her so much. She isn\u2019t the pretty-but-dumb stereotype either, she\u2019s quick on her wits and can actually do stuff. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic was well done, as expected of KEY. I am a huge fan of Jun Maeda and his music, so I enjoyed the BGM and insert songs a whole lot. There\u2019s a blend of English lyrics in the insert songs, which is a hit or miss, but to me it was very fitting. OP and ED were done in typical KEY fashion with Lia and Aoi Tada, and they have the same Angel Beat vibes. If you like the music in Angel beats, Charlotte would be perfect for you, same artists, and same styles. There\u2019s also a group in the show that produces great music in the show, but I won\u2019t spoil it\u2019s it was by KEY, feels music was there at particular moments and they were awesome!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt was beautiful! Not as good as say \u20185 meters per second\u2019 but  it reminded me of why even though P.A works have produced some disastrous shows, They would never fail in the art. This show has a lot of moments where they would just portray the night sky and its shining stars beautifully. Characters are well drawn in typical KEY fashion with moe-ish eyes, nothing new, but it isn\u2019t bad.\\n\\n\r\nNow you must think I am a fanboy that gives this show a 10/10, but unfortunately this show has a lot of glaring errors that as much as I love the anime and enjoy it very much, could not overlook.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor a 13 episode anime, spending around 5 episodes for the pace to pick up means you only have 8 episodes for the drama and action. How is that enough? The plot picked up pace no doubt, but it was so rushed that I couldn\u2019t guess the direction of where the show is going. Speaking of direction, in shows there are things called sub-plots, but Charlotte has so many of them that in the end if they aren\u2019t developed, just become loose ends. Huge plot holes are present and they make me feel confused about the character\u2019s reactions/development at times. In fact, I mentioned that I liked how the MC is fleshed out, but I can\u2019t deny how the other characters were mediocre at best in terms of this aspect. There\u2019s the annoying little sister, the otaku (or close to one), the girl which everyone admires, go figure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA comedic trope if done once is funny, twice is fine, thrice and it just makes me cringe. The comedy aspect of the show is so repetitive I don\u2019t even laugh anymore; I understand that it\u2019s used to lift the mood, and I expect no Gintama, but come on, don\u2019t the producers think that using the same jokes all over again throughout the show is being very unoriginal?\\n\\n\r\nShows like Clannad and Little Busters by Key spend almost 15-20 episodes being slow-paced to make you be attached to the characters, and have 20 more to show all the drama, but when you have only 13 episodes. The same method isn\u2019t going to work. \u2018KEY\u2019 is famous for its way of bring out emotions from its shows but I think they might be trying too hard, they shouldn\u2019t focus on just that and sacrificed a well written storyline.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Charlotte is great but flawed. From a critical standpoint, it was not as good as it was hyped up to be. But I enjoyed the show and never stopped watching except for toilet breaks/getting snacks. To me it was really enjoyable and could be one of my favourites (Nao fanboy).\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t think about the flaws much and just want to watch something beautiful and touching, go for it; If you expect intelligent plots and realistic character development, you would be let down.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler section**\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte has major plot holes as previously mentioned, when a show uses time-leaping as a plot, it is very challenging to make it have absolutely no plot holes, that\u2019s understandable. But I believed the writers could have done better to explain some things that just became loose ends. For example, our MC travels back in time and all his actions that has a connection to the other characters should not have happened anymore; this means that all the relationships he had with others should go back to 0, but instead the other characters, particularly the female MC acts as if those things that happened still happened feelings for the male MC. From episode 7-10 everything that happened should have not developed any character besides the MC due to time travel, be it helping Nao\u2019s brother, going to the concert together, but on episode 12 you fall in love? What????I can understand the MC liking the female MC, but it\u2019s strange for the female MC to return those feelings when she has no memory of their experiences. You can say power of love and all that ,but the show doesn\u2019t even imply any memories returning and if they did maybe I could have let it slide abit.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the sub plots which make no sense, you have a 12-13 year old yandere girl that would wield a knife at another person just because your crush likes the other person instead, crazy much? You have someone being healed through someone\u2019s angelic voice when he has been psycho for such a long time? It could\u2019ve been anime magic that\u2019s present in many other shows so\u2026Oh well. Not only that, in the last episode the MC travelled around the world to help people by stealing their powers and then boom! Happy ending with the female MC, when it looked so apparent that the MC lost his memories, and again with the memories and development criticism. It\u2019s alright to accept a person as your lover when you have no memories of her right? As long as you have a token to prove that she has been there for you at least (Maybe I\u2019m nit-picking here I\u2019m not sure). Oh and not to mention the super convenient helicopter to the rescue when the MC is dying.\\n\\n\r\nEnd of spoiler**\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I was too critical, but I just wanted to see something touching and heart-warming as well as being well written.\\n\\n\r\nP.S My rating is my enjoyment of the show but if you want to rate it not based on that, its probably a 7( And because of the Art and Sound that adds some points into it)\\n",

            "content": "Charlotte, many have high hopes for this anime as it is a Jun Maeda, Angel Beats, Clannad, AnoHana etc epic tearjerker drama-ish animes that have been sometimes said to be the ' best '. Tbh I don't really like Clannad and the other works stated up there, as I think they are overdramatic, and I didn't cry while watching these animes. Maybe there are sentences like ' if you don't cry you are not human ', but, Imho, I just don't really feel these are one of those that'll make me feel sad, although I did felt hollow.\r\nNow let's get into business.\r\nFirst impression : AlthoughI did have the overdramatic prejudice thinking about Jun Maeda's works, but I seriously had HIGH hopes as the art for this piece was looking great. And on social media like Facebook, I kept noticing my friends making huge hype, so I was also quite pumped for the anime.\\n\r\nThe idea of having super powers in a high school is really similar to Angel Beats, except that one takes place where people are alive and one is another realm.\\n\\n\r\n(Contains slight spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nStory : 6/10\\n\r\nWhy? The first few episodes was damn boring and most of the people watching it ( my friends ) were discussing about whether to drop it or not. Mostly fan service and moe stuff, some people are into it ( I am not ). The creator said to give it some time ( after a certain episode ) some things will start to change. Yep it started to develop some plot, it was a good development for the story, but then it went like, one episode was good, then the next one failed me again. Overall it was ok-ish storyline, but then I had really high hopes, maybe for something well made without so much cringey stuff.  There were really lousy holes in the plot and some things like a baseball match, similar to a certain Jun Maeda anime, and they won against a pro team with their superpowers. The ending though, was literally bullshit to me. Why? How can one guy conquer the whole world in a short time. And then the forced parts of the anime. There were attempts to make people ' cry ' in the anime, but none of them were successful. You can say that the romance is also forced and they were not developed. Was expecting more about the characters to be in more danger or some suspense but there were only a little and most of the plot was expected, except some of the parts where there was a huge leap. *spoilers* Charlotte's meteor, wanted it to be elaborated and made into some kind of huge secret. Overall, the plot, was bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was well done, the only thing I didn't like was the moe kind of drawing. The characters were designed quite nicely, and the colour was colourful, bright?? Not going to go in depth with this.\\n\\n\r\nSound : -\\n\r\nNot really great with this section, didn't really listened to the soundtracks also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 6/10\\n\r\nThe character development here is weak. Some parts of the characters were forced to change. Like, the mc for example. He realizes he made some mistakes after a certain incident occur. He then changes. He then falls in love with his saviour ( this is fine ). But then, he suddenly matures into some badass character and tries to save the world. As for the main character ( female ), she is some cool girl which I like a lot, only thing is the romance part was forced quite hard, Imo it's ok if they were to be together but there weren't much detail about how it bloomed, as in they didn't put in a lot of parts where they slowly blossom into a very good romantic situation. This isn't about a true romance anime anyway, so I shouldn't be giving these critics here. The character designs were great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 6/10\\n\r\nA rollercoaster ride. Ups and downs. There has been major flaws in the anime's plot. Overall I felt the anime was dull, boring at the front, then my hype for the anime was toned down, then raised a little at the middle part, and then was normal for the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7/10\\n\r\nCharlotte. My hype was too high, and then maybe it made me more disappointed towards the anime. This series was an ok-ish anime, and I won't give a too low score for this series, probably because of Jun Maeda's works are one of my favourites, his anime and song lyrics are very enjoyable.\\n",

            "content": "A comedic drama packed with supernatural elements can make a heck of an anime which surely sounds awesome. And it its!. Charlotte is a 13 episode series portraying the lives of 4 high school kids and their own unique supernatural abilities. Now lets get to the parts I enjoyed.\r\nWell starting off with the fact that the music and concept was written by Jun Maeda (ma all time fav) so you know its gonna be freaking awesome, And I certainly wasn't disappointed. Personally i don't feel as if Charlotte was one of his best works but I definitely didn't regret giving it a try, and youshould too if your ever feeling bored, or in mood of a hilarious comedy series. The animation quality is superb and I'm quite impressed to how much its improving. The sound as i mentioned, composed by none other than the holy Jun Maeda was extraordinary. ( damn that opening and ending) The soundtracks perfectly fit with the mood and situation of the event that was taken place. Now for the story. I thoroughly enjoyed what the series had to offer plot wise and gave an interesting outlook on supernatural beings... to an extent. I feel as if the same impact didn't stay consistent throughout the series and lost its spark halfway. It was definitely rushed towards the end of the show and wasn't able to keep me as interested as I hoped. Regardless, I wont mention any spoilers, and you should check it out for yourself.\\n\r\nFinally the characters were probably one of my favorite aspects of this series as each had its unique individual characteristic fitting into the story. My favorite out of all was probably Tomori Nao as her independence really struck a cord to me. ( her sarcasm dou)\\n\r\nAs goes for the other characters such as Yuu Otosaka, This particular character had immense character development but tbh, his narcissistic and rude approach is what made this series so damn funny. \\n\r\nJ\u014djir\u014d Takaj\u014d ( omg this dude is my life)\\n\r\nAyumi Otosaka ( Probably my favorite little sister in any show)\\n\r\nAnyway, that's all for this review, i definitely recommend at least the 1st half of this series to those who just like a good laugh and even some drama compacted to it. Luckily this series just ended today, so you'll be able to watch it without any problems ^___^ ( really hope Jun continues his work of awesomeness)\\n\r\nEnjoy\\n\r\nSayonara \\n",

            "content": "\u201cNo one man should have all that power,\u201d \u2013 Kanye West\r\nWatchmen was a response to the explosion of superhero comics. Charlotte feels like a response to the explosion of superhero films. The Marvel Cinematic Universe helped to keep superheroes in the public\u2019s consciousness, but it was just a dumbing-down of what Sam Raimi did before. Charlotte has a more interesting take.\r\nThese teens are superheroes. They may not have capes and a one-eyed boss (although an eye does get plucked out), but they got superpowers that can be used for saving the world. Why should they, though? A superpower is just an extension of any kindof power.\\n\\n\r\nHow many powerful people use their power to contribute to humanity? Musicians use their talent to vent their frustration and sell records. Programmers build websites to get traffic. Most people I know become doctors because it\u2019s a respected profession and gets money. The mindset that you should use your power to contribute is rare.\\n\\n\r\nYuu and Nao are two different sides of the coin. For the first two and a half episode, they\u2019re an interesting exploration of power. Yuu uses his to move on up, taking advantage of people but not actually hurting them. Nao\u2019s desire to protect others leads her to plenty of physical confrontation.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a moral hero isn\u2019t easy. Nao may have good intentions, but she leaves a trail of beat up people and isolates herself. Yuu\u2019s achievements rely on a skill he gained by luck, not by hard work. There could be an interesting examination of how we shun people who work hard and praise those who just won the genetic lottery.\\n\\n\r\nNao also has a reasonable motivation for being moral. Her moral behavior isn\u2019t convenient but results in isolation. Sadly, this is where the character development stops.\\n\\n\r\nYusa is brought in as much-(un)needed cuteness, as if Nao isn\u2019t pretty herself. Ayumi already does the forced cuteness bad enough, so what does Yusa contribute? Worse, she makes another character turn into a drooling fanboy. Takajou first looks like a middle ground between Nao\u2019s vigilance and Yuu\u2019s selfishness, but after Yusa appears all he does is worship her.\\n\\n\r\nThis forced cuteness clashes with the occasional grim tone. Yusa and Ayumi are too-much-sugar cute. They\u2019d be overly-optimistic in Azumanga. Their cuteness is plain happiness, with no unique design or quirk. Next to the cuteness there\u2019s grief, overcoming it, time traveling and what power does to the user.\\n\\n\r\nThe treatment of grief does acknowledge the darkness. We see the downward spiral, the isolation and how a person is so overwhelmed he abandons life. Then after 2 episodes he rises up and things are going well. Grief is supposed to change us forever. It doesn\u2019t automatically make us good guys. Nao\u2019s grief turned her into a vigilantee. When Impmon\u2019s whole world was wrecked, he changed but part of him remained. There\u2019s no hint in Yuu that he used to be a selfish brat. He transforms into a moral hero with no relation to what he used to be.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that the story of Charlotte is convenient by nature. The core premise is an attempt at subverting a common trope. The problem must be in the length. Charlotte has too many ideas and stories which can\u2019t be crammed in 13 episodes. Mirai Nikki couldn\u2019t develop it all in 26.\\n\\n\r\nAt least Mirai Nikki played by its own rules. Charlotte often gives up any time it could get interesting. The last episodes is where its most harmful. A senseless enemy appears whose contribution to the story is nil. The only contribution is the killing of another character, but it they don\u2019t do anything meaningful with it. The death doesn\u2019t affect the story in anyway. We don\u2019t see how the characters deal with grief, or how that death is a meaningful conclusion to that character\u2019s story.\\n\\n\r\nThey already touched on grief. The only thing that conflict adds to the story is to make Yuu be heroic while killing a device that makes Yuu work a little harder in the climax. Yuu is interesting because he\u2019s the opposite of a moral hero, so turning him into one works against the story. The climax also didn\u2019t need such a dramatic brush with death to start.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the final episode redeems the series. Like the detour to Dealing With Grief, it\u2019s too short for its own. Still, its idea is intriguing and the psychological development is well-paced. It\u2019s further development on the original ideas the series started with.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Charlotte does suffer from rushed pacing, it overcomes it by well-structuring its episode. The last episode is an epic journey that often takes more than 10 episodes in other anime. The creators managed to sum it up in 20 minutes without the journey losing too much impact. There is talented people there, they just took on too much.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte\u2018s main problem is that all its detours don\u2019t always rise from the premise. Mirai Nikki explores both an ensemble cast and the Nature of Time and Space, but these are things that are found in the premise. Nothing about Charlotte\u2019s idea of superpowered teenagers has anything to do with exploring the nature of death or time travel.\\n\\n\r\nAll these detours also lead to too many characters who aren\u2019t given enough to do. Too many events are external. The puzzle-solving of the first episodes was fun, but after that it\u2019s all big events. The creators can\u2019t imagine a way to approach them that\u2019s not dull heroism, so there\u2019s no emotional payoff.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why the sentimental moments often feel manipulative. This is a criticism that\u2019s been directed at KEY often, but here it feels even more out-of-place. Charlotte is either too plot-driven or too psychological for such convenient wrapping-up. It\u2019s been a long time since I watched Kanon (2006), but it was a pure drama. The sentimentality rose naturally, instead of feeling tacked on.\\n\\n\r\nSome credit must be given to the soundtrack. It seems originality in soundtracks is now common in anime. There is attention paid to the textures and use of rhythm that is rare in Western scores. In this case, it borrows some cues from Bass Music to create the right intensity \u2013 one that is not world-altering, but still so.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte is a clever idea that took unnecessary, if interesting baggage and didn\u2019t have enough episodes to connect everything. It\u2019s more enjoyable than annoying. The episode are somehow paced well, even if the overall pace isn\u2019t. It manages to make a final turn at the end so the journey won\u2019t be futile. Wasted potentials are everywhere, but Charlotte works more than it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not brilliant, but it\u2019s good enough to show there are still creative minds in anime.\\n\\n\r\n3 comets out of 5",
