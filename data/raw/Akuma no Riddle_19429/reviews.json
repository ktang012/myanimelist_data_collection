            "content": "With an interesting premise that is dark and alluring, this show looked very promising. The thing with some anime adaptations is that it\u2019s hard to pull off while the source material is still on-going. Studios and Staff that take on this type of project are now tasked with a challenging job of getting the execution right. Akuma no Riddle is sadly held back from the poor execution on many of the aspects, ideas and story elements it presented that prevents the show from being great.\r\nAdapted from Yun Kouga's manga, Akuma no Riddle follows the path of Tokaku Azuma, a seasoned assassin who transfers to aprivate boarding school in Myoujou Academy to attend Class Black. It consists of 13 students, 12 being assassins and 1 being the target in Haru Ichinose, a bright and cheerful girl who aims to become friends with her peers. Unknowing to her, things soon take a turn for the worst. The purpose of this Class is more of a test or game for the assassins, they have to find out who is the target among them and then assassinate her within the rules that have been established. The ruling is that the target must be informed that she is going to be targeted and killed and that it must happen within 48 hours after issuing the notice. Failing to follow the ruling or the completion of the assassination within the time frame has one expelled from Class Black. If successful, one is granted any wish of their desire.\\n\\n\r\nTokaku concludes that Haru is the target after thoroughly examining her peers and has her sights on her. She finds out that Haru will become her roommate and after spending the time to getting to know her more, she becomes drawn to her to the point where she defects to her side and becomes her protector as they both strive to graduate Class Black. This is how the story begins and I found this rather interesting. I like the whole idea of this survival concept but as the story progresses, it felt that it was following an episodic format where an episode is dedicated to each one of the girls trying to kill Haru. While we get some flashbacks about their past and how they came to Class Black, it leaves every character besides Tokaku and Haru one episode for development. This led to shallow characters, rushed conclusions and a drowned out overarching story which for the most part makes Akuma no Riddle fail to make anything meaningful. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where I felt Akuma no Riddle was lacking and it\u2019s how the show handles its characters. I wish there was more exploration with our main protagonists though we get to see their true self behind the fa\u00e7ade they put on and also learn important details of their past. For the rest of the characters, due to time constraints of only 12 episodes, it was a tough ask to get more from them or to care for them. This is a big flaw, given the setup of the show is extremely character driven and with the \u2018assassination of the week\u2019 approach it gives limited ways for development, which in this case comes from a flashback, what they want for their reward or how they failed the assassination. One episode for development is simply not enough to feel invested.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things to appreciate about Akuma no Riddle is its distinctive look and style. The world is well designed, the art style and colour palette used helped create a dark and eerie atmosphere which increased the intensity of the assassinations. The character designs were very well done and each character's look suited their personalities. Diomedea studio did ok with the animation, it was consistent despite drops in quality occasionally. Majority of the action scenes were very fluid and choreographed very well. An interesting choice the show implemented was the custom Ending that each episode got dedicated to each character of the series. I found that very creative and it added more content\u2014showing a little summary about their story.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is mainly fast-paced and dark atmospheric tracks to keep you engaged in the assassinations but no particular track was inherently memorable. Immediately I found myself hooked to the Opening song, \"Soushou Innocence\" by Maaya Uchida. It really sets the mood and tone for the series while also fitting the themes. As mentioned before, I was pleased by the custom Endings and to go along with the different animation used in each one was also different songs. This is what made the Endings so refreshing and another plus factor in the creativity category. I had no issues regarding the voice acting, each of the voices used fitted the design and personality of the character. They deserve praise for showcasing the characters true killer instinct perfectly both in and outside of the assassinations.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the series began, I noticed it had a \"Yuri\" tag but that was later switched with \u2018Shoujo-ai\u2019. Call me blind if I missed anything but there was no Yuri, sure there were hints with Tokaku and Haru's relationship but nothing serious or anything that would turn viewers off who may not like Yuri. The concept of survival game is nothing new but it did attempt to give it a bit more flair, something I can appreciate. The rating I had for it before the last two episodes was a bit higher but I had to bring it down because I felt the ending was anticlimactic and was disappointed on the route it chose. Despite its flaws Akuma no Riddle can still be an enjoyable thriller for those who like episodic series with lots of action, it has its moments and I felt that I may have enjoyed it a bit more if I didn\u2019t go into the show with high expectations.\\n",

            "content": "Anime Review No.8\r\nAkuma no Riddle an anime about 12 girl assassins enrolled in a prestigious private high school where they are gathered there for one reason and that is to kill the daughter of a very powerful and influential clan in japan. The plot is already not promising for it\u2019s kind of one sided. Oh come on? 1 vs 12 and they are assassins for crying out loud! But the story have a twist one of the assassins named Tokaku Azuma decided to protect her for unknown reason giving the targeted girl named \u201c Haru Ichinose\u201d a chance to survive. This anime is something youcan expect to be good because it\u2019s like the same with Mirai Nikki in terms of two partners helping each other to win the battle royal in a yuri type of way but entirely after finishing this show you will be disappointed for you can\u2019t understand what is going on about the show? \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWarning this review may contain spoilers but if you want to be save by not wasting your time to badly written animated show please here me out\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot (3/10)\\n\r\nThere are so many elements and events that make the plot badly written to the point you can\u2019t understand the show anymore. It\u2019s not your fault if you can\u2019t understand the show. It\u2019s the plot\u2019s fault for not giving proper explanation on what\u2019s going on. I list down below the major plot holes they carelessly didn\u2019t give a damn for the viewers to better understand the flow of the plot.\\n\r\n\uf0e8\t1st is that the Tournament rule mechanics is not properly explained. Even though they did explain the rules for just a \u201cfew seconds\u201d you can\u2019t understand what are the penalties and other alternatives that rule can offer. They just let the action do the explaining in which in the end just make the viewers and also me so confuse in what the heck is happening to the show. We don\u2019t know what happen to the girl if she failed to assassinate the girl and another thing is that does the rules even fair to begin with? The girls are randomly selected to kill haru but do the girls have the right to interfere just to give them the chance to kill haru in case the present challenger failed? The problem of the rules is it doesn\u2019t give a clear explanation how it works which make the battle royal pointless. \\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tAnother thing is that Haru background story is unclear why the black classes wanted to kill her. Being in an influential family is not enough for an explanation.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe logic of the show is screwed. Why do haru even push herself to study in a school where she already knows that all her classmates will attempt to kill her?\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tBeing friends with the people who will try to kill you is very stupid mindset even in the most common sense.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe show present flashbacks to characters at first it was understandable but as the story move\u2019s forward I cannot even understands each of the story.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe story is trying to make the characters feel dramatic or I call it the \u201cFEELS\u201d factor which is useless for the characters have no depth. You cannot make character depth in a few seconds of a flashback which is another weak factor for the plot.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe plot is so train wreck you cannot take it seriously for the action makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tLastly the biggest plot hole is that haru manage to survive just because the characters who have the 100% chance of killing her and win the game goes full retard in at the last second and always give Tokaku the \u201cprince charming figure\u201d the chance to save the damsel of distress from its assailants. Obvious plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10)\\n\r\nThe characters have no originality if you watched a lot of anime with typical stereotype of personalities it is not hard to identify.  Major weaknesses of the characters by the ff.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tIf you are going to kill someone never give a second thought that\u2019s not assassin like. The moment I always see this scene the more I discover this girls are not really mature assassins but immature children going on crazy because of puberty.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe logic of Tokaku being allied with haru is senseless. They just met for a few hours, talk about each other\u2019s pass and exchange some dialogues and boom what we got Tokaku changing of heart out of the blue\u2019s thought the so called manipulation ability of haru explained in the last episode make\u2019s sense but still it's confusing if you need to endure 11 more episodes.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe action\u2019s and logical reasoning of the characters is so predictable in the point you\u2019re annoyed.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tPretentious dialogues. My issues of this show for what they say is different on what they act.\\n\\n\r\nSound (2/10)\\n\r\nCharacters songs are pointless if you don\u2019t like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\r\nI will give an average score for the good action scenes, knife slicing, explosions and girl punches.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10)\\n\r\nI just enjoyed the small scale action and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\r\nThis anime is not about assassin being mature but it\u2019s just show killing people is \u201cImmature\u201d. Immature violence and nothing really happens in the story. Nobody dies and everybody lives happily ever after like the story just makes a reason for the girls to kill and hurt each other in the first place. \\n",

            "content": "Upon the understanding that a film, book or television show will feature assassins as its fundamental aspect, it\u2019s likely that the immediate set of expectations we receive from this falls along the imagery of thrill, excitement and aesthetics. Akuma no Riddle is very much a show that exhibits these types of expectations. It sets the stage for a high-school battle royale well enough by introducing 12 female assassins, each with their own desires, and one target, a girl striving to survive the oncoming ordeal. The assassins and target must all participate in Myoujou Academy\u2019s elusive Black Class, where they\u2019ll assume the guise of high-school students,and whoever is able to successfully kill the target may have their any wish granted. However, due to a twist of events, one assassin successfully defects to the target\u2019s side, vowing to protect her at all costs. It is quite an exciting premise and definitely promises those characteristic expectations of assassins. Unfortunately, Akuma no Riddle falls short on delivery of said expectations and is ultimately a weak series. That is not to say that it fails solely because of its lack of deliverance. Rather, the series\u2019 shortcomings can be directly attributed to a much greater, fundamental flaw located right at its very core. That and one particular misfire that brings down all hopes of the show had of being redeemed.\\n\\n\r\nThe particular assassin that defects to the target\u2019s (Haru Ichinose) side, is Azuma Tokaku, the central character of Akuma no Riddle. We are affixed to her presence from the show\u2019s very beginning and quickly learn that she is stoic, reserved and not the most determined assassin out of the bunch. Her reason for defection is not initially made clear by the series though this is not a hindrance but a gateway for speculation that Tokaku has become subtlety attracted to Haru. Tokaku is very much the protagonist of the series though, due to her newfound predicament, she finds Haru, the series deuteragonist, in her company more often than not. Haru is a surprisingly cheery and optimistic girl for a girl of her position, and her grand desire is to achieve friendship with the assassins and graduate from the Black Class, not as enemies but as friends. It seems to be a vain goal but, we learn that through Haru\u2019s past experiences, she has been shaped to think like this. The main characters don\u2019t have the strongest or most convincing characterization they could but, it is done well enough to make them interesting to follow. What\u2019s more interesting than their individual characteristics is their relationship. Tokaku and Haru share an inevitable bond that grows stronger with each assassination attempt, which is a pleasure to watch. It is probably one of the the series\u2019 greatest strength. It\u2019s not long before the series sets us free to discover the other 11 assassins and their motives. The quality of their characterization varies, but Akuma no Riddle sets out to define each and every assassin to their distinct character. However, the success of this greatly hindered by the great limitation of the series; its very own formula.\\n\\n\r\nHarkening back to the rules of the Black Class, assassins must hand in an advance notice to Haru in order for their assassination to be considered valid. From there, they must successfully execute their assassination within a 48-hour limit. Failure upon doing so means expulsion from the Black Class. In retrospect this is where the series limits itself. This is not an apparent limitation but it\u2019s how Akuma no Riddle handles this rule that causes the series to become restricted. From the start of the assassination game, the series decides to formally focus on usually one assassin and their assassination attempt per episode. This type of formula of focusing on a different character each episode is a familiar one, so it\u2019s all up to the execution to make sure that it\u2019s a effective episode with strong characterization and memorable moments. Akuma no Riddle fails to deliver here. With the confliction of the show\u2019s premise (Tokaku protecting Haru from her assassination), the 48-hour time limit and only one assassination attempt per assassin, it\u2019s obvious that there can be only one outcome. For the sake of the show to continue, it should be no surprise that Haru and Tokaku are able to prevail over their opponents, resulting in the opposing assassin being disqualified, never to be seen at Black Class again. This type of formula can get tired fast and yet, Akuma no Riddle decides to let it dictate nearly the entire series. It gets old seeing the same thing twice, nevertheless the 8th time as well. By deciding to have this formula, the series allows itself to become entrapped in a web of predictability. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens to the protagonists in each episode because you know what the outcome will be. Surprise is effectively killed, despite the series\u2019 best attempts to shake it up now and then. It is a breathe of fresh air when the series does this but the problem is that the formula is still there when it really shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s probably the most roundabout & counterintuitive way to execute the series\u2019 premise.\\n\\n\r\nPredictability is not the formula\u2019s sole crime however. A very important and much focused on aspect of this series is affected as well; characterization. Each episode has a focus character and the show wastes no time in its attempts to characterize them and flesh them out. However, with solely one episode to work on a character (who probably didn\u2019t get a lot of spotlight because prior episodes focused on different characters) Akuma no Riddle\u2019s attempts at characterization are ineffective and insubstantial. There\u2019s just not enough time to develop these assassin-of-the-week characters who won\u2019t be seen again and any attempts that are made are just shallow. Usually a good option for this one-episode-character trope is to have these characters leave an imprint on the main characters and have them develop instead. However, Akuma no Riddle has no desire to do this. It solely attempts to develop these side-characters who will ultimately have no significant outcome on the story. It is entirely futile and the series doesn\u2019t do a particularly good job at making us care for these characters anymore than we did before, no matter how tragic or reverent the character is. It\u2019s thanks to this formula of strictly focusing on side characters that the series forgets to focus on the more interesting aspects of the series, like Tokaku and Haru\u2019s relationship. If Akuma no Riddle had focused more on their relationship, we generally would have gotten character development that mattered and watching it would\u2019ve been more rewarding. \\n\\n\r\nWith surprise taken out and weak characterization in abundance, surely Akuma no Riddle should be able to soar with exciting, thrilling and aesthetic action. After all, the formula is not strict enough that it needs the action to subscribe to it. As I said earlier, Akuma no Riddle is not able to completely deliver upon these expectations. Assassinations are not as clever or exciting as one would expect. Most assassinations don\u2019t have much effort put into them, they lack effectiveness and creativity, almost as if the assassins aren\u2019t really trying to seriously kill Haru. Though this is unconvincingly addressed by the series later on, it doesn\u2019t make it any more engaging. There\u2019s a point where the series understandably breaks free from its formula, and surprisingly enough, it is almost able to redeem itself. The final three episodes are able to deliver thrilling revelations, truly exciting action and well-built momentum for an engaging, albeit confusing, finale.  However, it is what directly follows the finale that permanently sinks Akuma no Riddle. An epilogue that is meant to give closure to the series, while also attempting to please the viewer ends up becoming a complete misfire. It\u2019s confounding in its own right, but as a direct cause of being an immediate follow-up to the climax, it becomes incredibly jarring and backwards. The finale sets up a definite ending, one that is understandable, and a good one for the series. The epilogue completely rewrites this climax, undermining it as well as everything else the series had built up prior. The bizzarity of this epilogue is outstanding that it\u2019s almost surreal and its disparity with the rest of the series is too apparent. \\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle had all the pieces, but assembly led to mistakes that ultimately brought down the series. It is still has its enjoyable aspects however. Animation, while not incredibly impressive overall, conveys the fight scenes and action quite well and is without compromise. OST accompanies scenes well, and while nothing stands out, it fits into the background nicely. Character design does stand out thankfully and each assassin has a memorably distinct design, setting them apart from the rest. The OP \u2018Soushou Innocence\u2019 is notable in delivering a fittingly moody & energetic tune filled an aesthetic visual experience. Regarding the EDs, Akuma no Riddle generously gives nearly every assassin their own song which can serve as further characterization as to who they are. For example, the 8th ED \u2018Mayonaka no Toubou\u2019 is able to effectively exude the melancholic delusion of a character through its lyrics, tune and visuals. The art for these EDs are in good quality as well, matching the characters nicely and further indirectly characterizing them. It\u2019s a shame that the series was not able to deliver the same level of characterization with such conviction.\\n\\n\r\nEven with Akuma no Riddle becoming a slave to its own formula, it can still be enjoyed. Tokaku and Haru\u2019s relationship is pleasant to see (when it is actually focused on), the action is decent, reaching an all time high near the end, and some of the characters can still be entertaining (notably the ones given more prominence than others). However, its formula is its greatest enemy, bringing down the deliverance of expectations, characterization as well as the effectiveness of its story. Along with a questionable epilogue, Akuma no Riddle is weakened and restricted from crafting the exciting, thrilling and aesthetic battle royale it wanted to be.",

            "content": "The concept of the survival game and battle royal is very mainstream today and is favored also by many people, a lot of anime that uses this concept with the objective of achieving huge profits that  make anime these days feels more commercial. One of those anime is Riddle Story of Devil or commonly called Akuma no Riddle, a show that comes from Diomedea studio (known for the anime Squid Girl). The story is illustrated in Myojou Academy, a boarding school for women. The school has a special class named Black Class, containing 12 assassin who has a mission to kill 'the target' whichis in the same class as well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses of this anime is the supporting element of the story that almost didn't run at all, the concept of battle royal that usually thrill and exciting can not be felt. Also, the anime is not paying attention the importance of an originality of a masterpiece, the story didn't have an identity. Furthermore, Akuma no Riddle has a plot that is very common, the plot is not well organized and feels very easily predictable from the beginning, the ending looks very forced. There are plot holes that still empty until the end of the story. Exacerbated by many unexpected fan service appear everywhere like rain. These factors above really makes Akuma no Riddle very weak in the story section.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation possessed adequate existing standards, as well as the character design. But it doesn't fit with the story feeling, figure portrayed an assassin less on character design. \\n\r\nEven so, there is no problem in that their actions show. In terms of sound and music, Akuma no Riddle quite above average. The opening song very lively, the ending songs is quite interesting because each episode has their own ending songs. While the voice actor does their job adequately.\\n\\n\r\nDeepening the characters in this story concept is difficult, let alone this show consists just 12 episodes, very difficult to make an interesting character in that short periodic of time. This happens on Akuma no Riddle, the anime impose to tell all of the character's past. But do not notice how shallow the development of the character they make, which creates a backfire to the plot. The main character also has a very weak motive and irrational reason in helping the target.\\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle may have a lot of shortcomings in terms of story and character, but it didn't make this show very ugly until you want to dispose of this radioactive far away, maybe recommended for people who are looking for action and fight rather than a story. \\n\r\nFinally, you like it or did not it depends on you.",

For starters, we have a diverse and colorful cast ofcharacters who transfers into the infamous all-girls school known as Myojo Academy. One particular class stands out known as the \u201810th Year Black Class\u2019. It\u2019s here where the show tells its story as Haru is marked a target for death by the other transfer students. As a show based on setting of survival, the premise tells of a different setup. Rather than a free-for-all and every killer for themselves, it\u2019s all against Haru. Apparently, the victor gets themselves a wish, something that I\u2019m sure almost everyone wants if they ever had a chance to make a fantasy into a reality. While all this seems interesting at first, the first episode only introduces its premise that is underwhelming. The premise serves a device to show the deadly game as Haru becomes the prey and the transfer students are the predators. It\u2019s easy to figure out the concepts of the game though since the show explains itself early on with the mechanics. The part where it gets confusing is the ultimate purpose of the game. Mystery draws out throughout the show like a riddle with characters in the background such as Nio Hashiri to spellbind the audience\u2019s curiosity.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show, there\u2019s an instinctive towards the assassin\u2019s motivations, which differs between every character. However, one prominent attribute involves Tokaku\u2019s will to protect Haru from harm. Her motivation is uncertain besides a few cryptic hints relating to possibly Haru\u2019s past and herself. In essence, the show is one big riddle with her motivations and how they fight for survival at the school. For Tokaku and Haru, they develop a close and innate relationship spawned by the time they spent together. Existing as polar opposites, there\u2019s some development between the two although the duo feels incompatible. For instance, Tokaku is someone who hates others getting close to her and dislike people referring by her first name. On the other hand, Haru is energetic, sociable, and often tries to brighten a gloom and doom atmosphere. Curiosity spawns as how these two can co-exist together as a duo when their lives are at stake every single day at the academy.\\n\\n\r\nLike mentioned before, each assassin is different with a different personality and even killing method of choice. In total, there are 12 of them including Azuma. Here\u2019s where the problem comes in when it follows the adaptation. The manga has only been publishing for about a year and its inconclusive how it will end. In other words, the anime braces itself for a possible anime original ending. But that\u2019s not really the main problem. The main flaw here is characterization and development of the assassins. As a one cour show (12 episodes), the show implies that each assassin gets only about a full episode of screen time. That\u2019s also fallacious because in one particular episode, three assassins are eliminated all the same time while one of them didn\u2019t even get her own chance at Haru\u2019s life. In retrospect, it means that there will hardly be any concentration or focus on an assassin\u2019s character. The only focus it spends is the flashbacks that often feels too centralized, predictable, and sometimes clich\u00e9. Director Keizou Kusakawa appeals to the audience with his gimmicks that quickly turns itself into a twisted game as each episode progresses on. More and more students are \u201ctransferred out\u201d of the class, but in reality are expelled/killed. His previous works on series such as Sekirei and Campione also relied on a main character to fight for glory and triumph against other skilled adversaries. Here, it follows a similar suit only that it seems episodic in nature. By worst, the series also likes to pull out some oddball conclusion with its finale that seemingly circumnavigate backwards with its original theme but destroying the grim feelings of despair. Perhaps the unaired special OVA will find its way to depict a more accurate image.\\n\\n\r\nDiving into this show also will feel like dark academy adventure. To get the best experience, it would be to familiarize yourself with the various characters. This could be a problem since most of them are hardly relatable as result of their weak development. Not to mention the fact that all the assassins have deadly skills, it\u2019s hard to picture yourself in their shoes in the first place. But luckily, there is a catch of diversity. Each episode offers something new with the characters. They attempt to kill Haru with every chance and seizes that opportunity. The methods they formulate results in creative ideas that although seems gimmicky but is also unorthodox in an unique sense. These include diffusing strategically placed bombs, fighting on stage in front of an audience in the disguise of a school play, or even literally solving riddles. And to further diversity themselves, each character has a different persona whether it\u2019s a sadist (Isuke Inukai), innocent little girl (Hitsugi Kirigaya), assertive (Koko Kaminaga), or even one with dual personalities and among others. Haru\u2019s presence creates a strange vibration between some of these characters as she is too fragile and incomparable to them. It mixes in the wrong way when it comes to developing any sort of relationship with them. And because they are assassins, the only relationship is decided by life and death.\\n\\n\r\nA variety of themes is dealt with throughout the show whether it\u2019s friendship, jealousy, regret, or vengeance. It explores the basics of human nature in a dark way since most of the characters seems to have a troubling life based on the various flashbacks. But these concepts don\u2019t have a profound way to express themselves. Looking at on the surface, there\u2019s a feeling of cuteness molded with dark configuration. Even the girls that fights for \u201cjustice\u201d plays roles as anti-heroes rather than a figure of admiration. But for what\u2019s worth, Azuma perhaps the most dynamic character for her self-motivation to protect Haru. In attempts to protect Haru, we learn more about Azuma including parts of her past and visage as an assassin. We also see different sides of her through the relationship between the duo. But ultimately, this comes down to storytelling as the main premise is still intact throughout the series. As Haru is the main target, their relationship is tested by the human nature and instinct.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also explicitly shown that the show does take itself seriously, perhaps too much for its own good. Whether these are the taunting riddles, intimidating expressive eye gestures, or even torture scenes, the show makes its oddball point. But despite this dark nature, it also tries to humor the audience with its gags. These include the yuri vibes between some characters including Haru and Azuma. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising considering the way the show is setup. But other tactics of humor attempt often includes Haru\u2019s lack of sense and the denseness of the classes\u2019 teacher, Ataru Mizorogi. From a motivational case, this doesn\u2019t work right since the show has a grim and more mature setting. The girls are dead serious on killing Haru so when comedy sometimes come into play, it doesn\u2019t balances itself right.\\n\\n\r\nDiomed\u00e9a, known for their previous involvement with other game scenario-esque shows such as Problem Children and NouCome adapts similar gimmicks. Only this time, it focuses on the deadly side with its character designs. In fact, every character in the show has an appeal to color themselves as a competitor. Some seems intimidating while others are innocent but all the assassins are deadly in respect when they show their true colors. This is shown prominently by how the camera focuses exclusively on their eyes. It depicts the anti-thesis of schoolgirls are like, especially in a prestigious school. They hide their true nature until the moment comes to strike just like assassins. As far as their face gesture, it crafts this gimmick right by nature. Character outfits are also decorative with distinctive figures to match their personalities. However, do expect some fan-service when it comes to pool episodes, censored bath scenes (TV version) and the shock violence that comes out as cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn\u2019t a super powerhouse but does works very well as a supplement to this show when it works with the characters. The most noticeable aspect involves the ED songs as each assassin gets her own theme song (when the episode focuses on them). The OP song remains unchanged however with depiction of the assassins in femme fatale like poses and a catchy aesthetic rhythm. Not to mention, the song contains some spoilerish scenes involving their weapons. For most of the character voices, they show their tone of intimidation and violence. I\u2019d give credit to most of their mannerisms to stay consistent with the characters. However, Haru\u2019s voice mannerism greatly contradicts this with her innocent nature. We also get a variety of soundtrack to depict the heavy action toned sequences. Some works out right while others feels repetitive but ultimately does the job to craft a decent balance of sound mixture.\\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle\u2019s endgame is the fact that the show focuses exclusively more on story rather than character development. Demanding for that would leave you unsatisfied. After all, the ultimate goal of the show is to deliver Haru\u2019s execution and fulfill the wish of an assassin. While all this sounds dandy, it also tries desperately to appeal to the audience with its misplaced comedy, shadowy flashbacks, and shallow character relationships. And although it showcases yuri at times, it isn\u2019t a prominent feature to that end either. But the show does offer great diversity with its colorful character cast. For all its faults, the show\u2019s raison d'etre can still be appealing and leave audience wonder who or what happens next. Make no mistake though. This show isn\u2019t just some Romeo and Juliet story about two girls but rather their tale of survival. Because in their world, the strongest prevail and the weak perish.",

            "content": "Ok, so this is my first review and I'll be as honest and thorough as possible for an readers.\r\nOk so basically Akuma no Riddle is about a girl named Haru who has to survive a classroom full of assassins.  That's really the gist of it.  That being said, let me move on to my scores and why I rated them as such.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story was very much lacking in this show, and I say that with utter disappointment.  This was a show that when it first started, had the set up to be an awesomely written masterpiece full of character development andplot twists.  Sadly, that didn't happen.  I was hoping for characters that were in the class for ulterior motives, or that had such an elaborate plan that it lasted longer than one episode.  This didn't happen at all.  This show is basically a generic battle-royal.  Not that I have anything against battle-royal style anime and manga, but I honestly expected more out of the show and its characters.\\n\r\nThe other disappointing thing, was that whenever a particular assassin was the focal point of an episode, that was it.  They got one episode and then done.  They got two episodes only if they didn't start their battle in the beginning of their first one.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good.  It wasn't anything stellar and it certainly had some horrifically drawn moments, but those were very rare and it had plenty of other scenes where the art looked excellent.  Not a master piece, but certainly above average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound was probably the highlight of the show.  The tracks during the fight scenes were good, and the tracks during emotional scenes were good as well.  The best part however, were the OP and the EDs.  The OP was amazing, and each assassin had her own ED.  So basically when it was that assassin's turn in the show, it played their ED at the end.  All of the endings were unique and very very good.  The lyrics also reflected the characters extremely well.  If you are a fan of anime music, this would definitely be a reason to check out the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThis pretty much plays off the same reasoning I had with the story score.  Just as there was a lack of plot twists and really good story development, there was an extreme lack of character development as well.  None of the characters were outright terrible to begin with, and some were more interesting than others off the bat.  Their personal reasons for wanting to assassinate Haru were pretty much all interesting too, but that's all you get from them.  Like I said under story, after they get their one episode spotlight, that's it.  So character development really becomes impossible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI rate this as high as I do, simply because I enjoyed it for what it was; a battle-royal high school anime.  Sure if I take into account the poor story, lack of character development, and the ending (wont spoil it at all, but just me personally, I didn't enjoy it) then I would rate it a lot lower.  That's precisely why my overall score is lower.  BUT if you take the show at face value and just accept it for being a generic battle-royal with a bunch of fighting between unique assassins, then it's pretty entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nWhen I take every part of the show into consideration, I cant score it anything better than mediocre.  While it didn't completely blow at anything, it didn't excel at anything either, especially in parts it should have.  The story could have been SOOO much more, and along those lines a better story could have brought much more in depth characters.  I wont say it isn't enjoyable to watch, but if you're looking for some masterpiece of a story, with characters that will blow your mind, then this show is not for you.  If you're just looking for an action anime, with good music and very minimum yuri, then you might want to take a look at Akuma no Riddle.  \\n\\n\r\nJust an extra tid-bit here - but if you're one of those people that flocks to the manga to get more details or if the anime has a bad adaptation, then don't.  This is one of the EXTREMELY RARE cases where the anime is better than the manga...and I mean significantly better.",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle was an interesting anime. But not in a good way. Potential seems to be the name of the game now-a-days, and if you have it you must be good, right? This was an example of that being completely, and truly, false.\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nIf you're here, you've probably heard this anime referred to as the \"DanganRonpa with Yuri\". As of  finishing the series, I can assure you, that this was partially true. This, like DanganRonpa, had a lot of potential and a very interesting plot going in. This also shares DanganRonpa's somewhat bad traits by having everything culminate into next to nothing.However, in Dangan, it's next to nothing. Here, we get absolutely nothing. Nothing changes throughout the course of the series, and it leaves me with a very bland feeling that nothing was accomplished after 12 episodes.\\n\r\nNow, this would be minor spoilers, but the tags on MAL are wrong. If you are watching this purely for Yuri, you will be extremely disappointed. There is very little Yuri, if you could even call it that. Maybe if you have some pretty intense Yuri googles, you might enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nLet's be honest, the art is really good, and the animation is beautiful. I do recognize that it is 2014, but we still have shows like Kill La Kill that look terrible. Yes, I know that money is a factor, but it still doesn't excuse poor animation. Anyways, the animation in Akuma no Riddle is very fluid and looks amazing. Very few corners were cut here, and we don't have books covering peoples mouths so they didn't have to animate them talking...\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThis is and Art are the only places Akuma no Riddle shines. This anime had some very enjoyable OST's that really fit the feel and mood of the show. But the thing that really stood out to me was that each ending of this show is unique, and each has a unique song. This is something that may have been done before, but I have never seen this before, and it shows that the creators at least put something into creating this show. I liked this most of all, but I'm not someone who's big on the OP/ED of shows. I much prefer the actual content, and a bad/good opening/ending doesn't really reflect the content within the show for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 4/10\\n\r\nThe way the story develops the characters is in a really poor way. It goes the route of introducing them each individually. Then, it will give you the characters backstory. The problem with this is all the side characters shove out the mains and leave them with less development time. I'm not fan of this way of character development at all because now I feel like I know next to nothing about any of the characters, because the screen time was too evenly split. Therefore, it's more like things doing actions rather than an actual character you can grab on to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment - 4\\n\r\nHonestly, I was very disappointed by Akuma no Riddle. I thought it would be this new innovative anime that would really try to branch out and do its own thing and end up amazing. This was not the case as it reverted to the old tried and true methods that we've all seen before.\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, I would not recommend this anime to almost anyone, as it has my cliffhangers and boring design choices that left me yearning for what could have been, instead of what we got.",

            "content": "Please note that this review may contain minor spoilers. You have been warned.\r\n*Updated 20/06/2014 \r\n\"The world is filled with (___).\" -Kaiba\r\nThis anime has been called several names including \"'Danganronpa but less shitty.\" Were they right? Well... maybe. Both certainly have their pro's and con's and even though they are similar in terms of topic, I don't feel the need to compare them. \r\nToday I will be reviewing the highly anticipated yuri hyped anime known as Akuma no Riddle. \r\nStory - 6/10\r\nAkuma no Riddle (AnR for short) is set in a high school (because apparently nothing interesting ever happens outside of one) in which 12 assassinshave chosen to partake in some sort of a contest. The assassins share one common interest. Each with the goal of assassinating our main protagonist Ichinose Haru with the hopes that they will receive the prize that comes with it. A chance to make one request of any kind a reality, but if they fail their attempt they are expelled and forced to leave the competition. This is where our main heroine Tokaku comes to play. Even though her original mission was to assassinate Haru, she grows fond of her and decides to be the one that protects her. Now it is 11 assassins vs one target and a protector. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of the story isn't really unheard of with there being a competition in which one must kill to succeed, but I applaud it for trying to bring a more refreshing topic in mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this story is that after you finish the series it leaves you with no fulfillment. They manage to create so many asspulls and plotholes in one abrupt moment, that after you are finished with the series it makes you feel that everything you've learned or seen about the characters had no meaning in the end. You are just left there; confused with a bunch of questions unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough the style of art in an anime shouldn't be the deciding factor of whether or not its worth watching or not, (Ping Pong the animation being the greatest example I can think of) I constantly see my opinions being influenced because of it. I found myself having no problems with Akuma no Riddle's art quality. AnR's art quality was actually quite nice. It fits the quality of an 2014 anime (of a 2014 anime art style) and is actually above average during its high points. The fight scenes were interesting and nice to look at, but the art that really stood out for me was the custom ending's (ED's) made for each antagonist in the anime. I found that these were creative, well thought out, and well executed. These little things I feel help differentiate from your typical anime and is definitely refreshing to see.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of AnR is actually on par. The opening \"Soushou Innocence\" is very catchy, and has its high moments. (especially when it gets to the chorus) The different ED's was what made this area stand out. Choosing to play a different ending song every episode was very interesting and having it sung by the characters themselves was an exceptional bonus as well. The combination of these endings was what made each of them stand out on its own and was well executed. The OST's in this anime are okay, but none of them really struck me as something that stands out on its own. That being said, it wasn't bad. Overall as long as the soundtrack helped compliment the anime, then it has done its job, which I felt it has.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nThis is the section where I feel AnR required some work in. I enjoy yuri as much as the next person, but I felt that the other characters (the antagonists) were basically just catalysts for Tokaku and Haru to build their relationship and nothing more. Any form of character development from the antagonist's are thrown out of the window, as after their 'feature' episode, they are basically gone without any recognition in the later episodes except for possibly a few mentions. This is why this anime feels a bit empty. Any form of bond gained between the antagonist's and the viewers are cut, never to be seen again. (I should write my own drama novel lmao) Overall, i'm just disappointed in this section as if it payed more attention to its side characters it could have shined.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10 \\n\r\nOverall before ending - 7.5/10 Overall after ending - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that I did not regret watching this. Although there are components that prevented this anime from excelling,it was not done terribly.  Hell, i'd even recommend it to some people if they enjoy anime's like these with an assassination type feel, but it certainly wouldn't be the top choice i'd recommend for that type of anime. If the premise and the synopsis interest you, then you should check it out BUT lower your expectations. After finishing this series/ending with high expectations, I was quite dissapointed. There are some parts that are ridiculously stretched (when you find it, you'll see it clearly) and just dissapoints me because this anime had the potential to be so much more.

            "content": "One of the more anticipated series of the Spring season, this series definitely did not live up to those expectations. That being said, the series is very good. I mean, the entire series is based on teenage girl assassins, with very little side story. What's not to like? Throw a little yuri into it and it becomes a fairly interesting series. \r\nA brief summary: The story is set at Myoujou Academy, a private girls' boarding school. The 10th year's Kurogumi (Black) class has 12 assassins with their sights on one target, Haru Ichinose. Tokaku Azuma is a recent transfer student who is also targeting Ichinose,but she gradually develops feelings for Ichinose, and becomes her protector. And that's really all you need to know. The show's plot is very straight forward and basic at best. But it has a ton of action, with some puzzles that need to be solved. But the viewer doesn't really need to solve them. Tokaku solves them for you. LOL\\n\\n\r\nEach episode centers around one or two of the assassins and their attempt to assassinate Haru. During the episode, you learn of their motives, and reasoning behind why they are participating. Each assassin has a unique situation which drives them which is something I really enjoyed about the series. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the music and \"art\", they both were very good in the series. Each episode has it's own ED, which is very unique and something I rarely see. The character were drawn fantastically and the animation is spot on. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest negative I have is the length. I think the series could've used another few episodes to further explain things. At a few points, I felt the episode and series was being rushed a tad bit due to the time constraints.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Akuma No Riddle isn't the best series of the season, but it's far from being bad. It's filled with a ton of action, and doesn't stray too far from it's straight forward plot. The premise of the series kept me interested, and the series should keep you entertained if you aren't looking for a series that requires a ton of wit and thinking.\\n",

The characters indeed lack depth and development for viewers to sympathize with their hardships and trials, this include the two main characters Tokaku and Haru. The story didn't progressmuch from the given plot either as one can already predict exactly what will happen except maybe in the last few episodes which in my opinion have plot devices coming out of nowhere without proper build up.\\n\\n\r\n    However, with brain turned off, Akuma no Riddle can be quite enjoyable. The fight scenes have such fluid animation and are so fun that I didn't even mind much that they are unrealistic and in times dumb and does not make sense. The romance factor, though not as well handled as the action do have some of its moments and are able to entertain for a bit.\\n\\n\r\n    In conclusion, if you don't have anything else to watch, try Akuma no Riddle, why not? Though it's not exactly the \"I highly recommend this!\" type of anime, it can be fun. just don't question it's logic too much, your head will explode",

            "content": "(updated 9/19/18 to match format with other reviews, slight content revision)\r\nHi! Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Reviews! As always, the synopsis is your friend, and there could be SPOILERS but I do try my very best to avoid/minimize them. Working the dubbed version. If you've seen some of my reviews, I can be a little forgiving, but alas, Akuma no Riddle doesn't leave much room for positive elements. There are surely more wasteful anime out there, but there are MANY more that towers over this in quality, so there are better uses of your time. Will this make the RTLR wall of fame? Youmight be surprised!  Let's get into it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nThe entire premise of a prestigious school recruiting a special class of assassins to just kill a single target, and then impose tons of rules on how the hit can go down is just ridiculous beyond words. It would have made more sense for the assassins to find the target on their own means and attempt to attack than to pool them together and say 'wait your turn now!' They're all supposed to be pro killers, why would they ever even bother with this setup? There are better ways to write in a killer facing down her target than what we're given. Worse still, one assassin who has never killed yet somehow made the cut for a class of super killers, decides to protect the target character with what i would call murky motivations at best. The story comes across as a half baked thought someone scribbled on a napkin then, without further refinement, just threw it together. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad, the animation seemed to flow well from my perspective, though it was not anything to write home about. It was kind of middle of the road to slightly good side. Not much more to say on it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI dig the intro song, the rock style matches the theme of assassinations and action, so that's a positive, and in an interesting twist, each episode features a different ending song that is related to the assassin that was featured in that episode taking their turn to kill the target. Some of the songs are odd, but mostly they seemed to fit the assassin's they were written for. It was a nice touch and not something I've come across previously.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nAs I said, the main pacifist assassin doesn't really have a good reason to throw her lot in with the target, but does so anyway. The target is made to be somewhat mysterious in her background and such as an attempt to inflate the sagging story, but that fails as well. The target comes to a point where she admits she knows everyone's out to kill her, and is still cheery and ready for class each day. If I found out my entire class was only there to kill me, I think I'd play hookey for.....well forever! \\n\\n\r\nThe assassins' themselves are a mixed bag, some are cool, others are just disappointing. Each killer uses a personalized weapon, say a knife or a sword, or bombs and poison. This anime does feature one of my favorite characters, a split personality killer who is mild mannered by day, and stark raving mad and in a murderous rage at night. I like crazy girls, what can I say? There's also a weird set of an obviously older assassin who watches over a much younger one. This one tips way too close to an inappropriate relationship for my tastes. There are a few redheads that are basically slight variations of each other, and the 'MC' of the killer competition is just straight up annoying. \\n\\n\r\nIf not for Jamie Marchi's character (yes she's been in EVERYTHING but I'm a fan anyway) and the ultimately awesome hammer wielding Mahiru Banba, the assassin group would be a bore. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nI was not expecting much because the basic plot is clearly too contrived, but I watched, hoping for some awesome assassin action. There are a few moments, but not enough to justify the amount of time invested to see them. \\n\\n\r\nAs I came towards the end of the series, I could think of 3 or maybe even 4 twist endings they could use that would have just really made it so worth it, but again, what seems to be lazy or uninspired writing took the day and the show limped to the end. There are too much good anime to waste time on this one like I did. Strangely enough as much as I felt 'meh' about this anime, it ranked two pics on the wall, one purely for Banba (hammertime!) and one of the bodyguard and the target girl because I like romance, even when it's kinda limp. Still,  pass.",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle is a generic, edgy show that features edgy girls doing edgy things for edgy reasons. It is a bad series that I can not honestly recommend to anyone. For starters, the pacing was poor, with some sections proceeding at breakneck speeds, while others dragged. This is not one of the most glaring flaws, but is still present. The main flaw in this series stems from the poor writing. Characters develop seemingly randomly, motivations are shaky at best, and the resolutions at the end of each arc were unsatisfying at best. The poor writing means that the dialogue between characters is not justconfusing, but often times nonsensical, and leaves viewers lost. The soundtrack is also an issue in Akuma no Riddle, because the score seems to just play whatever at any given point in time. The music almost never fits the scenes, often times giving off mixed feelings, like being tense in a situation where nothing is actually happening, or going to happen. The final, fatal flaw in this series is the conclusion, which not only fails to wrap up the story, but instead leaves the viewer in shock. Nothing happens, and nothing is achieved. In conclusion, if you're looking for a poorly written action series featuring homosexual women, you've found your series, however if you're looking for a decent story with fleshed out characters, and a plot that is well-defined, you won't find it here.",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle: The Intriguing Battle Royale with Squandered Potential\r\nAkuma no Riddle was an interesting take on the battle royale genre, that ultimately failed in delivering its promising concept. I won't go through the story as the synopsis is written down, but I will address some mild spoilers so keep that in mind if you want to go in 100% blind.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nUnfortunately, the strongest aspect of this show was its plot. Most battle royale anime put a group of competitors against each other, with the last man standing as the winner. However, this show takes the concept and flips it on its head, by havingonly one murder target, while everyone else is a competitor. With such an interesting premise, I was expecting this show to be really well made. Although, despite having such a fantastic idea, the delivery was horrendous. Without spoiling the show, I'll mention that the main plot twists and threads are introduced not when it's relevant, but when it's convenient. This results in the progression being rather convoluted. The story doesn't flow naturally, and feels like it is constantly travelling back and forth between plot threads that are introduced with abysmal timing. Akuma no Riddle wasted so much potential, and it really hurts me to see such an awesome idea go to waste.\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art isn't exactly bad by any means, but it's nothing outstanding either. It's the kind of art you'd expect from a standard battle royale anime. At times the fight scenes had some interesting perspective shots that added to the intensity, but they were few and far between. If anything, these occasional jumps in quality were somewhat jarring to the show, and made the production quality feel inconsistent. The only time I really felt inclined to keep my eyes focused on the screen was during the opening. \\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound design is nothing to write home about. The effects are your run-of-the-mill style sounds, although the music was very well composed. The opening song got me excited to watch the show, and the music played throughout the show was used at the perfect times. I feel that sometimes, the music was a little unnecessary, but not exactly harmful either. It was there, but didn't at all impact the scene in any way. \\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nThis will by far be the longest part of my review, because the characters were so poorly written that I would've been better off watching Sword Art Online. Yes, I really do think they're that bad.\\n\r\nThe main character (Tokaku) is an apathetic edgy stereotype. She shows no empathy towards other characters and is constantly acting \"cynical\" however this cynicism simply comes across as blind and ignorant negativity. Although she strongly expresses her care for our side protagonist (Haru), she hardly ever gives her the respect she deserves. Tokaku acts like a two headed snake, doing anything she can to protect Haru one second, only to talk Haru's ideas and hopes down the next. As a protagonist, she blunders not only due to being cruel, but also due to her lack of relatability. \\n\r\nA key aspect of Tokaku's character is her lack of parents. Both her mother and father are deceased, and I imagine the creator of the manga did this to provide a motivation for her constant negativity. It doesn't really feel like a solid motivation though, and feels like a backstory someone would write for their Sonic OC. It doesn't make her character feel interesting or easier to sympathize with, it quite simply feels cliche and half-baked.\\n\r\nThe saddest part of the characters, is that despite Tokaku being the protagonist, every other character in the show was more fleshed out than her. That isn't to say that the other characters are well written though, because they still feel like one-dimensional stereotypes. Most characters only got one episode each, which didn't give viewers enough time to grow attached. We got around twenty-two minutes to see what drove them. While some characters had some thought provoking motives, others were basic, almost flat. Much like the animation, the character quality was inconsistent and felt jarring to the show's progression.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nDespite the harsh criticism I've given the show, I'll give credit where it's due. The music was an absolute blast to listen to, and the story itself had a really kick-ass premise with some interesting twists along the way. So, would I recommend this show? Well, it could serve as good background noise if you need that, but otherwise it isn't all that great.\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nI do think I am being a little harsh on this anime, but it isn't all that amazing regardless. Overall, I'll give it a 6/10. It lacked a lot of substance and could have done a lot more with some extra episodes and a good director.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review here. I hope you enjoyed it and thank you for reading.",

            "content": "(Spoiler Free)\r\nIn short, Akuma no Riddle is about a special class in My\u014dj\u014d Academy where 12 assassins are tasked with taking down the remaining classmate in the class they are grouped in.\r\nStory: 7\r\nI feel that the assassin theme is not new to anime culture, nor is it outdated in any way. I feel that adding this concept into a seemingly on the surface, slice of life anime makes it fresh, though, in reality this series is far from a slice of life. Seeing attractive young ladies showing their grit and fighting for their lives, is not something I've seen in many anime series, hence itseems kinda fresh in my perspective. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the progression of the storyline, the only thing that gets me down is the predictability of the progression of the series. It starts with a 1v1 duel and pretty much stays that way throughout the rest of the series. Platonic, but it is something i do not mind going back to after each episode\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in Akuma no Riddle is fantastic on the front of character design. All of the 13 girls each bear a strikingly distinct feature that sets them apart from the rest of the cast. All of these characters are beautifully drawn to life and are all pleasant to the eyes, as all girls are.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, one serious drawback in the art department would be the realism of the action sequences in the anime. There are times where fight sequences seem a tad bit too \"low budget\" with very underwhelming actions and repetitive simple animation. Yes, this is an anime on assassins. These people are trained to kill, but the anime struggles in illustrating what could be the most important selling point in the anime. The \"action\" in an \"action\" genre anime\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI personally feel that this is one of the aspects which Akuma no Riddle excels in. The anime is a short 12 episodes , and runs with a single opening. However not only is the opening engaging and fast paced, the 12 unique endings based on each character add spice to each episode, making the audience want to watch all the way to the end of the episode. This unique twist also allows fans of the different characters to take back a piece of their own, in the enjoyment of that particular character. Something that is very fresh in anime today, which I hope I can see more in the future\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nDespite the show's short running episode series, 12 episodes proved sufficient in capturing almost all of the different characters in the anime. Despite it being \"sufficient\". To introduce this much back story for each of the characters in such a short time is not just \"ok\". its a pretty damn good achievement on its own. Its a shame that the anime had to move so quickly, but I applaud the creators on that feat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nPersonally, I did quite enjoy myself while watching this anime. Most of the elements of the show blended in very nicely to make watching this anime worth the time spent. However, those looking for an intricate storyline, plot or ending may be a tad bit disappointed with this series, as it mainly centers around action and suspense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\n\"Worth your time watching!\"\\n\\n",

She and twelve other girls will make up the school's Black Class and all of them except one, Ichinose Haru, are assassins. The assassin to slayHaru will be rewarded with whatever they desire. Things shift when Tokaku develops feelings for Haru, vowing to protect her from the others even if it costs her her life.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start by looking at the issues with the narrative. There's really only one major complaint I have. The ending is pretty weak. There are parts of it that work but it tries way too hard to wrap everything up nicely and there are some things that really don't add up as a result. I can't really go into more details without giving major spoilers but if you've seen the anime you know exactly what I'm talking about. I will also say that the pacing isn't very good and the series quickly falls into a rhythm of having an assassin make an attempt on Haru's life every episode resulting in a match between her and Tokaku. I will give the series credit for being able to pull this off without it getting really samey and it's kind of understandable since the series has the same number of episodes as assassins, but it still leads to a sense that things are getting rushed.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the concept is compelling and it does keep you invested. The tension is really strong and there are a lot of really good sources for it be they mysteries about a character's past, a situation with one of the assassins that's particularly perilous or mysteries surrounding the scenario itself. I also like that Haru isn't a helpless damsel who can't do anything without Tokaku. She proves herself capable on several occasions and she even saves Tokaku a few times. The romance is also nicely done. It starts off kind of abruptly, but it gets a lot of good moments including a buddy breathing scene that's on par with Due South's, and it does develop into something really good. The series also has a really tragic episode about halfway through and it's very well done and handled.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is surprisingly strong. For a series with more major characters than episodes they do manage to give them all back stories, motivations and make them pretty well fleshed out. There are certainly characters who are better developed than others, but they do do really well overall. That isn't to say it's perfect. There are some issues with it. They use the pop culture version of dissociative identity disorder. There's also a part of Isuke's background that bothers me. She has two dads, no that isn't what bothers me, and calls one of them \u201cMama.\u201d I'm relatively certain that most gay couples do not have their adopted children refer to one of them by an opposite gender term and that that detail was just put in to make their family more \u201ctraditional.\u201d In fact, most gay couples just differentiate by using different terms like \u201cdaddy\u201d and \u201cpapa\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d and \u201cfather\u201d or \u201cpapa\u201d and \u201cvati.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of good aspects to the art. The character designs, mostly, are well done. Although I still have no idea why that one girl looks like a grade schooler. The action scenes are really well done with a lot of intensity. There are a lot of nicely done background details too. On the downside, the series is overly fond of fan-service\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOur leads are voiced by Suwa Ayaka and Kanemoto Hisako (the voice of Ika Musume). They both give solid performances. We also get great performances from Nanjo Yoshino (Canaan's Maria), Misawa Sachika (Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku's Reina), Uchida Mami and Yamada Yuki. Really, there aren't any badly done performances in this. The music is also really good. Interestingly enough, the ending themes change from episode to episode and all the major actresses get to perform either by themselves or as part of a duet and they're all really good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is a yuri series, the romance elements are a bit downplayed. About the most you get is going to be a hug here and there. Still, the relationship between Tokaku and Haru is really well done and there is some extra yuri on the side between Chitaru and Hitsugi. There's also the fact that Isuke has two dads but we never really see them together. So, the ho-yay factor is a 7/10. Don't come into this expecting a lot of snogging and romantic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle is an interesting series with some really good moments, intense action scenes, compelling characters and an intriguing plot. It's not perfect by any means and there are some head scratching decisions in it, but I still suggest checking it out since there are so many more things that it does well. My final rating for it is going to be an 8/10. Next week I'll look at Sengoku Otome : Momoiro Paradox.",

            "content": "Ah, another anime with a battle royale-esque plot just came out, but the question is, was it any good? Well, yes and no.\r\nSince I'm a huge fan of battle royale, I feel inclined to watch anything that has any resemblance to it's basic plot (Future Diary, DanganRonpa, Btooom!, etc) and Akuma no Riddle did not fail me in the slightest.\r\nStory (6) -\r\nAkuma no Riddle is set in a class full of 12 assassins that have the main goal of killing Haru Ichinose in exchange for a wish to be granted. However, one of the assassins, Tokaku Azuma, decides to help protect Haru against the others.\r\nIt'svery episodic for the majority of the show. Each episode is based around a new assassin trying to kill Haru and Haru somehow living with the help of Tokaku. This set up makes it very predictable, but doesn't make it any less interesting. Since it can be compared to so many other story lines, the story is nothing extremely original. Nevertheless, it never fails to be entertaining enough for you to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the ending was very disappointing, at least for me. Allow me to quote someone very important, who points out something that this anime totally ignores at the end.\\n\\n\r\n\"People die when they are killed.\" -Shirou Emiya (Fate/Stay Night)\\n\\n\r\nI do so hate it when stories neglect this.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7) -\\n\r\nThe character designs were one of the best things about this anime. Each looked completely different than the rest and they all looked really cool. The rest of the art was good, but nothing extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6) -\\n\r\nNothing really popped out when it came to the music within the show. The opening was good but nothing amazing. The endings are what really stood out, as there was an ending for each assassin when the episode was about them. They corresponded with the character and had really awesome music/visuals. Beyond the endings, the soundtrack was decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8) -\\n\\n\r\nWith a huge cast such as this, it would be hard to give them all the same amount of screen time or different character traits. However, this anime excels at giving them each their own backgrounds and quirks. Each assassin also has different wishes that are mentioned and expanded upon, as their wishes are the driving force for trying to kill Haru. The only one that didn't have that much originality was the main character, Tokaku. She was a tsundere. Thankfully she actually had a personality, as she loved Haru and had a past that haunted her enough to give her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important thing to mention is that the anime is considered yuri. However, the yuri factor isn't very prevalent. Sure, there was some hugging and group bath time but nothing really happened beyond that. That's alright with me but if you're a yuri fan, you might be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was left open-ended. However, it can be assumed that Haru and Tokaku do start dating, or at least remain very close friends. So, romance fans might also be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8) -\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for stories about characters trying to kill other characters. It's just something I'm into, don't judge me. If you like an entertaining story with great characters (and character designs) as well as some decent twists, then you should give this a go. Don't expect anything amazing, but expect a fun ride.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: A classroom with female assassins + Battle Royale = ...DanganRonpa 2.0?",

            "content": "A class full of assassins. Twelve assassins, all tempted with a reward for being granted anything, versus one student. One assassin has a reversal; a change of mind, to protect the student. Night after night, Tokaku Azuma fends off the schemes, traps, and ambushes of these assassins in order to keep Haru from being killed. (The premise is copy-pasted from my review on the manga; it has not changed between mediums.)\r\nAnd does this anime portray this story well? Like the manga - to which I have also given a poor score to - it does not.\r\nUnfortunately, the anime has not \"enhanced\" the value of themanga at all, aside from adding its intended attributes: visuals and audio. There are even some areas where the anime has perhaps made the viewing experience *worse*, due to the added intensity of clich\u00e9s and various other hackneyed devices already present in the manga. \\n\\n\r\nFor those not familiar with the manga, the only reason I would recommend the anime over it is because it is somewhat easier to understand from the get-go; although this improvement is only a smidge above.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nThe premise is actually interesting and has potential, but the execution and delivery of a good, gripping, and tense story of survival, deceit, and conspiracy is...futile, to say the least. There is very little, if any, messages to be derived from the series, and whatever messages it did attempt to convey are completely overshadowed by the sheer stupidity of tropes such as delaying the final blow, the overuse of dramatic pauses, and cheesy dialogue. In other words, this is an extremely frustrating and underwhelming show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am not of the belief that death is an absolute essential, even in a story such as this, the significance of life and living lacks any depth here. Which seems incredibly difficult to screw up with a protagonist like Azuma Tokaku, an assassin who is handicapped with the inability to kill, but the writing still manages to do so. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nMy original score for \"Character\" in my review for the manga was 3/10 (poor). So how does it get worse in the animation?\\n\\n\r\nAgain: the animation did not necessarily \"improve\" what was the manga was deficient in; aside from presenting a couple of scenarios more clearly. A few characters benefited from having voices and animations, such as Kaminaga and Takechi, but others had a reduced presence (even lacking their original backstories), such as Nio and Kenmochi. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it was the bluntly dull and trite dialogue, behavior, and interaction of the characters in animation format which made it all the more worse. As stated in my review of the manga, \"There were characters I very much wanted to \"understand\", but the writer refuses to develop and expand upon them. With a cast of killers, it should be expected that their resolve and reason for their resolve be explored...\"\\n\\n\r\nHaru's steadfast motivation to graduate Class Black remains redundant. Azuma's desire and reasoning to protect her remains redundant. The other eleven assassins just do not have enough screen-time to offer some variation from the redundancy of Haru and Azumas' interaction with one another. Therefore, it becomes difficult for the viewer to sympathize with either.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, very few assassins actually felt dangerous and deadly. Many were simply outdone by clich\u00e9 maneuvers such as shooting whatever may be hanging off the ceiling or not being a challenge at all to Azuma Tokaku's daggers, even if they were equipped with a firearm. This really lowers the viewer's expectations for the rest of the cast, which is not a good thing at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 4/7\\n\r\nFor once, the score for Sound > Art.\\n\\n\r\nI do not like admitting it, but I feel compelled to make a note of how badly action is conveyed in the animation. The battles, chases, traps, trials and tribulations...none of them were exciting or intense. Everything felt very \"slowed-down\", almost to the point of absurdity. This really contributed to the overall disappointment that can be felt from watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation feels almost undeserving of the musical score it has been coupled with. Atmospheric, eerie, and foreboding at times (e.g. Owari no Hajimari), percussive and inspiring at others (e.g. Mamoru Beki Mono); the soundtrack is excellent, but unfortunately oddly contrasted to the slow and rigid pace of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, it was not noticeably good, nor was it so horrible that I could not stand listening to it. It sits somewhere in the middle of the scale, probably gravitating towards the lower end. The voices clearly could not carry the burden of bad dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI could not enjoy this. And from reading the comments underneath the videos on the site where I watched Akuma no Riddle, many people did not either. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I did manage to finish it. I did not feel turned-off enough to stop at any point, but it did take me a little longer (about a week) to watch the last four episodes due to a lack of interest along the way. \\n\\n\r\n3/10 - Poor. Not an improvement from the manga. As such, my recommendation remains the same for what I have stated for the manga: I just would not recommend this.",

Why should they make every second one into something sticky, made of a concentrated purple goo? Yep, Akume no Riddle, it\u2019s about your creators.\r\nCharacters fap-fap-fap. I couldn\u2019t get a grip of the m=names, expect for Haru (Haru wo mamoru, I\u2019ll be saying this while doing illogical things). The main heroine is fit to become an ideal soldier, why don\u2019t they have more of her. And the others! Stamp in on stamp here, raw materials barely make a single line. Even in Danganronpa they had it kindamore livelily. Mi-nu-s.\\n\r\nDat logic made me getting a vicious dump. I thought the director is the laziest man in the world. I was about getting my on-duty washbowl, when\u2026 *spoiler*. And that\u2019s it! Everything fell into place. Then *spoiler* again. The problems I even wasn\u2019t aware of have got rid of. Yet the final scene disturbed the good impression, I think that\u2019s because some people have a bit too much vitality. But it\u2019s a plus.\\n\r\nThe same goes for the place. At first you are scrambled upon some black classes, assassins, way too elite schools\u2026 *spoiler* makes everything clear. The world at once becomes well-made and ready-to-defend-itself-against-your-criticism. Well yeah, just not bad, it has noting new or interesting in particular., and it\u2019s wasn\u2019t even planned that way. Simply plain.\\n\r\nGRAFICS. And SOUNDING. I frealing love it when each episode has its own ending theme. There are even descent ones. The opening is much more promising than the anime itself, and you can\u2019t ignore it. At least everything is pretty and well-animated! Characters fap-fap-fap (da voices even make my desire stronger), especially the red-haired one, left behind near the end. Haru is quite something too. And the school. And it\u2019s a plus.\\n\r\nThe plot. The plot. It seems there is one, but on the other hand \u2013 is it needed? \u2013 you think for yourself while watching before *spoiler* occurs. Then it happens, and\u2026 What\u2019s \u201cand\u201d? An artless \u201ckill or be killed\u201d story with a tiny bit of pure girls\u2019 love. The last episodes start to interpret the previous ones freely, adding up a certain degree of THE DRAMA, but without answering the questions. As I seem to respect THE DRAMA here, there\u2019s no minus.\\n\r\nWell\u2026 minus-plus\u2026 turns out to be a mediocre, casual anime which, however, has everything it takes to excite an unsophisticated viewer. If you don\u2019t look into details much, you can even gain pleasure of it. It ain\u2019t like you are anime for its final, right? Yet sure thing you won\u2019t be looking forward to the promised sequel, damn it\u2026 Have a look at cute schoolgirls? Here you go. They even have weapons! I don\u2019t know a man who\u2019d stay calm and, ermmm, not get excited.\\n\r\n5/10. It\u2019s normal; there are much more bad things. But for you to know \u2013 you should watch this BEFORE Danganronpa and stuff.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, if you're looking for an in-depth-review of this one, you won't find it here. I want to showcase this one only because it may feature one of the greatest anime-episodes of all time.\r\n[insert kanye-meme here]\r\nNo joke, I'm actually serious about that statement.\r\nNow, that we've got that out of the way, I want to recommend this series to anyone who's into Battly Royale'ish survival game-settings, girls-with-guns and/or anything yuri-related, who doesn't have amazingly high expectations and just want to consume a nice, little survival game thriller. You'll be pleased, at the very least.\r\nAkuma no Riddle (otherwise known by its hilariously Engrish alternate title Riddle Storyof Devil) has kind of a slow-ass pacing up until a certain point. While it maintains a slow speed in terms of storytelling in the first and second third, it is in a constant struggle with itself to keep things interesting and suspenseful on one hand and, on the other hand, to show off some (admittedly sometimes quite competently made) short-burst action sequences and fanservice. It does both with rather varying degrees of success, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is not the overall artistry of the series - I dig the character designs and the colorful presentation. The animation quality varies between \"alright\" and \"lots of stillframes\" with the occasional well-animated and -orchestrated action sequence. It's slightly above average in that department. The kickass OP and some of the EDs are nice to listen to, the seiyuus do a really good job at delivering their lines with just the right amount of cheese (especially Yuka Ootsuba is freakin' fantastic as Banba) and the overall OST is not an insult to the ears. So, all in all, AnR's art works well with what it's got.\\n\\n\r\nThe big problem I had with the series was its lack of focus, even though the plot is simple enough: The headmaster of Myoujou Academy has a bunch of girls assigned to the \"Black Class\". Their assignment is to kill Haru - a.k.a. Redhead McNicegirl - in order to graduate and become a professional killer. The only one of the \"Black Class\" who doesn't want to murder her dead is fellow classmate Tokaku - a.k.a. Bluehair McHardass. Instead, she makes it her mission to protect the target from the rest of the chicks, who take turns in trying to kill Redhair.\\n\\n\r\nEach classmate gets her own episode devoted to her respective backstory and her motivation to become a badass assassin/to assassinate the shit out of Redhair, which is a nice idea in and of itself. But as said above, it hurts the pacing of the show in the long run. It starts to pick up, however, in the most glorious way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \"payoff\" gets thrown around a lot when people talk about how a certain anime episode delivered a nice payoff - but holy sandals of Moses, the tenth episode of this series is completely worth the wait. It turns an otherwise fairly average yuri thriller show into a fucking rollercoaster ride of fun and awesome for twenty minutes. It's as if AnR throws off its own restraints and decides to go completely all-in on the viewer. And, for me at least, it worked perfectly. I was HOWLING with amazement at my TV screen during the entire duration of that one episode, even though (or, rather, because!) it was only a twenty minute long action scene that didn't stop to step on the gas until the end credits rolled.\\n\\n\r\nI really wish I could tell you more about it, but 1. I'd go into heavy spoiler-territory if I did so and 2. it would ruin the surprise. The series is coming out on Bluray (in Germany, at least) right now and I urge you guys to get it, if just for the sudden stroke of genius that is episode 10. The enjoyment of the rest of the series really depends on what you want out of it: if you want yuri, you'll get it, but only in short, concentrated bursts. If you're like me and you want a badass girls-with-guns-action show, you'll get it, but only in short, concentrated bursts. If you want suspense, you get it, but in short, concentrated bursts and with kind of a lackluster conclusion (even though the ending is wide open to interpretation).\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see a show, however, that makes complete use of its own and the potential of its medium for only one episode, you will definitely get it here.\\n\\n\r\n\"The world is full of ______\" (surprises)",

            "content": "With an interesting premise that is dark and alluring, this show looked very promising. The thing with some anime adaptations is that it\u2019s hard to pull off while the source material is still on-going. Studios and Staff that take on this type of project are now tasked with a challenging job of getting the execution right. Akuma no Riddle is sadly held back from the poor execution on many of the aspects, ideas and story elements it presented that prevents the show from being great.\r\nAdapted from Yun Kouga's manga, Akuma no Riddle follows the path of Tokaku Azuma, a seasoned assassin who transfers to aprivate boarding school in Myoujou Academy to attend Class Black. It consists of 13 students, 12 being assassins and 1 being the target in Haru Ichinose, a bright and cheerful girl who aims to become friends with her peers. Unknowing to her, things soon take a turn for the worst. The purpose of this Class is more of a test or game for the assassins, they have to find out who is the target among them and then assassinate her within the rules that have been established. The ruling is that the target must be informed that she is going to be targeted and killed and that it must happen within 48 hours after issuing the notice. Failing to follow the ruling or the completion of the assassination within the time frame has one expelled from Class Black. If successful, one is granted any wish of their desire.\\n\\n\r\nTokaku concludes that Haru is the target after thoroughly examining her peers and has her sights on her. She finds out that Haru will become her roommate and after spending the time to getting to know her more, she becomes drawn to her to the point where she defects to her side and becomes her protector as they both strive to graduate Class Black. This is how the story begins and I found this rather interesting. I like the whole idea of this survival concept but as the story progresses, it felt that it was following an episodic format where an episode is dedicated to each one of the girls trying to kill Haru. While we get some flashbacks about their past and how they came to Class Black, it leaves every character besides Tokaku and Haru one episode for development. This led to shallow characters, rushed conclusions and a drowned out overarching story which for the most part makes Akuma no Riddle fail to make anything meaningful. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where I felt Akuma no Riddle was lacking and it\u2019s how the show handles its characters. I wish there was more exploration with our main protagonists though we get to see their true self behind the fa\u00e7ade they put on and also learn important details of their past. For the rest of the characters, due to time constraints of only 12 episodes, it was a tough ask to get more from them or to care for them. This is a big flaw, given the setup of the show is extremely character driven and with the \u2018assassination of the week\u2019 approach it gives limited ways for development, which in this case comes from a flashback, what they want for their reward or how they failed the assassination. One episode for development is simply not enough to feel invested.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things to appreciate about Akuma no Riddle is its distinctive look and style. The world is well designed, the art style and colour palette used helped create a dark and eerie atmosphere which increased the intensity of the assassinations. The character designs were very well done and each character's look suited their personalities. Diomedea studio did ok with the animation, it was consistent despite drops in quality occasionally. Majority of the action scenes were very fluid and choreographed very well. An interesting choice the show implemented was the custom Ending that each episode got dedicated to each character of the series. I found that very creative and it added more content\u2014showing a little summary about their story.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is mainly fast-paced and dark atmospheric tracks to keep you engaged in the assassinations but no particular track was inherently memorable. Immediately I found myself hooked to the Opening song, \"Soushou Innocence\" by Maaya Uchida. It really sets the mood and tone for the series while also fitting the themes. As mentioned before, I was pleased by the custom Endings and to go along with the different animation used in each one was also different songs. This is what made the Endings so refreshing and another plus factor in the creativity category. I had no issues regarding the voice acting, each of the voices used fitted the design and personality of the character. They deserve praise for showcasing the characters true killer instinct perfectly both in and outside of the assassinations.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the series began, I noticed it had a \"Yuri\" tag but that was later switched with \u2018Shoujo-ai\u2019. Call me blind if I missed anything but there was no Yuri, sure there were hints with Tokaku and Haru's relationship but nothing serious or anything that would turn viewers off who may not like Yuri. The concept of survival game is nothing new but it did attempt to give it a bit more flair, something I can appreciate. The rating I had for it before the last two episodes was a bit higher but I had to bring it down because I felt the ending was anticlimactic and was disappointed on the route it chose. Despite its flaws Akuma no Riddle can still be an enjoyable thriller for those who like episodic series with lots of action, it has its moments and I felt that I may have enjoyed it a bit more if I didn\u2019t go into the show with high expectations.\\n",

            "content": "Anime Review No.8\r\nAkuma no Riddle an anime about 12 girl assassins enrolled in a prestigious private high school where they are gathered there for one reason and that is to kill the daughter of a very powerful and influential clan in japan. The plot is already not promising for it\u2019s kind of one sided. Oh come on? 1 vs 12 and they are assassins for crying out loud! But the story have a twist one of the assassins named Tokaku Azuma decided to protect her for unknown reason giving the targeted girl named \u201c Haru Ichinose\u201d a chance to survive. This anime is something youcan expect to be good because it\u2019s like the same with Mirai Nikki in terms of two partners helping each other to win the battle royal in a yuri type of way but entirely after finishing this show you will be disappointed for you can\u2019t understand what is going on about the show? \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWarning this review may contain spoilers but if you want to be save by not wasting your time to badly written animated show please here me out\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot (3/10)\\n\r\nThere are so many elements and events that make the plot badly written to the point you can\u2019t understand the show anymore. It\u2019s not your fault if you can\u2019t understand the show. It\u2019s the plot\u2019s fault for not giving proper explanation on what\u2019s going on. I list down below the major plot holes they carelessly didn\u2019t give a damn for the viewers to better understand the flow of the plot.\\n\r\n\uf0e8\t1st is that the Tournament rule mechanics is not properly explained. Even though they did explain the rules for just a \u201cfew seconds\u201d you can\u2019t understand what are the penalties and other alternatives that rule can offer. They just let the action do the explaining in which in the end just make the viewers and also me so confuse in what the heck is happening to the show. We don\u2019t know what happen to the girl if she failed to assassinate the girl and another thing is that does the rules even fair to begin with? The girls are randomly selected to kill haru but do the girls have the right to interfere just to give them the chance to kill haru in case the present challenger failed? The problem of the rules is it doesn\u2019t give a clear explanation how it works which make the battle royal pointless. \\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tAnother thing is that Haru background story is unclear why the black classes wanted to kill her. Being in an influential family is not enough for an explanation.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe logic of the show is screwed. Why do haru even push herself to study in a school where she already knows that all her classmates will attempt to kill her?\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tBeing friends with the people who will try to kill you is very stupid mindset even in the most common sense.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe show present flashbacks to characters at first it was understandable but as the story move\u2019s forward I cannot even understands each of the story.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe story is trying to make the characters feel dramatic or I call it the \u201cFEELS\u201d factor which is useless for the characters have no depth. You cannot make character depth in a few seconds of a flashback which is another weak factor for the plot.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe plot is so train wreck you cannot take it seriously for the action makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tLastly the biggest plot hole is that haru manage to survive just because the characters who have the 100% chance of killing her and win the game goes full retard in at the last second and always give Tokaku the \u201cprince charming figure\u201d the chance to save the damsel of distress from its assailants. Obvious plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10)\\n\r\nThe characters have no originality if you watched a lot of anime with typical stereotype of personalities it is not hard to identify.  Major weaknesses of the characters by the ff.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tIf you are going to kill someone never give a second thought that\u2019s not assassin like. The moment I always see this scene the more I discover this girls are not really mature assassins but immature children going on crazy because of puberty.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe logic of Tokaku being allied with haru is senseless. They just met for a few hours, talk about each other\u2019s pass and exchange some dialogues and boom what we got Tokaku changing of heart out of the blue\u2019s thought the so called manipulation ability of haru explained in the last episode make\u2019s sense but still it's confusing if you need to endure 11 more episodes.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tThe action\u2019s and logical reasoning of the characters is so predictable in the point you\u2019re annoyed.\\n\\n\r\n\uf0e8\tPretentious dialogues. My issues of this show for what they say is different on what they act.\\n\\n\r\nSound (2/10)\\n\r\nCharacters songs are pointless if you don\u2019t like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\r\nI will give an average score for the good action scenes, knife slicing, explosions and girl punches.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10)\\n\r\nI just enjoyed the small scale action and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\r\nThis anime is not about assassin being mature but it\u2019s just show killing people is \u201cImmature\u201d. Immature violence and nothing really happens in the story. Nobody dies and everybody lives happily ever after like the story just makes a reason for the girls to kill and hurt each other in the first place. \\n",

            "content": "Upon the understanding that a film, book or television show will feature assassins as its fundamental aspect, it\u2019s likely that the immediate set of expectations we receive from this falls along the imagery of thrill, excitement and aesthetics. Akuma no Riddle is very much a show that exhibits these types of expectations. It sets the stage for a high-school battle royale well enough by introducing 12 female assassins, each with their own desires, and one target, a girl striving to survive the oncoming ordeal. The assassins and target must all participate in Myoujou Academy\u2019s elusive Black Class, where they\u2019ll assume the guise of high-school students,and whoever is able to successfully kill the target may have their any wish granted. However, due to a twist of events, one assassin successfully defects to the target\u2019s side, vowing to protect her at all costs. It is quite an exciting premise and definitely promises those characteristic expectations of assassins. Unfortunately, Akuma no Riddle falls short on delivery of said expectations and is ultimately a weak series. That is not to say that it fails solely because of its lack of deliverance. Rather, the series\u2019 shortcomings can be directly attributed to a much greater, fundamental flaw located right at its very core. That and one particular misfire that brings down all hopes of the show had of being redeemed.\\n\\n\r\nThe particular assassin that defects to the target\u2019s (Haru Ichinose) side, is Azuma Tokaku, the central character of Akuma no Riddle. We are affixed to her presence from the show\u2019s very beginning and quickly learn that she is stoic, reserved and not the most determined assassin out of the bunch. Her reason for defection is not initially made clear by the series though this is not a hindrance but a gateway for speculation that Tokaku has become subtlety attracted to Haru. Tokaku is very much the protagonist of the series though, due to her newfound predicament, she finds Haru, the series deuteragonist, in her company more often than not. Haru is a surprisingly cheery and optimistic girl for a girl of her position, and her grand desire is to achieve friendship with the assassins and graduate from the Black Class, not as enemies but as friends. It seems to be a vain goal but, we learn that through Haru\u2019s past experiences, she has been shaped to think like this. The main characters don\u2019t have the strongest or most convincing characterization they could but, it is done well enough to make them interesting to follow. What\u2019s more interesting than their individual characteristics is their relationship. Tokaku and Haru share an inevitable bond that grows stronger with each assassination attempt, which is a pleasure to watch. It is probably one of the the series\u2019 greatest strength. It\u2019s not long before the series sets us free to discover the other 11 assassins and their motives. The quality of their characterization varies, but Akuma no Riddle sets out to define each and every assassin to their distinct character. However, the success of this greatly hindered by the great limitation of the series; its very own formula.\\n\\n\r\nHarkening back to the rules of the Black Class, assassins must hand in an advance notice to Haru in order for their assassination to be considered valid. From there, they must successfully execute their assassination within a 48-hour limit. Failure upon doing so means expulsion from the Black Class. In retrospect this is where the series limits itself. This is not an apparent limitation but it\u2019s how Akuma no Riddle handles this rule that causes the series to become restricted. From the start of the assassination game, the series decides to formally focus on usually one assassin and their assassination attempt per episode. This type of formula of focusing on a different character each episode is a familiar one, so it\u2019s all up to the execution to make sure that it\u2019s a effective episode with strong characterization and memorable moments. Akuma no Riddle fails to deliver here. With the confliction of the show\u2019s premise (Tokaku protecting Haru from her assassination), the 48-hour time limit and only one assassination attempt per assassin, it\u2019s obvious that there can be only one outcome. For the sake of the show to continue, it should be no surprise that Haru and Tokaku are able to prevail over their opponents, resulting in the opposing assassin being disqualified, never to be seen at Black Class again. This type of formula can get tired fast and yet, Akuma no Riddle decides to let it dictate nearly the entire series. It gets old seeing the same thing twice, nevertheless the 8th time as well. By deciding to have this formula, the series allows itself to become entrapped in a web of predictability. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens to the protagonists in each episode because you know what the outcome will be. Surprise is effectively killed, despite the series\u2019 best attempts to shake it up now and then. It is a breathe of fresh air when the series does this but the problem is that the formula is still there when it really shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s probably the most roundabout & counterintuitive way to execute the series\u2019 premise.\\n\\n\r\nPredictability is not the formula\u2019s sole crime however. A very important and much focused on aspect of this series is affected as well; characterization. Each episode has a focus character and the show wastes no time in its attempts to characterize them and flesh them out. However, with solely one episode to work on a character (who probably didn\u2019t get a lot of spotlight because prior episodes focused on different characters) Akuma no Riddle\u2019s attempts at characterization are ineffective and insubstantial. There\u2019s just not enough time to develop these assassin-of-the-week characters who won\u2019t be seen again and any attempts that are made are just shallow. Usually a good option for this one-episode-character trope is to have these characters leave an imprint on the main characters and have them develop instead. However, Akuma no Riddle has no desire to do this. It solely attempts to develop these side-characters who will ultimately have no significant outcome on the story. It is entirely futile and the series doesn\u2019t do a particularly good job at making us care for these characters anymore than we did before, no matter how tragic or reverent the character is. It\u2019s thanks to this formula of strictly focusing on side characters that the series forgets to focus on the more interesting aspects of the series, like Tokaku and Haru\u2019s relationship. If Akuma no Riddle had focused more on their relationship, we generally would have gotten character development that mattered and watching it would\u2019ve been more rewarding. \\n\\n\r\nWith surprise taken out and weak characterization in abundance, surely Akuma no Riddle should be able to soar with exciting, thrilling and aesthetic action. After all, the formula is not strict enough that it needs the action to subscribe to it. As I said earlier, Akuma no Riddle is not able to completely deliver upon these expectations. Assassinations are not as clever or exciting as one would expect. Most assassinations don\u2019t have much effort put into them, they lack effectiveness and creativity, almost as if the assassins aren\u2019t really trying to seriously kill Haru. Though this is unconvincingly addressed by the series later on, it doesn\u2019t make it any more engaging. There\u2019s a point where the series understandably breaks free from its formula, and surprisingly enough, it is almost able to redeem itself. The final three episodes are able to deliver thrilling revelations, truly exciting action and well-built momentum for an engaging, albeit confusing, finale.  However, it is what directly follows the finale that permanently sinks Akuma no Riddle. An epilogue that is meant to give closure to the series, while also attempting to please the viewer ends up becoming a complete misfire. It\u2019s confounding in its own right, but as a direct cause of being an immediate follow-up to the climax, it becomes incredibly jarring and backwards. The finale sets up a definite ending, one that is understandable, and a good one for the series. The epilogue completely rewrites this climax, undermining it as well as everything else the series had built up prior. The bizzarity of this epilogue is outstanding that it\u2019s almost surreal and its disparity with the rest of the series is too apparent. \\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle had all the pieces, but assembly led to mistakes that ultimately brought down the series. It is still has its enjoyable aspects however. Animation, while not incredibly impressive overall, conveys the fight scenes and action quite well and is without compromise. OST accompanies scenes well, and while nothing stands out, it fits into the background nicely. Character design does stand out thankfully and each assassin has a memorably distinct design, setting them apart from the rest. The OP \u2018Soushou Innocence\u2019 is notable in delivering a fittingly moody & energetic tune filled an aesthetic visual experience. Regarding the EDs, Akuma no Riddle generously gives nearly every assassin their own song which can serve as further characterization as to who they are. For example, the 8th ED \u2018Mayonaka no Toubou\u2019 is able to effectively exude the melancholic delusion of a character through its lyrics, tune and visuals. The art for these EDs are in good quality as well, matching the characters nicely and further indirectly characterizing them. It\u2019s a shame that the series was not able to deliver the same level of characterization with such conviction.\\n\\n\r\nEven with Akuma no Riddle becoming a slave to its own formula, it can still be enjoyed. Tokaku and Haru\u2019s relationship is pleasant to see (when it is actually focused on), the action is decent, reaching an all time high near the end, and some of the characters can still be entertaining (notably the ones given more prominence than others). However, its formula is its greatest enemy, bringing down the deliverance of expectations, characterization as well as the effectiveness of its story. Along with a questionable epilogue, Akuma no Riddle is weakened and restricted from crafting the exciting, thrilling and aesthetic battle royale it wanted to be.",

            "content": "The concept of the survival game and battle royal is very mainstream today and is favored also by many people, a lot of anime that uses this concept with the objective of achieving huge profits that  make anime these days feels more commercial. One of those anime is Riddle Story of Devil or commonly called Akuma no Riddle, a show that comes from Diomedea studio (known for the anime Squid Girl). The story is illustrated in Myojou Academy, a boarding school for women. The school has a special class named Black Class, containing 12 assassin who has a mission to kill 'the target' whichis in the same class as well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses of this anime is the supporting element of the story that almost didn't run at all, the concept of battle royal that usually thrill and exciting can not be felt. Also, the anime is not paying attention the importance of an originality of a masterpiece, the story didn't have an identity. Furthermore, Akuma no Riddle has a plot that is very common, the plot is not well organized and feels very easily predictable from the beginning, the ending looks very forced. There are plot holes that still empty until the end of the story. Exacerbated by many unexpected fan service appear everywhere like rain. These factors above really makes Akuma no Riddle very weak in the story section.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation possessed adequate existing standards, as well as the character design. But it doesn't fit with the story feeling, figure portrayed an assassin less on character design. \\n\r\nEven so, there is no problem in that their actions show. In terms of sound and music, Akuma no Riddle quite above average. The opening song very lively, the ending songs is quite interesting because each episode has their own ending songs. While the voice actor does their job adequately.\\n\\n\r\nDeepening the characters in this story concept is difficult, let alone this show consists just 12 episodes, very difficult to make an interesting character in that short periodic of time. This happens on Akuma no Riddle, the anime impose to tell all of the character's past. But do not notice how shallow the development of the character they make, which creates a backfire to the plot. The main character also has a very weak motive and irrational reason in helping the target.\\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle may have a lot of shortcomings in terms of story and character, but it didn't make this show very ugly until you want to dispose of this radioactive far away, maybe recommended for people who are looking for action and fight rather than a story. \\n\r\nFinally, you like it or did not it depends on you.",

And incidentally, we have an angel-like character with and energetic personality named Haru Ichinose who gets herself into a mess that threatens her very existence. Luckily, she\u2019s not alone because Haru\u2019s got a protector. Her name is Tokaku Azuma and she is not a pushover, not in the art of assassin anyways.\r\nTo call Akuma no Riddle a memorable art piece though could be both an understatement and overstatement. For starters, we have a diverse and colorful cast ofcharacters who transfers into the infamous all-girls school known as Myojo Academy. One particular class stands out known as the \u201810th Year Black Class\u2019. It\u2019s here where the show tells its story as Haru is marked a target for death by the other transfer students. As a show based on setting of survival, the premise tells of a different setup. Rather than a free-for-all and every killer for themselves, it\u2019s all against Haru. Apparently, the victor gets themselves a wish, something that I\u2019m sure almost everyone wants if they ever had a chance to make a fantasy into a reality. While all this seems interesting at first, the first episode only introduces its premise that is underwhelming. The premise serves a device to show the deadly game as Haru becomes the prey and the transfer students are the predators. It\u2019s easy to figure out the concepts of the game though since the show explains itself early on with the mechanics. The part where it gets confusing is the ultimate purpose of the game. Mystery draws out throughout the show like a riddle with characters in the background such as Nio Hashiri to spellbind the audience\u2019s curiosity.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show, there\u2019s an instinctive towards the assassin\u2019s motivations, which differs between every character. However, one prominent attribute involves Tokaku\u2019s will to protect Haru from harm. Her motivation is uncertain besides a few cryptic hints relating to possibly Haru\u2019s past and herself. In essence, the show is one big riddle with her motivations and how they fight for survival at the school. For Tokaku and Haru, they develop a close and innate relationship spawned by the time they spent together. Existing as polar opposites, there\u2019s some development between the two although the duo feels incompatible. For instance, Tokaku is someone who hates others getting close to her and dislike people referring by her first name. On the other hand, Haru is energetic, sociable, and often tries to brighten a gloom and doom atmosphere. Curiosity spawns as how these two can co-exist together as a duo when their lives are at stake every single day at the academy.\\n\\n\r\nLike mentioned before, each assassin is different with a different personality and even killing method of choice. In total, there are 12 of them including Azuma. Here\u2019s where the problem comes in when it follows the adaptation. The manga has only been publishing for about a year and its inconclusive how it will end. In other words, the anime braces itself for a possible anime original ending. But that\u2019s not really the main problem. The main flaw here is characterization and development of the assassins. As a one cour show (12 episodes), the show implies that each assassin gets only about a full episode of screen time. That\u2019s also fallacious because in one particular episode, three assassins are eliminated all the same time while one of them didn\u2019t even get her own chance at Haru\u2019s life. In retrospect, it means that there will hardly be any concentration or focus on an assassin\u2019s character. The only focus it spends is the flashbacks that often feels too centralized, predictable, and sometimes clich\u00e9. Director Keizou Kusakawa appeals to the audience with his gimmicks that quickly turns itself into a twisted game as each episode progresses on. More and more students are \u201ctransferred out\u201d of the class, but in reality are expelled/killed. His previous works on series such as Sekirei and Campione also relied on a main character to fight for glory and triumph against other skilled adversaries. Here, it follows a similar suit only that it seems episodic in nature. By worst, the series also likes to pull out some oddball conclusion with its finale that seemingly circumnavigate backwards with its original theme but destroying the grim feelings of despair. Perhaps the unaired special OVA will find its way to depict a more accurate image.\\n\\n\r\nDiving into this show also will feel like dark academy adventure. To get the best experience, it would be to familiarize yourself with the various characters. This could be a problem since most of them are hardly relatable as result of their weak development. Not to mention the fact that all the assassins have deadly skills, it\u2019s hard to picture yourself in their shoes in the first place. But luckily, there is a catch of diversity. Each episode offers something new with the characters. They attempt to kill Haru with every chance and seizes that opportunity. The methods they formulate results in creative ideas that although seems gimmicky but is also unorthodox in an unique sense. These include diffusing strategically placed bombs, fighting on stage in front of an audience in the disguise of a school play, or even literally solving riddles. And to further diversity themselves, each character has a different persona whether it\u2019s a sadist (Isuke Inukai), innocent little girl (Hitsugi Kirigaya), assertive (Koko Kaminaga), or even one with dual personalities and among others. Haru\u2019s presence creates a strange vibration between some of these characters as she is too fragile and incomparable to them. It mixes in the wrong way when it comes to developing any sort of relationship with them. And because they are assassins, the only relationship is decided by life and death.\\n\\n\r\nA variety of themes is dealt with throughout the show whether it\u2019s friendship, jealousy, regret, or vengeance. It explores the basics of human nature in a dark way since most of the characters seems to have a troubling life based on the various flashbacks. But these concepts don\u2019t have a profound way to express themselves. Looking at on the surface, there\u2019s a feeling of cuteness molded with dark configuration. Even the girls that fights for \u201cjustice\u201d plays roles as anti-heroes rather than a figure of admiration. But for what\u2019s worth, Azuma perhaps the most dynamic character for her self-motivation to protect Haru. In attempts to protect Haru, we learn more about Azuma including parts of her past and visage as an assassin. We also see different sides of her through the relationship between the duo. But ultimately, this comes down to storytelling as the main premise is still intact throughout the series. As Haru is the main target, their relationship is tested by the human nature and instinct.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also explicitly shown that the show does take itself seriously, perhaps too much for its own good. Whether these are the taunting riddles, intimidating expressive eye gestures, or even torture scenes, the show makes its oddball point. But despite this dark nature, it also tries to humor the audience with its gags. These include the yuri vibes between some characters including Haru and Azuma. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising considering the way the show is setup. But other tactics of humor attempt often includes Haru\u2019s lack of sense and the denseness of the classes\u2019 teacher, Ataru Mizorogi. From a motivational case, this doesn\u2019t work right since the show has a grim and more mature setting. The girls are dead serious on killing Haru so when comedy sometimes come into play, it doesn\u2019t balances itself right.\\n\\n\r\nDiomed\u00e9a, known for their previous involvement with other game scenario-esque shows such as Problem Children and NouCome adapts similar gimmicks. Only this time, it focuses on the deadly side with its character designs. In fact, every character in the show has an appeal to color themselves as a competitor. Some seems intimidating while others are innocent but all the assassins are deadly in respect when they show their true colors. This is shown prominently by how the camera focuses exclusively on their eyes. It depicts the anti-thesis of schoolgirls are like, especially in a prestigious school. They hide their true nature until the moment comes to strike just like assassins. As far as their face gesture, it crafts this gimmick right by nature. Character outfits are also decorative with distinctive figures to match their personalities. However, do expect some fan-service when it comes to pool episodes, censored bath scenes (TV version) and the shock violence that comes out as cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn\u2019t a super powerhouse but does works very well as a supplement to this show when it works with the characters. The most noticeable aspect involves the ED songs as each assassin gets her own theme song (when the episode focuses on them). The OP song remains unchanged however with depiction of the assassins in femme fatale like poses and a catchy aesthetic rhythm. Not to mention, the song contains some spoilerish scenes involving their weapons. For most of the character voices, they show their tone of intimidation and violence. I\u2019d give credit to most of their mannerisms to stay consistent with the characters. However, Haru\u2019s voice mannerism greatly contradicts this with her innocent nature. We also get a variety of soundtrack to depict the heavy action toned sequences. Some works out right while others feels repetitive but ultimately does the job to craft a decent balance of sound mixture.\\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle\u2019s endgame is the fact that the show focuses exclusively more on story rather than character development. Demanding for that would leave you unsatisfied. After all, the ultimate goal of the show is to deliver Haru\u2019s execution and fulfill the wish of an assassin. While all this sounds dandy, it also tries desperately to appeal to the audience with its misplaced comedy, shadowy flashbacks, and shallow character relationships. And although it showcases yuri at times, it isn\u2019t a prominent feature to that end either. But the show does offer great diversity with its colorful character cast. For all its faults, the show\u2019s raison d'etre can still be appealing and leave audience wonder who or what happens next. Make no mistake though. This show isn\u2019t just some Romeo and Juliet story about two girls but rather their tale of survival. Because in their world, the strongest prevail and the weak perish.",

            "content": "Ok, so this is my first review and I'll be as honest and thorough as possible for an readers.\r\nOk so basically Akuma no Riddle is about a girl named Haru who has to survive a classroom full of assassins.  That's really the gist of it.  That being said, let me move on to my scores and why I rated them as such.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story was very much lacking in this show, and I say that with utter disappointment.  This was a show that when it first started, had the set up to be an awesomely written masterpiece full of character development andplot twists.  Sadly, that didn't happen.  I was hoping for characters that were in the class for ulterior motives, or that had such an elaborate plan that it lasted longer than one episode.  This didn't happen at all.  This show is basically a generic battle-royal.  Not that I have anything against battle-royal style anime and manga, but I honestly expected more out of the show and its characters.\\n\r\nThe other disappointing thing, was that whenever a particular assassin was the focal point of an episode, that was it.  They got one episode and then done.  They got two episodes only if they didn't start their battle in the beginning of their first one.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good.  It wasn't anything stellar and it certainly had some horrifically drawn moments, but those were very rare and it had plenty of other scenes where the art looked excellent.  Not a master piece, but certainly above average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound was probably the highlight of the show.  The tracks during the fight scenes were good, and the tracks during emotional scenes were good as well.  The best part however, were the OP and the EDs.  The OP was amazing, and each assassin had her own ED.  So basically when it was that assassin's turn in the show, it played their ED at the end.  All of the endings were unique and very very good.  The lyrics also reflected the characters extremely well.  If you are a fan of anime music, this would definitely be a reason to check out the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThis pretty much plays off the same reasoning I had with the story score.  Just as there was a lack of plot twists and really good story development, there was an extreme lack of character development as well.  None of the characters were outright terrible to begin with, and some were more interesting than others off the bat.  Their personal reasons for wanting to assassinate Haru were pretty much all interesting too, but that's all you get from them.  Like I said under story, after they get their one episode spotlight, that's it.  So character development really becomes impossible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI rate this as high as I do, simply because I enjoyed it for what it was; a battle-royal high school anime.  Sure if I take into account the poor story, lack of character development, and the ending (wont spoil it at all, but just me personally, I didn't enjoy it) then I would rate it a lot lower.  That's precisely why my overall score is lower.  BUT if you take the show at face value and just accept it for being a generic battle-royal with a bunch of fighting between unique assassins, then it's pretty entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nWhen I take every part of the show into consideration, I cant score it anything better than mediocre.  While it didn't completely blow at anything, it didn't excel at anything either, especially in parts it should have.  The story could have been SOOO much more, and along those lines a better story could have brought much more in depth characters.  I wont say it isn't enjoyable to watch, but if you're looking for some masterpiece of a story, with characters that will blow your mind, then this show is not for you.  If you're just looking for an action anime, with good music and very minimum yuri, then you might want to take a look at Akuma no Riddle.  \\n\\n\r\nJust an extra tid-bit here - but if you're one of those people that flocks to the manga to get more details or if the anime has a bad adaptation, then don't.  This is one of the EXTREMELY RARE cases where the anime is better than the manga...and I mean significantly better.",

Well Haru is one of the most annoying anime charaters i've ever faced,her life is threaten daily and she faces her possible assasins with an annoying smile and a way ofa total unrealistic looseness and kindness\\n\\n\r\nStory:Its swallow and total unrealistic in many ways.\\n\\n\r\nI am really pissed off with this anime cause  first episodes  gave me the impression of something good.Truth is that it is just  an awkard situation where a girl goes to school with some assasins and she is trying to be friends with them, even though she knows they want her in pieces. 5.5/10 its my score graphs and OSTs save it for the day",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle was an interesting anime. But not in a good way. Potential seems to be the name of the game now-a-days, and if you have it you must be good, right? This was an example of that being completely, and truly, false.\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nIf you're here, you've probably heard this anime referred to as the \"DanganRonpa with Yuri\". As of  finishing the series, I can assure you, that this was partially true. This, like DanganRonpa, had a lot of potential and a very interesting plot going in. This also shares DanganRonpa's somewhat bad traits by having everything culminate into next to nothing.However, in Dangan, it's next to nothing. Here, we get absolutely nothing. Nothing changes throughout the course of the series, and it leaves me with a very bland feeling that nothing was accomplished after 12 episodes.\\n\r\nNow, this would be minor spoilers, but the tags on MAL are wrong. If you are watching this purely for Yuri, you will be extremely disappointed. There is very little Yuri, if you could even call it that. Maybe if you have some pretty intense Yuri googles, you might enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nLet's be honest, the art is really good, and the animation is beautiful. I do recognize that it is 2014, but we still have shows like Kill La Kill that look terrible. Yes, I know that money is a factor, but it still doesn't excuse poor animation. Anyways, the animation in Akuma no Riddle is very fluid and looks amazing. Very few corners were cut here, and we don't have books covering peoples mouths so they didn't have to animate them talking...\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThis is and Art are the only places Akuma no Riddle shines. This anime had some very enjoyable OST's that really fit the feel and mood of the show. But the thing that really stood out to me was that each ending of this show is unique, and each has a unique song. This is something that may have been done before, but I have never seen this before, and it shows that the creators at least put something into creating this show. I liked this most of all, but I'm not someone who's big on the OP/ED of shows. I much prefer the actual content, and a bad/good opening/ending doesn't really reflect the content within the show for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 4/10\\n\r\nThe way the story develops the characters is in a really poor way. It goes the route of introducing them each individually. Then, it will give you the characters backstory. The problem with this is all the side characters shove out the mains and leave them with less development time. I'm not fan of this way of character development at all because now I feel like I know next to nothing about any of the characters, because the screen time was too evenly split. Therefore, it's more like things doing actions rather than an actual character you can grab on to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment - 4\\n\r\nHonestly, I was very disappointed by Akuma no Riddle. I thought it would be this new innovative anime that would really try to branch out and do its own thing and end up amazing. This was not the case as it reverted to the old tried and true methods that we've all seen before.\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, I would not recommend this anime to almost anyone, as it has my cliffhangers and boring design choices that left me yearning for what could have been, instead of what we got.",

            "content": "Please note that this review may contain minor spoilers. You have been warned.\r\n*Updated 20/06/2014 \r\n\"The world is filled with (___).\" -Kaiba\r\nThis anime has been called several names including \"'Danganronpa but less shitty.\" Were they right? Well... maybe. Both certainly have their pro's and con's and even though they are similar in terms of topic, I don't feel the need to compare them. \r\nToday I will be reviewing the highly anticipated yuri hyped anime known as Akuma no Riddle. \r\nStory - 6/10\r\nAkuma no Riddle (AnR for short) is set in a high school (because apparently nothing interesting ever happens outside of one) in which 12 assassinshave chosen to partake in some sort of a contest. The assassins share one common interest. Each with the goal of assassinating our main protagonist Ichinose Haru with the hopes that they will receive the prize that comes with it. A chance to make one request of any kind a reality, but if they fail their attempt they are expelled and forced to leave the competition. This is where our main heroine Tokaku comes to play. Even though her original mission was to assassinate Haru, she grows fond of her and decides to be the one that protects her. Now it is 11 assassins vs one target and a protector. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of the story isn't really unheard of with there being a competition in which one must kill to succeed, but I applaud it for trying to bring a more refreshing topic in mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this story is that after you finish the series it leaves you with no fulfillment. They manage to create so many asspulls and plotholes in one abrupt moment, that after you are finished with the series it makes you feel that everything you've learned or seen about the characters had no meaning in the end. You are just left there; confused with a bunch of questions unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough the style of art in an anime shouldn't be the deciding factor of whether or not its worth watching or not, (Ping Pong the animation being the greatest example I can think of) I constantly see my opinions being influenced because of it. I found myself having no problems with Akuma no Riddle's art quality. AnR's art quality was actually quite nice. It fits the quality of an 2014 anime (of a 2014 anime art style) and is actually above average during its high points. The fight scenes were interesting and nice to look at, but the art that really stood out for me was the custom ending's (ED's) made for each antagonist in the anime. I found that these were creative, well thought out, and well executed. These little things I feel help differentiate from your typical anime and is definitely refreshing to see.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of AnR is actually on par. The opening \"Soushou Innocence\" is very catchy, and has its high moments. (especially when it gets to the chorus) The different ED's was what made this area stand out. Choosing to play a different ending song every episode was very interesting and having it sung by the characters themselves was an exceptional bonus as well. The combination of these endings was what made each of them stand out on its own and was well executed. The OST's in this anime are okay, but none of them really struck me as something that stands out on its own. That being said, it wasn't bad. Overall as long as the soundtrack helped compliment the anime, then it has done its job, which I felt it has.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nThis is the section where I feel AnR required some work in. I enjoy yuri as much as the next person, but I felt that the other characters (the antagonists) were basically just catalysts for Tokaku and Haru to build their relationship and nothing more. Any form of character development from the antagonist's are thrown out of the window, as after their 'feature' episode, they are basically gone without any recognition in the later episodes except for possibly a few mentions. This is why this anime feels a bit empty. Any form of bond gained between the antagonist's and the viewers are cut, never to be seen again. (I should write my own drama novel lmao) Overall, i'm just disappointed in this section as if it payed more attention to its side characters it could have shined.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10 \\n\r\nOverall before ending - 7.5/10 Overall after ending - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that I did not regret watching this. Although there are components that prevented this anime from excelling,it was not done terribly.  Hell, i'd even recommend it to some people if they enjoy anime's like these with an assassination type feel, but it certainly wouldn't be the top choice i'd recommend for that type of anime. If the premise and the synopsis interest you, then you should check it out BUT lower your expectations. After finishing this series/ending with high expectations, I was quite dissapointed. There are some parts that are ridiculously stretched (when you find it, you'll see it clearly) and just dissapoints me because this anime had the potential to be so much more. If you are planning to watch this anime don't expect this to be a breakthrough in its genre or you will be quite dissapointed.",

            "content": "One of the more anticipated series of the Spring season, this series definitely did not live up to those expectations. That being said, the series is very good. I mean, the entire series is based on teenage girl assassins, with very little side story. What's not to like? Throw a little yuri into it and it becomes a fairly interesting series. \r\nA brief summary: The story is set at Myoujou Academy, a private girls' boarding school. The 10th year's Kurogumi (Black) class has 12 assassins with their sights on one target, Haru Ichinose. Tokaku Azuma is a recent transfer student who is also targeting Ichinose,but she gradually develops feelings for Ichinose, and becomes her protector. And that's really all you need to know. The show's plot is very straight forward and basic at best. But it has a ton of action, with some puzzles that need to be solved. But the viewer doesn't really need to solve them. Tokaku solves them for you. LOL\\n\\n\r\nEach episode centers around one or two of the assassins and their attempt to assassinate Haru. During the episode, you learn of their motives, and reasoning behind why they are participating. Each assassin has a unique situation which drives them which is something I really enjoyed about the series. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the music and \"art\", they both were very good in the series. Each episode has it's own ED, which is very unique and something I rarely see. The character were drawn fantastically and the animation is spot on. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest negative I have is the length. I think the series could've used another few episodes to further explain things. At a few points, I felt the episode and series was being rushed a tad bit due to the time constraints.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Akuma No Riddle isn't the best series of the season, but it's far from being bad. It's filled with a ton of action, and doesn't stray too far from it's straight forward plot. The premise of the series kept me interested, and the series should keep you entertained if you aren't looking for a series that requires a ton of wit and thinking.\\n",

The characters indeed lack depth and development for viewers to sympathize with their hardships and trials, this include the two main characters Tokaku and Haru. The story didn't progressmuch from the given plot either as one can already predict exactly what will happen except maybe in the last few episodes which in my opinion have plot devices coming out of nowhere without proper build up.\\n\\n\r\n    However, with brain turned off, Akuma no Riddle can be quite enjoyable. The fight scenes have such fluid animation and are so fun that I didn't even mind much that they are unrealistic and in times dumb and does not make sense. The romance factor, though not as well handled as the action do have some of its moments and are able to entertain for a bit.\\n\\n\r\n    In conclusion, if you don't have anything else to watch, try Akuma no Riddle, why not? Though it's not exactly the \"I highly recommend this!\" type of anime, it can be fun. just don't question it's logic too much, your head will explode",

            "content": "(updated 9/19/18 to match format with other reviews, slight content revision)\r\nHi! Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Reviews! As always, the synopsis is your friend, and there could be SPOILERS but I do try my very best to avoid/minimize them. Working the dubbed version. If you've seen some of my reviews, I can be a little forgiving, but alas, Akuma no Riddle doesn't leave much room for positive elements. There are surely more wasteful anime out there, but there are MANY more that towers over this in quality, so there are better uses of your time. Will this make the RTLR wall of fame? Youmight be surprised!  Let's get into it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nThe entire premise of a prestigious school recruiting a special class of assassins to just kill a single target, and then impose tons of rules on how the hit can go down is just ridiculous beyond words. It would have made more sense for the assassins to find the target on their own means and attempt to attack than to pool them together and say 'wait your turn now!' They're all supposed to be pro killers, why would they ever even bother with this setup? There are better ways to write in a killer facing down her target than what we're given. Worse still, one assassin who has never killed yet somehow made the cut for a class of super killers, decides to protect the target character with what i would call murky motivations at best. The story comes across as a half baked thought someone scribbled on a napkin then, without further refinement, just threw it together. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad, the animation seemed to flow well from my perspective, though it was not anything to write home about. It was kind of middle of the road to slightly good side. Not much more to say on it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI dig the intro song, the rock style matches the theme of assassinations and action, so that's a positive, and in an interesting twist, each episode features a different ending song that is related to the assassin that was featured in that episode taking their turn to kill the target. Some of the songs are odd, but mostly they seemed to fit the assassin's they were written for. It was a nice touch and not something I've come across previously.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nAs I said, the main pacifist assassin doesn't really have a good reason to throw her lot in with the target, but does so anyway. The target is made to be somewhat mysterious in her background and such as an attempt to inflate the sagging story, but that fails as well. The target comes to a point where she admits she knows everyone's out to kill her, and is still cheery and ready for class each day. If I found out my entire class was only there to kill me, I think I'd play hookey for.....well forever! \\n\\n\r\nThe assassins' themselves are a mixed bag, some are cool, others are just disappointing. Each killer uses a personalized weapon, say a knife or a sword, or bombs and poison. This anime does feature one of my favorite characters, a split personality killer who is mild mannered by day, and stark raving mad and in a murderous rage at night. I like crazy girls, what can I say? There's also a weird set of an obviously older assassin who watches over a much younger one. This one tips way too close to an inappropriate relationship for my tastes. There are a few redheads that are basically slight variations of each other, and the 'MC' of the killer competition is just straight up annoying. \\n\\n\r\nIf not for Jamie Marchi's character (yes she's been in EVERYTHING but I'm a fan anyway) and the ultimately awesome hammer wielding Mahiru Banba, the assassin group would be a bore. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nI was not expecting much because the basic plot is clearly too contrived, but I watched, hoping for some awesome assassin action. There are a few moments, but not enough to justify the amount of time invested to see them. \\n\\n\r\nAs I came towards the end of the series, I could think of 3 or maybe even 4 twist endings they could use that would have just really made it so worth it, but again, what seems to be lazy or uninspired writing took the day and the show limped to the end. There are too much good anime to waste time on this one like I did. Strangely enough as much as I felt 'meh' about this anime, it ranked two pics on the wall, one purely for Banba (hammertime!) and one of the bodyguard and the target girl because I like romance, even when it's kinda limp. Still,  pass.",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle is a generic, edgy show that features edgy girls doing edgy things for edgy reasons. It is a bad series that I can not honestly recommend to anyone. For starters, the pacing was poor, with some sections proceeding at breakneck speeds, while others dragged. This is not one of the most glaring flaws, but is still present. The main flaw in this series stems from the poor writing. Characters develop seemingly randomly, motivations are shaky at best, and the resolutions at the end of each arc were unsatisfying at best. The poor writing means that the dialogue between characters is not justconfusing, but often times nonsensical, and leaves viewers lost. The soundtrack is also an issue in Akuma no Riddle, because the score seems to just play whatever at any given point in time. The music almost never fits the scenes, often times giving off mixed feelings, like being tense in a situation where nothing is actually happening, or going to happen. The final, fatal flaw in this series is the conclusion, which not only fails to wrap up the story, but instead leaves the viewer in shock. Nothing happens, and nothing is achieved. In conclusion, if you're looking for a poorly written action series featuring homosexual women, you've found your series, however if you're looking for a decent story with fleshed out characters, and a plot that is well-defined, you won't find it here.",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle: The Intriguing Battle Royale with Squandered Potential\r\nAkuma no Riddle was an interesting take on the battle royale genre, that ultimately failed in delivering its promising concept. I won't go through the story as the synopsis is written down, but I will address some mild spoilers so keep that in mind if you want to go in 100% blind.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nUnfortunately, the strongest aspect of this show was its plot. Most battle royale anime put a group of competitors against each other, with the last man standing as the winner. However, this show takes the concept and flips it on its head, by havingonly one murder target, while everyone else is a competitor. With such an interesting premise, I was expecting this show to be really well made. Although, despite having such a fantastic idea, the delivery was horrendous. Without spoiling the show, I'll mention that the main plot twists and threads are introduced not when it's relevant, but when it's convenient. This results in the progression being rather convoluted. The story doesn't flow naturally, and feels like it is constantly travelling back and forth between plot threads that are introduced with abysmal timing. Akuma no Riddle wasted so much potential, and it really hurts me to see such an awesome idea go to waste.\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art isn't exactly bad by any means, but it's nothing outstanding either. It's the kind of art you'd expect from a standard battle royale anime. At times the fight scenes had some interesting perspective shots that added to the intensity, but they were few and far between. If anything, these occasional jumps in quality were somewhat jarring to the show, and made the production quality feel inconsistent. The only time I really felt inclined to keep my eyes focused on the screen was during the opening. \\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound design is nothing to write home about. The effects are your run-of-the-mill style sounds, although the music was very well composed. The opening song got me excited to watch the show, and the music played throughout the show was used at the perfect times. I feel that sometimes, the music was a little unnecessary, but not exactly harmful either. It was there, but didn't at all impact the scene in any way. \\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nThis will by far be the longest part of my review, because the characters were so poorly written that I would've been better off watching Sword Art Online. Yes, I really do think they're that bad.\\n\r\nThe main character (Tokaku) is an apathetic edgy stereotype. She shows no empathy towards other characters and is constantly acting \"cynical\" however this cynicism simply comes across as blind and ignorant negativity. Although she strongly expresses her care for our side protagonist (Haru), she hardly ever gives her the respect she deserves. Tokaku acts like a two headed snake, doing anything she can to protect Haru one second, only to talk Haru's ideas and hopes down the next. As a protagonist, she blunders not only due to being cruel, but also due to her lack of relatability. \\n\r\nA key aspect of Tokaku's character is her lack of parents. Both her mother and father are deceased, and I imagine the creator of the manga did this to provide a motivation for her constant negativity. It doesn't really feel like a solid motivation though, and feels like a backstory someone would write for their Sonic OC. It doesn't make her character feel interesting or easier to sympathize with, it quite simply feels cliche and half-baked.\\n\r\nThe saddest part of the characters, is that despite Tokaku being the protagonist, every other character in the show was more fleshed out than her. That isn't to say that the other characters are well written though, because they still feel like one-dimensional stereotypes. Most characters only got one episode each, which didn't give viewers enough time to grow attached. We got around twenty-two minutes to see what drove them. While some characters had some thought provoking motives, others were basic, almost flat. Much like the animation, the character quality was inconsistent and felt jarring to the show's progression.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nDespite the harsh criticism I've given the show, I'll give credit where it's due. The music was an absolute blast to listen to, and the story itself had a really kick-ass premise with some interesting twists along the way. So, would I recommend this show? Well, it could serve as good background noise if you need that, but otherwise it isn't all that great.\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nI do think I am being a little harsh on this anime, but it isn't all that amazing regardless. Overall, I'll give it a 6/10. It lacked a lot of substance and could have done a lot more with some extra episodes and a good director.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review here. I hope you enjoyed it and thank you for reading.",

            "content": "(Spoiler Free)\r\nIn short, Akuma no Riddle is about a special class in My\u014dj\u014d Academy where 12 assassins are tasked with taking down the remaining classmate in the class they are grouped in.\r\nStory: 7\r\nI feel that the assassin theme is not new to anime culture, nor is it outdated in any way. I feel that adding this concept into a seemingly on the surface, slice of life anime makes it fresh, though, in reality this series is far from a slice of life. Seeing attractive young ladies showing their grit and fighting for their lives, is not something I've seen in many anime series, hence itseems kinda fresh in my perspective. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the progression of the storyline, the only thing that gets me down is the predictability of the progression of the series. It starts with a 1v1 duel and pretty much stays that way throughout the rest of the series. Platonic, but it is something i do not mind going back to after each episode\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in Akuma no Riddle is fantastic on the front of character design. All of the 13 girls each bear a strikingly distinct feature that sets them apart from the rest of the cast. All of these characters are beautifully drawn to life and are all pleasant to the eyes, as all girls are.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, one serious drawback in the art department would be the realism of the action sequences in the anime. There are times where fight sequences seem a tad bit too \"low budget\" with very underwhelming actions and repetitive simple animation. Yes, this is an anime on assassins. These people are trained to kill, but the anime struggles in illustrating what could be the most important selling point in the anime. The \"action\" in an \"action\" genre anime\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI personally feel that this is one of the aspects which Akuma no Riddle excels in. The anime is a short 12 episodes , and runs with a single opening. However not only is the opening engaging and fast paced, the 12 unique endings based on each character add spice to each episode, making the audience want to watch all the way to the end of the episode. This unique twist also allows fans of the different characters to take back a piece of their own, in the enjoyment of that particular character. Something that is very fresh in anime today, which I hope I can see more in the future\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nDespite the show's short running episode series, 12 episodes proved sufficient in capturing almost all of the different characters in the anime. Despite it being \"sufficient\". To introduce this much back story for each of the characters in such a short time is not just \"ok\". its a pretty damn good achievement on its own. Its a shame that the anime had to move so quickly, but I applaud the creators on that feat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nPersonally, I did quite enjoy myself while watching this anime. Most of the elements of the show blended in very nicely to make watching this anime worth the time spent. However, those looking for an intricate storyline, plot or ending may be a tad bit disappointed with this series, as it mainly centers around action and suspense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\n\"Worth your time watching!\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle is an ongoing manga written by Koga Yun and illustrated by Minakata Sunao. Last year it was adapted into a twelve episode anime series by Diomed\u00e9a, the same studio behind Ika Musume and some series I've never seen and know basically nothing about. This is my second exposure to their work. Let's see how they do.\r\nStory:\r\nAzuma Tokaku is an assassin in training. She gets selected for a rather strange mission at Myoujou Academy, a girls' school. She and twelve other girls will make up the school's Black Class and all of them except one, Ichinose Haru, are assassins. The assassin to slayHaru will be rewarded with whatever they desire. Things shift when Tokaku develops feelings for Haru, vowing to protect her from the others even if it costs her her life.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start by looking at the issues with the narrative. There's really only one major complaint I have. The ending is pretty weak. There are parts of it that work but it tries way too hard to wrap everything up nicely and there are some things that really don't add up as a result. I can't really go into more details without giving major spoilers but if you've seen the anime you know exactly what I'm talking about. I will also say that the pacing isn't very good and the series quickly falls into a rhythm of having an assassin make an attempt on Haru's life every episode resulting in a match between her and Tokaku. I will give the series credit for being able to pull this off without it getting really samey and it's kind of understandable since the series has the same number of episodes as assassins, but it still leads to a sense that things are getting rushed.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the concept is compelling and it does keep you invested. The tension is really strong and there are a lot of really good sources for it be they mysteries about a character's past, a situation with one of the assassins that's particularly perilous or mysteries surrounding the scenario itself. I also like that Haru isn't a helpless damsel who can't do anything without Tokaku. She proves herself capable on several occasions and she even saves Tokaku a few times. The romance is also nicely done. It starts off kind of abruptly, but it gets a lot of good moments including a buddy breathing scene that's on par with Due South's, and it does develop into something really good. The series also has a really tragic episode about halfway through and it's very well done and handled.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is surprisingly strong. For a series with more major characters than episodes they do manage to give them all back stories, motivations and make them pretty well fleshed out. There are certainly characters who are better developed than others, but they do do really well overall. That isn't to say it's perfect. There are some issues with it. They use the pop culture version of dissociative identity disorder. There's also a part of Isuke's background that bothers me. She has two dads, no that isn't what bothers me, and calls one of them \u201cMama.\u201d I'm relatively certain that most gay couples do not have their adopted children refer to one of them by an opposite gender term and that that detail was just put in to make their family more \u201ctraditional.\u201d In fact, most gay couples just differentiate by using different terms like \u201cdaddy\u201d and \u201cpapa\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d and \u201cfather\u201d or \u201cpapa\u201d and \u201cvati.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of good aspects to the art. The character designs, mostly, are well done. Although I still have no idea why that one girl looks like a grade schooler. The action scenes are really well done with a lot of intensity. There are a lot of nicely done background details too. On the downside, the series is overly fond of fan-service\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOur leads are voiced by Suwa Ayaka and Kanemoto Hisako (the voice of Ika Musume). They both give solid performances. We also get great performances from Nanjo Yoshino (Canaan's Maria), Misawa Sachika (Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku's Reina), Uchida Mami and Yamada Yuki. Really, there aren't any badly done performances in this. The music is also really good. Interestingly enough, the ending themes change from episode to episode and all the major actresses get to perform either by themselves or as part of a duet and they're all really good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is a yuri series, the romance elements are a bit downplayed. About the most you get is going to be a hug here and there. Still, the relationship between Tokaku and Haru is really well done and there is some extra yuri on the side between Chitaru and Hitsugi. There's also the fact that Isuke has two dads but we never really see them together. So, the ho-yay factor is a 7/10. Don't come into this expecting a lot of snogging and romantic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle is an interesting series with some really good moments, intense action scenes, compelling characters and an intriguing plot. It's not perfect by any means and there are some head scratching decisions in it, but I still suggest checking it out since there are so many more things that it does well. My final rating for it is going to be an 8/10. Next week I'll look at Sengoku Otome : Momoiro Paradox.",

            "content": "Ah, another anime with a battle royale-esque plot just came out, but the question is, was it any good? Well, yes and no.\r\nSince I'm a huge fan of battle royale, I feel inclined to watch anything that has any resemblance to it's basic plot (Future Diary, DanganRonpa, Btooom!, etc) and Akuma no Riddle did not fail me in the slightest.\r\nStory (6) -\r\nAkuma no Riddle is set in a class full of 12 assassins that have the main goal of killing Haru Ichinose in exchange for a wish to be granted. However, one of the assassins, Tokaku Azuma, decides to help protect Haru against the others.\r\nIt'svery episodic for the majority of the show. Each episode is based around a new assassin trying to kill Haru and Haru somehow living with the help of Tokaku. This set up makes it very predictable, but doesn't make it any less interesting. Since it can be compared to so many other story lines, the story is nothing extremely original. Nevertheless, it never fails to be entertaining enough for you to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the ending was very disappointing, at least for me. Allow me to quote someone very important, who points out something that this anime totally ignores at the end.\\n\\n\r\n\"People die when they are killed.\" -Shirou Emiya (Fate/Stay Night)\\n\\n\r\nI do so hate it when stories neglect this.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7) -\\n\r\nThe character designs were one of the best things about this anime. Each looked completely different than the rest and they all looked really cool. The rest of the art was good, but nothing extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6) -\\n\r\nNothing really popped out when it came to the music within the show. The opening was good but nothing amazing. The endings are what really stood out, as there was an ending for each assassin when the episode was about them. They corresponded with the character and had really awesome music/visuals. Beyond the endings, the soundtrack was decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8) -\\n\\n\r\nWith a huge cast such as this, it would be hard to give them all the same amount of screen time or different character traits. However, this anime excels at giving them each their own backgrounds and quirks. Each assassin also has different wishes that are mentioned and expanded upon, as their wishes are the driving force for trying to kill Haru. The only one that didn't have that much originality was the main character, Tokaku. She was a tsundere. Thankfully she actually had a personality, as she loved Haru and had a past that haunted her enough to give her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important thing to mention is that the anime is considered yuri. However, the yuri factor isn't very prevalent. Sure, there was some hugging and group bath time but nothing really happened beyond that. That's alright with me but if you're a yuri fan, you might be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was left open-ended. However, it can be assumed that Haru and Tokaku do start dating, or at least remain very close friends. So, romance fans might also be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8) -\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for stories about characters trying to kill other characters. It's just something I'm into, don't judge me. If you like an entertaining story with great characters (and character designs) as well as some decent twists, then you should give this a go. Don't expect anything amazing, but expect a fun ride.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: A classroom with female assassins + Battle Royale = ...DanganRonpa 2.0?",

            "content": "A class full of assassins. Twelve assassins, all tempted with a reward for being granted anything, versus one student. One assassin has a reversal; a change of mind, to protect the student. Night after night, Tokaku Azuma fends off the schemes, traps, and ambushes of these assassins in order to keep Haru from being killed. (The premise is copy-pasted from my review on the manga; it has not changed between mediums.)\r\nAnd does this anime portray this story well? Like the manga - to which I have also given a poor score to - it does not.\r\nUnfortunately, the anime has not \"enhanced\" the value of themanga at all, aside from adding its intended attributes: visuals and audio. There are even some areas where the anime has perhaps made the viewing experience *worse*, due to the added intensity of clich\u00e9s and various other hackneyed devices already present in the manga. \\n\\n\r\nFor those not familiar with the manga, the only reason I would recommend the anime over it is because it is somewhat easier to understand from the get-go; although this improvement is only a smidge above.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nThe premise is actually interesting and has potential, but the execution and delivery of a good, gripping, and tense story of survival, deceit, and conspiracy is...futile, to say the least. There is very little, if any, messages to be derived from the series, and whatever messages it did attempt to convey are completely overshadowed by the sheer stupidity of tropes such as delaying the final blow, the overuse of dramatic pauses, and cheesy dialogue. In other words, this is an extremely frustrating and underwhelming show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am not of the belief that death is an absolute essential, even in a story such as this, the significance of life and living lacks any depth here. Which seems incredibly difficult to screw up with a protagonist like Azuma Tokaku, an assassin who is handicapped with the inability to kill, but the writing still manages to do so. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nMy original score for \"Character\" in my review for the manga was 3/10 (poor). So how does it get worse in the animation?\\n\\n\r\nAgain: the animation did not necessarily \"improve\" what was the manga was deficient in; aside from presenting a couple of scenarios more clearly. A few characters benefited from having voices and animations, such as Kaminaga and Takechi, but others had a reduced presence (even lacking their original backstories), such as Nio and Kenmochi. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it was the bluntly dull and trite dialogue, behavior, and interaction of the characters in animation format which made it all the more worse. As stated in my review of the manga, \"There were characters I very much wanted to \"understand\", but the writer refuses to develop and expand upon them. With a cast of killers, it should be expected that their resolve and reason for their resolve be explored...\"\\n\\n\r\nHaru's steadfast motivation to graduate Class Black remains redundant. Azuma's desire and reasoning to protect her remains redundant. The other eleven assassins just do not have enough screen-time to offer some variation from the redundancy of Haru and Azumas' interaction with one another. Therefore, it becomes difficult for the viewer to sympathize with either.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, very few assassins actually felt dangerous and deadly. Many were simply outdone by clich\u00e9 maneuvers such as shooting whatever may be hanging off the ceiling or not being a challenge at all to Azuma Tokaku's daggers, even if they were equipped with a firearm. This really lowers the viewer's expectations for the rest of the cast, which is not a good thing at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 4/7\\n\r\nFor once, the score for Sound > Art.\\n\\n\r\nI do not like admitting it, but I feel compelled to make a note of how badly action is conveyed in the animation. The battles, chases, traps, trials and tribulations...none of them were exciting or intense. Everything felt very \"slowed-down\", almost to the point of absurdity. This really contributed to the overall disappointment that can be felt from watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation feels almost undeserving of the musical score it has been coupled with. Atmospheric, eerie, and foreboding at times (e.g. Owari no Hajimari), percussive and inspiring at others (e.g. Mamoru Beki Mono); the soundtrack is excellent, but unfortunately oddly contrasted to the slow and rigid pace of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, it was not noticeably good, nor was it so horrible that I could not stand listening to it. It sits somewhere in the middle of the scale, probably gravitating towards the lower end. The voices clearly could not carry the burden of bad dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI could not enjoy this. And from reading the comments underneath the videos on the site where I watched Akuma no Riddle, many people did not either. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I did manage to finish it. I did not feel turned-off enough to stop at any point, but it did take me a little longer (about a week) to watch the last four episodes due to a lack of interest along the way. \\n\\n\r\n3/10 - Poor. Not an improvement from the manga. As such, my recommendation remains the same for what I have stated for the manga: I just would not recommend this.",

Why should they make every second one into something sticky, made of a concentrated purple goo? Yep, Akume no Riddle, it\u2019s about your creators.\r\nCharacters fap-fap-fap. I couldn\u2019t get a grip of the m=names, expect for Haru (Haru wo mamoru, I\u2019ll be saying this while doing illogical things). The main heroine is fit to become an ideal soldier, why don\u2019t they have more of her. And the others! Stamp in on stamp here, raw materials barely make a single line. Even in Danganronpa they had it kindamore livelily. Mi-nu-s.\\n\r\nDat logic made me getting a vicious dump. I thought the director is the laziest man in the world. I was about getting my on-duty washbowl, when\u2026 *spoiler*. And that\u2019s it! Everything fell into place. Then *spoiler* again. The problems I even wasn\u2019t aware of have got rid of. Yet the final scene disturbed the good impression, I think that\u2019s because some people have a bit too much vitality. But it\u2019s a plus.\\n\r\nThe same goes for the place. At first you are scrambled upon some black classes, assassins, way too elite schools\u2026 *spoiler* makes everything clear. The world at once becomes well-made and ready-to-defend-itself-against-your-criticism. Well yeah, just not bad, it has noting new or interesting in particular., and it\u2019s wasn\u2019t even planned that way. Simply plain.\\n\r\nGRAFICS. And SOUNDING. I frealing love it when each episode has its own ending theme. There are even descent ones. The opening is much more promising than the anime itself, and you can\u2019t ignore it. At least everything is pretty and well-animated! Characters fap-fap-fap (da voices even make my desire stronger), especially the red-haired one, left behind near the end. Haru is quite something too. And the school. And it\u2019s a plus.\\n\r\nThe plot. The plot. It seems there is one, but on the other hand \u2013 is it needed? \u2013 you think for yourself while watching before *spoiler* occurs. Then it happens, and\u2026 What\u2019s \u201cand\u201d? An artless \u201ckill or be killed\u201d story with a tiny bit of pure girls\u2019 love. The last episodes start to interpret the previous ones freely, adding up a certain degree of THE DRAMA, but without answering the questions. As I seem to respect THE DRAMA here, there\u2019s no minus.\\n\r\nWell\u2026 minus-plus\u2026 turns out to be a mediocre, casual anime which, however, has everything it takes to excite an unsophisticated viewer. If you don\u2019t look into details much, you can even gain pleasure of it. It ain\u2019t like you are anime for its final, right? Yet sure thing you won\u2019t be looking forward to the promised sequel, damn it\u2026 Have a look at cute schoolgirls? Here you go. They even have weapons! I don\u2019t know a man who\u2019d stay calm and, ermmm, not get excited.\\n\r\n5/10. It\u2019s normal; there are much more bad things. But for you to know \u2013 you should watch this BEFORE Danganronpa and stuff.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, if you're looking for an in-depth-review of this one, you won't find it here. I want to showcase this one only because it may feature one of the greatest anime-episodes of all time.\r\n[insert kanye-meme here]\r\nNo joke, I'm actually serious about that statement.\r\nNow, that we've got that out of the way, I want to recommend this series to anyone who's into Battly Royale'ish survival game-settings, girls-with-guns and/or anything yuri-related, who doesn't have amazingly high expectations and just want to consume a nice, little survival game thriller. You'll be pleased, at the very least.\r\nAkuma no Riddle (otherwise known by its hilariously Engrish alternate title Riddle Storyof Devil) has kind of a slow-ass pacing up until a certain point. While it maintains a slow speed in terms of storytelling in the first and second third, it is in a constant struggle with itself to keep things interesting and suspenseful on one hand and, on the other hand, to show off some (admittedly sometimes quite competently made) short-burst action sequences and fanservice. It does both with rather varying degrees of success, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is not the overall artistry of the series - I dig the character designs and the colorful presentation. The animation quality varies between \"alright\" and \"lots of stillframes\" with the occasional well-animated and -orchestrated action sequence. It's slightly above average in that department. The kickass OP and some of the EDs are nice to listen to, the seiyuus do a really good job at delivering their lines with just the right amount of cheese (especially Yuka Ootsuba is freakin' fantastic as Banba) and the overall OST is not an insult to the ears. So, all in all, AnR's art works well with what it's got.\\n\\n\r\nThe big problem I had with the series was its lack of focus, even though the plot is simple enough: The headmaster of Myoujou Academy has a bunch of girls assigned to the \"Black Class\". Their assignment is to kill Haru - a.k.a. Redhead McNicegirl - in order to graduate and become a professional killer. The only one of the \"Black Class\" who doesn't want to murder her dead is fellow classmate Tokaku - a.k.a. Bluehair McHardass. Instead, she makes it her mission to protect the target from the rest of the chicks, who take turns in trying to kill Redhair.\\n\\n\r\nEach classmate gets her own episode devoted to her respective backstory and her motivation to become a badass assassin/to assassinate the shit out of Redhair, which is a nice idea in and of itself. But as said above, it hurts the pacing of the show in the long run. It starts to pick up, however, in the most glorious way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \"payoff\" gets thrown around a lot when people talk about how a certain anime episode delivered a nice payoff - but holy sandals of Moses, the tenth episode of this series is completely worth the wait. It turns an otherwise fairly average yuri thriller show into a fucking rollercoaster ride of fun and awesome for twenty minutes. It's as if AnR throws off its own restraints and decides to go completely all-in on the viewer. And, for me at least, it worked perfectly. I was HOWLING with amazement at my TV screen during the entire duration of that one episode, even though (or, rather, because!) it was only a twenty minute long action scene that didn't stop to step on the gas until the end credits rolled.\\n\\n\r\nI really wish I could tell you more about it, but 1. I'd go into heavy spoiler-territory if I did so and 2. it would ruin the surprise. The series is coming out on Bluray (in Germany, at least) right now and I urge you guys to get it, if just for the sudden stroke of genius that is episode 10. The enjoyment of the rest of the series really depends on what you want out of it: if you want yuri, you'll get it, but only in short, concentrated bursts. If you're like me and you want a badass girls-with-guns-action show, you'll get it, but only in short, concentrated bursts. If you want suspense, you get it, but in short, concentrated bursts and with kind of a lackluster conclusion (even though the ending is wide open to interpretation).\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see a show, however, that makes complete use of its own and the potential of its medium for only one episode, you will definitely get it here.\\n\\n\r\n\"The world is full of ______\" (surprises)",

I've seen it compared to the Dangan Ronpa anime in this respect, but I feel that the Dangan Ronpa anime was a little more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime appears to have a yuri setting, but other than gratuitous panty shots, bondage and bath scenes, there seems to be very little actual romance - probably because there is literally not enough time for it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending leaves you unsatisfied and wondering what the hell I spent the past 12 weeks watching this for.",

I didn't really like that, to be honest I wanted that they would last longer after a battle, but nope, they decided to put them away. It was also more about battles and that is actually what I really enjoy so that was the thing that made my rate higher.\r\nArt (8/10)\r\nI really liked the art, it was amazing. The battles were viewed really great!\r\nSound (7/10)\r\nThe sound was good enough for me. So that's whyI gave it a 7. I loved the intro and the ending music. I thought the ending was kinda special, it always had a different character in it and music, I liked that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nIf they would last longer, maybe my rate would be higher.

I finished it in three days, because I only thought about watching it. I was sad when I finished it. How they made the anime, is really good.

            "content": "I saw so many reviews of this show that did not rate it a 1 so I felt I should put my opinion out there.  This show is utter shit.\r\nTL;DR: Fuck this show. Do not watch it.\r\n**SPOILERS**\r\nArt: Let's start with the one somewhat positive note.  The art. I gave it a 7/10, the animation was decent and the action wasn't terrible by any means.\r\nSound: I am genuinely curious whether the sound director even watched the show he or she was controlling the soundtrack for, because the music in this show just does not convey the proper tone. I found it to be laughableat many points.  There would be a casual scene or a slightly on edge conversation and intense piano music would play in the background, or a symphonic piece would be in the background.  This had me on edge and waiting for a significant, suspenseful, and tense scene that just did not appear.  I suppose that this can be blamed on the show not delivering what was necessary in the writing, which it certainly did not. Overall, some of the other music was passable, so 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I was curious on how they would handle the large number of characters in this show, and my answer is: poorly. For most of this show it is basically one character has their chance to assassinate Haru, and then fails and then leaves the show.  So for each characters episode there was an attempt to set up a backstory and provide motivation for the characters actions.  However, these attempts were futile providing insufficient motivations and hopelessly attempting to give two dimensional characters some substance.  As far as the main two characters go, they were equally disappointing. Tokaku was the stereotypical emotionless badass who wins every time.  But I will admit, I found her assassin backstory to be somewhat compelling at times, but she often comes off as an emotionless robot and never really sells me on her love for Haru.  And Haru is nothing but a ditsy, hopeless, happy, upbeat, piece of cardboard.  Can you actually expect me to believe that you got all those scars and had all those people die and act so normally?  And how can you be so stupid as to think that you can befriend the assassins trying to fucking KILL YOU? I hate Haru.  All in all, 2/10 characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Dear sweet mother of Christ, this story was shit.  First of all, it is a show about assassins, but NO ONE DIES.  NO ONE FUCKING DIES IN THIS ENTIRE GOD DAMN SHOW.  I am not someone who needs death, a show can be great without it, but this show is about assassins who want to kill Haru and will kill others to do so.  It is simply unrealistic that no one dies.  And the way that they just unkill some of the characters (the chick with mama and papa and Romeo and Juliet assassins specifically) just removes all the weight of their deaths, trivializing some of the actions in the show.  And that last episode, with Haru \"manipulating\" Tokaku, it was so clear that Haru cared for Tokaku, and that Tokaku cared for Haru, so who cares? No but Tokaku literally FUCKING TRIES TO MURDER HARU! What the fuck?  That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen in a story.  I have to wonder whether anyone read the first draft of the script before having the voice actors read it for the show. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Some times it was fun to watch how absurdly bad this show is. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Terrible. 1/10",

The art style was nice as well and the animation itself wasn't half bad. One thing that bothered me was that the anime was listed as \"yuri\", but the entire show barely had any yuri in it. The show was very enjoyable, but it seemedvery rushed. One thing that I loved about the anime was the soundtrack for each of the characters, those were really nice.",

            "content": "I'm going to try to go into detail about this anime without spoiling much. I also put this too long didn't read summary below just in case you do not want to read the longish review.\r\ntl:dr - Akuma no Riddle has some interesting elements and a large character cast, but due to only having 12 episodes, characters are underdeveloped and the \"yuri\" theme doesn't really rub on until the end of the anime. The ending is very dreadful and feels like a kick to the groin.\r\nI originally was inspired to watch this due to DemolitionD's video about the spring season. I was slightly excited towatch this anime due to it being my first \"yuri\" action themed anime. I started about two week's late when it aired and continued to watch it. Slowly as each week passed by my interest for this anime grew so weary that I'm amazed I did not drop this series. Story wise, this anime is about a special class known as \"Class Black\" that has 13 students. 12 of these students are trained assassins which their goal is the kill the non-assassin student and main protagonist Haru Ichinose. If one of the assassin kills Haru, they will be granted one wish of their desire.Tokaku Azuma, who happens to be room mates with Haru, forms liking for Haru and decides to protect her. Thus this story takes off.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme for the story is interesting but this anime shares similar problems with Danganronpa. To keep it short, Danganronpa also had a nice theme but due to only having 13 episodes, the development for its anime counterpart(this is a video game if your interested) is weak and rushed. Back to Akuma no Riddle, the assassins who target Haru(and sometimes ones not involved) only get 1 episode to showcase their background and wish. This makes characters who's personalities have not blossomed yet, seem irrelevant. You care for the character only for that episode and as 1 or 2 more pass by you may forget them or simply not care about them anymore. For those assassins that happen to last longer, in my opinion, they do not rub off well as likeable. A huge thing to complain about this development is Haru and Tokaku. After the first 2 to 4 episodes you pretty much understand them. There is no real development for them and if you choose to skip ahead you would truly only miss the weekly assassins back story. Haru is a gullible character, aware of being targeted by many assassins she tries to make the best out of her experience. People who watched this anime complain about her being useless(reddit comments) which I agree and slightly disagree. At least compared to other female characters claimed \"useless\" Haru will not sit back and watch much, she has her moments where she puts up a decent fight. Tokaku is another story also if it was not for Tokaku's slightly noticeable chest, then I would confuse her for being a man. Tokaku is the simple over protective character that focuses on her task at hand a majority of the time. Tokaku is simple a boring character to follow, if it was not for the action scenes I would've probably stop caring about her and Haru. There are some other elements in the story that \"grind my gears\" but ill just end it right here.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this anime is where it blossoms as intriguing. The backgrounds, effects, and other visuals are beautiful and is one of the elements that will keep you watching. The animation is alright. When the action scene's occur the animation can be great but it is nothing special and at some moments during action scene's, the animation can look choppy. Character designs are nice as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is not much to brag about...just kidding. The music is pretty good, It fits the scenes perfectly, whether its a serious or casual moment the music fits it well. A unique thing(that also gives more props to the animation) is the endings. Each ending is sung by a voice actor, usually the weekly assassin and the animation for the ending reflects the characters personality. It is enjoyable and another element that shines in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is something that I really despise. In a way it decently wraps up the story but....If I continued I would be posting major spoilers just check it out for yourself, It gave me a good 5 minute head shake. It beats the \"established seriousness\" out of this series in my opinion. It also made me demote this anime from a 6/10 to a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime can be enjoyable here and there but it wasn't something I was hyped waiting each weak for. Being fully offensive to this anime, I purposly watch this first so to hype myself up for Hitsugi no Chaika and Ping Pong the Animation. I would only recommend this anime if you are truly bored and looking for something just to pass by time. Would not re-watch this either.",

            "content": "This is by far the most disappointing anime of spring 2014. I was pulled into this anime by the PV and the first 3 episodes. However, it turns out to be another generic action anime with no suspense.\r\nSTORY (2):\r\nThe story takes place in Myoujou Academy where 13 students are enrolled there. There is one student who is not an assassin and that person is Haru Ichinose. Tokaku Azuma is an assassin who develops feelings for her and is willing to protect her from the assassins.\r\nThe hunter: 11 assassins\r\nThe bodyguard: Tokaku Azuma\r\nThe hunted: Haru Ichinose\r\nThe story has some decent action scenes but not those high-octane ones.The first 3 scenes are decent but the rest are not. This story tries to cramp every characters back story into 13 episodes and most of them are incoherent and I didn't care for them. One example was in episode 6 about Chitaru's  & Hitsugi's back story.\\n\\n\r\nART (2):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is dull. They make use of dim colors to set the mood for seriousness. However, the usage of dim colors works against the anime advantage, making it not engaging. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (3):\\n\\n\r\nThe PV is decent. I loved the tone of the music, it gives like a mysterious tone. The opening and ending is all right. The ending song has different songs sung by each of the seiyuus.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (1):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just generic and paper-thin. All they are here for is to get their asses handed over to Tokaku Azuma. \\n\\n\r\nTokaku Azuma was the only decent character in this anime, but as the series progresses, her character starts to deteriorate until the final episode when she makes her wish. \\n\\n\r\nHaru Ichinose was so annoying to the point I wanted to choke her until she dies. Her character serves no point and all she do was being naive and easily trust people even though they are about to kill her. All she does was make every situation worse, even for Tokaku Azuma. \\n\\n\r\nOtoya Takechi has a cheerful personality and she reminds me of Hibiki Ganaha from Idolmaster. Both characters are voiced by Manami Numakura. Not only that Otoya attacks using scissors which Genocyder Syo from Danganronpa did. \\n\\n\r\nAt least Otoya Takechi was a memorable assassin, the rest are just not worth talking about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (2):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are generic and paper-thin.  I have such high hopes for this anime but it let me down in every aspect with the characters and their incoherent back stories. There were some decent fights but they weren't enough to save the show. And the ENDING. This ending is the worst ending I have ever witnessed. The ending is worse than any ending I have ever witnessed. Worse than Btooom, End of Evangelion & Coppelion. \\n\\n\r\nI already didn't care about the characters and the ending came and slap me right into the face. The ending just shows everyone all right. All that development was completely scrapped by the ending.\\n\\n\r\n*screaming and crying*\\n\\n\r\nSorry about that, I just couldn't control my emotions. Overall, the only decent characters are Otoya & Azuma. However, that doesn't save the show from being generic. There are better action anime worth your time. I will give this anime a 2/10. \\n\\n\r\nI need to calm down and rest my head.",

This isn't to say \u201cAkuma no Riddle\u201d isn't an Anime people should forgo watching. The series simply fell flat because of all the cliches shoved into the series. \r\nI think my disappointment started in the first episode when I found myself reminded of \u201cNoir\u201d in a manner which made me feel \u201cAkuma no Riddle\u201d was unoriginal. After that I found myself reminded of to many other series. \u201cHigurashi no Naku Koro ni\u201d, \u201cDangonropa\u201d and quite a fewothers which I can't remember off the top of my head or couldn't quite place. There is nothing wrong with using other peoples work as inspiration, but in this particular case nothing new came from the series. The plot and characterization was to flat.\\n\\n\r\nThis particular series falls under the \u201cDeadly Game\u201d trope. The plot for this particular trope is very straight forward. If you lose you die, and the main character must find a way to beat the system. A good series for this kind of plot relies on two things to draw writers in. The first tactic is to create some kind of puzzle the main character must solve which also gets the writer thinking. Said puzzle also needs to be unique. The other tactic is to have a strong roster of characters to work from.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAkuma no Riddle\u201d fails in both aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe puzzles the main character needs to figure out are simple compared to many other series. The only two characters given development over the course of the series are the main couple. Series like \u201cDangonropa\u201d and \u201cBtooom!\u201d happen to have the characters they used fully developed prior to the series starting. So what then is the draw for this particular series?\\n\\n\r\nI can't say it's the art work. The actual character designs for the characters in this particular series don't make up for the lack of character development. The design might be good for a slice of life Anime series, but not really for a series falling under the action genre let alone comprised of a \u201cDeadly Game\u201d trope. And that right there is the odd charm of this piece. The characters would actually fit better into a different story scenario.\\n\\n\r\nAnother charm is the secret revealed at the end of the series. This in itself has execution problems and in reality there could have been more hints dropped for this particular series in regards to the secret which ends up finally revealed at the end. This series is also odd because of the number of yuri pairings worked into the series. The class size is rather small for the numbers shown, and normally when one sees this many the cast has a higher. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a bad thing, but truth is this element could have been worked more into the secret revealed at the end.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my disappointment in this series I did find myself enjoying the series quite a bit, nor does it stop me from liking the series. In part I enjoyed seeing the potential of what this particular series could have been as I watched said series, but I also found said series relaxing to watch.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this anime.  Here I will list why.\r\nCharacter design:\r\nA lot less ecchi than most.  Doesn't start off with panty shots and silly \"I'M SO KAWAII\" things.\r\nIt's really serious in atmosphere.  I'm not sure how empathetic of an audience you guys are, but let me try to explain it in my own words.\r\nCharacter design:  Variety in character designs.  Variety in personalities.  Variety in objectives, past, etc.  Colorful, easy to distinguish hair styles.\r\nOf course after a while, things tend to look the same in anime.  Characters tend to show themselves in other animes with different names.\\n\r\nCliche isn't always a bad thing.  Here in this anime, the designs are decent.\\n\r\nI can always appreciate good use of tattoos, scars, and color.  I can rate it a 8.  On another note, I think the fact the girls aren't super sexualized and have actual proficiency in their talents make them even more valuable gems.  Let me try and ask a question to the audience.\\n\r\nDo you want a girlfriend/friend that has passion and talent, or would you rather have a girlfriend/friend that's proficient in plotless pantyshots?\\n\r\nIt's fine if you want the latter one.  I just personally don't like dimwitted child girls with filling in precious plot with their plump, blushing vag-shots--thank you very much.  I find all of these characters to be interesting to be around if they were real.  I'd totally hang around with them, you know?  Whereas if the typical, generic anime girl were around me--whether it's tsundere, yandere, dandere, kuudere, etc---I'd either be embarassed, annoyed, or just bored out of mind to be around them.  I hope that makes sense---I tried.\\n\\n\r\nPlot design(trying to be blunt without spoilers):  Do you ever wonder if anime is too boring because \"You saw it coming?\" \\n\r\nDo you EVER ask yourself if it was intended by the producer to allow you to see the future climax?  Yeah, well--it's called foreshadowing.  If you think this anime is boring because you're smart sh*t, you're better off watching random shenanigans like Nichijou and FLCL.  -shrugs-\\n\r\nI do enjoy the plot twists here and there.  I can explain why--even if I do see it coming.\\n\r\nDo you ever get that feeling you want something to be a certain way?\\n\r\nThis anime gives you to you, takes it away, then gives it to you again.  Why?\\n\r\nBecause you get false hope.  It's fun.  You ought to try it.\\n\r\nThe plot is decent.  It's a good story.  I'm sick of people rating it by 'originality'  \\n\r\nDo you ever see people that like weird, non-mainstream anime because it's rare and different?  Like--people who can't like Akame Ga Kill or Cowboy Bebop just because they have their panties in a knot trying to figure out whether they're non-conformist?  Just think of it this way--\\n\r\nEverything has a formula just like in math--just like a recipe.\\n\r\nMainstream:Hey, let's make a cake today!  We're going to use eggs, milk, sugar, and flour--we'll add some yummy fruit too!\\n\r\nNon-mainstream fanbase: WE'RE MAKING ANCHOVY CAKE WITH PEANUTS AND FRUIT PUNCH.  SO COOLLLL. WAO.\\n\r\nBasically, I can give this anime a higher rating for a plot because of that.  -shrugs-\\n\\n\r\nAnother note: Lesbians that have personality and coolness---and they don't all have C and D-cups.  I'm impressed by variety--personally.  I dig variety more than anything.  = w=\\n\\n\r\nArt: AAAAAH.  The lighting changes, the atmosphere coloration--the hair--the detailing---the shading--10/10.  It's hard to make extremely nice lines and accurate animations in well---animation.  Do you ever ask yourself how hard it is to animate?  It's tedious.  Animating is a job that chunks your life away.  So I have to rate it 10/10--not to compare to anything else--just as an anime by itself--you know?\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I wish there were more songs showing different emotions for different scenes--like---for sad scenes, fight scenes, super happy scenes.  I love the voice actors to death though.  Just--the variety.  I mean to say that---the girls have different voices---they aren't all moe and high pitched pterodactyls.  I love it.  I loved it so much I'm ready to die.  Just kill me now.  *o* 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I cried.  I don't care if it's cliche.  I liked it.  10/10.  I enjoyed the type of cliche.  I enjoyed the tension.  I enjoyed the happy moments.  I like the humor in it but I can't quite understand myself if I SHOULD be laughing most of the time--grim humor, you know?\\n\\n\r\nStory:8/10.  It's not the cliche that matters---I say once again.  Everything else applied well.  I would give it 5/10 or less if I didn't like it, but since I did, I give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "Sometimes, when you're browsing through the new lineup for a given anime season, certain words will catch your eye; words that make you think \"Oh hey, this show has a lot of stuff that I like in it. This is totally for me.\" A few weeks pass by and not much has happened in that show yet, but you're still fine because the good part has to be coming up soon. Then, by the end of the season, you're left only with the feeling that you've somehow been swindled out of five hours of your life by a promise that was not kept, and thatis where we begin today...\\n\\n\r\n\tThirteen students at My\u014dj\u014d Academy, a private boarding school for girls, have recently joined what is known as \"10th Year Class Black.\" However, the situation is a bit different from your ordinary classroom. In Class Black, twelve of the students are expertly-trained assassins, and the thirteenth is the target. If one of the assassins manages to take out the target, they will be granted one wish from the benevolent benefactor of the school. Soon after the school year begins, Tokaku Azuma, an assassin from the infamous Azuma clan, discovers that the target is Haru Ichinose, a rather friendly member of the class. However, instead of assassinating her, Tokaku ends up developing feelings for Haru and swear to protect her from the rest of the class.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo, let's recap what would most likely draw people to this series in the first place: 1. Assassins, and 2. Yuri (Girl Love). Starting with the first point, one would think that, for a show with eleven different assassins going after the same person, the ways in which someone is killed would be rather creative, and for the most part that would have been true. The different techniques and weapons used by each assassin, from deadly poison to straight-up smashing people with giant hammers, was an interesting facet of the show. Now, you might have noticed that I prepared that last statement with the phrase \"would have,\" and that's because this series makes a mistake so unbelievably unforgivable that it made me question whether or not the writers even knew what as assassin was. That's right: no one died, and many of them, after failing to kill Haru, sort of just walk off in shame and aren't seen again til the epilogue. I really hate to start with such a huge spoiler so early, but...why?! They're assassins!\\n\\n\r\n\tThe worst part was that, until the last five minutes or so, it looked like we did have a few deaths, with two of them that happened at the same time making up what I considered to be the emotional climax of the show (at the halfway point of the series mind you); but then the decided at the end to go \"Oh yeah everyone's still alive by the way.\" The people who were stabbed in the chest, drank highly-potent poison, and were crushed under falling theater lighting were all A-OK. When someone says \"assassin,\" you don't think \"person who subdues their target in the most over-the-top way possible without actually killing them.\" It's like how Naruto has been woefully abusing the word \"ninja\" for the past decade.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo, the assassin part is officially belly-up, which leaves us with the yuri. The popularity of yuri in anime has been growing steadily over the past few years, but there hasn't really be a \"be-all end-all\" title to represent the genre. Does Akuma no Riddle fit the bill? Absolutely not. While they say that Tokaku has fallen for Haru, they never really show any chemistry between them. I'm pretty sure Tokaku spends more time deflecting attacks from the other assassins than she does actually having a conversation with Haru.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere's also a very huge discrepancy with the \"yuri\" label that needs to be addressed. Were we in Japan, I would not have addressed this at all; but as a westerner using western sites to look up anime, it's extremely discouraging to see some sites not understand the difference between yuri and shoujo-ai. To put it briefly, yuri covers relationships of a more sexual nature (kissing, sex, etc.), while shoujo-ai covers the more intimate and emotional aspects of the relationship without being more explicit. So, at best, Akuma no Riddle barely makes the cut for shoujo-ai, but doesn't even come close to breaking into yuri territory. Thankfully, I have seen some sites backtrack on their labels and switch it to shoujo-ai, but that initial mistake was still an upsetting one.\\n\\n\r\n\tCharacter development for this was an absolute mess as well. I will admit that we do get some details and developments on Tokaku and Haru and how the class is affecting them, and I did care a little bit about them by the end of the series. However, the other eleven were practically throw away characters. I can't even remember most of their names as I'm typing this because they left so little of an impression on me. The only ones I actually cared about were Hitsugi and Chitaru, as they had the most spectacular \"deaths\" out of everyone and also managed to have better yuri moments that Tokaku and Haru.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe animation was done by Diomed\u00e9a, also responsible for Noucome and Mondaiji, and this is the only aspect of this series that stood out for positive reasons. The fight sequences were exceptionally well-choreographed and well-animated, though the environments tended to default to a drab gray color sometimes. They also had the good sense to make the character designs extremely diverse, as making any of these characters too similar would have led me to be extremely confused, on account of how little characterization they gave to everyone. My only complaint is that the fan service wasn't really all that interesting, and, to be honest, it kind of turned me off sometimes.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere is currently no dub, but, as this show rests with FUNimation, a dub would probably be an improvement on this show. I'm not sure how popular this show really is though, so the assurance of a dub actually coming out is still up in the air.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe music was composed by Yoshiaki Fujisawa, who also composed for Love Live! and Rail Wars. In keeping with what seems to be the theme recently, Fujisawa makes very heavy use of intense electronic music to set each scene on edge and to hype up fight sequences. It's a shame that \"S\u014dsh\u014d Innocence\" by Maaya Uchida had to be attached to this show, as it was hands-down my favorite opening theme from this season, with its heavy driving rock sound getting me excessively pumped to watch each episode. Additionally, each episode had a different ending theme, with my personal favorites being for episodes 5 and 10-12.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn the end, Akuma no Riddle was nothing more than a total betrayal of my expectations. The assassins didn't kill anyone, there was barely any yuri, and no amount of epic fight scenes could forgive that.\\n\r\n\tI give Akuma no Riddle\ufeff a 5/10 and recommend that you skip this series. However, if you are still interested in watching it, the series is currently licensed by FUNimation and it available for streaming from their site.\\n\r\n\tFor alternate recommendations, I point you towards a murder/mystery series also set in a classroom: \ufeffDanganronpa the Animation\ufeff; and for an alternate take on a battle royale-esque scenario with one contestant defending another, we once again come to \ufeffThe Future Diary\ufeff.",

I won't give you one, No! I'll give you 13 awesome girls in just one anime show. Yeah, you read good! (Just realized that this sounds like a TVcommercial). Akuma no Riddle or Riddle Story of Devil finished airing in 2014 and  in 12 episodes in total it really showed that girls don't only care about nails and clothes. \\n\r\nPlot and Storyline:\\n\r\nTo be honest, this anime has a poor storyline. It's not stupid but there could have been done a better job. And it was like the makers were bored and just wanted it to end, resulting a kinda forced eniding with no sense. \\n\r\nStill, I have to say that the action in this anime can hardly be compared to any other 12-episode anime. You have guns, swords, knifes, bombs and some very clever ways of killing. VIOLENCE INCLUDED so I wouldn't recommend watching with younger brothers and sisters. \\n\r\nEverything starts with the beginning of the new school year at Myoujou Academy, a boarding school for girls. New girls, new assassin class, new target...Wait what?\\n\r\nYeah, it does look like an assassin game, I know. Well it kinda is. You have 13 girls in one class. \\n\r\nTwelve of these girls are skilled and well trained killers and they all have one goal. Kill the target. This year it will be little Haru Ichinose. The only difference is that this year the target surprisingly gains a protector. Tokaku Azuma kinda falls in love with Ichinose and tries to protect her until the very end. When it comes to the end...What a surprise!   \\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYou have 13 different girls. As excepted each of them has her own background story and a different way of assassinating Ichinose. That's the most interesting part of the show, the diversity. \\n\r\n Ichinose: She is that typical naive, cute, little girl that is half of the time not aware of what's happening around her. She is the most innocent character in the show and I really felt sorry for her. And please don't judge her in the end. It's not her fault taht...(NO SPOILERS, THAT'S THE RULE!). \\n\r\nAzuma: What a girl! The skills of this woman really surpassed my expectations. Her moto as I understood: \"Speak less, do more\". She always kept calm, observed and then acted. A very interesting fighter. May I represent, Tokaku Azuma.  \\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe first thing I want to commend about this anime are definitely the looks of the characters. Nice work done by the director and designers.  What I personally found interesting is that the ending of each episode is different, every time sung by another voice actor. Nice idea, although I always skip the ending. Never-mind, Let's move on...\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nA with action overloaded anime awesomely interesting anime despite his poor storyline. It is not a masterpiece but I still don't get the low ating of 6,84 on My Anime List. It probably lies in the as said before forced ending. A few episodes more would have made it way better.\\n\r\nIn short. If you love action and adrenaline and don't care about the quality of the story this would definitely be a anime for you. \\n\r\nI liked it, I hope you'll too.\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle is a fun little time waster for those that are wanting something short and action filled to watch. While no masterpiece, Akuma no Riddle provides enough entertainment for you to keep watching, all with badass girls who do the badass things.\r\nThere really isn't much in the way of story here. Haru, a girl born into a clan, is being hunted by 12 other students, who each have their own reasons for wanting her dead. The characters themselves have no real depth to them, nor do they have any real growth. The only characters you could argue experience growth are Tokaku and Haru.This show really isn't deserving of its \"Shoujo Ai\" tag, either. If you were looking for Yuri, you probably want to search elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is marginally episodic, with each episode focusing on one particular assassin. The series lends itself to predictability and you'll soon learn that the episodes pretty much go as follows: Assassin sends in their card, Haru is in danger, the girls do the fighting, Haru and Tokaku win while the assassin learns something about themselves and is expelled from the Class Black program. The romantic subplot in this anime is almost non-existent. It's obvious that Tokaku's reasons behind wanting to protect Haru stems from sexual attraction, yet the show never really explicitly says it outright, rather resorting to the more generic term of \"wanting to protect someone precious to them\". Imagine the romantic subplot as a jar on a high shelf. Now imagine reaching for it, where you can *almost* reach it but its just that bit too far. That's the romantic subplot in a nutshell. It's almost there, but its never explicitly referred to nor is it explored in any fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good and the art style is aesthetically pleasing. Non-important characters such as b.g characters are portrayed as black and white, providing an interesting contrast from the main characters. The music is good, invoking the right emotions at the right times.\\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle definitely isn't for everyone, as shown by its relatively average score. However, I enjoyed it and had a fun time. If there was ever a reason to ever come back for a second season, which is unlikely, you can bet your buns that I'll be the first one there to be watching it.",

            "content": "This review is being written directly after watching the very last episode. \r\nOkay I need to vent my disappointment. This show had potential, the idea wasn't original and the characters were all a bit cliche but it had potential and I decided to give it a chance.  That said the beginning of this series was quite good actually with one episode near the middle of the series being a personal highlight for me.\r\nIt was good and I liked it enough to continue.\r\nAnd this is where things change. The show just nose dives and loses any charm it had and without spoiling anything it becamea tiny bit stupid. I mean they're assassins and while everyone is trying to kill Haru it seems like just don't know how to kill a person.. They are supposed to be trained assassins but they just don't act like it. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the ending, well, to put it bluntly, it's terrible. If you told me they could destroy the show in two episodes I wouldn't have believed you, but that's what they've done. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize my feelings on this, the beginning was good, the characters were bland and the ending seemed rushed and kinda stupid. That's harsh I know, but I really didn't enjoy the second half of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSpare yourself some time and watch something else.\\n\\n\r\nAlso those watching this for the possible Yuri classification, you will be disappointed. Just putting that out there.\\n\\n\r\nCool.\\n\\n\r\nBye.\\n",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle is about a class of 12 girls who have a task to kill a thirteenth girl, Haru.   All of this takes place at a high school, and in a particular classroom, called the Black Class.  Upon arrival, the 12 girls, who are shown to be assassins, are briefed on the rules, and go from there.  The \"rules of the game\" so to speak, are that the target must have a notice before being killed and that if a person is able to kill the target, then they are granted one wish, which could range from something simple asmoney, to something elaborate as a writ to kill.    After the meeting, one of the girls, Tokaku, is against it and helps to protect Haru from the others.   That is the basic plot, without saying any spoilers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:   Already mentioned the main plot.  Each episode would roughly cover one of the 11 girls as they make their attempt in Haru.  Each of the girls has an unique way of attempting an assassination, which ranged from simple weapons like guns and knifes, to more unique weapons, some of which I can't say since it would be a spoiler.   During a given episode, you find out about what wish a girl wanted, and a brief flashback, that usually explains why they would want such a wish.   Given that this was a 12ep show,the pacing was quick, and the girls only got one episode that would focus on them.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The anime style was one of the few that I enjoy a lot.  The color and tone of the rooms and the design of the girls, were nice and each of them had a slightly unique feature to them, whether it is being short, being tall, being flat chest, busty, etc.   And the clothes sometimes would match the person's personality too.\\n\\n\r\nSound:   The thing that I liked about the show, was that each of the EDs were different.  Different video, different theme, and different song.   The sounds used were great, the BGM was minimal but enjoyable, especially the fight scene music later on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:   This is where Im split on rating it, but Ill explain the best that I can.   The characters themselves, were unique enough to be very different from each other.  Example would be that one girl had a more religious background, while another had an extensive criminal background.   With that in mind, the characters were very pleasing to watch and see interact, with my favorite being Hanabusa for reason that I can't say because of spoilers,   However, the characters suffered from a lack of complete background describing.  In other words, we were shown very little about the girls' past, and thus there was simply not much to learn for any of the girls.   Usually, it would be something very short and basic, and that's it,   For those who do not like melodrama, then it wouldn't be an issue, but for those who want to know more about the girls, well, sorry, but that didn't happen much.    This is the second worse part about the show, but Im a sucker for characters that at least look nice, even if background info is lacking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:   I enjoyed watching each episode as the week went on.  They started kind of slow and dry, but when things picked up, it got better.   The one major thing that I absolutely did not like, was the ending.  I wont dare say it nor give an hint, but I wish they did the ending the way it should have been, rather than what some people would like.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:    Overall, this was an enjoyable show, but the ending was such a bummer.  The characters were pretty, the music was great, the art style was fine, and after the first couple episodes, it progressively got better.   My favorite episode was the 10th one, but there were others that had good moments in them too.   Oh, and lastly, for anyone looking at this in hopes of it being a yuri anime, better look somewhere else, because there were very VERY little \"girl love girl\" moments.  Maybe one kiss, but it wasn't intended to be a kiss.  Hope my review helps.  Im still working on improving my critic skills.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, let's give this another go! - Updated review. One slight tiny spoiler after the end of Story.\r\nStory: 7\r\nAkuma no Riddle is set in Myoujou Academy, an academy that teaches grade school through to university. In said Academy, specifically Year 10, is the Black Class. In this year's Black Class, 12 assassins face off in a competition to eliminate the 1 target among them, Haru Ichinose. The winner is given anything she desires, and failures are simply expelled. A pretty neat sounding concept, right?\r\nAfter finishing the series, the only thing that springs to mind when reviewing the story is 'wasted potential'. Akuma no Riddle couldhave done so much more, but instead decided to follow a repetitive structure for over half of it's short span and suddenly dump a whole load of 'what the fuck is going on' in the last moments. I feel the issue with the story is either that the show was not long enough for what the writers wanted to do, or they took too long trying to do it. My biggest problem with AnR is that everything is just so convenient and just so happens to work out, but despite the issues it's not so bad the show is un-watchable.\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILER] It all went downhill after \"Let me show you my true form!\" [/SPOILER]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nI'm no expert with art, but AnR is visually pleasing. Nothing spectacular, but it's far from dull.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly one of my favourite OPs so far. It really fits the show and I found I never skipped it. One thing in particular I loved was how every episode had a different ED. I can't say I loved all of the songs themselves, but it's new (to me, at least) and added a little extra. The idea of using a new ED was to 'fit' it to the assassin that the episode had focused on. For example, episode 5 is Haruki's ED.\\n\r\nThe OST as a whole is nothing memorable, but it works nicely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis is where AnR had the most potential. Did it live up to it? Just about. Don't get me wrong, I found all the girls like-able, and I had favourites, but the only one I ended up caring for was Haruki. Almost every one of the assassins has their time in the spotlight to show their personality, motives and backstories. However, once they had this moment, they were gone.\\n\r\n The main focus of AnR is the relationship between Tokaku Azuma and Haru Ichinose. Tokaku vows to become Haru's guardian, which explains the Shoujo Ai. Tokaku is, unfortunately, one of the most boring protagonists I've ever come across. Tokaku is a frown on legs carrying a load of wasted potential on her shoulders. Haru, on the other hand, is so optimistic and cheery I want to leap through the screen and take her down myself. Haru's redemption, however, lies in her development. Watching her turn from a smiling bag of rainbows to a ballsy heroine that could finally hold her own was one of the best things about the show.\\n\r\nSpecial shoutout to the homeroom teacher Mizorogi for being blissfully unaware and still trying to keep the class together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nDespite its issues, I enjoyed Akuma no Riddle very much. I'm a sucker for survival games and a female cast, so I was drawn to this immediately. Did I expect differently? Yes. Am I disappointed? Only slightly. Would I watch this again? In a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! Feedback is always appreciated.",

I personally enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to others who like some thrills and some yuri-like plots with tons of assassins mixed in. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you are looking for something to watch because you're in a drought looking for anime, try it out.

            "content": "Two words to describe Akuma no Riddle - \"wasted potential\".\r\nPicture this: \r\nAzuma Tokaku has spent her whole life dedicated to becoming a highly trained assassin due to the expectations of her family, enduring trauma through the loss of loved ones whose deaths she blames herself for, and finds herself lacking any sense of purpose or anything or anyone to live for. As part of her training, she is sent to an all-girls boarding school, where she and 12 other female assassins are told that they must figure out which of them is their target, and the first to eliminate the target will be granted opportunitiesbeyond their wildest dreams. Azuma finds herself falling in love with her room mate, Ichise Haru, who she believes to be the target. The assassins face inner turmoil as they try to figure out who it is they have to kill, facing crises of morality, wondering what the purpose and value of their lives really is and what it really means to take someone else's life. Azuma grapples with her indifference towards both winning and dying, but slowly finds purpose in protecting Ichise. At the end, all is revealed -  the catch is, nobody is a target. In fact, the last assassin to survive will be the winner. In the very end, when only Ichise and Azuma are left, they are forced to realize why they had to endure the trauma of the last few months, decide what to do from then on, whether they can defy the powers that be and rebuild their lives after the considerable trauma they faced during their time at the academy. \\n\\n\r\nThat is a tale of what might have been. Of course, this is not an original plotline. It has been done before. Yet rewatching the same recycled messages about what it means to be alive and what it means to love would still have been preferable to watching what actually occurred in Akuma no Riddle.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10 | Characters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, this is what happens: generic emotionless character meets generic cinnamon roll character and tries to protect her from generic violent characters that, although of varying backgrounds using different methods, are all pretty much the same. Apparently, if they eliminate the target, they will get whatever they wish for, which is why they're eager to get her blood on their hands. From the very beginning, everyone knows who the target is (and yes, she's a target, not an assassin, who has supposedly been victimized her whole life). Emotionless character supposedly starts to develop feelings for cinnamon roll character based on how different cinnamon roll character is from her, but this is never really portrayed in a realistic, believable, or even upfront way. We don't even really know why, but emotionless character vows to protect cinnamon roll character at all costs. One could argue that it's because emotionless character needs motivation to keep living/something to love etc., or that it was because of the plot twist, and these things might have worked had emotionless character's backstory actually been shown in more detail and a way that was at all realistic, and/or if the plot twist had made any fucking sense. In fact, the most believable reason for why Azuma protects Haru is probably that she had nothing better to do because she didn't care about either winning or losing. Emotionless character defends cinnamon roll from all the violent characters. We don't learn anything new from any of the characters apart from what their backstories are when they're chucked at us all in one go - nothing deeper. At the very end, it's discovered that (hold your breath) this game wasn't a test for the assassins, but a test for the cinnamon roll, who apparently has a power passed down through all the women in her clan that she didn't even know about - the power to subconsciously manipulate others into protecting her - to see if she could survive living amongst 12 assassins by subconsciously manipulating one to protect her. ...what. It's like the story tried to be original but ended up just being fucking stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the \"riddle\" element of this story... I still have no idea what relevance the \"riddles\" even had to the story. Honestly, you could have taken the guy who texted the riddles to Azuma (I can't even remember what relevance he had to the plot, apart from being a part of the organization that sent Azuma to this school, which is a red flag considering he is made out to be important to the story - yet I still have no idea why) out of the picture completely and it wouldn't have made any difference at all. The only reason I can think of for why his idiotic \"riddles\" play a part is to make it seem as if there is profundity to the story, which there isn't, and the riddles never made me believe for a second that there was.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that all the assassins knew who their target was from the start instantly took away so much potential for coming to understand and get attached to all the characters. If they had had to figure it out on their own, we could have seen a realistic exposition of the characters' identities in real time. It would really have made so much difference to the quality of the plot and the depth of the characters. That way, the characters could have been much more subtle and believable, and their motivations for killing Ichise/staying in the game wouldn't have had to be so ridiculous. Clearly thinking of a unique reason for each of the assassins to kill Ichise was pretty difficult, because the assassins' motives were all much too out there to believable in the short period of time we're given to actually find out what they are. Had they just been better developed characters, the writers wouldn't have had to put such incredible and obvious effort into forcing the methods of the assassins to be so unique and fantastical.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, it is very clear what every character is. They have all the depth of cardboard cutouts. Each and every one of them is exactly what they appear to be. I think I stuck through every episode of this incredibly disappointing anime hoping against hope that I would be able to see some dimension appear in the characters, but to no avail. Everyone was exactly what they seemed. Any mediocre attempts at making them appear, for a split second, to have any depth at all were a mirage. \\n\\n\r\nIf this anime had focused on the experience of the collective rather than on one character per episode, it would have been a thousand times better. Every time someone new tries to kill Haru (before Azuma saves her ofc) it's like a stranger has come onto the screen to give you a speech about their past disappointments before attempting to end Ichise. I cannot even describe how idiotic and simplistic the supporting characters were. As for the protagonists, they were equally idiotic and simplistic. Azuma is basically a kuudere and nothing more. Ichise is an almost unrealistically optimistic cinnamon roll who could get her arms and legs cut off with a rusty spoon and still be smiling through the tears. Their relationship goes nowhere. That's all there really is to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nNo comment. It was fine. Nothing striking or spectacular in a good or bad way. Nothing you haven't seen or heard before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit that I watched this entire series in less than a day, but that was mostly because I felt like the episodes added nothing to the development of the story and I was looking for a good place to stop from which I could pick it up again with interest. That point never came. I can see why it would appeal to some people - not everyone wants to be able to analyse the story or characters for their 'deeper meanings' and that's okay - but even so, I couldn't even enjoy Akuma no Riddle much in that way. It also seemed to me like the writers were trying to give the characters and story depth but it just didn't happen. Akuma no Riddle wasn't horrifically unwatchable. It was just not enjoyable.",

            "content": "Akuma no riddle can best be described as a waterdowned version of danganronpa or no more heroes. There's a whole lot of potential but not much bite. This can be attributed not the fact this show is based off a manga written by yun Kouga. Loveless is the only other manga I read by her but I can tell there isn't much impact in her writing. Just like how loveless is a shonen ai with barely any romance much less non ambiguously gay characters, akuma no riddle is a action survival series filled with fluff.\r\n The basic premise is that Haru Ichinose isenrolled into this class filled with highly trained assassins and they all want to kill her. Except for the other lead characters, Tokaku. Having show where the Mc must survive multiple assassin attempts with the help of her bodyguard sounds like a really cool set up but the execution ( both figuratively and literally) is where things fall apart. Haru spends most of time being chatty with her would be killers and always acts so surprised when they try to kill her. Anime writers need to understand there's a difference between optimism and plain old stupidity. No rational person would act like this and tokaku calls her out on this multiple times. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also the weird fact that each assassin is only allowed one chance to kill Haru and they all just give up after they fail. They're each promised a wish should they win and they all decide to try to kill Haru in the most elaborate ways possible. Plot armor is the only reason why none of them were smart enough to just catch Haru alone and snap her neck. It's like this show is afraid to get too gruesome and just goes for the most passive way possible. I admire tokaku for her no killing stance but she could've still severely crippled those evil girls.\\n\\n\r\nI do admit I found most of The assassins to have interesting backstories and motives. They could've benefited from a longer format to fully flesh out their characters.  I don't like how the morality of the characters isn't really addressed and Haru never seems bothered that she surrounded by assassins. There really isn't any justice here. I also love the cinematic feel the soundtrack has. It made me feel like I was watching a movie even though the show would show any thing impressive enough for such music. Overall, akuma no riddle could've been much better in the hands on someone who actually knows how to write an action thriller and didn't just make what felt like an LMN version No more heroes.",

It's hard to really get into it or have a sense of danger and excitement when the antagonists and protagonists continuously make stupid, obvious mistakes.\r\nArt, sound, etc was \"okay\" but nothing groundbreaking or memorable.\r\nI did like the first ending.

I also likedthe conclusion of the character arcs, it felt completed.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show manages to ruin this ending with a 2nd end, I think it was in the final half of the last episode. In that end, they ret-con a bunch of stuff. I would have liked it better had I not seen that part.",

            "content": "(This review contains mild spoilers)\r\nThe biggest problem with Akuma no Riddle is that for an anime about assassins playing a death match game, there isn't actually any death involved. The anime refuses to kill off its characters, going as far as to 'trick' you into thinking certain characters were killed only for them to magically show up in the last episode, somehow perfectly ok. \r\nThat's only if a character gets 'killed' at all. Usually they just get disarmed or forfeit, quietly stepping down from the game and admitting defeat.  \r\nThis can be excused if you remember they're in a school that's watching over theiractions and can quickly save them, not to mention that they /are/ assassins. It'll take a lot to kill them. It is still irksome knowing that there aren't really any risks involved in this game (you can't even count what each character wants as an award as a risk because in the end they all get a variation of their desires realized), but despite that, I think this anime is pretty good. Not amazing, but good.\\n\\n\r\nReally, the biggest pull this anime has other than its premise is the promise of shoujo ai involved. Too bad they don't really push for it too much and only hint at it most of the time. One couple in particular seems more heavily implied than others, but the 'main' couple might as well be called 'good friends' for as much fan service they throw our way. It's slightly disappointing, but I take what I can get. I still enjoyed what I saw. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the thing, despite having gripes with this show, I did like what a saw. I liked the main couple, I felt they had chemistry, I felt they had substance to their character backstories, I felt like their ending was justified even with the cop outs. And I'm a sucker for death match stories, though many of them aren't particularly well executed when it comes to having us feel for the characters when they die, this one did make me like a lot of the characters by the end of it and a lot of their backstories were interesting. Finding out why any of the characters were assassins in the first place was always an interesting addition to their time to shine. Every character had something to offer in that regard, but that's a given I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the fights are really fun. The main characters' struggles are catching. The reveal towards the end about their target was also pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't feel like Akuma no Riddle goes the full mile with what it could have done with its premise, but with what we are given, it is an enjoyable ride. Is it worth watching? I think so, but only if your interested in an all girl cast of assassins with shoujo ai undertones with no stakes involved. You're not going to get much else. \\n",

            "content": "Alright, most of us are usually attracted to mysterious series and characters, patiently waiting for the full storyline to reveal itself blowing your mind away into the heights of the sky.. Akuma no Riddle totally gives\r\n you this impression about it right from the first episode.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe reason I gave it a 7? Because I was a little disappointed by how not-so-deep, compicated/not understandable this series turned out to be. It gives you that perfect impression at first but as the episodes continue you kind of find out it's a bit shallow, but it still has a good storyline, just not one that would blowyou away, especially the ending which I found pretty lame, ruining the enjoyment you had most of the series. It was just a plain, normal ending, nothing as special as I predicted. They didn't solve the riddles either, that made me upset. :c\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the art! It was very pleasant, I liked it \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI almost always skip to the episode through most animes, but the opening was great to watch and listen to..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nOkayy.. I'm not a big fan of Yuri, but halfway through the series I almost forgot there was supposed to be some kind of love story between Haru and Tokaku. Seriously, if you're searching for a lovey-dovey story or characters then this isn't your type, you'll be disappointed. The rest of the characters are great, i didn't prefer them though. A 7 because there was some actual work to come up with their background stories, only for that, they weren't that creative, sadly. Character development isn't massive here either, except maybe a little for Haru and Tokaku. You don't even get to bond with the characters to feel them, the other assassins would've became a huge success if only the series wasn't just 12 episodes, if we had enough time to know them better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nHonestly I got bored in the middle and wanted to quit the series, the episodes were repeating themselves just with a different assassin each episode. The art saved this series big time, and the sounds also, including the great voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nIt was a nice anime with a good plot and good characters, nothing more nothing less. I thought assassins were scary killing machines like Killua in Hunter x Hunter, but this series changed my mind.. The assassins were all helpless and proportionally weak for assassins, especially Tokaku.. It's great for passing time and being entertained, it's got amazing art and music, but if you're aiming for a deep plot, this wouldn't be your anime. c:\\n",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle is an anime full of girls that are all targeting one girl - Haru Ichinose. After watching this anime, I can affirm that it definitely deserves the MAL ranking it has right now. This review will be mainly spoiler free, as all of my reviews.\r\nSTORY: 4. When watching through this, I had so much trouble figuring out the true purpose of the story. Why are all the girls gathered to kill Haru? Why are so many girls involved (12 girls + Haru!!!)? What's with the riddles that Tokaku, the MC, gets from the one guy via a text message? After I finishedthe anime, I kinda understand where the story is going at, but the way it was presented was so confusing especially towards the end. Then at the end, I was lost for words, in a bad way. If you're reading this and you watched it through, you'll understand my point of view.\\n\\n\r\nART/SOUND: 7. These two categories is the only high point in this anime. The fighting and sound quality was good. Nothing that impressive, but it was alright stuff. If you are looking for a bit of action, the fight scenes are good, and the animation is good. Also, I liked the opening music :).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 3. I felt like if you needed a reason to hate this anime, here it is. Since there are so many girls and only so many episodes, how in the world are you going to pull off developing the characters effectively? Honestly, it came to the point where we got to know about each girls brief backstory and then they became irrelevant for the rest of the anime, with exception to the MC Tokaku and Haru, and maybe 1 or 2 more. It's only really Tokaku and Haru that we get an understanding of their story.\\n\\n\r\nLiterally every single girl in the class of 13 girls had such distinctive, different personalities. If you could form a list of popular anime character types, most of the girls would fall into a distinct type for sure. Some people I guess might like this but I personally did not.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, while we're on the topic of characters, I was extremely disappointed with the ending of the anime. If you've finished the anime, you'll know what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4. I came into this anime not having a clue about what it's about. It seemed okay at first, then gradually, and gradually, my enjoyment sunk as I saw a great deal of flaws coming out of this anime. Normally, animes that have some flaws won't bother me - I'm not really that picky with what I watch. It just added up and the things that bothered me only ended up repeating after each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5. Animation and sound passes. Story and character, not so much. If you are looking for some action and a bit of suspense, this anime will give you some. There were many flawed parts that really dropped my score for this anime, but it wasn't completely terrible. I managed to get through it at least.",

Their personalities compliment each other-Haru is naive, cheerful, and bubbly, while Tokaku is often serious and all business. It's fun to see how they interact.\r\nNow on to the other characters-the assassins who will be making attempts at Haru's life. Because of the show's set up, the anime is episodic, with an episode focusing on one assassin at the time. Thisgives each character a chance to be at the spotlight; the character's backstory and motivation are also discussed in the episode. And each of the assassins have unique personalities that are different from each other. They also have different ways in attempting to assassinate Haru, ranging from the old fashioned way of using a gun  to a sort of game of sorts. This makes each episode interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is also beautifully animated and the fight scenes are well done. \\n\r\nThe music of this show is very good! It has one opening, sung by Maaya Uchida. However it has 12 EDs, with the singer being the spotlight character of the episode. And yes, they are all good!\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending of the anime, without going into spoilers, is kind of a base breaker. Either you like it or you hate it. I actually like it, but can see why there are people who hate it. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Akuma no Riddle is definitely a fun show. It can have it's flaws, but it has interesting characters, good fight scenes, and great music, and I think it is worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\nAre you ready to countdown? There is no way out to run!",

            "content": "The yuri genre is a very controversial genre. It may seem difficult to find an enjoyable yuri anime, seeing how so many of them are flawed. A large portion of the anime in this genre frequently feel the need to constantly remind you of the genre by throwing a vast amount of fan service in your face as a requiem of some sort. Akuma no Riddle just almost crosses the threshold and had amazing potential. \r\nSTORY - \"Battle royals are so cliche tho! I don't want to watch this shit!\" Well Internetman how do you successfully counter a cliche and generic premise? You have twooptions, poke fun at the plot with satire or spend your entire budget to make it the best cliche you have ever seen. Akuma no Riddle tries to make the battle royal setting feel unique, but it took away the very element made so many people like death matches in the first place. Without the overwhelming suspense from shows such as Mirai Nikki, you lost what made us interested in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, simply the idea of the ending sounds like it was coined while masturbating on the toilet somewhere in the Sahara Desert. It feels very last minute and leaves a lot of plot holes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART -  What held this anime up was it's animation. It felt very aesthetically pleasing, which I don't usually see in Yuri. The character designs aren't anything to jerk it over, but they are not bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - The sound in this show is surprisingly well done. The opening theme song got me HYPE AS FUCK. Each different character had their own ending theme song which was cool. Again, nothing to jerk yourself over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I've said it plenty of times before, but fuck it I'll say it again. YOU CANT FUCKING TELL 12 PEOPLE'S BACKSTORY IN THIS SHORT OF A FUCKING SERIES. This had so much backfire, which resulted in a collective disinterest in the main heroine.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT - 6.2 There were a plethora of things holding this series back. If the characters were developed better and that ending didn't happen, it would've been a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSEE YA LATER FUCKERS!!!",

            "content": "Story (6)-The show presents itself as a sort of psychological thriller at the start. All these assassins gathered in one place to kill one girl. Sounds a bit over-the-top but you get a little bit more interested as to how this is going play out. Unfortunately, it fails to execute it's pseudo-psychological aspect properly because how horribly ineffective some of the characters are. Because of this, it's hard to truly feel like the main characters are in any sort of danger. The story works semi-episodically, with small plot points scattered throughout the show but never really feeling like a story until later in the show.It tries to act like some big complex show at the start, slows down in the middle, and tries to reassert itself as a complex show at the end. That said, when there is actual plot, it's good enough that you say \"this isn't as terrible as I expected.\" The episodes prior to the build-up of actual plot are pretty formulaic. \\n\\n\r\n*very mild spoiler*\\n\r\nAssassin announces (that's right, announces) that they're targeting the main character, character tries to figure out why, background info on assassin, main character defeats assassin, rinse and repeat\\n\r\n*end mild spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nThere's also not much action to be had in some episodes. Some feel like they were lazily scripted and even though these are assassins, they aren't very good at providing enough action for this to be an action anime. Suspense sure, but the action is few and far. Finally, the last thing I should mention is that the deus ex machina is heavy. The biggest one is around the end and, essentially, renders the previous episodes obsolete. If you hate that kind of device, steer clear from it.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, if you can see past these flaws (like I managed to do), then the story will be decent enough to enjoy\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): I rarely factor art into my enjoyment of a series unless it causes me physical pain to watch it but the art was generally appealing with few or no complaints. Characters,settings, etc were done nicely\\n\\n\r\nSound (9): Solid voice acting here. The background music did the scenes justice for the most part minus a couple of times where it felt a little off but the music was overall fitting. I don't factor opening or ending themes into my ratings either but the OP was good enough and each episode ended with a song sung by the assassin who was the focus of that episode. All were done well except for a couple but otherwise, catchy.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5): Here is where the show stumbles. These are some of the most best assassins around and yet, I can't help but feel the entire show would be over a lot quicker if the assassin just straight up tried to kill the main character instead of turning it into some sort of mind game. Their methods of going about assassinating are so asinine, it's a wonder that they're even assassins at all. Luckily, there are a couple of genuine badasses of the bunch that make me appreciate sticking around the show but holy hell, most of them are ridiculously ineffective. Additionally, the backgrounds of some of these assassins are really vague, leaving us unable to truly understand the characters. \"This happened, and that happened\" and that's it. No real why's, how's, or even what's are addressed. The backgrounds of the main characters, while a bit more developed and clearer than the assassins, still have some missing questions that have us scratching our heads to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also hard to see characters really develop when they only appear for one episode per assassin (some fewer) but the ones who do end up developing, they pull it off nice enough that you can sort of see past their flaws. Other assassins just felt really generic and pulled out of antagonist vault. By far, the best development comes from our two main characters because where else are we going to get any development with the show? Even then, however, it isn't too big of a development.\\n\\n\r\nThe main antagonist, the host of this assassination games, just doesn't feel like there is enough reason for her to be an antagonist. Sure, they try to make her look evil and badass but ultimately, I couldn't really perceive her to be a threat. At the end of the day, a lot of these villains are forgettable except for a couple of unique individuals. The target of these assassins might also get on your nerves if you hate those \"can't we all be friends\" types. There's a limit to how optimistic you can be towards people who are actively trying to kill you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): I know. I did all this nitpicking and I still enjoyed it? Well that's because I rarely let these things bring me down. I enjoy film, TV, books and even if it's the worst of them. I try to just enjoy the show for what it's worth. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7): I remember hearing a saying that went something along the lines of \"I only nitpick at it because I love it.\" While I don't quite love the show, there is still something to be enjoyed here.While it's not quite memorable enough to leave a deep impact, it is a show that if someone mentions it to you, you'd probably remember it vaguely and be able to give a rough sketch of your feelings for the show. Would I recommend it? Well if you're the kind of person who enjoys fleshed-out and well-developed characters with an intelligent, coherent plot, this probably won't be your cup of tea. If you're anything like me and are blissfully ignorant of flaws and immune to nitpicking and you've got a couple of hours to kill at the airport while you wait for your flight and you want a show that you wouldn't mind doing a marathon of it on your phone, then this is probably the show for you.",

Episode 11 leaves off on a massive cliffhanger that actually is resolved prettywell when you finish the series, however where that cliffhanger is cured, an ENTIRE different slew of problems arise.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely cannot stand deus ex endings, and I really, really don't like in general how they wrapped this story up. It had so much potential, so INCREDIBLY much potential to be a great anime, but they choked at the very end with wrapping up the story. They could've done almost anything else, they could add a truly thoughtful message/action in, they could culminate the relationship of the characters, but instead? They just threw a bunch of garbage together and had it be completely ineffective.\\n\\n\r\nI still recommend watching this anime if you're into battle royale style anime. Throughout the entire thing, I was wondering how this was rated so poorly by the community because it was extremely good, but don't expect anything good from the ending whatsoever. It was the biggest let down of any anime series I've ever watched.",

            "content": "Note: This review is late. I was planning to write this a few weeks ago after I finished this anime, but I decided to do it now. I wanted to review this anime because I felt that this anime failed to deliver at some points. I'm also still new to reviews since I've only made four not counting this one. \r\n-Story-\r\nTo kill or nor to kill is a concept that frequently appears on different types of media. Think of Akuma no Riddle as a combination of a survival game show plus some yuri doujinshi. The theme of the anime is easy to understand. The storyis about twelve assassins whose primary goal is to kill the target, Haru Ichinose. All of the students are part of a \"special\" class called Class Black, similar to class 3-E from Assassination Classroom. However, one of the assassins, Tokaku Azuma, wants to protect Haru rather than kill her. The pacing of the show was stable, but there were some parts of the series that didn't make sense. The ending felt like every event that happened in the anime was scripted or part of a stage play. Ironically, there was an episode where the main setting was a school auditorium. My expression of the ending is mixed with satisfaction and disappointment because the protagonist accomplished her goals despite certain plot twists, but, the story didn't properly explain some of the characters. A lot of potential was wasted in this series starting from the characters to the whole story. There was also some fanservice on the series, which includes the typical \"hot bath\" setting. Also, this anime has each episode titled as a riddle that is answered at the end of an episode. However, the anime forgets to give a proper answer to those riddles in some episodes. Also, despite this anime being a yuri anime, the relationship between Tokaku and Haru was somehow weak. Tokaku did care about Haru, but there was some situation in which Haru didn't need Tokaku's aid. \\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nThe main reason I wanted to do this review is to make a brief analysis of all the 13 students of Class Black and their ups and downs.  It was interesting seeing \"almost\" all of the characters have their ending theme and their episode which focused on their back stories and assassination attempts against Haru. Overall, the characters were pretty diverse and had interesting personalities. However, I felt that their potential was wasted as I mentioned earlier. The list will go from my least favorite to my most favorite. \\n\r\n13. Kouko Kaminaga. She's probably the least interesting of the 12. She does have a backstory, but it's not enough to make her a great character.  Judging by the design, she would fit better at a post-apocalyptic anime.\\n\r\n12. Moeka Kiryuu. Oh, wait that's not Moeka, that's Shiena Kenmochi. She might be one of the most wasted characters I've seen in an anime. She didn't get her episode, ending theme, or even a plausible attempt to assassinate Haru. At first, I thought that she was going to have a similar personality to Moeka from Steins; Gate because they look quite similar. However, little is known about her since the anime fails to explain her background. The only thing that's known about her it's that she likes to write making her a typical nerdy girl. \\n\r\n11. Hitsugi Kirigaya. We can't have an anime without the lolis. Hitsugi appears to be boring at first, but she receives some development along with Chitaru in the series. She's not related to Kirito, by the way. \\n\r\n10. Chitaru Namatame. She looks like some a noblewoman. Her design doesn't fit with the time setting. However, it does fit her being Hitsugi's guardian and even playing as Romeo for the school play that occurred on one of the episodes. However, I think a character of her design will fit better on a fantasy anime. Her relationship with Hitsugi was interesting, though. \\n\r\n9. Otoya Takechi. The patient killer who likes to toy with her victims in a masochistic fashion. She does get multiple chances to shine twice in the series. But she just turns out to be the jobber of the series. \\n\r\n8. Sumireko Hanabusa. She seems like a snobby rich girl at first glance. But, she receives major development later in the series. All I can say is if you're a mecha fan watch out for her. She does a sad backstory which made her one of the strongest characters of the series.\\n\r\n7. Haru Ichinose. Surprisingly, she wasn't a useless character. She was independent of Tokaku in certain situations. The yuri of the series was quite unnecessary. \\n\r\n6. Haruki Sagae. Haruki looks familiar. She looks like Kyouko Sakura. They have the same personality, obsession with Pocky, sense of fashion, and even hair color. Kyoko might even be one of Haruki's siblings, who knows? Anyways, I wanted her to remain longer in the series but too bad they rushed her character. \\n\r\n5. Suzu Shutou. The carefree veteran assassin. She has a chill personality (literally), and an interesting backstory. Her design and sense of fashion are great. I wish she more popular in the series, though. \\n\r\n4. Isuke Inukai. Speaking a fashion, Isuke is your typical femme fatale character. Her backstory is a brief one, and I wished the anime her more effectively. All I know is that she's the adopted daughter of same-sex parents, but I never got to know her original parents since her backstory scene passed by rapidly.  In fact, I didn't get to know whether some of the other supporting characters were orphans or not. Anyways, her personality is enjoyable, and she does have a lot of memorable moments. \\n\r\n3. Mahiru \"Shinya\" Banba. The Touko Fukawa of this series minus the glasses. She has a sad backstory that explains her split personality. She has an intriguing personality that makes you like her; especially if you're into yangire characters. \\n\r\n2. Nio Hashiri. The Queen of Trolls. Nio is the most entertaining character of the series. From her personality to her design she's one of those characters you love to hate. She plays a good villainous role, but she lacks a good backstory. The anime fails to explain her effectively as it did with many other characters.\\n\r\n1. Tokaku Azuma. The reason why this anime wasn't as bad I thought it would be is that of Tokaku. Her design and personality are solid. She's a badass in short. I like female characters similar to her. It was enjoyable seeing her together with Tokaku. However, it seemed pointless in the end. \\n\r\n-Art (Music & Design)-\\n\r\nThe opening theme was fitting for the series. Also, the theme was great that it made me get hyped up for every episode. The art for each ending was also diverse. Almost each character of the series had their spotlight. However, the design of the background characters was somehow disappointing. Not everyone in a city has to be a high school student. This series didn't have a memorable environment outside of the campus. \\n\r\n-Top 5 Pros-\\n\r\n1. Good music.\\n\r\n2. Diverse characters.\\n\r\n3. Badass protagonist. \\n\r\n4. Simple setting and theme.\\n\r\n5. Decent character designs. \\n\r\n-Top 5 Cons-\\n\r\n1. Bad main villain. Nio was great but why would you name a villain of a yuri anime, Yuri. I think Nio alone was a good villain.  \\n\r\n2. Bland environments. \\n\r\n3. Lack of good male characters.  \\n\r\n4. Various plot twist that don't make sense.\\n\r\n5. Bad character development. \\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle is one of those series that isn't appreciated that much. It's probably because of the yuri themes or the pacing. But, I overall enjoyed the series. I recommend this anime if you've watched Assassination Classroom and Danganronpa or if you're a guy or gal that enjoys watching girl action. In conclusion, this anime remains underrated 'till this day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Series Rating: 7/10",

The girls might seem a little cute and ditzy, but when it comes time to do their jobs, they will drop the act and go full killer mode! Also, while there are certain antagonists,some of the girls in Class Black aren't actually evil. It's just that they are fighting for a certain cause which some can see as just. It is why for this anime, viewers can't help but sympathize for them. The Opening and Endings are awesome. I particularly love the 9th episode's ending the most. Also, This anime is morePG-13 than R, as it isn't very violent as some say.",

            "content": "Let me start out by saying I have mixed feelings about this anime, the plot was muddled and confusing at times but something kept me watching til the end. I watched the whole series in one day and if I don't like something I usually put it off or eventually drop it but something was different about this one.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nI don't even know... It was strange to say the least. If it was just a story about finding a new top assassin by eliminating the others that would have made more sense. But it wasn't really about that exactly. Something about primes.. and bees.. andI don't even know. But I found the eliminating part entertaining I liked how each character had their own episode and even their own ending theme. I like focusing on one character at a time with big casts like this until it gets narrowed down. But there were some plot points I found confusing and weird. All in all if it wasn't for the full cast of female characters which I'll get into later I'd drop it after 10 seconds.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing groundbreaking but oh lord the girls were so freaking cute. Every single one of them were just so nice to look at. I liked the colors and the backgrounds and the shading of the hair and everything. The character designs were just awesome. All the girls looked so cute especially Isuke lemme just fangirl for a sec she was cute as hell. Anyways the art wasn't really groundbreaking but it was nice to look at. I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said I liked all the music except maybe the opening it got old after a while but the ending songs were different each episode and I liked that. The sound effects themselves were passable and fine. I had to watch the dub because it's all Funimation had. I feel like the score would be higher if I watched the sub because the dub voices were not my favorite except for maybe Tokaku. Haru's voice got kinda annoying near the end. So probably go for the sub if you want to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow other reviewers say they're bland stock characters but I don't fully agree. While they are \"types\" I feel like they still stood out and were original. I loved the robot arms on a certain character and all the girls were just CUTE AS HELL. I have a soft spot for all of them. I wish this was more of a yuri but it had the shoujo ai elements which kept me focused as well. It was super cute. I liked the dynamic with Tokaku and Haru and the whole \"I'll protect you\" angle. And let me say again Isuke is my WIFE.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI know I won't be rewatching this one but it still kept me entertained to the end and will probably stick with me. I loved the characters and that's the most important part for me of any anime. I found myself rooting/yelling at characters etc so I was really kinda into it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSeems high but I still liked it although the ending could have been a lot better seemed too abrupt for my liking. I'll probably watch the OVA soon. \\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all I recommend this if you want something easy to watch with lots of cute girls fighting in skirts while being tough and most importantly no male characters to pause the plot.",

I just turn off my brain and enjoy them. So I gave this a try and... well\r\n\u2588\u2588\u2588STORY\u2588\u2588\u2588\r\nIt's bad. Like really bad. Looks like something written by a ten years old for the big amount of stupidity and inconsistencies. Is totally impossible to take this seriously from the start. Just look at the plot: a bunch of girls (professional assassins who don't reach 18 years old) go to school. The only purpose ofthis is killing one of their classmates, who is totally aware of this. They take turns to do so and everything. The professor who gives classes to them (because for some reason they have to assist school while trying to kill someone, of course) knows nothing about this, and he's so stupid that doesn't notice that something is wrong even when the amount of girls that leave his class is too big. Then we have the target of the killing (Haru), who is so stupid that wants to be friends with people who is trying to kill her. Luckily, she has a bodyguard, who used to be one of the assassins supposed to kill her, but know she's protecting her because... because reasons [(actually, this is explained later)]. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the inconsistencies. And I'm not just talking about how a girl can stop a bullet with a saw (which actually happened and I was supposed to take seriously), but other kind of stuff. Like, this looks like it happens in the real world (our world), but some characters have superpowers. For example, there's a girl who doesn't age. The show barely explained things, so maybe those weren't real superpowers.\\n\r\nDo you recall the famous phrase from Emiya Shirou \"People die if they are killed\"? Well, it doesn't apply to this show. People who are supposed to be dead came back to life because yes.\\n\\n\r\nThe killing themselves wouldn't be that bad if the girls actually focused on killing instead of wasting time. I don't know what is bigger: Haru's plot armor or the assassins' stupidity. They are like those villains from movies who can finish you off with one hit, but instead tell you all their motivations and plans, so someone can come to your rescue. \\n\\n\r\n\"Well, the survival sounds really shitty. What about the romance?\"\\n\r\nWhat romance are you talking about? This barely go deeper in the relationship between Tokaku and Haru. I wouldn't know that this was a lesbian show if MAL hadn't told me.\\n\\n\r\n\u2588\u2588\u2588CHARACTERS\u2588\u2588\u2588\\n\\n\r\nThough I like the design of the characters, their personalities fall in archetypes. They even used the most third-rated character traits like split personality and psychopath serial killer. Luckily, the show actually tries to do some character development. Sadly, it fails. \\n\\n\r\nTalking about the main characters, Tokaku is fine. She's probably a one dimensional character, but I don't have a problem with her. In the other hand, Haru is really annoying. Not only because she talks about herself in third person (which I found really irritating), but because she's actually too dumb to realize that she can't be friends with her assassins.

            "content": "This is my first review, so it's probably not going to be the greatest but I will try.\r\nStory- 6/10\r\nSo the story's main setting is at a school called Myoujou Academy(an all girls private boarding school). Where there is a class called Black Class. In this such class there is 12 assassins who are after one target. This girl is named Haru Ichinose, the reward for who sucessfully kills the target will get anything they want.\r\nThen the other main character known as Tokaku Azuma finds out that the target will be living in the same room as her. In this twist she then develops feelings towardsHaru to where she wants to protect her.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10\\n\r\nI have to be honest the art in this was pretty amazing. Its not anything really new we have seen thus far But the overall art of it was so good that out of all the anime in 2014 thus far I would put it in the top 10 of shows with amazing art.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound in this show was plain out amazing. I really loved the opening and endings, where all the endings where different I would say that it has some of the best music in any anime this year. I also really like the suspense music they would play through out it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-6/10\\n\r\nOk this is where it has its fault. I would make this lower but I liked that they did actually give each character its own back story which I loved. But to be honest only the two main characters go through any development. But like i said I really love how they give there back story to show why they are trying to get the reward in the first place. But then again half the characters just get dropped like flies.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-6/10\\n\r\nThis is really a two part grade. The first 8 episodes it was so predictable it was sad where I would give it a 4 or 5. But oh boy the last 4 episodes they were so amazing in my opinion. They had non stop twists and thats where it really shined. At first you might think it had no story. But once you get through the first 8 episodes of action knife slicing and such. It really turns into a great show that i couldn't put down. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 overall.\\n\r\nIf you want a action packed anime, but with not the greatest story. I would say Akuma No Riddle is just for you. If you can get past the first 8 episodes you get some of the best twists you willl ever see.",

            "content": "This review will contain non-explicit spoilers.\r\nAkuma no Riddle is an anime which I looked forward to viewing every week. It is an overall enjoyable experience if you bear in mind the short running time. I personally found the end disappointing, however.\r\nStory - 6/10.\r\nI enjoyed the premise of this show - a kind of Danganronpa-esque survival game within the \"Black Class\", a class of 13 students. It wasn't totally butchered; there were some interesting plot twists here and there and the pacing was okay for such a short anime, however because of its shortness, it did feel a little rushed at times, for example some ofthe battle scenes could have been expanded on a little more, and similarly to Danganronpa we lost a character per episode on average, which didn't allow the watcher to fully connect with the story.\\n\r\nI also did not enjoy the ending. I don't understand why the show went through killing them each episode for that to happen at the end. Maybe I missed something.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10.\\n\r\nDecent character design, I enjoyed the animation generally. Thought the battle/action scenes were eye-catching and didn't leave you wanting.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the soundtrack to this, Soushou Innocence by Maaya Uchida fit the theme of the show relatively well and set up a mostly fast-paced action-filled episode each week. The voice acting was good, the only voice that really irritated me was Haru's, but that's personal preference as opposed to bad seiyuu. I thought for the most part the voices fit the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10.\\n\r\nThis is where the show tripped itself up a little - though this is mostly due to the short run time of the anime, only 12 episodes. Each character was relatively unique from one another, though I didn't think any character really screamed originality this didn't really detract from the anime as their interactions were still interesting.\\n\r\nHowever you never really get any chance to get attached to any of the characters, their backstories are briefly outlined but because they tend to disappear rapidly we don't get a chance to root for anyone, to really appreciate why they are here and why they became an assassin.\\n\r\nThe relationship between Ichinose and Tokaku was never properly expanded upon, which is a shame, it would have added another dimension to the anime however this again suffered from time constraints.\\n\r\nAs a result we get quite one-dimensional characters with no chance to really learn about what their true motives, drives, etc are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10.\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime, although the last two episodes left me with a \"meh\" feeling. It looks and sounds good, no glaring errors there, and the story itself is a good watch, and it does get quite gripping at points.\\n\r\nI would recommend this to those who like anime which will have them on the edge of their seats at times, however don't expect a masterpiece.",

In addition, the lack of any really interesting personalities made the cast very lacklustre. \r\nI wasn't a big fan of the music. I hated the OP, and I don't remember the ED. \r\nMy biggest problem with this anime is that for having such an \"edgy\" premise, it really didn't do anything to live up to it. It shiedaway from a lot of mature content, yet still tried to portray itself as some sort of dark, action-packed thriller. There were very few on-screen deaths, and even when there were, it was very tame. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that had the potential to be a sexy and intriguing, but it ended up being a boring battle royale.",

Akuma no Riddle has an interesting story that stays on course the entire time without drifting off and wasting an episode or two. The art was visually appealing grabbing my attention through out the entire thing. The sound was great and was decent to listen to as much as watching it. Each character has a story and each one was well told out in my opinion although i wish that this anime were 24 episodes to go into more depthof each individual character. I enjoyed every my time watching Akuma no Riddle and i watched it from start to finish in one sitting i couldn't stop after finishing an episode, my overall rating is an 8/10.",

            "content": "A story about a lesbian assassin sounds like it could either be very good, or very bad. Akuma no Riddle is a mix of both. \r\nThe anime starts off very strong. There's enough mystery to keep you on your feet and the first few assassination attempts are suspenseful and intriguing. The main character is bad-ass, yet not over-powered.  If the anime stayed at the level of quality that there was in the beginning, it could have easily landed on my favorite's list. \r\nThere's not much character development, but hey, there's 13 characters squeezed into 12 episodes. To be honest, I didn't even mind thatmuch. Although I will say the story might have been better with fewer characters. Maybe 10 instead of 13 would have sufficed. \\n\\n\r\nAs the show progresses, the assassination attempts become ridiculously convoluted. I cant say much without giving away spoilers, but at times it seems like the assassins are trying to fail. That, and the episodes became somewhat predictable as they started to follow a set formula. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance between the two MC's has development near the beginning, but then tapers off. At times there was little chemistry between the two. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much else to be said. This anime is mostly empty entertainment, so don't expect anything life-changing or outstanding. Also, one of the main characters yells out the other main character's name out a lot. If I hear \"Tokaku-san!\" one more time I'm gonna lose it.",

Tho' the yuri scenes aren't much and not-too-yuri. Take place in Myoujou Academy, the private boarding school. In the surface, there's nothing different from this institution, know deeper and you'll find it that the 10th Year Class Black aren't filled with normal students. They are all assassins.\r\n    Haru Ichinose is one of the Class Black student, regrettably she is also the target of other 13 assasins. Slowly but sure, one of em, namedTokaku Azuma begins to protect Haru from assassination by the unexpected feeling that grows towards her. The awful secret of the academy, resolve of each assassins, and the numerous attempted murder to Haru.\\n\\n\r\n    The show is quite good, I like it even every ep seems episodic because of it shows us one by one assassination the students try to attempt. They need to success in order to get the prize from killing Haru. The school offers any wish they want to get, there's also consequent for those who fail, which will be dropped out of school. Everyday school life is stained by the intention to kill and tension of each other. Talk about the fighting, it's good but not superior. The killing intention vibe raises up and the whole mess starts.\\n\\n\r\n    Since there are so many characters, these assassins have their own uniqueness. They stand out in their role but not developed enough, except the main characters, Azuma and Haru. We will get explanations of each character and their changing, still those words and few scenes of all of 'em won't satisfying just by 12 eps. I don't mean to extend the series here. Azuma x Haru's relationship (friendship) is somewhat complicated (in this circumstances, they aren't the one to blame). Azuma tries her best to not let Haru get killed whilst wonder the true purpose of school and who is Haru to be targeted?\\n\\n\r\n    The suspense feeling will raise from the songs too, they are various songs here, especially insert songs of Akuma no Riddle series. Just for your information, I do think that most of character songs are very well too aside from the OP & ED theme songs. OP theme song is \"S\u014dsh\u014d Innocence\" (\u5275\u50b7\u30a4\u30ce\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9) by Maaya Uchida, I like the beating of it. ED theme songs are the songs from each seiyuu, it's different for each episode (character song).\\n\\n\r\nI give Akuma no Riddle series 7.5 \u2727 It's good to have series which the characters are female and they are trying to kill each other lol\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nTheme songs! The first impression that hype me up\\n\r\nVarious characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nThe characters can be developed more but they didn't",

Good variety of appearances and even personalities.\r\nEverything else about the series is absolutely terrible.\r\nFirst of all, they take turns assassinating 1 target. So whoever tried it at episode 3 obviously failed because there's an episode 4, and then 4 and 5, then 5 and 6, etc.+ \r\nSecondly. On the same point, remember when someone told you there's a really great prize, and whoever gets their hands on it FIRST is the winner. And then you go \"yeah I'll be the 8th person to take a shot\". Because, why would Imind missing out the prize without getting a go?\\n\\n\r\nThen, they don't even die. The girls slap each other a bit => assassination is then deemed to have failed. The the girl leaves school. Put a nice flower on the desk. If you are too weak to tell a story where characters get killed, maybe don't choose assassination as the subject. It's like you make a basketball anime, and then every character in it is too weak to actually play basketball. Everyone had a go and FAILED. And no basketball was played. \\n\\n\r\nThe riddles still make 0 sense after you are told the answer. That's not how riddle works in any language I know. Maybe I don't live in Japan but I understood all the other anime I watched. So I have no reason to pity this one.",

In comparison to the other girls in the class she's average to say the least. It does the job well, but in not a very good manner.\\n\r\n         The sound is mediocre, it didn't touch me at all, and the scenes that were meant to hit my hearth with the hammer didn't succeed in doing so.

            "content": "\"Akuma no Riddle\", being about assassins, is hard to tie down to a particular genre. However, it is widely considered a Yuri series;  even though there's nothing explicit and no real talk of love, most fans interpret the two main girls as romantic partners. They can also be interpreted as close friends. Whether you think it's Yuri or not, \"Akuma no Riddle\" will probably delight anyone who likes assassin stories, well-animated combat sequences, and of course pretty-but-deadly young women. \r\nThe art is great, the story is interesting, and the main characters are unforgettable. However, \"Akuma no Riddle\" is certainly not perfect. The worst flawin the series occurs at the end, and while I won't tell you what happened, many fans were upset with it. Yuri fans like me were also disappointed to see so little physical/romantic affection between the two girls. Also, the music isn't really memorable, and the opening song is just plain annoying. These are the kind of flaws that prevent \"Akuma no Riddle\" from being rated any higher. Still, I think it's good overall and I encourage you to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I loved the character Tokaku Akuma. Her fighting skills are amazing, she's emotionally strong, and she is loyal almost to a fault. Whether she is a lesbian or not, her devotion to the other main girl is outstanding. She reminds me of myself, except I'm not that great with knives and obstacle courses. If you don't like Miss Akuma, don't worry: there are many assassins to choose from, each with their own histories and their own kind of charm. I encourage viewers to check out \"Akuma no Riddle.\"",

A very big thumbs up from me!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nWell, it comes with my favourite character ever created, so all i can say is- good job!\\n\r\nThe characters were suited with each other, each one had their own cliche to do, but sadly, around 10 had a purpose of 1 episode... and then the others were either 2 eps or the whole anime.\\n\r\nIt has characters like the main (Tokaku Azuma) which was really well done, and (Haru whatevertheheck) which was also done well, but with tons of cliches, and she receives my thumbs down, because, go see for yourself... If you're not a fan of the f***ing cliches, jesus.\\n\r\nThen comes my favourite character- Nio Hashiri, silly, cute, serves nearly no purpose, but to prove she does, well... ergh, go watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nWell i had plenty of fun, and i didn't waste or regret any of the seconds that went into watching those 12 episodes of girls battling and shiz... I do recommend you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nLets go over with pro's and con's\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+amazing characters\\n\r\n+well made story\\n\r\n+Amazing soundtracks and voice actors\\n\r\n+Very good animations\\n\r\n+surprises served the \"purpose of surprises\"\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-Too much cliches\\n\r\n-way too predictable\\n\r\n-Too clingy with all the \"happy ending\" theme\\n\r\n-cliches\\n\r\n-cliches\\n\\n\r\noverall, well, i put a 10 out of 10, but if i wouldn't have enjoyed the anime, it would have been an 8.5/10 maximum.

My favorite though was the opening song, that got me pumped up to watch the show every time. The endings were all good, with a few unique songs that stoodout. I liked how each episode there was an ending song for each assassin, and also for the target, Haru.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 \\n\r\nMost (if not all) characters had their time to shine, most getting their own episode to show their reason for being an assassin. Though, I feel they didn't do enough for some characters, and I ended up not feeling anything towards them at the end of the episodes/anime. One thing I really hated was that Haru stayed pretty much the same throughout the show - very gullible and naive, constantly saying she wants everyone to graduate, pretty much forgetting that everyone around her is AN ASSASSIN that wants to KILL HER!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe fight scenes were enjoyable, some plot twists that kept me watching the show, along with the music, not much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10 \\n\r\nThe story... my god this was a mess. Not to mention that the series was very unoriginal, and felt extremely episodic, almost every assassin getting an episode for their attempt. I felt I knew exactly what was going to happen even before I started each episode (with the exception of a couple). Also, THAT ENDING, I HATE that some of the assassins somehow MAGICALLY LIVED through this... Especially the Romeo/Juliet girls... Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 \\n\r\nIf it wasn't for the story(which I think is the most important part of shows), this would have gotten probably a 7 or 8 out of 10. Would not recommend this to anyone unless this was their type of anime.",

            "content": "So I just finished this anime a few hours ago, and I have to say it was a lot of fun. But in terms of actual substance, it had many weak points.\r\nBefore I get into that, though, I just want to comment that, for a show in the yuri genre, there really wasn't a lot of yuri. Plenty of female characters, sure, but not a ton of romance. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it might be something you want to consider, if you're looking for yuri.\r\nThe story was very basic. For the majority of the episodes, you know exactly what's going tohappen, because they all follow the same set-up. No real plot development happens from the first two episodes till the last two. The ending almost surprised me, but then it concluded in a very trope-ish way, unfortunately. But the story creates a great premise to showcase the characters, which are the real highlight of this show.\\n\r\nThere are so many characters in this show that I can guarantee you that you'll find one you love. Part of the issue, though, is that each character gets pretty much just one episode, so you don't get a lot of time with them. But each episode focuses so much on each character that it feels like enough. The EDs are a testament to how much thought is put into each character's personality and story, and they provide for a lot of great music. And they fact that they chose to produce new, fantastic art for each ED is also really impressive.\\n\r\nOverall, I'm pretty confident in the 7 I gave this show. The plot is repetitive, the romance is barely there, and each character besides the main two is only given around twenty minutes of screentime (one gets none at all). But there's always great action and fight scenes, a new character to get to know, and a devil's riddle to keep you wondering well after the episode is over.",

            "content": "It is truly a shame when a certain element of a show binds the hands of the viewer, and masks the brighter qualities that made it so very watchable. What could have been praise-worthy material is brought down to a rather anti-climatic end. It stops the viewer, painfully, from giving a score that it would otherwise deserve. \r\nAction. Drama. Gore. Intensity. They're all there in Akuma no Riddle, and certainly is a feast for the eyes and the mind for those who enjoy strong plot development. With so many unique assassins targeting a single individual, there is an incredible amount of potential for many excitingscenes, something AnR delivers with ease. The characters truly make the show, as the animation and voice acting harmonize well and make the premise believable and enjoyable to watch. Especially for some of the characters, the voice acting is simply superb, blending in with the atmosphere and the unease. One can simply feel the pure insanity and unbridled desire to kill radiating from some of the more \"unstable\" characters. The combat scenes are smooth and lack no amount of quality, even to the very end. Dialogue remains consistently thought-provoking. Motive remains unclear. All of these things build on the tension and anticipation of the finality, preparing the viewer for what just may be an incredible ending. A chance to wrap everything up in one delicious  burrito. \\n\\n\r\nBut the ending is paramount, especially for a show such as AnR that introduces such a brave method of plot progression. I detest using the analogy of the roller coaster, but it describes this case, most unfortunately, perfectly. This roller coaster is like a ride that goes up and up and up, and then stops at a station on the very top, and the people who rode it take the stairs to get back down to ground level. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason for my great disappointment is the lack of courage by the author. Because, profound things do happen to the characters. Profound things, and some of them VERY much irreversible. But the final two episodes did not, in my opinion, do any justice to all of the time spent developing the characters and the situation. It is an ending where everyone is alright, feels alright, and are better people for going through adversity. An open ending. An ending where everyone lives, and everyone wins!\\n\\n\r\nHere, it is a negation of the struggles that every single character went through. Here we find that death and defeat are no longer realistic factors, and everything is at a null. Back to square zero. The only thing that has changed is the relationship between the two main heroines (which didn't even develop as fully as I would have liked, due to one of them being a kuudere). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you've read other reviews, yes, Akuma no Riddle has lot's of potential, but it did not fulfill.\r\nBut, if you're an avid anime watcher, you wouldn't expect much from this anime in the first place.\r\nSure, survival games can always be somewhat interesting, but immediately, if you'll notice, Akuma no Riddle has a less than 7 rating on MAL, 13 characters and 12 episodes. (13 if you count the OVA)\r\nThat formula itself is not good. With so many characters and so little episodes you can predict the anime will try to give each character its own little piece of screen time, but it did not workout well.\\n\\n\r\nAkuma no Riddle followed an episodic format that made it predictable.\\n\r\nSeeing each characters backstories and failed attempts just gets boring. But probably my biggest issue with this anime is that the characters....\\n\r\nare pretty dumb.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you have Haru Ichinose, she's being targeted, right? She knows this and even gets a notice every time someone will attempt to kill her, and you know what? SHE'S STILL FRIENDLY WITH THEM!?\\n\\n\r\nI mean seriously, if people have tried to kill this girl her ENTIRE LIFE, If you, are in a dark room with another girl assassin, and you just got a notice that you will be killed, you DON'T GO AND ASK:\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh, Haruki-san? Have you seen Tokaku-san? She wrote me a memo of how she wanted to see me here urgently...\"\\n\\n\r\nNO, BITCH, YOU RUN.\\n\\n\r\nI mean seriously, this girl Haru's dream is to want to live right? WELL IT SURE DON'T SEEM LIKE IT.\\n\\n\r\nAnd not just Haru, the assassins have less sense than an empty piggy bank too.\\n\\n\r\nIf you kill this girl, you can get ANY WISH. So even if you are SKILLED, COCKY, ASSASSINS.\\n\r\nWE ARE TALKING ANYTHING HERE.\\n\r\nSome of their logic and ways they want to kill her, well, let's just say I could do better than they could. In the cast of characters, we also have the most dense and naive homeroom teacher ever to grace the earth. YOU SERIOUSLY WOULDN'T SUSPECT ANYTHING IF 7 PEOPLE TRANSFERRED IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK? \\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, those are just the main problems, packed with the confusing ending which actually managed to somehow undo plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nIf you see Akuma no Riddle, I will admit, it seems interesting. Not the best art and animation, but for me I really liked it, the anime even dedicated a different ending song for each character. IT SEEMS INTERESTING, IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH!\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, some good points, music is good, like I said before, each character has their own ending, the opening grew on me too, it really sets up the mood, but unfortunately, the anime wasn't as dark as I expected.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy it, I...wanted to enjoy it, but I'm sure most of us MALians will agree it didn't fulfill much of it's potential.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Let me start by saying an article in Otakuusa convinced me to watch this series. I don't know, it's like it has everything I could want in an anime and yet it still left me wanting. It's devoid of the anime cliches I dislike (save the high school setting but I won't knock it for that). It lacks many cliches others tend to dislike, fan service and no strong female characters. I like the premise, story and characters. The art and action was good, and the story has sufficient twists. But the whole thing is just too predictable. Maybe had I watched it as itaired I would have liked it more. But knowing it was only twelve episodes creates a villain of the week formula that gives the story predictability.They say it's about the journey not the destination, but I've always disagreed. If it was about the journey you wouldn't care where you ended up, that's my problem with this series. The destination is kind of important here as it completes the story. The journey seems routine, a simple formula to follow just to get to the end. It was cool to watch and I really enjoyed watching it but eleven assassins in twelve episodes...you can kind of see where this is going fast. I like how the story incorporates the incompetence of some of these assassins into to it. There were several times I questioned why these trained assassins are struggling to kill an ordinary high school girl. Also the end. I'm not a big fan of this style of ending. I know why they do it but it still change the fact that...I do not like this style of ending. A detailed expression on this would contain spoilers so I let it go at that. In summation I'll recommend this series with a \"but\". BUT, don't expect to be blown away for find your new favorite here, (far be it for me to dictate the tastes of others, it's just my psychotic opinion) you'll watch it, it'll be over and you'll move on to the next series.\\n\r\nOne more note: I think it's important to point out the difference between \"good\" and \"great\" and that's what I'm doing with this review. Riddle Story Of Devil is a perfect example of how I separate good from great.",

How in the hell is a premise like that supposed to work?\r\nAnswer: with outstanding visuals, mesmerising combat, great characters and a story that will tug at your heartstrings from beginning to end.\r\nSo the story begins with Class Black, a special little group of 13 girls gathered together for one purpose: 12 of them are supposed to go after the 13th. And the brilliant thing is everyone is aware of the status quo. Well, except the teacher - how quaint - for whose benefit the whole \"pretending to be a real class\" thing is.Poor clueless sensei.\\n\\n\r\nSo, enter our main heroine, one Azumi Tokaku. She is an emotionally challenged bad-ass that, given the tools, would give any would-be assassin a run for their money. And she is totally hot in a tomboyish sort of way. She comes into the whole thing on orders of her superior -  one very f*ked and crafty psychologist named Kaiba who pesters her with unanswerable riddles throughout the seires - with nary a want or goal of her own until she meets...\\n\\n\r\nIchinose Haru. Oh man. This girl. Even if you didn't know the premise beforehand and even if somehow you missed the first intro - which totally would give it away - she is. from the moment she comes on-screen, most obviously the target. She is the friendliest, most open girl there with her only goal being to graduate. You know, without dying. \\n\\n\r\nSo the two meet, their personalities clash like fire and ice, one assassin gets a tad greedy and rushes in for the kill, Tokaku busts her moves and bim bam boom! the ball gets rolling.\\n\\n\r\nWhat follows can only be described as a roller-coaster. The action is top notch and the characters, who at first come off as practically cliche show most amazing - if sometimes subtle - depths to them, as their images of heartless killers are washed away like tears in the rain. Half-way through the series... I... I...\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, the ride continues at its perfect pace until the glorious conclusion that resolutely flips the whole thing on its head, while tugging at your heartstrings as if attempting to pull them out.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"But if Haru was allowed to decide the answer, \"forgiveness\" would be nice\"",

            "content": "CONTAINS SPOILERS!\r\n////\r\nAs you may have already seen in the synopsis of Akuma no Riddle it is a kind of battle royale between the classmates of the so called \"Black Class\". You may suppose lots of violence will be seen and that the main two, Ichinose Haru and Azuma Tokaku, will have some character development.\r\nHaha, not really.\r\nThe first two episodes are slow. All the class members are getting to the school used for the Black Class. In these two episodes they show mostly what kind of people the assasins are and how Ichinose wants to live her last high school year, plus a little bit ofintimidating each other. As everyone is present they have a meeting where they reveal the predictable target they have to assasinate. They get some rules and Azuma reveals how she will protect Ichinose instead. So it begins!\\n\\n\r\nEpisodically the assasins start going after Ichinose. These aren't too bad, but it depends on the invidual whether they'll find it enough of a characterisation. What was bad about this is that not all of them get to show their personality and/or their background story (Hashiri Nio and Kenmochi Shiena per example). Also, the way they go about the assasination differs greatly. Some were pretty stupid and the amount of violence in the action scenes are pretty minimal. \\n\r\nThey did do something interesting with that which are the different endings that fit the character that failed the assasination of that episode. Again, some endings looked a lot better than others with most of the ending being pictures of them and a sequence where they show some of the action in their silhouette.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore about the story: Ichinose doesn't really grow and stays the same determined to live, cutesy gal. Azuma on the other hand changes her perspective on life and sort of accepts her history to be able to well now. She kind of likes Ichinose for that, but because of this perspective and the weird explanation as to why the Black Class exists in the first place she does something so stupid after the fight with Hashiri. And ta-da! Seems like everyone is alive for some reason and some stay friends with each other for some reason!\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the opening, endings and background are pretty good but not that special or gripping. They fit the show and never felt awkward, but are forgettable. As for the art: it's pretty cool, the characters look fine and mostly fit their personality. The animation is smooth and colorful. Nothing really stood out to me which is good and bad. Bad because nothing looked outstandingly beautiful and good because it didn't drop in quality and stayed consistent. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, pretty average, but because it was never boring to me and I enjoyed the show I find it fair to give it a 6. The animation helped the score quite a bit, that story though.\\n\\n\r\nBONUS: This anime does contain little to no yuri scenes. Read the manga if you actually wanted some form of yuri (the manga isn't really yuri either though). The manga has a little bit more details than the anime between characters, but lacks those details in the fight scene. \\n",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle, alternately Riddle Story of Devil, is a rather refreshing deviation from your typical super moe \"cute-girls-doing-cute-things\" genre of yuri anime. The concept of \"assassin yuri\" insinuates that Akuma no Riddle would mix the genres of suspense, drama, action, and yuri efficiently; I'm glad to say that it was executed rather decently. Of course it is not without its flaws, and to be frank, is just as easy to pick apart as it is to find enjoyable. \r\nPlot: 6/10\r\nAs you would expect, this premise requires the \"monster of the week\" format, and it does get predictable very quickly. Not to mention thereare quite a bit of plot holes, and there we're a few instances where Tokaku and Haru should died without their plot armor protecting them. The pacing also feels a bit rushed and cut for time in a few instances. However, it does deliever some twists here and there to keep things interesting. The action does not dissapoint, and I was actually surprised at how dark it was. This is no Sakura Trick (not that Sakura Trick was bad, mind you.) \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri aspect of AnK was a bit lacking though, as there was hardly anything explicitly yuri-ish (kissing, holding hands, etc.) but there is a lot of subtext and there's little doubt as to who's paired up with who.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nRather impressive. The animation was smooth, the art was pleasing to look at and the contrast in some scense doesn't strain the eye either. The soundtrack was bizzare, but in a good way, and helped to create a gritty and mysterious atmosphere. The OP is one of my favorites of any anime, but one of the best points of the soundtrack would have the the many EDs, each sung by the character's voice actress after they are expelled.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd say the anime's biggest focus was on the characters rather than the plot. Interesting characters overall, as they didn't stick to typical architypes for the most part. Each assassin does have their own backstory though, which makes them redeemable and gives a reason for their actions. My biggest qualm with the characters however, is that some just didn't have enought screen time to fully give them depth and make them really believeable; they are more developed in the manga though, which is to be expected for a 12 ep anime, to be fair, as there were most definitely time constraints regarding the characters considering just many of them there are.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nAs an impartial reviewer, I give an 8/10, but personally I rank it as 9/10. Each week I found myself anxiously anticipaiting the next episode, and was overall impressed and found Akuma no Riddle very enjoyable. If you feel stuck in and endless rut of moe and are looking for an entertaining, more character driven action/drama, then Akuma no Riddle is definately a breath of fresh air.",

            "content": "Going into this anime I didn't really have any expectations. The concept was interesting enough, but it wasn't something I hadn't seen before in one way or another. \r\nTokaku Azuma, the story\u2019s main protagonist, is sent to Myojo Academy to participate in a competition between other assassins where the main objective is to murder Haru Ichinose (for seemingly unknown reasons). After vowing to protect Haru, both of their developments take a backseat to the side characters. \r\nThe show tries so desperately to cycle through each assassin within such a limited amount of time, that even the characters with the right potential just end up fallingflat.  \\n\\n\r\nNot much is known about ANY of the characters until their designated episode comes up, and even then, it\u2019s cut in half because the anime tries so hard to explain their back story. I\u2019d say that there was SOME foreshadowing with a few of the later characters, but a lot of it felt so cryptic that the anime actually needed to hold my hand. \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s strongest character is Tokaku. Although her relationship with Haru felt forced at times, Tokaku really was the most consistent character of this story. Her motivations and development were at times overshadowed by the next punching bag\u2019s struggle, but at least an effort was made to prove she wasn\u2019t a completely 1 dimensional character. Aside from her, the only other notable characters are Haru and Nio.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the art was good. There were times where it seemed a little awkward, but for the most part, it was refreshing and clean. There\u2019s nothing notable about it, but at least you won\u2019t get eye strain just from looking at it. Some of the girls had a nice design, too. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot, much like the characters, is a bit rushed and sloppy. Actually, I would go so far as to say that the real plot ends prematurely. After a certain episode, it\u2019s all exposition and resolution. This wasn\u2019t really a bad thing considering how many characters it had to shuffle through, but I refuse to believe the last episode held any true significance due to how the story ended. In fact, nothing was terribly bad about the plot until the final episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs rushed as this anime was, it was extremely easy to watch. My interest was never completely lost, and the fast-paced action actually made it enjoyable to rewatch. The flaws are evident, but it never felt like a chore to sit through. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also some yuri in it if you squint, but I wouldn\u2019t watch it based on that alone as most of it is just subtext. That being said, there were only two actual relationships in the whole anime (three, if you actually care about poorly constructed back-stories). \\n\\n\r\nDespite all these flaws, Akuma no Riddle is something you can pick up quickly. If you\u2019re interested in lady assassins trying to kill someone, then this anime may be something to look into. I wouldn\u2019t exactly recommend it, but it\u2019s not something I would discourage against watching either. \\n",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle has a dark and alluring plot that seemed like it could've explored many interesting ideas however it failed to actually feel mysterious. \r\n  Akuma no Riddle follows Tokaku Azuma an assassin trained by the infamous Azuma clan. She along with 11 other assassins are enrolled into Class Black. Their goal is to kill a girl named Haru Ichinose, who is also attending, in exchange for killing her the killer gets one wish of their choosing. After hearing who the target is Tokaku is compelled to protect Haru instead. Each episode follows Tokaku attempting to protect Haru fromher classmates and slowly uncovering the nature of Class Black. Akuma no Riddle has some interesting ideas that actually got me somewhat interested to see how they'd play out, like some of the murder schemes. However, the main problem with Akuma no Riddle is its mystery, or lack there of. The big overarching mystery throughout Akuma no Riddle is trying to find out the true reasoning of why Class Black exists, or at least its supposed to be. I felt like there was absolutely nothing that implied that this plot even existed and was even being driven forward. Nothing was ever set up that would've indicated that there was an ulterior motive. The closest thing would have been the riddles given to Tokaku throughout the entire anime, by some mysterious man that Tokaku knows. These riddles were likely intended to guide the viewer along in order to solve the mystery of why Class Black existed however, there really wasn't anything indicating that they were even related to Class Black at all. Since the reasoning why these riddles even were given in the first place was extremely vague, and are unintentional misleading. The riddles felt like they related to the person giving them, which some of the dialogue suggests. As a result they felt tact on because they were given by someone who had zero plot significance at all. When any shocking revelations were revealed I felt like they lacked any impact because they had zero foreshadowing to back them up. Contributing to this problem is that Akuma no Riddle decides to drop into the plot with no world building at all. It doesn't bother to introduce any of the concepts that would be important later on and just expects the viewer to know by the time they are important. Akuma no Riddle's story feels like making a puzzle that is missing countless of pieces. It didn't give anything for me to actually think about and instead just sets them down expecting me to understand.   \\n\\n\r\n Akuma no Riddle's main characters aren't the best either. Tokaku is your average cold distant girl, who is all business. Her personality doesn't make her fun to be around as she lacks any traits that would make her a likable character like snark or unexpected talent. She isn't even that cool despite being an assassin because she doesn't do anything overly clever and mostly just handles everything with above average knife skills that are often on par with everyone else. Her backstory is at least somewhat adequate. Throughout the anime her parts of her childhood are slowly revealed and they help to explain why she is the way she is now. This at least made her feel like there was a reasoning behind most of her actions and was kinda nice to see. However, only a very small portion of her past is revealed and doesn't help indicate why she acts the way she does is. We only get really get to see 2 or 3 moments from her childhood. Nothing about how she was raised or why she was even in Class Black are revealed. She feels shallow and there isn't anything that would imply her current motivations. Similarly, Haru has very little backstory. Haru's backstory consist of only one traumatic moment of her childhood and that's it. Nothing interesting about Haru is every uncovered until the very end. Haru's backstory defines her character throughout the entire anime and as a result Haru feels static that never actually grows or learn anything despite what she's been through. Its especially painful considering that Haru is so optimistic to the point where it feels like she actively puts herself in danger. She walks into obvious traps and is way too trusting of her classmates who she knows are all out to get her. Seeing Haru do all this was frankly frustrating and it was hard to even care about her when she did so many idiotic things. It made me wonder why Tokaku was even helping at all. Which leads into another big issue. The relationship between the two of them is also never explored in depth. Its implied that Tokaku and Haru have feelings for each other, but nothing is ever shown to indicate that, besides a couple blushes. Akuma no Riddle doesn't take time at all to build the relationship between these two, even in a non romantic way. There is hardly any scenes of them just talking to each other,being friendly or even getting to know each other better. Most of the time they are together its Tokaku protecting Haru or Tokaku telling Haru to be careful and running off to fight one of the other girls. There was no real relationship between the two as it just felt like a girl protecting another girl for no reason. Akuma no Riddle tries to play off these problems by making them part of the mystery, however there is nothing here to make you question of the nature of their relationship. \\n\\n\r\n    The other characters are somewhat better however, they have their own set of problems. The other 11 students of Class Black are actually fairly unique. Some of them fall into anime tropes, but for the most part they don't act like stereotypical anime girls at all. They range from ruthless killers to snobby aristocrats and they are pretty open about their desire to kill Haru. This was pretty fun to see, however you barely get to spend time with any of these characters. This mostly due to the fact Tokaku never interacts with them. This took away a lot of the fun this anime could of had because most of the time you don't get to spend time with the rest of the cast. This is also becomes a problem because each episode explores the backstory of one of the students of Class Black and their reasoning for wanting to kill Haru. It was really hard to sympathize because most of their motivation come out of nowhere. There was no subtlety when conveying why these characters were here and the anime just flat out tells you what the reason is without building it up. They could've built it up by adding subtle hints in the dialogue but since there was so little character interaction there was never a chance to do it. It was especially hard to care because after their attempt to kill Haru they are completely removed from the anime, so any emotional attachment I could've had with to them just disappears along with them. Some characters don't even get the luxury of getting a backstory either and are simply removed for no reason at all. I feel like all these problems exist because of the length of the anime. Its almost impossible for an anime to make me care about 13 characters in 12 episodes it frankly needs more time to really let things develop out naturally instead of forcing it down when it thought it was necessary to get the plot forward.\\n\\n\r\n     Akuma no Riddle was also really stupid at some points. There were plenty of Deus Ex Machina moments where Haru clearly should have died but there was something there to conveniently protect her. There was even one part where one of the girls could have killed her guaranteed but instead decided to play a game instead for no reason. Some of the characters motivations were absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical. There were also some lines that cracked me up just because they sounded like they were trying way to hard to be cool. All of this really took away from the seriousness of the plot and instead of becoming invested and curious to see what was coming next I ended up laughing at how cheesy it was.                                                                                                \\n\\n\r\n    The animation is also poor, especially the fight scenes. During fights, none of the combatants strikes had any impact to them and it looked like they were awkwardly swinging their weapons. Another problem is how a lot of the weapons were animated poorly in CG. It was such an eyesore to see them carry around their ugly CG weapons which contrasted poorly with the rest of the show. Outside of fights, the animation look average with nothing particularly catching my eye. The characters themselves also looked fine and I liked some of the character designs. The music wasn't the best either and I did not like some of the tracks used during fights. The different ED themes unique to each character was a nice touch at least. \\n\\n\r\n     Akuma no Riddle tries its hardest to seem mysterious, and frankly it fails to feel that way. Combined with the poor handling of its characters and it was struggle to get past this one. Its really a shame because I feel like this anime could work if it had more time to build up everything, but everything feels shallow and a waste of potential.  \\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading!\\n\\n\r\nMy Ratings \\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\r\nArt 4/10 \\n\r\nSound 4/10 \\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nOverall 3/10",

            "content": "Akuma no Riddle. Assassins assassinating other assassins in order to assassinate a victim that has an assassin protecting her.\r\n-Overall\r\nThe story of Akuma no Riddle is told episodically, with each episode focusing on one assassin to characterize. While this was fun in it's own way, it caused many problems. The premise isn't explained too much, and this way of storytelling caused the characters to be horribly underdeveloped. The art and sound were good, average really, but the characters, although interesting, end up laughably underdeveloped and not really likable at all. It's a shame, since Akuma no Riddle seems to focus on the action and characters, butthe characters fall short of their goal. The action is good, though. \\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 6.75\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 7.15, Akuma no Riddle is good.\\n\r\nHowever, the last episode is utterly horrible and breaks the characters. I would rate a 6 in story and 6 in character if I seriously took the last half of that episode into consideration. However, I feel it unfair to judge the show based on it's \"cooling down\" conclusion portion. But anyways, Akuma no Riddle gets an overall score of 7.15.\\n\r\nMore details down below:\\n\\n\r\n-Story\\n\r\nThe story of Akuma no Riddle is simple enough. While the premise isn't explained well at all, (What is this \"assassins network\" that Tokaku works for? How does it work? How are people recruited into this network?) I still enjoyed the episodes. Each episode a different assasssin has the spotlight alongside the main characters, who specialize in different weapons. While it can get monotonous, the action is well choreographed. Some episodes are \"whatever\", others are very good. (Episode 6 was probably my favorite episode. It was cool with all the Romeo and Juliet parallels) The plot isn't amazing, but it's nice in its simplicity. However, Episode 12 ruins the plot. Don't watch episode 12.\\n\\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\nThe art looks good. It seems to be \"shinier\" than contemporary works. Nothing special, though.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe voices and soundtracks are average. They're good, but not extraordinary. The opening theme is pretty cool. The ending theme is different each episode, sung by the voice actors of the characters that \"perished\" in that episode. That's pretty cool, but I didn't really listen to them anyways.\\n\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\nThere are many assassins in Akuma no Riddle with interesting enough backstories. However, because the anime is so short and each backstory gets on average 3-6 minutes, the characters end up being laughably underdeveloped and not really relatable. I mean, I can feel the anime trying to get me to feel sympathetic, but most of the time, I just laughed at how badly the story was delivered. Haru, the main character that all the assassins are targeting, is really dumb. She tries to make friends with the assassins... even though she knows they're trying to kill her...\\n\r\nTokaku is a badass with a good backstory, and the teacher's just... the best. In the end, I did respect and feel sympathetic towards some of the characters, but episode 12... destroys some of those feelings...\\n\r\nDon't watch episode 12.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime. The episodic story telling was fun enough, and some of the characters were cool. The action is enjoyable. But the 2nd half of episode 12 is bad. Don't watch that episode.",

            "content": "I went into this anime without any knowledge of it whatsoever. After seeing the first couple of episodes, I began to wonder: is this going to be really smart or really dumb? The answer, as usual, is none of the above.\r\nAkuma no Riddle starts off with a simple yet intriguing premise: there are 12 assassins in the Black class and one victim. The killers, of course, need to kill her, the target wants to survive. So, after hearing this, I thought the show was opting to be mystery: you can't trust anyone, everyone is suspicious and so on. This can be done and has beendone to great success but there is one obvious and serious problem here: unlike, say, in Another, you don't have many usual people trying to find one special person; instead, only one is normal. Therefore, there is no reason for the target to check anyone, thus every suspicious or ambiguous bit of dialogue immediately exposes the character as an assassin. Handling that for 12 episodes and still maintaining the intrigue doesn't seem to be possible, and the anime wisely takes a different turn. The target is revealed very early on to everyone; instead, the hunt has rules, which basically mean everyone makes their attempts in order, and the goal is to be the first to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nThe synopsis is a bit misleading, though: Tokaku develops feeling for Haru, sure, but not that gradually. To be honest, it comes out of nowhere, really; what surprised me is the fact that it is actually explored later on. The number of killers (12) isn't coincidental, it basically means each episode has its villain. There are deviations from this rule but it's more or less true. So, everyone gets a chance to shine, even though it means there isn't much of a coherent narrative. The only question is: is one episode always enough for the writer to make a character interesting and memorable? At first, it seems like the answer is no, first attackers are not very interesting: there are either no redeeming qualities whatsoever or they are as boring and banal as you can get. Their methods can't be called cunning, too.\\n\\n\r\nIt does improve, though, some characters are actually compelling and easy to identify with, their resolutions well-handled. Ironically, those who actually didn't want to kill Haru all that much turned out to be most interesting. Their episodes are mostly around the mid point of the series. After that, however, the focus is more on Tokaku, Haru and their relationship rather than anyone else, so the killers serve mostly as a means for character development. As a result, they aren't that memorable but allow the leads to shine; thanks to that, Haru doesn't come out as a complete damsel in distress, and Tokaku is affected by these experiences, which makes their personalities more interesting. Which is good, since in the beginning they are more (Haru) or less (Tokaku) two-dimensional. The ending changes this radically, although it is pretty strange and, I'm certain, didn't appeal to many. It's probably happy, all things considered, but strange and surprising. I liked it, unsure as I am of how plausible the events were in terms of established relationships.\\n\\n\r\nThe art really worked for me, it's rather unrealistic but has a sharp feeling to it, making the atmosphere seem surreal yet not exactly threatening. Overall, the show looks and feels pretty energetic, helped by the score often choosing electronic music, though also utilizing traditional instruments. I also liked the decision to make everyone except the students of the Black class black and white, it just looks awesome. The character designs are great, no one looks the same and practically no one looks generic, too. The voice acting was great, I especially liked Tokaku; the voice is unusual but works well with her.\\n\\n\r\nMost of my problems with the show I have already mentioned: while SOME characters I liked, some were boring or were only there to develop the leads; and one of the students is completely pointless and has little to no personality. The big revelation in the end (and of course there's the big answer to who's behind this and what do they want) is only good for the effect it has on Haru and Tokaku's relationship, it's not that interesting or surprising, for that matter, and ultimately comes out of left field and amounts to nothing. The anime, in my opinion, suffers from it only having 12 episodes; otherwise, character arcs could have been more explored, the ending built up better, so that it could make more of an impact. As it is, not everything is great with Akuma no Riddle but it is enjoyable, contains surprisingly little padding and fanservice and at least half the class consists of interesting characters. Overall, it's good. I just can't shrug off the feeling it could have been better.",
