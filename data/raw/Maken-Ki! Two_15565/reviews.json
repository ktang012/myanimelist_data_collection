Two...closest thing i can remember as plot in this season was theepisode we learned cup sizes of every character in the show using the alphabet(One of the Teachers was a K or Z cup )...One episode was about a girl( i don't even remember her boobs from first season) fantasizing about another girl for 24 minute,another episode was about a teddy bear(!)doing something to some boobs for another 24 minute...\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:4/10\\n\r\ni liked the opening but there was nothing special about other soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nART(Boobs):3/10\\n\r\nWell there are boobs,there are small boobs,big boobs,bigger boobs(mostly bigger boobs )...These boobs sometimes wear bras,sometimes they wear swimsuits,sometimes they are naked...The only development seems to be about boobs,they grow bigger after first season and they are so unrealistic that it just hurts to watch them and i can honestly say that as a normal man who loves boobs i didn't enjoy watching these boobs running around for 24 minute every episode,not even a little...(Well,maybe just a little)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:1/10\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an ecchi anime without any second genres like action,comedy,drama,romance watch it otherwise don't waste your time...even though thats the case i would advise you to go watch hentai instead(at least you wouldn't fall asleep while watching hentai)...\\n\\n\r\nEdit:Some Wizard guy made Fanservice compilations of this after BD releases so you can watch those instead of struggling 10 episodes of boring stuff...",

            "content": "First off, This is a 2nd season of sorts, What do i mean, Well I'll explain. As we all remember Maken-Ki Aired on 2011, So i bet you all are expecting the following:\r\n1. How is Takeru related to Kodama Himegami\r\n2. Who is Takerus father and his role in Maken-ki\r\n3. Relationship Inaho and Haruko towards takeru.\r\n4. Kamagari relations to Tenbi\r\n5. What happened to the US Pop star.\r\nWell, As you all know the 1st season was produced by AIC Studios, The 1st OVA as well, The 2nd OVA was AIC partnered with Xebec Studios. Xebec took command of the 2nd season, AIC was left out. \r\nThere aremany ways to approach this so, I'll do it this way. We all know a basic anime plot, 1 - leads to 2, Then to 3, but these events do not happen in next day correlations, As we know entire weeks or semesters are skipped but we don't care as long as the story continues right.\\n\\n\r\nWell, Maken-Ki 2, Though it is a continuation of sorts, but it is more of a Test season. This season has an entire perceptions change that literally goes 360. We viewers often get a bird view of plots, I know you're probably having a hard time following me, But please bear with me, Perception is not easily explained, So i'm doing my best. As i was saying, Normally we see plots and see characters develop from the outside in, Then we judge and make all sorts of suggestions\\n\\n\r\nIn real life, We all have our own little worlds inside our heads, There is no such thing as a human with organized thoughts, So our specie is pretty chaotic. However we organize those thoughts from time to time. Well, Maken-ki 2 explores CHAOS, It's a 10 Epsiode anime, and the viewer is to explore 10 episodes, with unseemly correlations, Imagine the Chaos of all the characters planted on film. Don't get me wrong, This season does posses an extraordinary amount of fan service, This however is a distraction of what you're truly seeing, In my view this season is too complex for your average anime viewer, So i can see why most people give it a crappy reception. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season, You the viewer takes a role on the anime, That's why most of you are confused. I'll give you three perspectives that this anime grants you as part of the anime it self, You're the background guy, The guy who seems intrigued by a group of teens and mishaps, I'm sure you guys have experienced this, You are walking somewhere then you come up to a noisy bunch, Now a lot of things can be happening to that group, but that's not what you see. \\n\\n\r\nNext up, Is the buddy stalker, You no longer witness the bird eye perception, You're no longer on top, You don't see anything coming, and I know that bugs you, Each episode features a little group, or a character and you only see that character and experience that characters logic, Now the character you're stalking will get away with what he/she wants, As a result you also see the consequences of that logic. You guys see unrelated fan service, What is really happening, It's showing you, how fantasies could play out and chaos that can emerge.\\n\\n\r\n3rd next is, You're the brain of the character. You see through the characters eyes, You take in the info how they take in the info. This is a great gamble that Xebec took as thought that this double-edge sword would have no repercussion, The viewers would either be distracted by the fan service or perceive the perspective that is being aired, But they forgot that this is the 2nd season of a romantic comedy, All the romance has dramastically reduced and this test has ate 10 episode space that was granted to a 2nd season of maken-ki, However this was also done to piss off the critics. \\n\\n\r\nThere were some critics that reviewed the first season and said the following \"Maken-Ki offers nothing more than boobs and women underwear\", Well this time around, They really offered that superficially, Kinda like, Well i hope you guys get this reference. \\n\\n\r\nTry to think why EMINEM has always been miss judged for and critic for on his lyrics, Then listen to this song \"Role Model\", That is what i mean, So the critics would actually realize what something with no plot is...!, Though it does, But they're miniplots, But not as a whole. Well I hope you guys understand me.",

            "content": "I watched the first Maken-ki and enjoyed it fairly well though I though there was a bit too much fanservice. The end of Maken-ki left me looking forward to season two for more of the storyline about the MC and the immediately surrounding supporting cast. Maken-ki two was a horrible let down.\r\nThere was absolutely NO continuation from the original Maken-ki. Previously developed character relations were lost. The excessive fanservice was doubled (in certain episodes). Despite my belief that there was too much fanservice, there was also censoring...horribly inconsistent censoring. If you were hoping to find out more about ANY of the characters from the original,I am sorry to say you won't find it here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10 -- Non-existent\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 -- I do prefer this type of artwork over others, but at times you can see where the artists got lazy and ignored quality. There are also times where extra \"chub\" is added to characters that wasn't previously there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 -- I don't find myself to be a good judge of openings and endings, but as for dialogue and sound FX, the volume levels were consistent so that constantly adjusting my volume throughout a single episode was not necessary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10 -- Such disappointment. All character development was lost. Only one episode had mildly interesting character interaction, but it was ruined towards the end and completely forgotten by the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 -- I HAVE seen worse, but I had to push myself to watch all 10 episodes so that I can rightfully claim to have seen all 10. I was not amused (except for that one episode mentioned above--short lived), in fact, I found myself pausing every episode at least once to do something else (very unlike me).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 -- While I did enjoy the artwork, this season of Maken-ki was even more of a waste than Full Metal Panic - Fumoffu. I will NOT be watching this again for any reason. (sent to recycle bin and deleted)",

            "content": "Maken-Ki is a strange case for me. I actually liked season two more than the first season. Before you look at me as if you were an Edvard Munch painting, allow me to explain what twisted logic made me see things this way.\r\nLet me ask something first, does anyone really care about the story of Maken-Ki that much? As other reviewers keep stating, the first season had some plot and developments, while this had little to none of it. However, does that mean the plot of season one was any good? Not really. It had a generic and inconsequential plot that amounted to very littleat the end, presented alongside intrusive fan-service that distracted from any potential immersion that could be had.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I appreciate in season two is that it\u2019s honest. Without a story to follow, the fan-service ceases to be the distraction, and becomes the focus. Rather than shove together two elements that don\u2019t mix, season two dedicated itself to shameless titillation alone.  No story could be deflated by the fan-service, and by extension no fan-service could feel intrusive, since there was nothing to intrude on. I think the first episode is the perfect example of fan-service actually playing a role in what\u2019s happening, where the key to solving a series of attacks lies in the pattern of the girls\u2019 breast sizes. In the history of ecchi this might be the first time I\u2019ve seen the perverted main character\u2019s interest in breasts come in handy, something that I felt made it more true to the premise.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that constant fan-service is only a short-term solution to keep fans interested. The lack of an overarching story, romance and a seductive tone to balance out the ridiculousness gives the audience little reason to return to the series in the long run. Thankfully I never thought Maken-Ki deserved a longer running show to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Maken-Ki! 2 is fast-food media in its most distilled form, doing a decent enough job of being balls-to-the-wall exploitation, with good fluid animation to make it a feast for the eyes. I can only recommend it to those that are looking to fulfill their most basic needs, which they could get much easier by just looking up some hentai.",

Because unlike this sequel, season 1 has a plot and a climax, the sequel was more on the fanservice, in fact everything for this sequel was all about the fanservice, and that's as good as it gets....BOINK!

Except it was censored.\r\nStory 1:\r\nI will some up the story of Maken-Ki! Jew.\r\nThere is no story to Maken-Ki! Two.\r\nArt 4:\r\nNo real difference here, just a toned version of Maken-Ki which seems like it had as much of a budget spent on it as Toei spends with One Piece. There is also the fact that it's censored. But don't worry, my fap hand is still busy with DxD.\r\nSound 3:\r\nThe only redeeming factor of this entire anime wasits opening, and even then I feel embarrassed to listen to it. Other than that I was too busy questioning the nip censoring to pay attention to the background music.\\n\r\nCharacter 1:\\n\r\nNo character development took place. Even if some did, it would probably be thrown into Xebecs void of a womb to make room for a season 3, which probably won't happen anyway because that is too busy stuck up Xebecs cesspool of an anus.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2:\\n\r\nBesides from the occasional banter, I literally just sat there asking when something is going to happen, and then it ends. Like the solar eclipse.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime wasn't even near the Tittilation of Highschool DxD thanks to its censoring, let alone the softcore porn levels of To Love Ru. Overall, disappointing to say the least. I may come back and stare at the pointless OVAs with there high octane bouncing breastaroos. But that's about it. Overall it gets a high quality 2 from me.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "So what can i say about maken-ki 2? Well let me put it in its simplefest description... Boobs.\r\nYes boobs, its a whole titty feast, an all you can see boobie galore. Most people watch shows for the story and plot but in this anime the 'plot' never seems to fail, it comes hitting you and all directions. I'm a boob man myself i love them! But even i draw the line in this, can you believe it? Too much boobs? What? Well yes just too much and their appearance never makes sense at all! Like there is no need to jiggle them in all directionwhen you're just standing there doing nothing! Also some of these titties make the girls look completely dispropotional it doesn't make sense at all! How the hell do they find the energy to lift their chest, run, sleep, etc! That's just sheer willpower right there, i swear of one of them girls fall their tatas would come down to earth and make an impact greater than the asteroid that wiped out the dinosuars all those million of years ago.\\n\\n\r\nOh and for those who love panty shots, don't worry just as season 1 did before there's plenty so don't get dissapointed, just the first episode alone hits you with 7! I repeat 7 panty shots in under 8 minutes of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime define the sub-genre fan service i'm honestly surprise that there isn't full nudity i think that's the biggest surprise there is! Anyways enough of titty talks let get down to business for those who actually care about the story and not the 'plot' but the plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nThe story as like an episode that doesn't feature boobs, was none existence. From capturing a pervet to clich\u00e9 memory lost (or in this case stole) to student/teacher taboo love. You name it, each episode was a short way of becoming a hentai that's the only story behind this anime, just a bunch of wacked-out antics every episode; no main villians, no true motive or purpose to gain basically this whole season is one major ova special is all. The fact that it even lasted 10 episodes is a feat on in itself, such a waste of money that could've went to a production of a much worthy anime. Also its been 2 seasons now and i'm still confuse about the whole maken and element power, why must you be so greedy have 1 power/weapon not 2 who the hell you think you are maken-ki?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nIts the only thing that is good, but its not like its that great anyways! Most animes improve their art style over the years/seasons, this one kept it pretty generic. However the girls just look completely disproportion and its a total eyesore.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nTrust me as far as the ost goes there is none that sticks to your head honestly, I know I won't be getting on youtube searching for the ost. The opening song is just as boring and plain as it get, it puts you to sleep before the show starts, they conteract this by zooming into haruko's boobs multiple times just to keep you awake, and as for the ending just the same just more titties is all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nNo developement what-so ever so that's out the window, the characters seem more bland then before! Takeru is not even the main focus yet he and haruko are the face of this series yet what was the point about them even being in this season? Trust me they were as boring as most recurring character that appear out of no where with no explanation yet dissapear into the light leaving no impact.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 3\\n\r\nHonestly it would've just made sense if they would've just made this into a hentai honestly, nothing about this anime entertained me at all. Honestly i suffered watching the first season readying a gun to my head, how in the world did i think this season would've been different, regardless i gave it a shot and honestly these will be the 2 days i'll never get back.. I'm dissapointed that I even gave this a try and actually thought it would be good oh boy... Trust me on this if you have to choose between watching you grandma's back or watching this for enjoyement! Well i got news there's a window right there so run away as fast as you can. (You have been warned).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.6 out of 10\\n\r\nI honestly don't know what else to say, but still if you guys want to give it a try cause you're drawn in to the 'plot' go right ahead, our experience may differ, as they say one man's trash is another person's treasure or something like that so who knows maybe you might enjoy, however i do recommend not to fap as those \"sexy\" scenes only last for like 20 seconds, but if you still find it fappable then wank away my little gupies.\\n",

Opening and ending songs were ok. The sounds of breasts bouncing was most noticeable. \r\nCharacter. Two words AKI NIJOU.

If you decide to watch it anyway then I recommend at least half a litre of vodka and the standards of a Geordie to enjoy this to its fullest.\r\ni need a longer review so let us analyse,\r\nStory, this is an anime which features the nipple, if it had a plot worth watching then it wouldnt need to show full on boobs or even ecchito be able to market itself. The \u201cplot\u201d may be voluptuous but the plot is not.\\n\\n\r\nArt, just like the first season, passable and with areoles with the equation A=(oversized L x oversized B) + a nipple like a Rolo sweet.\\n\\n\r\nSound, it\u2019s there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, generic harem cover all bases model.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 4/10 bearable if you pay zero attention.

            "content": "The second season of Maken-Ki.  Don't watch this until you've watched the first season, because it otherwise won't make any sense.  On the other hand, this is about the most generic \"magical combat school\" anime there is, so that's pretty much all you need to know ahead of time.\r\nJust be warned that this show is half action-oriented and half ecchi comedy.  If you're the type of person to be turned off by gratuitous panty shots, cleavage, and frontal nudity with obscenely large breasts, you should skip this one.\r\nStory: 5\r\nI'm not entirely sold on what they did this season.  The characters andsetting are already established, so they abandoned any pretense of having a seasonal story arc and went completely episodic this time around.  If these episodes were presented in random order and you had to guess the order, you would not be able to do it, except maybe you might identify the last episode correctly.  Maybe.  Personally, I like a lot of filler so I'm fine with it, but after the lack of resolution in the first season, I was kind of hoping to see a continuation of the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say.  If you watched the first season, you'll know what to expect.  I like the fact that Takeru no longer wears glasses.  He looked too nerdy in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nIf I have one complaint, it's the obsession with Haruko's breasts.  I get it; big boobs are kind of mandatory in shows like this, and I like them as much as the next guy.  But there is such a thing as too big.  In most of the scenes where they're exposed (and there are a lot of them), those udders are so huge that they're more grotesque than sexy.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on Aki-sensei's breasts.  Less screen time than Haruko's, but even more gargantuan.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints, but nothing extraordinary either.  I like the theme song for the first season slightly better.  The voice actors are all fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nThere's no real character development.  Different episodes focus on different characters.  The hero from the first season is no longer the focus; he's just one of the core group now.  You may or may not like that.\\n\\n\r\nThey got rid of a bunch of characters, specifically the villains and the \"Venus\" group from the first season.  Since I didn't really like either all that much, I'm not complaining.  Paring it down to just the main group gives the major characters more screen time, which is nice.  There aren't too many to keep track of.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like most about this show is that it's not threatening.  There are villains, but they're always dealt with by the end of the episode.  You can just sit back and watch an episode or two without worrying about what comes next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nA fun watch, if you're into action/ecchi shows.  There's nothing spectacular about it, but nothing wrong with it either.\\n",

            "content": "I enjoyed the first season of Maken Ki they set down a decent backstory, introduced all the main characters, and set up the second season for a successful continuation of the story.  Unfortunately the second season never advances the story at all, in fact nothing that happens in season 2 is in the manga at all. You remember the evil organization Hiragana that is trying to take over the school?   Yeah not mentioned at all during the second season.  How about VENUS the transfer students who in the manga have a huge battle? Not mentioned at all during Maken Ki 2.The majority of episodes have a lot of fan service yet, have little to no real advancement to the story overall.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10 Poor\\n\r\nAs I said the story is exceptionally weak so weak in fact that none of them happen in the manga at all.  This whole season is a long OVA.  Some of the episodes are fairly entertaining but they do nothing to advance a plot or the storyline at all. Each episode has it's own plot and add nothing to the series overall.  The episode plots are simple like trying to catch the person who is stealing girls underwear or stopping the guys who try and cause problems at the manga festival.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 Good\\n\r\nVibrant colors and fairly normalized style of animation.  There is nothing really exceptional here girls have ridiculously large breasts as per usual in this type of anime series.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nSound is good they used a new intro and credit song and use them for the entire series.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10 \\n\r\nNo real advancement in character development or their relationships like at all.  I mean usually we have some advancement in the harem love levels but nothing really ever happened in the series to  change the status of any of the girls.  Takeru still pretty much is torn between Haruko and Inaho.  There is more focus on secondary characters this season Chacha and some of the other girls get a lot more screen time than the main characters seem to.  Once again the main problem with character development in this season is the fact that none of it has anything to do with the actual story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nI mean if you enjoyed the first season and bothered watching the second you probably had some interest in the series.  For me I rate this as a 5/10 because it is completely unneeded filler storyline,however, the majority of episodes are entertaining at least.  I am extremely  disappointed in how the story was not advanced at all, but, I still enjoyed the season somewhat overall.  \\n\\n",

Compared to the season before, which was pretty minimal in story, the story in this nonexistent.\r\nThe comedy, random action and loads of nudity are still there from before.\r\nUnusual but funny occurrences, like the girls turning into cute, sexy kitties are one of the highlights.\r\nThe fan service is the best part of this series, so unless you came for that I don't thinkyou'll enjoy it. And assuming you're reading this, you've watched the first season and enjoyed it, or you didn't like the first season so this one wouldn't be good for you either.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime seems to be taking itself less seriously than before, parts where Takeru makes comments making fun of cliches happening and other things. \\n\r\nIt feels more like extra OVA's than an actual season.

Two...closest thing i can remember as plot in this season was theepisode we learned cup sizes of every character in the show using the alphabet(One of the Teachers was a K or Z cup )...One episode was about a girl( i don't even remember her boobs from first season) fantasizing about another girl for 24 minute,another episode was about a teddy bear(!)doing something to some boobs for another 24 minute...\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:4/10\\n\r\ni liked the opening but there was nothing special about other soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nART(Boobs):3/10\\n\r\nWell there are boobs,there are small boobs,big boobs,bigger boobs(mostly bigger boobs )...These boobs sometimes wear bras,sometimes they wear swimsuits,sometimes they are naked...The only development seems to be about boobs,they grow bigger after first season and they are so unrealistic that it just hurts to watch them and i can honestly say that as a normal man who loves boobs i didn't enjoy watching these boobs running around for 24 minute every episode,not even a little...(Well,maybe just a little)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:1/10\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an ecchi anime without any second genres like action,comedy,drama,romance watch it otherwise don't waste your time...even though thats the case i would advise you to go watch hentai instead(at least you wouldn't fall asleep while watching hentai)...\\n\\n\r\nEdit:Some Wizard guy made Fanservice compilations of this after BD releases so you can watch those instead of struggling 10 episodes of boring stuff...",

            "content": "First off, This is a 2nd season of sorts, What do i mean, Well I'll explain. As we all remember Maken-Ki Aired on 2011, So i bet you all are expecting the following:\r\n1. How is Takeru related to Kodama Himegami\r\n2. Who is Takerus father and his role in Maken-ki\r\n3. Relationship Inaho and Haruko towards takeru.\r\n4. Kamagari relations to Tenbi\r\n5. What happened to the US Pop star.\r\nWell, As you all know the 1st season was produced by AIC Studios, The 1st OVA as well, The 2nd OVA was AIC partnered with Xebec Studios. Xebec took command of the 2nd season, AIC was left out. \r\nThere aremany ways to approach this so, I'll do it this way. We all know a basic anime plot, 1 - leads to 2, Then to 3, but these events do not happen in next day correlations, As we know entire weeks or semesters are skipped but we don't care as long as the story continues right.\\n\\n\r\nWell, Maken-Ki 2, Though it is a continuation of sorts, but it is more of a Test season. This season has an entire perceptions change that literally goes 360. We viewers often get a bird view of plots, I know you're probably having a hard time following me, But please bear with me, Perception is not easily explained, So i'm doing my best. As i was saying, Normally we see plots and see characters develop from the outside in, Then we judge and make all sorts of suggestions\\n\\n\r\nIn real life, We all have our own little worlds inside our heads, There is no such thing as a human with organized thoughts, So our specie is pretty chaotic. However we organize those thoughts from time to time. Well, Maken-ki 2 explores CHAOS, It's a 10 Epsiode anime, and the viewer is to explore 10 episodes, with unseemly correlations, Imagine the Chaos of all the characters planted on film. Don't get me wrong, This season does posses an extraordinary amount of fan service, This however is a distraction of what you're truly seeing, In my view this season is too complex for your average anime viewer, So i can see why most people give it a crappy reception. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season, You the viewer takes a role on the anime, That's why most of you are confused. I'll give you three perspectives that this anime grants you as part of the anime it self, You're the background guy, The guy who seems intrigued by a group of teens and mishaps, I'm sure you guys have experienced this, You are walking somewhere then you come up to a noisy bunch, Now a lot of things can be happening to that group, but that's not what you see. \\n\\n\r\nNext up, Is the buddy stalker, You no longer witness the bird eye perception, You're no longer on top, You don't see anything coming, and I know that bugs you, Each episode features a little group, or a character and you only see that character and experience that characters logic, Now the character you're stalking will get away with what he/she wants, As a result you also see the consequences of that logic. You guys see unrelated fan service, What is really happening, It's showing you, how fantasies could play out and chaos that can emerge.\\n\\n\r\n3rd next is, You're the brain of the character. You see through the characters eyes, You take in the info how they take in the info. This is a great gamble that Xebec took as thought that this double-edge sword would have no repercussion, The viewers would either be distracted by the fan service or perceive the perspective that is being aired, But they forgot that this is the 2nd season of a romantic comedy, All the romance has dramastically reduced and this test has ate 10 episode space that was granted to a 2nd season of maken-ki, However this was also done to piss off the critics. \\n\\n\r\nThere were some critics that reviewed the first season and said the following \"Maken-Ki offers nothing more than boobs and women underwear\", Well this time around, They really offered that superficially, Kinda like, Well i hope you guys get this reference. \\n\\n\r\nTry to think why EMINEM has always been miss judged for and critic for on his lyrics, Then listen to this song \"Role Model\", That is what i mean, So the critics would actually realize what something with no plot is...!, Though it does, But they're miniplots, But not as a whole. Well I hope you guys understand me.",

            "content": "I watched the first Maken-ki and enjoyed it fairly well though I though there was a bit too much fanservice. The end of Maken-ki left me looking forward to season two for more of the storyline about the MC and the immediately surrounding supporting cast. Maken-ki two was a horrible let down.\r\nThere was absolutely NO continuation from the original Maken-ki. Previously developed character relations were lost. The excessive fanservice was doubled (in certain episodes). Despite my belief that there was too much fanservice, there was also censoring...horribly inconsistent censoring. If you were hoping to find out more about ANY of the characters from the original,I am sorry to say you won't find it here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10 -- Non-existent\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 -- I do prefer this type of artwork over others, but at times you can see where the artists got lazy and ignored quality. There are also times where extra \"chub\" is added to characters that wasn't previously there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 -- I don't find myself to be a good judge of openings and endings, but as for dialogue and sound FX, the volume levels were consistent so that constantly adjusting my volume throughout a single episode was not necessary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10 -- Such disappointment. All character development was lost. Only one episode had mildly interesting character interaction, but it was ruined towards the end and completely forgotten by the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 -- I HAVE seen worse, but I had to push myself to watch all 10 episodes so that I can rightfully claim to have seen all 10. I was not amused (except for that one episode mentioned above--short lived), in fact, I found myself pausing every episode at least once to do something else (very unlike me).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 -- While I did enjoy the artwork, this season of Maken-ki was even more of a waste than Full Metal Panic - Fumoffu. I will NOT be watching this again for any reason. (sent to recycle bin and deleted)",

            "content": "Maken-Ki is a strange case for me. I actually liked season two more than the first season. Before you look at me as if you were an Edvard Munch painting, allow me to explain what twisted logic made me see things this way.\r\nLet me ask something first, does anyone really care about the story of Maken-Ki that much? As other reviewers keep stating, the first season had some plot and developments, while this had little to none of it. However, does that mean the plot of season one was any good? Not really. It had a generic and inconsequential plot that amounted to very littleat the end, presented alongside intrusive fan-service that distracted from any potential immersion that could be had.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I appreciate in season two is that it\u2019s honest. Without a story to follow, the fan-service ceases to be the distraction, and becomes the focus. Rather than shove together two elements that don\u2019t mix, season two dedicated itself to shameless titillation alone.  No story could be deflated by the fan-service, and by extension no fan-service could feel intrusive, since there was nothing to intrude on. I think the first episode is the perfect example of fan-service actually playing a role in what\u2019s happening, where the key to solving a series of attacks lies in the pattern of the girls\u2019 breast sizes. In the history of ecchi this might be the first time I\u2019ve seen the perverted main character\u2019s interest in breasts come in handy, something that I felt made it more true to the premise.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that constant fan-service is only a short-term solution to keep fans interested. The lack of an overarching story, romance and a seductive tone to balance out the ridiculousness gives the audience little reason to return to the series in the long run. Thankfully I never thought Maken-Ki deserved a longer running show to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Maken-Ki! 2 is fast-food media in its most distilled form, doing a decent enough job of being balls-to-the-wall exploitation, with good fluid animation to make it a feast for the eyes. I can only recommend it to those that are looking to fulfill their most basic needs, which they could get much easier by just looking up some hentai.",

            "content": "This Holocaust of a second season brings us an abundance of wasted time. While no plot actually took place, \"plot\" was very prominent. Not much of a surprise really. Except it was censored.\r\nStory 1:\r\nI will some up the story of Maken-Ki! Jew.\r\nThere is no story to Maken-Ki! Two.\r\nArt 4:\r\nNo real difference here, just a toned version of Maken-Ki which seems like it had as much of a budget spent on it as Toei spends with One Piece. There is also the fact that it's censored. But don't worry, my fap hand is still busy with DxD.\r\nSound 3:\r\nThe only redeeming factor of this entire anime wasits opening, and even then I feel embarrassed to listen to it. Other than that I was too busy questioning the nip censoring to pay attention to the background music.\\n\r\nCharacter 1:\\n\r\nNo character development took place. Even if some did, it would probably be thrown into Xebecs void of a womb to make room for a season 3, which probably won't happen anyway because that is too busy stuck up Xebecs cesspool of an anus.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2:\\n\r\nBesides from the occasional banter, I literally just sat there asking when something is going to happen, and then it ends. Like the solar eclipse.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime wasn't even near the Tittilation of Highschool DxD thanks to its censoring, let alone the softcore porn levels of To Love Ru. Overall, disappointing to say the least. I may come back and stare at the pointless OVAs with there high octane bouncing breastaroos. But that's about it. Overall it gets a high quality 2 from me.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "So what can i say about maken-ki 2? Well let me put it in its simplefest description... Boobs.\r\nYes boobs, its a whole titty feast, an all you can see boobie galore. Most people watch shows for the story and plot but in this anime the 'plot' never seems to fail, it comes hitting you and all directions. I'm a boob man myself i love them! But even i draw the line in this, can you believe it? Too much boobs? What? Well yes just too much and their appearance never makes sense at all! Like there is no need to jiggle them in all directionwhen you're just standing there doing nothing! Also some of these titties make the girls look completely dispropotional it doesn't make sense at all! How the hell do they find the energy to lift their chest, run, sleep, etc! That's just sheer willpower right there, i swear of one of them girls fall their tatas would come down to earth and make an impact greater than the asteroid that wiped out the dinosuars all those million of years ago.\\n\\n\r\nOh and for those who love panty shots, don't worry just as season 1 did before there's plenty so don't get dissapointed, just the first episode alone hits you with 7! I repeat 7 panty shots in under 8 minutes of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime define the sub-genre fan service i'm honestly surprise that there isn't full nudity i think that's the biggest surprise there is! Anyways enough of titty talks let get down to business for those who actually care about the story and not the 'plot' but the plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nThe story as like an episode that doesn't feature boobs, was none existence. From capturing a pervet to clich\u00e9 memory lost (or in this case stole) to student/teacher taboo love. You name it, each episode was a short way of becoming a hentai that's the only story behind this anime, just a bunch of wacked-out antics every episode; no main villians, no true motive or purpose to gain basically this whole season is one major ova special is all. The fact that it even lasted 10 episodes is a feat on in itself, such a waste of money that could've went to a production of a much worthy anime. Also its been 2 seasons now and i'm still confuse about the whole maken and element power, why must you be so greedy have 1 power/weapon not 2 who the hell you think you are maken-ki?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nIts the only thing that is good, but its not like its that great anyways! Most animes improve their art style over the years/seasons, this one kept it pretty generic. However the girls just look completely disproportion and its a total eyesore.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nTrust me as far as the ost goes there is none that sticks to your head honestly, I know I won't be getting on youtube searching for the ost. The opening song is just as boring and plain as it get, it puts you to sleep before the show starts, they conteract this by zooming into haruko's boobs multiple times just to keep you awake, and as for the ending just the same just more titties is all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nNo developement what-so ever so that's out the window, the characters seem more bland then before! Takeru is not even the main focus yet he and haruko are the face of this series yet what was the point about them even being in this season? Trust me they were as boring as most recurring character that appear out of no where with no explanation yet dissapear into the light leaving no impact.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 3\\n\r\nHonestly it would've just made sense if they would've just made this into a hentai honestly, nothing about this anime entertained me at all. Honestly i suffered watching the first season readying a gun to my head, how in the world did i think this season would've been different, regardless i gave it a shot and honestly these will be the 2 days i'll never get back.. I'm dissapointed that I even gave this a try and actually thought it would be good oh boy... Trust me on this if you have to choose between watching you grandma's back or watching this for enjoyement! Well i got news there's a window right there so run away as fast as you can. (You have been warned).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.6 out of 10\\n\r\nI honestly don't know what else to say, but still if you guys want to give it a try cause you're drawn in to the 'plot' go right ahead, our experience may differ, as they say one man's trash is another person's treasure or something like that so who knows maybe you might enjoy, however i do recommend not to fap as those \"sexy\" scenes only last for like 20 seconds, but if you still find it fappable then wank away my little gupies.\\n",

Opening and ending songs were ok. The sounds of breasts bouncing was most noticeable. \r\nCharacter. Two words AKI NIJOU.

If you wannna watch hentai that stops at the tits and blue balls every relationship then this is the trash for you. If you decide to watch it anyway then I recommend at least half a litre of vodka and the standards of a Geordie to enjoy this to its fullest.\r\ni need a longer review so let us analyse,\r\nStory, this is an anime which features the nipple, if it had a plot worth watching then it wouldnt need to show full on boobs or even ecchito be able to market itself. The \u201cplot\u201d may be voluptuous but the plot is not.\\n\\n\r\nArt, just like the first season, passable and with areoles with the equation A=(oversized L x oversized B) + a nipple like a Rolo sweet.\\n\\n\r\nSound, it\u2019s there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, generic harem cover all bases model.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 4/10 bearable if you pay zero attention. Add alcohol and this is the shit,dayum this is hilarrious, just shoot every time you get the \u201coh I happened to see you half nude because you forgot the towel and had a shower, you had amnesia and tried to fuck me, you left the bathroom door unlocked, you were changing and didnt bother replying, I climbed a ladder to peek in a 3rd story window, etc. That kind of misunderstanding... ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like trashy anime or have enough alcohol to knock out an elephant 10/10, if not then you were tricked by the somewhat possibility of a story hidden deep within season 1 and are fucked.\\n",

            "content": "The second season of Maken-Ki.  Don't watch this until you've watched the first season, because it otherwise won't make any sense.  On the other hand, this is about the most generic \"magical combat school\" anime there is, so that's pretty much all you need to know ahead of time.\r\nJust be warned that this show is half action-oriented and half ecchi comedy.  If you're the type of person to be turned off by gratuitous panty shots, cleavage, and frontal nudity with obscenely large breasts, you should skip this one.\r\nStory: 5\r\nI'm not entirely sold on what they did this season.  The characters andsetting are already established, so they abandoned any pretense of having a seasonal story arc and went completely episodic this time around.  If these episodes were presented in random order and you had to guess the order, you would not be able to do it, except maybe you might identify the last episode correctly.  Maybe.  Personally, I like a lot of filler so I'm fine with it, but after the lack of resolution in the first season, I was kind of hoping to see a continuation of the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say.  If you watched the first season, you'll know what to expect.  I like the fact that Takeru no longer wears glasses.  He looked too nerdy in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nIf I have one complaint, it's the obsession with Haruko's breasts.  I get it; big boobs are kind of mandatory in shows like this, and I like them as much as the next guy.  But there is such a thing as too big.  In most of the scenes where they're exposed (and there are a lot of them), those udders are so huge that they're more grotesque than sexy.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on Aki-sensei's breasts.  Less screen time than Haruko's, but even more gargantuan.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints, but nothing extraordinary either.  I like the theme song for the first season slightly better.  The voice actors are all fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nThere's no real character development.  Different episodes focus on different characters.  The hero from the first season is no longer the focus; he's just one of the core group now.  You may or may not like that.\\n\\n\r\nThey got rid of a bunch of characters, specifically the villains and the \"Venus\" group from the first season.  Since I didn't really like either all that much, I'm not complaining.  Paring it down to just the main group gives the major characters more screen time, which is nice.  There aren't too many to keep track of.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like most about this show is that it's not threatening.  There are villains, but they're always dealt with by the end of the episode.  You can just sit back and watch an episode or two without worrying about what comes next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nA fun watch, if you're into action/ecchi shows.  There's nothing spectacular about it, but nothing wrong with it either.\\n",

            "content": "I enjoyed the first season of Maken Ki they set down a decent backstory, introduced all the main characters, and set up the second season for a successful continuation of the story.  Unfortunately the second season never advances the story at all, in fact nothing that happens in season 2 is in the manga at all. You remember the evil organization Hiragana that is trying to take over the school?   Yeah not mentioned at all during the second season.  How about VENUS the transfer students who in the manga have a huge battle? Not mentioned at all during Maken Ki 2.The majority of episodes have a lot of fan service yet, have little to no real advancement to the story overall.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10 Poor\\n\r\nAs I said the story is exceptionally weak so weak in fact that none of them happen in the manga at all.  This whole season is a long OVA.  Some of the episodes are fairly entertaining but they do nothing to advance a plot or the storyline at all. Each episode has it's own plot and add nothing to the series overall.  The episode plots are simple like trying to catch the person who is stealing girls underwear or stopping the guys who try and cause problems at the manga festival.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 Good\\n\r\nVibrant colors and fairly normalized style of animation.  There is nothing really exceptional here girls have ridiculously large breasts as per usual in this type of anime series.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nSound is good they used a new intro and credit song and use them for the entire series.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10 \\n\r\nNo real advancement in character development or their relationships like at all.  I mean usually we have some advancement in the harem love levels but nothing really ever happened in the series to  change the status of any of the girls.  Takeru still pretty much is torn between Haruko and Inaho.  There is more focus on secondary characters this season Chacha and some of the other girls get a lot more screen time than the main characters seem to.  Once again the main problem with character development in this season is the fact that none of it has anything to do with the actual story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nI mean if you enjoyed the first season and bothered watching the second you probably had some interest in the series.  For me I rate this as a 5/10 because it is completely unneeded filler storyline,however, the majority of episodes are entertaining at least.  I am extremely  disappointed in how the story was not advanced at all, but, I still enjoyed the season somewhat overall.  \\n\\n",

Compared to the season before, which was pretty minimal in story, the story in this nonexistent.\r\nThe comedy, random action and loads of nudity are still there from before.\r\nUnusual but funny occurrences, like the girls turning into cute, sexy kitties are one of the highlights.\r\nThe fan service is the best part of this series, so unless you came for that I don't thinkyou'll enjoy it. And assuming you're reading this, you've watched the first season and enjoyed it, or you didn't like the first season so this one wouldn't be good for you either.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime seems to be taking itself less seriously than before, parts where Takeru makes comments making fun of cliches happening and other things. \\n\r\nIt feels more like extra OVA's than an actual season.

I feel like the makers of Maken Ki just got lazy in season 2 and gave us bullshit characters and a bullshit story instead of giving us a better story with the characters who were developed in season 1. \r\n     I would've given it a 1 for a score, but I didn't because there were some moments that \r\n ( surprisingly )managed to make me laugh.\r\n   So here's the last question:would I recommend this anime? Surprisingly, yes. I actually watched a video explaining why we should watch bad anime. I think you should watch this anime ( even though it's filled with boobs ) because it could help you decide what kind of anime you like to watch and what kind you dislike.\\n\\n\r\n    Here's the link to the video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DwcO7otEMuc\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther scores:\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n",
