            "content": "On the surface, D. Gray-Man sounds like just another shonen anime with an organization of good guys with special weapons fighting evil monsters. Yeah, that's the base of it, but DGM turns into something more, something deeper than many other shonen anime series. In fact, I feel that it sneaks around seinen territory.\r\nWhile the setting is standard shonen all the way, you'll find yourself surprised when watching this show. It starts off a bit slow, with many fights, small arcs (~1-4 episodes) and nothing special to it. However, it quickly picks up, and some way into season 2 or 3, DGM starts to show itsqualities. The story soon blends in action, emotions and last but not least, realistic power-ups. The story is overall more deep and serious than most shonen anime, and builds up and only gets better towards the end, where it meets it demise with an unfortunate canceling, which, together with its slow start, may ruin the experience of the show for many.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are without a doubt the strongest point of DGM. I mentioned earlier that DGM is sneaking about in seinen territory, and the reason for this is the characters. They don't think &quot;You bastard! I need to suddenly get stronger so I can defeat you&quot; and get stronger and defeat the bad guys. The characters here aren't all about brawling against the evil guys. They have emotions. Emotions which they have to face. And that's what makes it into a semi-seinen series; it's a bit more character-driven and not so much plot-driven. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of DGM is also astounding. There's a lot of detail put into the environments, and character designs are great too. Special effects are really great, and the same can be said about lighting effects. When you consider that DGM is a bit dark and serious, the coloring is really great too; it's just as dark as it needs to be to fit in with the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is definitely the weakest point of DGM. The background music isn't especially memorable, and not really great. I hope they decide to get a new soundtrack soon so I can get something better. Also, using the same stuff for 100 episodes is a lot. OP and ED themes are okay though, and I like the more heavy style of the OP themes - it fits with the tone of the show. Voice acting and sound effects are great though. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thing which I should mention is that the fillers in DGM are actually good. &quot;What fillers?&quot; you may ask if you've watched the show. To be honest, I asked the same question when I first heard that there was a lot of filler in the show. The thought never even came close to my mind. So that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I feel that DGM mixes shonen and seinen into something special and unique. It may not appeal to all shonen fans, but those of you who like more serious action anime will enjoy DGM even more.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)\\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest here. I don't usually go for long running shounens. Since my younger days of pokemon, digimon and yu-gi-oh (back before I'd even heard the term anime and just thought of them as cartoons), the longest anime series I've watched was 50 episodes, and that was only one show and took me forever to finish. High episode counts put me off. I like my stories to have an end. I like my battles not to drag on for five episodes. I like my plot arcs to end before I've had enough of them. When my characters have to get stronger, I like atraining montage with the Rocky theme playing, not five episodes of them agonising over what it is that's holding them back, only for them to then repeat that process after the current villain is defeated and the next villain has presented itself. So why do I love D. Gray-Man? Because for a 103 episode shounen, it keeps it's use of the above shounen tropes to a minimum, and on the occaisions when it does use them, the other elements of the show keep the formula fresh.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the plot, which is far darker than your average shounen. From the very first episode, we are shown a merciless enemy that will exploit any weakness, who's main weapon, the Akuma (demons) uses the souls of the dead. These are not zombies, just mindless corpses. These are weapons which pull a soul back from heaven and torture it as their power source. A lot of shounens gloss over the concept of death, bad guys are captured alive or shown the error of their ways, people fall unconscious but can be healed, etc. In D. Gray-man, death is very real, and resting in peace is only for the fortunate ones who's loved ones are strong enough not to be tempted to call them back.\\n\\n\r\nAgainst the Akuma and their creator, the Millennium Earl, are the Exorcists of the Dark Order. Exorcists are those chosen by God to use 'innocence', a mysterious substance which can be used to form weapons capable of destroying the Akuma. The series follows Allen Walker, a new recruit with the ability to see the souls trapped within the Akuma. The plot itself begins slowly, with short arcs in which Allen and his comrades are dispatched to investigate mysterious phenomena which are thought to be caused by innocence fragments. After a few of these arcs, the Noah Clan, allies of the Millennium Earl, begin to be introduced and the focus turns to the war between him and the Dark Order.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is, for the most part, very well paced. Early arcs are kept short, about 4 episodes or so long, with a single 'filler' episode in between. Don't be put off when I say filler. While the plot could easily go without these episodes, I found them all to be entertaining (if somewhat silly at times) and they served well as comic relief within an otherwise serious plot. And if you don't enjoy them, they do become fewer and further between as the war intensifies and plot arcs become longer. With one exception, none of these longer plot arcs drag on to the point that the viewer just wants them to get on with it. In the one arc in which this does occur, it is saved in part by having another plot running at the same time. Battles often do last across multiple episodes, but in most of these, the battle changes and develops over those episodes, unlike drawn out battles in other shounen which just get repetitive, where the middle episodes can often just be skipped entirely.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also boasts one of the best sets of characters of any anime I have seen. Each hero is flawed, and the Earl and Noah are far more fleshed out (in more ways than one in the Earl's case) than most villains. It says a lot about the quality of a series' characters when the villains mourning a dead friend can evoke sympathy. They also managed to inspire doubt as to whether the exorcists are in fact the good guys, thanks to the show's religious imagery.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the heroes, each has their own motive, each of which is more complex than the standard shounen motives of just saving the world or becoming the strongest and the like. Allen wants to save the souls of the Akuma, to the point where he can even show disregard for his own or others' lives at times. Lenalee, the series' main female character, fights for the sake of her friends and brother, and her past reveals that she may not support the Dark Order's cause even as she fights for them. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal favourite characters were Lavi and Bookman. These two are a master (Bookman) and apprentice (Lavi) of a clan of historians who became exorcists to be close to history as it occurred so that it could be recorded, and while they do fight, they try to minimise how much they interfere. Lavi's conflict between his duty as a Bookman and as an Exorcist, the loyalty he developed for his friends despite Bookman's orders to become close to no one, and his doubts as to whether the cheerful, friendly, fun guy is the real him or a mask that he should remove was probably my favourite aspect of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, here I am singing the series' praises, yet it got a 9, not a 10. Why? Well, in complete contrast to what I said at the beginning, because it ended. A lot wasn't able to be explained before the series was cancelled. The last ten episodes or so suffered from trying to rush one of the story arcs after having taken their time over previous ones. The battle in the last three episodes was amazing, but it also wasn't the final battle that I wanted to see. There is a lot of potential for a sequel, including a development at the end that virtually screamed \"to be continued\". I do sincerely hope that there will be a sequel. But if there isn't, the show ended in the best possible place it could. A clear cut ending is often unrealistic, and endings in which the heroes won but the villain is there in the shadows, not as dead as they thought, muttering \"This isn't over\" gets old quickly. Maybe the abiguity was for the best. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the show is well worth watching, even if you don't usually commit to long running shounen. Just don't go in expecting to not have any questions at the end.",

            "content": "This is my review of the episodes which I have seen which is up through 58.\r\n     Im not going to dull people with a summary of the story its on anidb and other such websites and they do a better job than I would. However if you want a short summarized version of what Im going to say, here it is: Want a series that start out as typical shounen series that transform into a powerful epic that twists and turns in unexpected ways? Then I would recommend D.Grey-man. \r\n     The story starts off pretty good, buttakes some time before it kicks into overdrive so be prepared. I found myself liking the series, but for the first 40 episodes or so it felt pretty mediocre after that point the story starts to flesh out and go in some pretty unexpected directions.  I felt probably one of the stronger points of the story was how episodes which appeared like fillers at first turned out to introduce important characters which return again and play very important roles in terms of the story. At heart though D.Grey-man is still a shounen so dont watch it if you absolutely hate these types of series, but it has a different taste than other series such as Naruto or One Piece.\\n\\n\r\n     The Animation is top notch and it improves as the series progresses. Characters facial expressions are superb especially when considering the huge cast of both good and bad guys. I love the unique look that the bad guys bring to this anime: evil, yet at the same time they are appealing in their own way. The same is also true of the good guys cool but, at times, ridiculous. Any filler episode had at least average animated action scenes. However whenever the series gets to the story pertinent battles the action scenes are stepped up a notch.\\n\\n\r\n     The sound is by far the most troublesome area. All the intro or ending songs are excellent and fit the series very well. However during the actual episode the music is far less memorable. Not that it is absent or that it is per say bad, but there was never a moment where I really noticed it particularly like I have in other series.  The sound effects themselves are alright, but there are several characters with really annoying sound effects attached to them when they use their abilities and that is by far my biggest complaint worth noting.\\n\\n\r\n     The characters are by far D.Grey-mans strongest point. They have an absolutely lovable cast. From the main characters to the side characters there hasnt been a single one I found annoying or wishing they would go away. Quite the opposite I found many times hoping these characters would make a return and too my surprise many did.  The series takes its time to flesh out as much as possible all the characters, of course with the emphasis being on the side characters, but I felt satisfied with all of the side characters back stories as well. It really doesnt get much better than the characters, in terms of growth and depth, than in this series.\\n\\n\r\n     The Enjoyment of this series is really watching the characters grow. This in my opinion is where D.Grey-man strongly resembles most other shounen series, but not in a bad way seeing as I love these types of series. The story is there in the back of your mind, but in the usually the focus is on the characters. I have found that as the series has progressed I began enjoying it more and more much like an acquired taste.\\n\\n\r\n     Overall  D.Grey-man does start out like a standard shounen. However after the first 40 episodes I found it getting increasingly more fun to sit and watch. And while its hard to say what the future will bring the series is entering what I would consider the second story arch and it has gotten really good, much in the same way that Bleach or Naruto did. So basically if you like shounen then you will dig this series, but if you typically dont go for those type of series I would still recommend giving D.Grey-man a try because it does vary from your typical series enough to make it a unique experience.\\n",

            "content": "When i originally wrote this review (after watching the 72 episodes that had aired at that time), D.Grayman was #42 in \"Popularity\" on myanimelist.net and a very Popular Manga (#10). The show had a score of 7.8..BUT You might have noticed that the score and popularity you now see is much higher reason being the anime starts off fairly slowly and takes a while to kick into gear and progress the plot. But once its does you just might be a fan...\r\nThe Story has a very original plot. When I started this anime I immediately liked the concept of chosen humans + \"innocence\" = akuma(demon) butt-kicking \"Exorcists\"!  I knew nothing about it but i decided to watch it based on its good animation and I was not disappointed at all. The characters and their uniforms/weapons all look outstanding! \\n\\n\r\nI found that all of the op. and end. songs are excellent songs that you wouldnt mind listening to each episode. Normally I would skip songs but I listened to all of D.Gray-man's because they really do suit the anime and sound good! Background music could be a bit better tho... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter is one of the best aspects of the anime. Each and every character is Amazing! Each main character is lovable, unique, strong, nice-looking and they all have mysterious pasts and secrets. I have found fan clubs for even the evil characters. You wont find out about the evil characters until late in the anime but they are surprisingly loved as well. There might be a few characters you dont like but those would likely be side characters..all the main characters are great! The development of the ALL the characters through out the series always amazed me...\\n\\n\r\nTry not to give up on this anime too early...after watching about 30 episodes I started to get a little bored... But since I loved the characters and was curious about the plot I decided to go read the manga. I was instantly hooked and it became a favorite! The point is that at the start of the anime there are a lot of filler-type episodes (especially before episode 38). Dont get me wrong, these are not the typical useless filler episodes. All most all these episodes are either action-packed or show some character development.\\n\r\nEven in the most serious of times there are humorous moments and great weapons/abilities/battles..\\n\\n\r\nD.Gray-man finished with 103 episodes and not many fillers..In my opinion do not be disappointed with the end of the anime. There are many amazing battles that lead up to the climatic end but a lot of things are left unexplained. I don't think its confirmed but I am expecting a second season in the future after a lot more manga chapters are released (when the anime ended, it was very close to manga and i guess they decided not to go into fillers...)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is excellent [9-10] and covers almost every genre; \\n\r\nA worthy watch! It can be compared with the popular shounen anime Naruto and Bleach but I found more interest in D.Gray-man which is a bit more serious and in depth.  (And a lot less out-stretched if you know what I mean...)\\n",

            "content": "To be fair, I can understand why D. Grayman has a huge following.  You've got an interesting premise, lots of good characters, and excellent animation by BONES.  And cool weapons and uniforms.  And Allen's REALLY cute.  The only problem is the snail-paced plot development.  And that's gonna be a lot to endure for a 100+ episode series.\r\nIt starts out interesting enough.  We meet our hero (Allen), and get introduced into the world of exorcists who fight akuma (monster/human/machine hybrids).  We learn what the goal is (save the world--specifically to save the crystal substance called \"innocence\" from the evilMillennium Earl).  But by the 15th episode or so, the episodes have begun to show a pattern.  Each episode falls into one of three categories:\\n\\n\r\n1: Somebody finds a new innocence accommodator\\n\r\n2: Allen goes on a trip/mission\\n\r\n3: Someone besides Allen goes on a trip/mission\\n\\n\r\nEach trip/mission (most take up just one episode) takes place in some town that holds a tragic story.  Since each of these towns has a new cast of townsfolk, we meet a bewildering number of characters very quickly, and it's a bit taxing to constantly be introduced to new characters.  The exorcist who is the hero of the episode has to solve the townsfolks' problem.  Practically none of these trip/mission episodes contribute anything to the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd each episode has a battle with akuma.  Every episode.  Did you hear me?  EVERY DANG EPISODE.  Okay, maybe one or two don't.  But it gets routine pretty quickly.  If we're lucky, we see Allen's weapon advance to a new level!  I've gotten to where I skip over the battles.  It gets to be where if you've seen one akuma battle, you've seen them all. \\n\\n\r\nNow and then we get an itsy bitsy tidbit that's actually related to the plot.  But they're so few an far between that when they do come I don't notice right away because I'm half-asleep.  And as far as I've seen, I'm not really sure what the plot is anymore.  There just isn't much \"meat.\"  The series has settled into a pattern of \"go to new town; meet akuma; fight akuma: repeat.\"  I suppose that's fine if you're watching it one episode per week, like when it was originally aired.  That would be easier to handle.  You'd get your akuma battle-of-the-week.  But watching it off DVD when you'd like to see 3-6 episodes at a time, it gets pretty tedious.\\n\\n\r\nI'm wondering whether I should bother trying to finish this series.  I've seen over 40 episodes so far.  I like an anime/manga/book to have an underlying story or mystery, but not take forever to provide any clues about it.  If you don't care so much about story, and are happy with good animation, characters, and your regular battle of good vs. evil, you'll probably be fine with it.",

            "content": "Story - 5\r\nThe story was bad to say the least. It was badly paced as  most of the time your stuck to seeing something between shonen- anime glued together with a lot of dramatism. And that means that action fight's are predictable and almost seem pointless and the Allen or Lenalle or other guys from the Order cry after almost every fight about something.  The story had so much plot-holes that there were more holes then the plot. Also on the end all you get is about the same were this anime started. The last episode everyone is still fighting akuma's and morethen 100 episodes passed away already.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nIt was very good. Nowhere in this anime you can see bad animation and it was 103 episodes long. That's a lot of episodes! Off course it wasn't anything ground braking and akuma's could of been made more creepier.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nIt was awesome. All the time I liked the sound in the anime soundtracks. Specially when Allen played piano. Only reason I didn't give it 10 was, because  few openings could of been a bit more better. Almost all of the openings were top notch, but none of them were something that I would like to listen.\\n\r\nCharacter- 7\\n\r\nThe good guys were decent characters.The main protagonist Allen was an interesting character, but he lacked the brains or the attitude to be a real protagonist. Allen is basically a good guy and nothing more. The protagonist might as well be Lavi or The Krory( The vampire dude).  Well at least the good guys had some good character development, but because of the bad story the character development was really hard to see. The villains were just pointless. There goal was pointless and even 3 year old kids have better goals to accomplish. For example, Earl's goal was to destroy the world. And what will happen to him? Who the hell would want to destroy something his life depends on? Makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 6\\n\r\nI kinda enjoyed this anime with a big minus. I liked to watch some of the fights in D. Gray-man, like Krory against Lavi and Allen. Though most of the time the fights were one-sided like Allen killing lvl 1 akuma's. The comedy in here was like: Should I be laughing or not? So I didn't crack any laugh at all. Well at least I liked to listen to the music. But once I remember how long this anime was I feel like I wasted too much of my time for almost nothing. I will never rewatch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6\\n\r\nThe story is rubbish. For 103 episodes it went nowhere and the last episode just ended with a cliffhanger. Character's are decent. The art and music is quality stuff, but nothing ground-braking.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really have nothing to do then go watch D. Gray-man.  At the start you will like it , then you will get bored of it somewhere in the middle, then close to the end you will start to like it again and you will want to know what will happen next and at the end you will just get a wtf moment that will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and a lot of wasted time.",

            "content": "Themes surrounding exorcists and demons have been treated in previously in other works, and D.Gray-man revolves around such topic. What makes this anime different, is that it takes the liberty to slightly adjust such theme to match the setting, and also make an arguably more intriguing story. With the recent announcement of the upcoming sequel of D.Gray-man, people may wonder whether this battle sh\u014dnen is worth their time, and in this case it is, but only to a certain extent, as several crucial elements of a battle sh\u014dnen were executed in a lackluster manner. Not to mention the presence of some very lackluster characters.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe storyof D.Gray-man revolves around Allen Walker a young boy who enlists in the organization of Exorcists with the purpose of eliminating the akuma that roam the world with the \"Innocence\" - a gift, a weapon bestowed to serve the apostles of God, the exorcists. The akuma are in fact mechanical weapons made by suffering living souls, as opposed to the regular definition of the term; these are controlled by the antagonist, the Millenium Earl, a twisted and dark \"joker\" or \"clown\" if you may. It is the task of this organization to abolish and vanquish the Earl, the source of evil.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is a very standard premise, as mentioned earlier, what makes this anime differentiate itself from other similar titles, is the approach on its theme: it is dark and cruel, which was is the first thing that will be noticed when viewing the anime, which isn't frequent in the genre. It gives insight in the working of despair, loneliness, longing and death in numerous occasions when the protagonist seek to quench the attack of these akuma. The side stories provided for numerous situations can be interesting and dramatic as well. Comedy is also present in the anime, which can be at times funny, yet ultimately was overused as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime even more interesting is its setting: it takes place in the 19th century, a good and welcoming Victorian/gothic feel, mixed with some futuristic elements, which was achieved by the studio. Furthermore, this enhances the credibility of the situation of humanity currently is in, through the lack of fast communication present currently in ours society, which in turn enables the occurrence isolated and unknown cases where attacks occur. In addition it makes the viewer appreciate the difficulties the people faced in that era. As for the pacing, this was overall a bit lacking at times, where in several instances actions lasted longer than necessary, or either were beating around the bush. It must be mentioned that the first batch of episodes (around 30) are of episodic nature with some small arcs, following a very similar structure, whilst introducing the characters. From there on actual story takes place, which is in turn more intriguing and gripping.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where the anime fails in several occasions are the battle scenes and the \"powerups\". First of all, each exorcist has a unique \"innocence\" power, which gives diversity to the show. What is a shame is that the majority of the battle sequences are executed in the same manner, and very repetitive, which renders the diversity of the skills a bit pointless, as these are in majority of the cases confined to 2 or 3 action. Other huge issue are the \"powerlevels\" in this anime, these are very irregular and change whenever the plot demands it. When actual powerups take place, which for the matter are not earned through training or the likes, these seem totally pointless as secondary characters who didn't undergo such changes have the same powers; it doesn't give any real feeling of progression.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of D.Gray-man are rather lackluster in general, who stay in the majority of cases one or two-dimensional, or in even some cases devolve; however, the author managed to make these characters somewhat interesting through their pasts. On the side of the organization there is Allen Walker, the main character who is the typical shonen character who is very caring and values friendship above everything else. On the flip side, as a character he is likable as the aforementioned attribute isn't overused; furthermore, his past is something that certainly will keep viewers intrigued throughout its duration. Some character development takes place, yet this is hardly noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Lenalee, easily the worst character in the show: at first she seems to be a somewhat mysterious person, with a dark past. However, her character seem to change over the course, the author seemingly not very sure what to use her for, consequently several times her actions being incomprehensible. What is worse, she ultimately devolves to being a simple damsel in distress, which was a huge drawback. Other character of interest is Kanda, who as opposed as Allen, doesn't care about the others, which nicely contrasts in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the antagonists, these are typical as well, yet the most intriguing by far is the Millenium Earl himself, as audiences are intrigued on what his ultimate motives are for creating the akuma. He appears to be a comical character, yet dead serious when necessary, which can be a drawback for some, as it makes to difficult to take him seriously, with no motives apparent. Concerning the supporting cast of characters, these are for the most part uninteresting, on both sides, being either one-dimensional characters, or too mysterious to care about these. I might want to add that the akuma are not always simple evil beings; in several occassions it is shown that these can have a will of their own.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime was well done, having its share of detailed and varied backgrounds, which enhaced the overall viewing experience; this can't be really said of the protagonists, as these are generic, as opposed to some of the akuma designs, and naturally, the main villain himself. The animation quality was overall good, yet as the fights were repetitive and basic, it never could shine. It must be said that some actions scenes were very well executed, alongside a matching choreography.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of D.Gray-man is certainly well done, befitting of the atmosphere, yet ultimately forgettable. The voice actors performed their role well, especially in the case of some of the secondary characters, which helped to the intrigue of said people. As for the openings and endings, these are of very high quality with praiseworthy music pieces that certainly helped to peak the interest in audiences.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nD.Gray-man was overall a fine anime, yet never really shined due to the above mentioned issues: it failed in some crucial aspects of the genre itself, in addition to a weak cast of characters, although some were interesting, in addition to some of the antagonists. Despite all these flaws, I can't deny that I actually enjoyed the unknowing mysteries surrounding the world and the approach on its themes. A lot of things remain unknown in the anime, and thus I hope these are revealed in the sequel. So do I recommend this anime? Only to those who enjoy watching battle shounens really.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "What can I say, I tried.\r\nFor anime, you usually need to suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the story or the characters or the art.  It isn't an exercise in logic or anything serious.  However when it becomes that everything affronts your sensibilities, it's time to turn it off.  This anime was beyond frustrating, very unenjoyable.  I've been frustrated at animes like Bleach, Naruto, Hunter x Hunter, but nothing this awful.\r\nFirst, I didn't read the manga, maybe that is where it all went wrong.  It starts out by throwing you into a world that is far fetched, with unrealistic physicsand what not.  To be expected.  The art is above average, the music was mediocre and forgettable.  The main character is weak, without any distinguishable personality traits other than his clothing.  There isn't any supporting characters that are worthy of note and it's as if the writers expect you to have logged in hours of previous anime viewing to understand things.\\n\\n\r\nI only made it to episode 12, it was very difficult.  There is so so many questions and holes, and not the good kind that you want to find out, it's the bad kind that you just wish wouldn't linger like a shot of cheap whiskey.  I understand it's shonen, but seriously, does the main character have to be a scrawny do-gooder with a twisted morality?  After 12 eps, it left nothing to be desired.  The villians were obnoxious and petty.  It was throw up juice for the mind.\\n\\n\r\nI stopped it at exactly the part where the main character was given a chance to kill off a \"bad guy,\" she says something like, \"I know you won't shoot me.\"  How does she know this?  Because she has profiled him as a typical shonen anime character.  Please show me something that makes me want to watch the next episode.  Nothing.  Stay away from this.  Far away.",

            "content": "D.Gray-man is a shounen/action/adventure anime. It aplies the typical formula: long episode range with 19-20 minute animation, practically endless storyline and a main lead that predominates over all. It plays a lot with religion, this is what actually makes it really interesting.\r\nLike in almost all shounen animes the first episodes seem to be interesting. This is because you don't know anything about the world in which the events are going to take place or about the protagonists of this story. So meet Allen Walker, a 15 year old boy who has the power to see Akumas (means demons, mechanical killing machines is the term apliedin this anime ) and haves an anti-Akuma weapon to free the souls that hold them. This weapon works powered by \"Innocence\", a misterious susbstance that haves a cubic form, it was supposedly created by God. Only those compatible with it can use it, can become \"Exorcists\" and join the Black Order to fight the Millenary Count, who is destined to destroy the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot develops in a 19th century, mostly, european demography. Of course you get to see some regions of Asia as well, but the settings are usually european. Past the first 10-15 episodes probably most people who aren't used to watch shounen-type animes will easily get bored. D.Gray-man haves a \"Inuyasha-10000+Pearl fragments\" feeling, but it does not develop that slowly. There are 140+ Innocence pieces to be found... well actually no. Some of them are already in posession of the Black Order and the events focuss troughout the first 40-45 episodes on only this objective, but then it drastically changes.\\n\\n\r\nFrom episode 50 the ambience changes will be totally obvious: the objetives will change, the battles will get more ferocious and the story will truly advance. D.Gray-man is as average anime up to espisode 50, then it touches the realm of a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically speaking I would define D.Gray-man as varied. You'll see lots of characters: enemies and companions. If I take the Akumas as an example the artistic design is poor on episodes 1-20, these are level 1 Akumas. Then the Akumas evolve into levels, now here you can see what I'm talking about: variety and creativity. As the anime develops you'll witness more crazy and unthinkable tranformations and evolutions. The protagonists are very well designed, the weapons of each one of them somehow reflects their own and unique personality. The fighting scenaries are beautiful and the \"bosses\" are more than fearsome, in a funny way.\\n\\n\r\nUVERworld, Abingdon Boys School and Sowelu are just some of the artists you'll come across on the opening and ending scenes. This translates into a amazing sound experience that will glue you to the anime fron the opening to ending sequences. The BGM's are well executed in the anime an add more suspense, spice up the action and ultimately transform good fights into epic confrontations. Definitely one of the strongest points D.Gray-man achieves.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are typical shounen-based. You have the strong-willed never-surrender-even-if-I'm-almost-dead Allen Walker (main lead). His female companion and most probable romantic parther Lenalee. The \"rival\" character: Kanda Yui. And other companions that will be added to the \"party\" as the storyline progresses. One thing I didn't like was the lack of airtime that some of the most interesting characters have (generals). You get glances of them at some point in the anime but they do not appear as part of the plot until later on and for such a short amount of time that it really feels like a waste once you get to finally see them on action. Also you don't get almost any character development troughout the first half of the anime; here episode 50+ becomes again a turning point in which characters develop at a very good speed in a 40-50 episode range. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I was about to drop the anime at episode 20. My friend told me \"to keep on going, you won't regret it once you get to episode 50\". Surely I didn't. The twists in the story started here, continued until the end and made D.Gray-man really worth my time. Anyone should watch this, it isn't your average shounen anime, you'll understand why once you dig into it. \\n\\n\r\nThe end is actually inconclusive so I guess the studio might be making another anime (second season?) to continuate this one, due to the great popularity this and the manga have. I really hope so because there are still many things that need to be explained and I just can't wait for that moment.",

At first look D.Gray-man may seem like a typical shonen anime. The main character is probably going to be a hot-head who wants to get stronger and stronger for a certain purpose... usually to protect his friends.\r\nBut.\r\nD.Gray-man is not like any shonen anime I've ever seen. In fact, it's got something much more than most.\r\n--STORY--\r\nYou may be thinking \"Hmm... a guy with a deformed arm... Full Metal Alchemist?\"\r\nWell, no, actually.\r\nD.Gray-man's plot may seem like it'sgoing on the same path as FMA at first, but it transforms into something completely different.\\n\\n\r\nI love the plot. At first (since I don't normally watch horror anime) I thought it was a little creepy, but it was an addicting kind of creepy. I couldn't get enough of it.\\n\\n\r\nThough in the beginning I thought it was going to be typical shonen since there's talk about \"finding all of the Innocence\", I was a little skeptical about watching DGM.\\n\r\nBut, after a while, that passed and it grew into something much more.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there's that issue of fillers. Darn fillers ruin a lot of anime sometimes, but I couldn't tell when there was a filler when I watching DGM. The fillers are actually good. Really.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil the series, but let's just say that once you start watching DGM, you'll never want to stop.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--ART--\\n\\n\r\nI loved the animation. At first, it starts off okay, but during the third and fourth season, it really kicks into gear.\\n\r\nThe characters match the manga really well, and stayed true to Hoshino-sama's character design.\\n\r\nThe lighting and scenery are utterly beautiful. There are too many beyond words places that this anime visits.\\n\\n\r\n--SOUND--\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good, but I found the background music boring at times. It's used over and over again--but the background music is still good.\\n\r\nThe OP's match the anime extremely well.\\n\r\nAt first when I heard the ED's, I really didn't like a lot of them. Listen to the ED's a couple of times, and you'll fall in love with them.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--CHARACTERS--\\n\r\nFirst of all, the main character,Allen Walker, is the exact opposite of most main shonen anime and manga characters. Allen Walker is the polite and klutzy type who just loves to eat, but there's much more to him than meets the eye, just as there is with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course you have to have the comic relief, Lavi, who can still fight.\\n\r\nYou have a guy who just seems to make you laugh every time you seem him, Yu Kanda.\\n\r\nYou have a girl who can kick some serious butt, Lenalee.\\n\r\nYou have a really... weird but cool adult figure, Komui.\\n\r\nAnd, of course, there's kick-ass villains who you just want to love--but you have to keep reminding yourself that they are evil, and WILL kill your favorite main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI found it extremely hard to NOT hate any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd... there was something else that caught my eye about these characters.\\n\r\nThey seemed REAL.\\n\r\nThis anime focuses on the characters more than the plot, even though the plot is almost as interesting as the characters.\\n\\n\r\n--OVERALL--\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime.\\n\r\nI think that every anime or manga fan should watch/read DGM.\\n\\n\r\nIt's my favorite anime--and D.Gray-man always makes me sit on the edge of my seat, tear up, and put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that D.Gray-man does the same to you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: This review has been completely changed and thought over.\r\nTo be honest, I was extremely iffy to watch D. Gray-Man. I mean, a series over 100 episodes screams out filler and something more mainstream like Naruto or Bleach. I began to watch it because I already had it and the holidays had come by. With nothing else to do, D. Gray-Man was the better option out of the rest of my anime storage.\r\nThis anime is really quite a typical shounen with action, a set enemy and a love interest. It goes more into the dramatic side though. Of course, D. Gray-Man follows the exorcist AllenWalker. It depicts his time at the Dark Order. DGM shows struggles within one's self and such. Once you get to about episode 40+ you are thrown onto a roller coaster of emotional struggle. It's really good, it gets to ya sometimes but it's not a tear jerker. It just makes you feel for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the main plot of the story. The idea is great but it's been seen before, most obvious example being FMA. It's the directing that let's DGM down at times. Some points in the plot is plain boring itself, it's nothing you haven't seen before really. The pacing is inconsistent and it bugged me. You get really tedious 4-5 episode long arcs at the start which are somewhat important to introduce characters and the idea of Innocence to the audience. It just could've been handled better and without the 2-3 episodes to get to the main point. \\n\\n\r\nAfter you're introduced with everything, nothing big happens until about episodes late 30's early 40's. Feel free to skip anything you deem filler and come back to it later. It's what I did and if you come to be obsessed with the characters in the end like I was, you'd be glad for them fillers you get to watch once you actually do have some sort of appreciation towards the characters. I skipped about 10 episodes, majority were filler and the rest were part of the actual plot. Even the original storyline can get boring as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt wasn't anything major. It was nice but it definitely wasn't something with a high budget. Only major characters were given a decent amount of detail, but at least the animation was smooth. I was also quite surprised with a scene near the end of the series, which I thought had quite a bit of effort put into it. If the scene was handed down to another anime, I fear that the detail would disappear as it's not something I see producers really caring about. So props to the producers for that. It's not shiny and wow looking, it's just a scene that felt realistic is all.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't take note of the BGM. BGM normally doesn't appeal to me unless it's really good. DGM didn't hit that really good standard. OP and ED's were quite normal for me. Catchy, but not something that was really really good. The voice acting I liked. I thought Allen had a too high pitched of a voice at first but it grew on me and is very suitable for him. Everything was up to normal standards and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have a thing for characters so this area usually gets a higher mark then the other categories. You get a range in characters and a few main cast ones but I only felt that Allen was the only one given any character development. Yes we find out Lavi's and Lenalee's past a little but it never really stood out. It felt like something thought up to fill in that curious gap, though it wasn't satisfying. That is why I find the characters bland when I seriously think about them. But if you think of them based on enjoyment then yes that would be quite high. The characters are fun to watch, it makes you happy to see them being well, happy with each other. The Noah are great. They're evil yet human at the same time and it's just so fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, DGM is definitely not a technically good anime. It more bases on its fandom and enjoyment rate for its success, like the mainstream anime. DGM is a little deeper then that though. It's better then mainstream but not good enough. This is really something to watch when you have the time and are bored. It's agonising just look at how many episodes there are. Just skip to about 40 once you watch maybe the first 20 and it should be more bearable. Don't expect something that is breath taking, expect something simply fun and addictive, like how Kuroshitsuji is. Both are dark but it's mainly the fandom which makes them awesome. \\n\\n",

The anime is quite similar to his works. The dark, gothic, and edgy. \r\nEven though the story is typical shounen anime, it&rsquo;s fun to watch the whole drawing things. Black, white, and grey are the main color use in the anime, but doesn&rsquo;t make the artwork dull, instead it makes the late 19th century setting to be stronger. \r\nThe main antagonist, Earl of the Millennium looks non-threatening at all. With his massive grinand high top hat, he very much like Joker from Batman, or Oogie Boogey man from Nightmare Before Christmas. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I&rsquo;m not up to date with this series, but I love it a lot. It got good storyline, great weapons and fights, adequate humor, good plot and twist.\\n",

            "content": "D.Gray-man is one of those \"hit or miss\" shows, for me it was a bit of a miss, but some hits.\r\nStory - 7.4/10 (C)\r\nThe tale begins with the introduction of Allen Walker, a young man with a strange power to send demons packing. His adventures in the Black Order, his encounters with many different types of Akuma, and his relationships with his fellow Exorcists are shown.\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nThe beginning felt a tad awkward, it was a little on the comedy side (When Allen goes to the Black Order), and for a show like D.Gray-man, it didn't really fit. It took me a few episodes (and some motivation)to get me into it. It was a moderate experience, some good turns, some bad ones. I liked how the filler episodes (yes, there were filler) didn't feel like filler, but more of a depth in character views (Ex. Lenalee, Allen, Miranda). Then there were a couple of &quot;Naruto&quot;-long fights, that really didn't have to be that long. Overall, it was a pleasant ride.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7.0/10 (C-)\\n\r\nThe animation was far from what we see today, but it doesn't mean that it was THAT bad. The OP sequences were great, however the ED sequences were just a bunch of pictures moving in cool angles. The fights were a mixture of both good and bad. But for the most part, the animation doesn't really change.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.5/10 (C)\\n\r\nThe OP/ED themes were really a great step-up than most animes, and i really enjoyed some of the lighter, lax music it had. The trouble of it was, sometimes it got to lax that it started to get boring fast. Mainly, the rest was just a mix of great tracks (Lala's Lullaby from one of the earlier episodes was a great, moving song) to plain tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.4/10 (B)\\n\r\nI can honestly say, none of the D.Gray-man characters will disappoint you. We have the polite and respectful Allen, the protective and light-hearted Lenalee, the mysterious and sometimes shady Kanda, the cheery, upbeat Exorcist Lavi, and the pessimistic time-user Miranda. Each character will leave you feeling the same way they do, and each character brings a uniqueness that leaves you wondering how it can be done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7.3/10 (C)\\n\r\nFor the most part (and that same phrase you keep reading in this review), it's a mixture of some good elements and some bad ones. I really enjoyed the light-hearted actions and the teary-eyed moments of the first season, the second season got more intense with the arrival of the Noah Clan, and the rest is ok. The animation needed a good tune-up though, and some better choices of BGM.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.5/10 (C)\\n\r\nThe Good:Great character backgrounds, interesting way of presenting each episode, the filler episodes make you feel like it's not filler\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\nLackluster animation, combined with lackluster BGM made the show more towards a &quot;good&quot; rating. Some episodes left you scratching your head more than others.",

            "content": "This is probably the most underrated show of all time. It's very unique when compared to other shounen anime, too.\r\nYou will notice how great, unique and advanced the story is as you progress. At the same time, it succeeds to keep the storyline simple and clean; Innocence and exorcists good, Akuma and Millenium Earl bad, The Heart big important, whoever finds The Heart achieves victory royale. After ridicule events that may occur in this absurd story, there're no plot holes formed and loose ends are ALWAYS tied up. In addition, there're no forced power-ups or friendship power assemblies to do the impossible. In fact, therehave been many times where I thought to myself \"crap, there's no way these guys make it out\". When Allen hits the ground, he hits it HARD. Combined with his selflessness, DGM gives a chance for side characters to prove themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development? Mmm, tasty! In over 100 episodes, there's always time to explore characters and their past, even ones with minor impact on the plot. Although it's a tad disappointing how Allen remains mysterious even after his past got slightly unveiled, it makes me glad that it wasn't disclosed in depth. You'll understand what I said when you watch DGM Hallow or read the manga afterwards. It's also worth mentioning that the antagonists are so well written that you might end up sympathizing them, which is the case with most of the DGM fans. In fact, you might begin to question who the righteous side is. Perhaps Allen will join the Noah someday? One can hope.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, for a shounen there're lots of sad episoded which will evoke your feels (also see episodes 4&5), followed by sorrowful soundtracks (also see Saikai OST and episodes 4&5 again). I'm a strong guy but damn, this anime drowned me in tears. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime has great story, characters, soundtrack, and can be tearful sometimes *whip*, but everything is followed by great humor, so you will most likely not get bored. I stayed along the journey only because the story was thrilling. Like in Neon Genesis Evangelion, so little was covered so there was always a feel of hype and excitement. I believe DGM is unlike your regular shounen anime, you should definitely give it a shot!",

            "content": "To everyone thinking \"Oh, joy. Another cliche shonen anime!\", you'll be surprised how different and fresh D.Gray-Man is from most other anime. OK, it starts off slow and has a sort of simple, definitely cliche plotline at the beginning. It seems really boring with simple and boring characters, right? Wrong.\r\nDGM (aka D.Gray-Man. I'll use this from now on - easier to type up) is definitely a more character-driven anime, instead of the usual plot-driven ones. The characters are all real and tangible; they have emotions and they show them. Each of them have different backstories, which are revealed as the story progresses and each ofthem faces different enemies and situations. Each of them has different abilities that they show as the danger increases and they all play unique and vital roles in the story. But wait, I'm jumping a bit ahead of myself. That's all in the second half of DGM; the first half is simply an introduction to their world, powers and enemies. The story arcs are very short; around 4 episodes max and quite decent. But after the 50th episode mark, DGM shows its true colours. The detailed introduction of the creator of the Akuma and his \"family\" really kicks off the story and raises the bar for everything to come.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as I've said, is more character-based, and is one of DGM's stronger points. It's unique and interesting, but the earlier episodes don't really compare story-wise to the later episodes; all hell breaks loose and it kicks into overdrive after episode 50 or so. Also, whilst watching DGM for the first time, I had no idea most of the episodes I was watching in the first half were fillers; the story arcs are so short they seem to be part of the story and just slot in with the more crucial episodes that introduce important characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation quality are top-notch. The special effects and art styles are quite something, and the character models and backgrounds are superb. There's a lot of detail for those who care to look, and there's nothing really I have to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound now. The sound's... well, decent. The openings and endings are excellent, but the background music doesn't really do much for the anime. To be honest, I just sort of blanked out the background music and when I saw a soundtrack for DGM in the shops, I thought \"D.Gray-Man had background music?\" Japanese voice acting is excellent. English? Not so much. Definitely watch in Japanese with subs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in DGM are by far its strongest aspect. They develop and mature as the series goes along, and they have real emotions, emotions which they have to accept and overcome. They aren't afraid to show their emotions, not afraid to cry or laugh, and they do so regularly. It's quite astounding how Katsura Hoshino has managed to make convincing characters and then throw them into different situations, showing them reacting accordingly without the slightest hint of forcing them to, or pushing the story along.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, I think D.Gray-Man mixes a cliche shonen storyline, convincing characters and a beautiful art style to create something completely fresh and unique. Definitely give it a try, no matter what. And if you don't like it, watch on anyway; it gets much better the further along you watch.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback much appreciated ;)",

I happen to be a huge fan of the manga; the art style has always impressed me, the pacing is just right, the humor is done well, and the characters are so well developed and interested. 10/10 in every category.\r\nThe anime has none of that.\r\nThe animation is lackluster, the filler plots are long, abundant, and dull, and the characters are simplified and just not done well at all (it's difficult to explain, but the depth and fullness of the characters just do not comethrough like they do in the manga).\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality would have to be the opening themes, and even that is a bit of a stretch (although this probably depends more on one's personal preference).\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, if you've never seen the series, go read the manga instead. If you've already read the manga and are looking for more, forget about this. If you've already watched the anime but have never read the manga, I highly implore you to go read the manga right now and compare.",

            "content": "Hoshino Katsura has created an interesting beast in D.Gray-man. It has a definite whiff of the standard shonen about it, but there's so much unique about the anime that it's easy to forgive that.\r\nFor one thing, the stylistic theme of the whole affair can only be described as \"surreal\". An interesting mixture of clown motifs and religious themes sets this anime immediately apart. The primary villain manages to be simultaneously comically ridiculous, incredibly sinister, and utterly evil, whilst the main supporting villains manage to be extremely likeable characters with a very human side, even whilst doing their master's undeniably evil bidding. The more generic enemies\u2013 the Akuma \u2013 are consistently creepy enough to maintain interest. I mean seriously. Creepy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and their abilities are also very well-executed. Unusually for a shonen, the main character is actually both interesting and likeable enough to deserve all the focus he gets; indeed, I think one area this anime succeeds brilliantly in is balancing its cast of characters. One never feels like the cast is getting stale, but at the same time it never seems to grow too large; characters get pretty much exactly the volume of screentime they deserve, and the characters who receive the most focus are generally also the most likeable. I say this in direct contrast to anime such as Bleach and Naruto, which have a huge cast of secondary characters, many of them more likeable than the main characters, but they have a distinct tendency to fail to receive any development, or often even any screentime whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is somewhat episodic. It manages not to shy away from focus on the main villains from very early on, whilst at the same time maintaining a healthy air of mystery and distance about them. Overall, it avoids the classic shonen trap of feeling like just a sequence of battles; with one major exception, progression is generally more complicated than simply battling enemies. The shonen \"power curve\" of progressively stronger enemies as the protagonists' power increases is present, but never feels forced; \"evolution\" is treated as an important theme, and often used to draw uncomfortable parallels between the heroes and the villains. The author is also not afraid to give a fair amount of focus to the characters without special abilities. Comedy is present, but generally restricted to short, more light-hearted \"relief\" segments in between the main story arcs.\\n\\n\r\nBut where the series really shines is in its emotion and conflicts. Enemies are routinely treated as sympathetic in one way or another, and the protagonists' \"heroic\" organisation is itself by no means morally perfect. The war with the Akuma is presented as just that \u2013 a war, and generally a losing one, with all the tragedies and internal/moral conflicts that come with that. Whilst the series doesn't have a habit of killing off its central protagonists, tragedy and death are central, recurring themes from the very first chapter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find D.Gray-man a compelling and entertaining series that is well worth a read. \\n\r\n(The anime had a premature ending, therefore I would suggest continuing D.Gray-man on chapter 156)",

            "content": "I finally finished D.Gray Man, just in time for the summer release of it's sequel. Was it worth the time and effort to catch up? Well, I wouuuuuld like to tell you, but if I do that you won't read the review! \r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 5/10\r\nThe concept of D.Gray Man is definitely overdone. It was certainly more unique in it's time, but was still common, even then. Even if it hadn't been overdone so much, it still wouldn't have been too interesting. Humans versus monsters isn't really that captivating. However, one of the big pluses of DGM is that it is much darker than you would expect.There is a LOT of death involved with the series, and it deals with the concepts of pain, loss, and depression rather well. I'll talk about this more in characters. For the actual plot itself... well, for the first half, it's totally garbage. It just feels pointless, like the story was being prolonged just to make money. But it's not like you can skip it either, because as boring as it is, it's important for setting the framework for the second half. Once you can get past that, though, the second half of DGM gets much, MUCH better. The story takes off from mimi arcs to a massive war between the main characters and the main villains. There is tons of death and despair during this arcs, which is quite rare to see from a shonen. However even in these climactic moments, plot armor still exists, and you know none of the main characters will die. Also, it seems that no matter how hard DGM tries to be unique, it always returns to it's shonen roots, with every character screaming 'I FIGHT FOR MY FRIENDS' and things along those lines. That said, the climax was epic and gets your adrenaline running every time the protagonists have a comeback. If I were to judge this anime on the second half alone, it would get a much higher score, but I can't forget that atrocious first half.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor shonen standards, the quality put into DGM's art is outstanding. However in the anime medium as a whole, it isn't as impressive. You can clearly note the unneeded effort put into structures, and it was clear the show wanted to make itself look as dark as possible. But, in the animation department, it falls flat. The character movements can be weird at times, and the most important part of any shonen, the battles, are majorly affected by this. In the second half not as much, but definitely in the first place I laughed during some of the grim battles, just because of how pathetically childish the animation is. \\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest problem I have with shonen is the massive amount of theme songs that come along with them. DGM is not one of those shonen. Only one, or two if you want to stretch, of the endings are really 'good', but that still makes it above average from the everyday anime! And the openings... omg, the openings... openings 3 and 4 are fantastic to go along with the dramatic improvement, bur 1 and 2 are no joke either. The theme songs power is overlooked when it comes to the soundtrack though. Remember how I was saying that I laughed during some of the serious battles? Well this is another reason why. And the main one. I would go as far as to say the soundtrack actually ruined the entire show for me, until the second half, where a couple good tracks are added. It ruined the suspense sometimes though, which may be another reason why I cannot stand the first half. The power of the soundtracks is ALSO overlooked when it comes to the voice acting department. Some of the most famous seiyu of all time voice the main characters, and they live up to their reputation and do a fantastic job. Krory, in particular, has an extremely talented voice actor, to be able to pull off his creepy voice. The power of the voice acting though, is ALSO (you must be tired of me saying this by now) overlooked b the poor sound effects. They're very typical to a shonen, and are the third and final reason why I can't take the battles seriously. It can be summed up in one word, and that is fake explosion. The directors practically spammed it during fights against akuma.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow THIS is where DGM shines, right from the start. First off, the main characters. The designs are AWESOME! Not to mention unique. I bet if you were to look at Allen or Lavi, you wouldn't forget them for a while. Now I know I said 'right from the start', but that wasn't completely true. The characters are great to start with, but are even more amazing when they go through the pain and loss of a comrade. They all have their own unique way of reacting, and sometimes they feel so real, it's... well eerie! Out of the four lead characters, though, there is one person in particular who is outshined by the rest: Lenalee. Being the only female main character, Lenalee has the plainest design and motivation of the four. However. I believe that Lenalee has the most potential out of the four of them. I feel in the future if she were to undergo a serious loss, her change would be almost psychological... something I wholeheartedly have crossed my fingers for. The supporting characters, especially the villains, are also worth mention as they are also extremely unique and outclass the characters of your average shonen. However... their designs don't, and because of this I guarantee you'll be calling characters 'Lenalee's brother' instead of 'Komui'. This isn't a problem with the antagonists, but the helping main characters certainly suffer from it.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6.15/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, is DGM worth the watch? If it was just the second half I would say YES in all capitals, but no matter how hard I try, I can't forget the first half. In the end, my answer became no. DGM is better than average, but it's not worth watching 103 episodes. If it was shorter I would say give it a go, but because of it's length, I had to answer with no. For recommendations I point you towards Hunter x Hunter (2011) which also has it's weak points but overall is a far better example of a mature shonen, and Bleach, which is similar in the sense that supernatural beings also invade the human world with a group of people blessed with special powers to defend it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! Feedback is always appreciated. This has been thelectricow, and now I shall end this review faster than lighting!",

            "content": "On the surface, D. Gray-Man sounds like just another shonen anime with an organization of good guys with special weapons fighting evil monsters. Yeah, that's the base of it, but DGM turns into something more, something deeper than many other shonen anime series. In fact, I feel that it sneaks around seinen territory.\r\nWhile the setting is standard shonen all the way, you'll find yourself surprised when watching this show. It starts off a bit slow, with many fights, small arcs (~1-4 episodes) and nothing special to it. However, it quickly picks up, and some way into season 2 or 3, DGM starts to show itsqualities. The story soon blends in action, emotions and last but not least, realistic power-ups. The story is overall more deep and serious than most shonen anime, and builds up and only gets better towards the end, where it meets it demise with an unfortunate canceling, which, together with its slow start, may ruin the experience of the show for many.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are without a doubt the strongest point of DGM. I mentioned earlier that DGM is sneaking about in seinen territory, and the reason for this is the characters. They don't think &quot;You bastard! I need to suddenly get stronger so I can defeat you&quot; and get stronger and defeat the bad guys. The characters here aren't all about brawling against the evil guys. They have emotions. Emotions which they have to face. And that's what makes it into a semi-seinen series; it's a bit more character-driven and not so much plot-driven. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of DGM is also astounding. There's a lot of detail put into the environments, and character designs are great too. Special effects are really great, and the same can be said about lighting effects. When you consider that DGM is a bit dark and serious, the coloring is really great too; it's just as dark as it needs to be to fit in with the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is definitely the weakest point of DGM. The background music isn't especially memorable, and not really great. I hope they decide to get a new soundtrack soon so I can get something better. Also, using the same stuff for 100 episodes is a lot. OP and ED themes are okay though, and I like the more heavy style of the OP themes - it fits with the tone of the show. Voice acting and sound effects are great though. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thing which I should mention is that the fillers in DGM are actually good. &quot;What fillers?&quot; you may ask if you've watched the show. To be honest, I asked the same question when I first heard that there was a lot of filler in the show. The thought never even came close to my mind. So that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I feel that DGM mixes shonen and seinen into something special and unique. It may not appeal to all shonen fans, but those of you who like more serious action anime will enjoy DGM even more.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)\\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest here. I don't usually go for long running shounens. Since my younger days of pokemon, digimon and yu-gi-oh (back before I'd even heard the term anime and just thought of them as cartoons), the longest anime series I've watched was 50 episodes, and that was only one show and took me forever to finish. High episode counts put me off. I like my stories to have an end. I like my battles not to drag on for five episodes. I like my plot arcs to end before I've had enough of them. When my characters have to get stronger, I like atraining montage with the Rocky theme playing, not five episodes of them agonising over what it is that's holding them back, only for them to then repeat that process after the current villain is defeated and the next villain has presented itself. So why do I love D. Gray-Man? Because for a 103 episode shounen, it keeps it's use of the above shounen tropes to a minimum, and on the occaisions when it does use them, the other elements of the show keep the formula fresh.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the plot, which is far darker than your average shounen. From the very first episode, we are shown a merciless enemy that will exploit any weakness, who's main weapon, the Akuma (demons) uses the souls of the dead. These are not zombies, just mindless corpses. These are weapons which pull a soul back from heaven and torture it as their power source. A lot of shounens gloss over the concept of death, bad guys are captured alive or shown the error of their ways, people fall unconscious but can be healed, etc. In D. Gray-man, death is very real, and resting in peace is only for the fortunate ones who's loved ones are strong enough not to be tempted to call them back.\\n\\n\r\nAgainst the Akuma and their creator, the Millennium Earl, are the Exorcists of the Dark Order. Exorcists are those chosen by God to use 'innocence', a mysterious substance which can be used to form weapons capable of destroying the Akuma. The series follows Allen Walker, a new recruit with the ability to see the souls trapped within the Akuma. The plot itself begins slowly, with short arcs in which Allen and his comrades are dispatched to investigate mysterious phenomena which are thought to be caused by innocence fragments. After a few of these arcs, the Noah Clan, allies of the Millennium Earl, begin to be introduced and the focus turns to the war between him and the Dark Order.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is, for the most part, very well paced. Early arcs are kept short, about 4 episodes or so long, with a single 'filler' episode in between. Don't be put off when I say filler. While the plot could easily go without these episodes, I found them all to be entertaining (if somewhat silly at times) and they served well as comic relief within an otherwise serious plot. And if you don't enjoy them, they do become fewer and further between as the war intensifies and plot arcs become longer. With one exception, none of these longer plot arcs drag on to the point that the viewer just wants them to get on with it. In the one arc in which this does occur, it is saved in part by having another plot running at the same time. Battles often do last across multiple episodes, but in most of these, the battle changes and develops over those episodes, unlike drawn out battles in other shounen which just get repetitive, where the middle episodes can often just be skipped entirely.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also boasts one of the best sets of characters of any anime I have seen. Each hero is flawed, and the Earl and Noah are far more fleshed out (in more ways than one in the Earl's case) than most villains. It says a lot about the quality of a series' characters when the villains mourning a dead friend can evoke sympathy. They also managed to inspire doubt as to whether the exorcists are in fact the good guys, thanks to the show's religious imagery.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the heroes, each has their own motive, each of which is more complex than the standard shounen motives of just saving the world or becoming the strongest and the like. Allen wants to save the souls of the Akuma, to the point where he can even show disregard for his own or others' lives at times. Lenalee, the series' main female character, fights for the sake of her friends and brother, and her past reveals that she may not support the Dark Order's cause even as she fights for them. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal favourite characters were Lavi and Bookman. These two are a master (Bookman) and apprentice (Lavi) of a clan of historians who became exorcists to be close to history as it occurred so that it could be recorded, and while they do fight, they try to minimise how much they interfere. Lavi's conflict between his duty as a Bookman and as an Exorcist, the loyalty he developed for his friends despite Bookman's orders to become close to no one, and his doubts as to whether the cheerful, friendly, fun guy is the real him or a mask that he should remove was probably my favourite aspect of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, here I am singing the series' praises, yet it got a 9, not a 10. Why? Well, in complete contrast to what I said at the beginning, because it ended. A lot wasn't able to be explained before the series was cancelled. The last ten episodes or so suffered from trying to rush one of the story arcs after having taken their time over previous ones. The battle in the last three episodes was amazing, but it also wasn't the final battle that I wanted to see. There is a lot of potential for a sequel, including a development at the end that virtually screamed \"to be continued\". I do sincerely hope that there will be a sequel. But if there isn't, the show ended in the best possible place it could. A clear cut ending is often unrealistic, and endings in which the heroes won but the villain is there in the shadows, not as dead as they thought, muttering \"This isn't over\" gets old quickly. Maybe the abiguity was for the best. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the show is well worth watching, even if you don't usually commit to long running shounen. Just don't go in expecting to not have any questions at the end.",

            "content": "This is my review of the episodes which I have seen which is up through 58.\r\n     Im not going to dull people with a summary of the story its on anidb and other such websites and they do a better job than I would. However if you want a short summarized version of what Im going to say, here it is: Want a series that start out as typical shounen series that transform into a powerful epic that twists and turns in unexpected ways? Then I would recommend D.Grey-man. \r\n     The story starts off pretty good, buttakes some time before it kicks into overdrive so be prepared. I found myself liking the series, but for the first 40 episodes or so it felt pretty mediocre after that point the story starts to flesh out and go in some pretty unexpected directions.  I felt probably one of the stronger points of the story was how episodes which appeared like fillers at first turned out to introduce important characters which return again and play very important roles in terms of the story. At heart though D.Grey-man is still a shounen so dont watch it if you absolutely hate these types of series, but it has a different taste than other series such as Naruto or One Piece.\\n\\n\r\n     The Animation is top notch and it improves as the series progresses. Characters facial expressions are superb especially when considering the huge cast of both good and bad guys. I love the unique look that the bad guys bring to this anime: evil, yet at the same time they are appealing in their own way. The same is also true of the good guys cool but, at times, ridiculous. Any filler episode had at least average animated action scenes. However whenever the series gets to the story pertinent battles the action scenes are stepped up a notch.\\n\\n\r\n     The sound is by far the most troublesome area. All the intro or ending songs are excellent and fit the series very well. However during the actual episode the music is far less memorable. Not that it is absent or that it is per say bad, but there was never a moment where I really noticed it particularly like I have in other series.  The sound effects themselves are alright, but there are several characters with really annoying sound effects attached to them when they use their abilities and that is by far my biggest complaint worth noting.\\n\\n\r\n     The characters are by far D.Grey-mans strongest point. They have an absolutely lovable cast. From the main characters to the side characters there hasnt been a single one I found annoying or wishing they would go away. Quite the opposite I found many times hoping these characters would make a return and too my surprise many did.  The series takes its time to flesh out as much as possible all the characters, of course with the emphasis being on the side characters, but I felt satisfied with all of the side characters back stories as well. It really doesnt get much better than the characters, in terms of growth and depth, than in this series.\\n\\n\r\n     The Enjoyment of this series is really watching the characters grow. This in my opinion is where D.Grey-man strongly resembles most other shounen series, but not in a bad way seeing as I love these types of series. The story is there in the back of your mind, but in the usually the focus is on the characters. I have found that as the series has progressed I began enjoying it more and more much like an acquired taste.\\n\\n\r\n     Overall  D.Grey-man does start out like a standard shounen. However after the first 40 episodes I found it getting increasingly more fun to sit and watch. And while its hard to say what the future will bring the series is entering what I would consider the second story arch and it has gotten really good, much in the same way that Bleach or Naruto did. So basically if you like shounen then you will dig this series, but if you typically dont go for those type of series I would still recommend giving D.Grey-man a try because it does vary from your typical series enough to make it a unique experience.\\n",

            "content": "When i originally wrote this review (after watching the 72 episodes that had aired at that time), D.Grayman was #42 in \"Popularity\" on myanimelist.net and a very Popular Manga (#10). The show had a score of 7.8..BUT You might have noticed that the score and popularity you now see is much higher reason being the anime starts off fairly slowly and takes a while to kick into gear and progress the plot. But once its does you just might be a fan...\r\nThe Story has a very original plot. When I started this anime I immediately liked the concept of chosen humans + \"innocence\" = akuma(demon) butt-kicking \"Exorcists\"!  I knew nothing about it but i decided to watch it based on its good animation and I was not disappointed at all. The characters and their uniforms/weapons all look outstanding! \\n\\n\r\nI found that all of the op. and end. songs are excellent songs that you wouldnt mind listening to each episode. Normally I would skip songs but I listened to all of D.Gray-man's because they really do suit the anime and sound good! Background music could be a bit better tho... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter is one of the best aspects of the anime. Each and every character is Amazing! Each main character is lovable, unique, strong, nice-looking and they all have mysterious pasts and secrets. I have found fan clubs for even the evil characters. You wont find out about the evil characters until late in the anime but they are surprisingly loved as well. There might be a few characters you dont like but those would likely be side characters..all the main characters are great! The development of the ALL the characters through out the series always amazed me...\\n\\n\r\nTry not to give up on this anime too early...after watching about 30 episodes I started to get a little bored... But since I loved the characters and was curious about the plot I decided to go read the manga. I was instantly hooked and it became a favorite! The point is that at the start of the anime there are a lot of filler-type episodes (especially before episode 38). Dont get me wrong, these are not the typical useless filler episodes. All most all these episodes are either action-packed or show some character development.\\n\r\nEven in the most serious of times there are humorous moments and great weapons/abilities/battles..\\n\\n\r\nD.Gray-man finished with 103 episodes and not many fillers..In my opinion do not be disappointed with the end of the anime. There are many amazing battles that lead up to the climatic end but a lot of things are left unexplained. I don't think its confirmed but I am expecting a second season in the future after a lot more manga chapters are released (when the anime ended, it was very close to manga and i guess they decided not to go into fillers...)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is excellent [9-10] and covers almost every genre; \\n\r\nA worthy watch! It can be compared with the popular shounen anime Naruto and Bleach but I found more interest in D.Gray-man which is a bit more serious and in depth.  (And a lot less out-stretched if you know what I mean...)\\n",

            "content": "To be fair, I can understand why D. Grayman has a huge following.  You've got an interesting premise, lots of good characters, and excellent animation by BONES.  And cool weapons and uniforms.  And Allen's REALLY cute.  The only problem is the snail-paced plot development.  And that's gonna be a lot to endure for a 100+ episode series.\r\nIt starts out interesting enough.  We meet our hero (Allen), and get introduced into the world of exorcists who fight akuma (monster/human/machine hybrids).  We learn what the goal is (save the world--specifically to save the crystal substance called \"innocence\" from the evilMillennium Earl).  But by the 15th episode or so, the episodes have begun to show a pattern.  Each episode falls into one of three categories:\\n\\n\r\n1: Somebody finds a new innocence accommodator\\n\r\n2: Allen goes on a trip/mission\\n\r\n3: Someone besides Allen goes on a trip/mission\\n\\n\r\nEach trip/mission (most take up just one episode) takes place in some town that holds a tragic story.  Since each of these towns has a new cast of townsfolk, we meet a bewildering number of characters very quickly, and it's a bit taxing to constantly be introduced to new characters.  The exorcist who is the hero of the episode has to solve the townsfolks' problem.  Practically none of these trip/mission episodes contribute anything to the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd each episode has a battle with akuma.  Every episode.  Did you hear me?  EVERY DANG EPISODE.  Okay, maybe one or two don't.  But it gets routine pretty quickly.  If we're lucky, we see Allen's weapon advance to a new level!  I've gotten to where I skip over the battles.  It gets to be where if you've seen one akuma battle, you've seen them all. \\n\\n\r\nNow and then we get an itsy bitsy tidbit that's actually related to the plot.  But they're so few an far between that when they do come I don't notice right away because I'm half-asleep.  And as far as I've seen, I'm not really sure what the plot is anymore.  There just isn't much \"meat.\"  The series has settled into a pattern of \"go to new town; meet akuma; fight akuma: repeat.\"  I suppose that's fine if you're watching it one episode per week, like when it was originally aired.  That would be easier to handle.  You'd get your akuma battle-of-the-week.  But watching it off DVD when you'd like to see 3-6 episodes at a time, it gets pretty tedious.\\n\\n\r\nI'm wondering whether I should bother trying to finish this series.  I've seen over 40 episodes so far.  I like an anime/manga/book to have an underlying story or mystery, but not take forever to provide any clues about it.  If you don't care so much about story, and are happy with good animation, characters, and your regular battle of good vs. evil, you'll probably be fine with it.",

To be honest I even liked the fillers in this series, actually not knowing they were fillers because I read the manga after I saw the anime (and desperately wanted to know what happens next).\r\nThe story is a bit stereotype, at least the main plot, but there are so many wonderful stories and moments it makes it very unique. \r\nI can't say a single bad thing about the animation. Of course it's not that great as manga, butthey still did a great job with reproducing the amazing manga-ka's style.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is probably the worst part of this anime, but still good. It's a bit plain and sometimes even boring, but you got attracted to the plot anyways, so you don't have much time to listen to it. XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are just the best. I love the fact we don't know much about them, yet we have to love them. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get discouraged by the lenght of this series, it's definetely worth your time, especially if you like typical shounen genre with something original to it!",

            "content": "Story - 5\r\nThe story was bad to say the least. It was badly paced as  most of the time your stuck to seeing something between shonen- anime glued together with a lot of dramatism. And that means that action fight's are predictable and almost seem pointless and the Allen or Lenalle or other guys from the Order cry after almost every fight about something.  The story had so much plot-holes that there were more holes then the plot. Also on the end all you get is about the same were this anime started. The last episode everyone is still fighting akuma's and morethen 100 episodes passed away already.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nIt was very good. Nowhere in this anime you can see bad animation and it was 103 episodes long. That's a lot of episodes! Off course it wasn't anything ground braking and akuma's could of been made more creepier.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nIt was awesome. All the time I liked the sound in the anime soundtracks. Specially when Allen played piano. Only reason I didn't give it 10 was, because  few openings could of been a bit more better. Almost all of the openings were top notch, but none of them were something that I would like to listen.\\n\r\nCharacter- 7\\n\r\nThe good guys were decent characters.The main protagonist Allen was an interesting character, but he lacked the brains or the attitude to be a real protagonist. Allen is basically a good guy and nothing more. The protagonist might as well be Lavi or The Krory( The vampire dude).  Well at least the good guys had some good character development, but because of the bad story the character development was really hard to see. The villains were just pointless. There goal was pointless and even 3 year old kids have better goals to accomplish. For example, Earl's goal was to destroy the world. And what will happen to him? Who the hell would want to destroy something his life depends on? Makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 6\\n\r\nI kinda enjoyed this anime with a big minus. I liked to watch some of the fights in D. Gray-man, like Krory against Lavi and Allen. Though most of the time the fights were one-sided like Allen killing lvl 1 akuma's. The comedy in here was like: Should I be laughing or not? So I didn't crack any laugh at all. Well at least I liked to listen to the music. But once I remember how long this anime was I feel like I wasted too much of my time for almost nothing. I will never rewatch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6\\n\r\nThe story is rubbish. For 103 episodes it went nowhere and the last episode just ended with a cliffhanger. Character's are decent. The art and music is quality stuff, but nothing ground-braking.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really have nothing to do then go watch D. Gray-man.  At the start you will like it , then you will get bored of it somewhere in the middle, then close to the end you will start to like it again and you will want to know what will happen next and at the end you will just get a wtf moment that will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and a lot of wasted time.",

            "content": "Themes surrounding exorcists and demons have been treated in previously in other works, and D.Gray-man revolves around such topic. What makes this anime different, is that it takes the liberty to slightly adjust such theme to match the setting, and also make an arguably more intriguing story. With the recent announcement of the upcoming sequel of D.Gray-man, people may wonder whether this battle sh\u014dnen is worth their time, and in this case it is, but only to a certain extent, as several crucial elements of a battle sh\u014dnen were executed in a lackluster manner. Not to mention the presence of some very lackluster characters.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe storyof D.Gray-man revolves around Allen Walker a young boy who enlists in the organization of Exorcists with the purpose of eliminating the akuma that roam the world with the \"Innocence\" - a gift, a weapon bestowed to serve the apostles of God, the exorcists. The akuma are in fact mechanical weapons made by suffering living souls, as opposed to the regular definition of the term; these are controlled by the antagonist, the Millenium Earl, a twisted and dark \"joker\" or \"clown\" if you may. It is the task of this organization to abolish and vanquish the Earl, the source of evil.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is a very standard premise, as mentioned earlier, what makes this anime differentiate itself from other similar titles, is the approach on its theme: it is dark and cruel, which was is the first thing that will be noticed when viewing the anime, which isn't frequent in the genre. It gives insight in the working of despair, loneliness, longing and death in numerous occasions when the protagonist seek to quench the attack of these akuma. The side stories provided for numerous situations can be interesting and dramatic as well. Comedy is also present in the anime, which can be at times funny, yet ultimately was overused as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime even more interesting is its setting: it takes place in the 19th century, a good and welcoming Victorian/gothic feel, mixed with some futuristic elements, which was achieved by the studio. Furthermore, this enhances the credibility of the situation of humanity currently is in, through the lack of fast communication present currently in ours society, which in turn enables the occurrence isolated and unknown cases where attacks occur. In addition it makes the viewer appreciate the difficulties the people faced in that era. As for the pacing, this was overall a bit lacking at times, where in several instances actions lasted longer than necessary, or either were beating around the bush. It must be mentioned that the first batch of episodes (around 30) are of episodic nature with some small arcs, following a very similar structure, whilst introducing the characters. From there on actual story takes place, which is in turn more intriguing and gripping.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where the anime fails in several occasions are the battle scenes and the \"powerups\". First of all, each exorcist has a unique \"innocence\" power, which gives diversity to the show. What is a shame is that the majority of the battle sequences are executed in the same manner, and very repetitive, which renders the diversity of the skills a bit pointless, as these are in majority of the cases confined to 2 or 3 action. Other huge issue are the \"powerlevels\" in this anime, these are very irregular and change whenever the plot demands it. When actual powerups take place, which for the matter are not earned through training or the likes, these seem totally pointless as secondary characters who didn't undergo such changes have the same powers; it doesn't give any real feeling of progression.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of D.Gray-man are rather lackluster in general, who stay in the majority of cases one or two-dimensional, or in even some cases devolve; however, the author managed to make these characters somewhat interesting through their pasts. On the side of the organization there is Allen Walker, the main character who is the typical shonen character who is very caring and values friendship above everything else. On the flip side, as a character he is likable as the aforementioned attribute isn't overused; furthermore, his past is something that certainly will keep viewers intrigued throughout its duration. Some character development takes place, yet this is hardly noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Lenalee, easily the worst character in the show: at first she seems to be a somewhat mysterious person, with a dark past. However, her character seem to change over the course, the author seemingly not very sure what to use her for, consequently several times her actions being incomprehensible. What is worse, she ultimately devolves to being a simple damsel in distress, which was a huge drawback. Other character of interest is Kanda, who as opposed as Allen, doesn't care about the others, which nicely contrasts in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the antagonists, these are typical as well, yet the most intriguing by far is the Millenium Earl himself, as audiences are intrigued on what his ultimate motives are for creating the akuma. He appears to be a comical character, yet dead serious when necessary, which can be a drawback for some, as it makes to difficult to take him seriously, with no motives apparent. Concerning the supporting cast of characters, these are for the most part uninteresting, on both sides, being either one-dimensional characters, or too mysterious to care about these. I might want to add that the akuma are not always simple evil beings; in several occassions it is shown that these can have a will of their own.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime was well done, having its share of detailed and varied backgrounds, which enhaced the overall viewing experience; this can't be really said of the protagonists, as these are generic, as opposed to some of the akuma designs, and naturally, the main villain himself. The animation quality was overall good, yet as the fights were repetitive and basic, it never could shine. It must be said that some actions scenes were very well executed, alongside a matching choreography.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of D.Gray-man is certainly well done, befitting of the atmosphere, yet ultimately forgettable. The voice actors performed their role well, especially in the case of some of the secondary characters, which helped to the intrigue of said people. As for the openings and endings, these are of very high quality with praiseworthy music pieces that certainly helped to peak the interest in audiences.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nD.Gray-man was overall a fine anime, yet never really shined due to the above mentioned issues: it failed in some crucial aspects of the genre itself, in addition to a weak cast of characters, although some were interesting, in addition to some of the antagonists. Despite all these flaws, I can't deny that I actually enjoyed the unknowing mysteries surrounding the world and the approach on its themes. A lot of things remain unknown in the anime, and thus I hope these are revealed in the sequel. So do I recommend this anime? Only to those who enjoy watching battle shounens really.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

It isn't an exercise in logic or anything serious.  However when it becomes that everything affronts your sensibilities, it's time to turn it off.  This anime was beyond frustrating, very unenjoyable.  I've been frustrated at animes like Bleach, Naruto, Hunter x Hunter, but nothing this awful.\r\nFirst, I didn't read the manga, maybe that is where it all went wrong.  It starts out by throwing you into a world that is far fetched, with unrealistic physicsand what not.  To be expected.  The art is above average, the music was mediocre and forgettable.  The main character is weak, without any distinguishable personality traits other than his clothing.  There isn't any supporting characters that are worthy of note and it's as if the writers expect you to have logged in hours of previous anime viewing to understand things.\\n\\n\r\nI only made it to episode 12, it was very difficult.  There is so so many questions and holes, and not the good kind that you want to find out, it's the bad kind that you just wish wouldn't linger like a shot of cheap whiskey.  I understand it's shonen, but seriously, does the main character have to be a scrawny do-gooder with a twisted morality?  After 12 eps, it left nothing to be desired.  The villians were obnoxious and petty.  It was throw up juice for the mind.\\n\\n\r\nI stopped it at exactly the part where the main character was given a chance to kill off a \"bad guy,\" she says something like, \"I know you won't shoot me.\"  How does she know this?  Because she has profiled him as a typical shonen anime character.  Please show me something that makes me want to watch the next episode.  Nothing.  Stay away from this.  Far away.",

            "content": "D.Gray-man is a shounen/action/adventure anime. It aplies the typical formula: long episode range with 19-20 minute animation, practically endless storyline and a main lead that predominates over all. It plays a lot with religion, this is what actually makes it really interesting.\r\nLike in almost all shounen animes the first episodes seem to be interesting. This is because you don't know anything about the world in which the events are going to take place or about the protagonists of this story. So meet Allen Walker, a 15 year old boy who has the power to see Akumas (means demons, mechanical killing machines is the term apliedin this anime ) and haves an anti-Akuma weapon to free the souls that hold them. This weapon works powered by \"Innocence\", a misterious susbstance that haves a cubic form, it was supposedly created by God. Only those compatible with it can use it, can become \"Exorcists\" and join the Black Order to fight the Millenary Count, who is destined to destroy the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot develops in a 19th century, mostly, european demography. Of course you get to see some regions of Asia as well, but the settings are usually european. Past the first 10-15 episodes probably most people who aren't used to watch shounen-type animes will easily get bored. D.Gray-man haves a \"Inuyasha-10000+Pearl fragments\" feeling, but it does not develop that slowly. There are 140+ Innocence pieces to be found... well actually no. Some of them are already in posession of the Black Order and the events focuss troughout the first 40-45 episodes on only this objective, but then it drastically changes.\\n\\n\r\nFrom episode 50 the ambience changes will be totally obvious: the objetives will change, the battles will get more ferocious and the story will truly advance. D.Gray-man is as average anime up to espisode 50, then it touches the realm of a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically speaking I would define D.Gray-man as varied. You'll see lots of characters: enemies and companions. If I take the Akumas as an example the artistic design is poor on episodes 1-20, these are level 1 Akumas. Then the Akumas evolve into levels, now here you can see what I'm talking about: variety and creativity. As the anime develops you'll witness more crazy and unthinkable tranformations and evolutions. The protagonists are very well designed, the weapons of each one of them somehow reflects their own and unique personality. The fighting scenaries are beautiful and the \"bosses\" are more than fearsome, in a funny way.\\n\\n\r\nUVERworld, Abingdon Boys School and Sowelu are just some of the artists you'll come across on the opening and ending scenes. This translates into a amazing sound experience that will glue you to the anime fron the opening to ending sequences. The BGM's are well executed in the anime an add more suspense, spice up the action and ultimately transform good fights into epic confrontations. Definitely one of the strongest points D.Gray-man achieves.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are typical shounen-based. You have the strong-willed never-surrender-even-if-I'm-almost-dead Allen Walker (main lead). His female companion and most probable romantic parther Lenalee. The \"rival\" character: Kanda Yui. And other companions that will be added to the \"party\" as the storyline progresses. One thing I didn't like was the lack of airtime that some of the most interesting characters have (generals). You get glances of them at some point in the anime but they do not appear as part of the plot until later on and for such a short amount of time that it really feels like a waste once you get to finally see them on action. Also you don't get almost any character development troughout the first half of the anime; here episode 50+ becomes again a turning point in which characters develop at a very good speed in a 40-50 episode range. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I was about to drop the anime at episode 20. My friend told me \"to keep on going, you won't regret it once you get to episode 50\". Surely I didn't. The twists in the story started here, continued until the end and made D.Gray-man really worth my time. Anyone should watch this, it isn't your average shounen anime, you'll understand why once you dig into it. \\n\\n\r\nThe end is actually inconclusive so I guess the studio might be making another anime (second season?) to continuate this one, due to the great popularity this and the manga have. I really hope so because there are still many things that need to be explained and I just can't wait for that moment.",

            "content": "\"Akuma: monsters born from dead souls mistakenly recalled by their loved ones to the living world.\"\r\n\"Exorcists: those who aim to destroy akuma and retrieve the Innocence scattered around the world.\"\r\nSo. At first look D.Gray-man may seem like a typical shonen anime. The main character is probably going to be a hot-head who wants to get stronger and stronger for a certain purpose... usually to protect his friends.\r\nBut.\r\nD.Gray-man is not like any shonen anime I've ever seen. In fact, it's got something much more than most.\r\n--STORY--\r\nYou may be thinking \"Hmm... a guy with a deformed arm... Full Metal Alchemist?\"\r\nWell, no, actually.\r\nD.Gray-man's plot may seem like it'sgoing on the same path as FMA at first, but it transforms into something completely different.\\n\\n\r\nI love the plot. At first (since I don't normally watch horror anime) I thought it was a little creepy, but it was an addicting kind of creepy. I couldn't get enough of it.\\n\\n\r\nThough in the beginning I thought it was going to be typical shonen since there's talk about \"finding all of the Innocence\", I was a little skeptical about watching DGM.\\n\r\nBut, after a while, that passed and it grew into something much more.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there's that issue of fillers. Darn fillers ruin a lot of anime sometimes, but I couldn't tell when there was a filler when I watching DGM. The fillers are actually good. Really.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil the series, but let's just say that once you start watching DGM, you'll never want to stop.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--ART--\\n\\n\r\nI loved the animation. At first, it starts off okay, but during the third and fourth season, it really kicks into gear.\\n\r\nThe characters match the manga really well, and stayed true to Hoshino-sama's character design.\\n\r\nThe lighting and scenery are utterly beautiful. There are too many beyond words places that this anime visits.\\n\\n\r\n--SOUND--\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good, but I found the background music boring at times. It's used over and over again--but the background music is still good.\\n\r\nThe OP's match the anime extremely well.\\n\r\nAt first when I heard the ED's, I really didn't like a lot of them. Listen to the ED's a couple of times, and you'll fall in love with them.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--CHARACTERS--\\n\r\nFirst of all, the main character,Allen Walker, is the exact opposite of most main shonen anime and manga characters. Allen Walker is the polite and klutzy type who just loves to eat, but there's much more to him than meets the eye, just as there is with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course you have to have the comic relief, Lavi, who can still fight.\\n\r\nYou have a guy who just seems to make you laugh every time you seem him, Yu Kanda.\\n\r\nYou have a girl who can kick some serious butt, Lenalee.\\n\r\nYou have a really... weird but cool adult figure, Komui.\\n\r\nAnd, of course, there's kick-ass villains who you just want to love--but you have to keep reminding yourself that they are evil, and WILL kill your favorite main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI found it extremely hard to NOT hate any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd... there was something else that caught my eye about these characters.\\n\r\nThey seemed REAL.\\n\r\nThis anime focuses on the characters more than the plot, even though the plot is almost as interesting as the characters.\\n\\n\r\n--OVERALL--\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime.\\n\r\nI think that every anime or manga fan should watch/read DGM.\\n\\n\r\nIt's my favorite anime--and D.Gray-man always makes me sit on the edge of my seat, tear up, and put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that D.Gray-man does the same to you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: This review has been completely changed and thought over.\r\nTo be honest, I was extremely iffy to watch D. Gray-Man. I mean, a series over 100 episodes screams out filler and something more mainstream like Naruto or Bleach. I began to watch it because I already had it and the holidays had come by. With nothing else to do, D. Gray-Man was the better option out of the rest of my anime storage.\r\nThis anime is really quite a typical shounen with action, a set enemy and a love interest. It goes more into the dramatic side though. Of course, D. Gray-Man follows the exorcist AllenWalker. It depicts his time at the Dark Order. DGM shows struggles within one's self and such. Once you get to about episode 40+ you are thrown onto a roller coaster of emotional struggle. It's really good, it gets to ya sometimes but it's not a tear jerker. It just makes you feel for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the main plot of the story. The idea is great but it's been seen before, most obvious example being FMA. It's the directing that let's DGM down at times. Some points in the plot is plain boring itself, it's nothing you haven't seen before really. The pacing is inconsistent and it bugged me. You get really tedious 4-5 episode long arcs at the start which are somewhat important to introduce characters and the idea of Innocence to the audience. It just could've been handled better and without the 2-3 episodes to get to the main point. \\n\\n\r\nAfter you're introduced with everything, nothing big happens until about episodes late 30's early 40's. Feel free to skip anything you deem filler and come back to it later. It's what I did and if you come to be obsessed with the characters in the end like I was, you'd be glad for them fillers you get to watch once you actually do have some sort of appreciation towards the characters. I skipped about 10 episodes, majority were filler and the rest were part of the actual plot. Even the original storyline can get boring as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt wasn't anything major. It was nice but it definitely wasn't something with a high budget. Only major characters were given a decent amount of detail, but at least the animation was smooth. I was also quite surprised with a scene near the end of the series, which I thought had quite a bit of effort put into it. If the scene was handed down to another anime, I fear that the detail would disappear as it's not something I see producers really caring about. So props to the producers for that. It's not shiny and wow looking, it's just a scene that felt realistic is all.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't take note of the BGM. BGM normally doesn't appeal to me unless it's really good. DGM didn't hit that really good standard. OP and ED's were quite normal for me. Catchy, but not something that was really really good. The voice acting I liked. I thought Allen had a too high pitched of a voice at first but it grew on me and is very suitable for him. Everything was up to normal standards and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have a thing for characters so this area usually gets a higher mark then the other categories. You get a range in characters and a few main cast ones but I only felt that Allen was the only one given any character development. Yes we find out Lavi's and Lenalee's past a little but it never really stood out. It felt like something thought up to fill in that curious gap, though it wasn't satisfying. That is why I find the characters bland when I seriously think about them. But if you think of them based on enjoyment then yes that would be quite high. The characters are fun to watch, it makes you happy to see them being well, happy with each other. The Noah are great. They're evil yet human at the same time and it's just so fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, DGM is definitely not a technically good anime. It more bases on its fandom and enjoyment rate for its success, like the mainstream anime. DGM is a little deeper then that though. It's better then mainstream but not good enough. This is really something to watch when you have the time and are bored. It's agonising just look at how many episodes there are. Just skip to about 40 once you watch maybe the first 20 and it should be more bearable. Don't expect something that is breath taking, expect something simply fun and addictive, like how Kuroshitsuji is. Both are dark but it's mainly the fandom which makes them awesome. \\n\\n",

The anime is quite similar to his works. The dark, gothic, and edgy. \r\nEven though the story is typical shounen anime, it&rsquo;s fun to watch the whole drawing things. Black, white, and grey are the main color use in the anime, but doesn&rsquo;t make the artwork dull, instead it makes the late 19th century setting to be stronger. \r\nThe main antagonist, Earl of the Millennium looks non-threatening at all. With his massive grinand high top hat, he very much like Joker from Batman, or Oogie Boogey man from Nightmare Before Christmas. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I&rsquo;m not up to date with this series, but I love it a lot. It got good storyline, great weapons and fights, adequate humor, good plot and twist.\\n",

            "content": "D.Gray-man is one of those \"hit or miss\" shows, for me it was a bit of a miss, but some hits.\r\nStory - 7.4/10 (C)\r\nThe tale begins with the introduction of Allen Walker, a young man with a strange power to send demons packing. His adventures in the Black Order, his encounters with many different types of Akuma, and his relationships with his fellow Exorcists are shown.\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nThe beginning felt a tad awkward, it was a little on the comedy side (When Allen goes to the Black Order), and for a show like D.Gray-man, it didn't really fit. It took me a few episodes (and some motivation)to get me into it. It was a moderate experience, some good turns, some bad ones. I liked how the filler episodes (yes, there were filler) didn't feel like filler, but more of a depth in character views (Ex. Lenalee, Allen, Miranda). Then there were a couple of &quot;Naruto&quot;-long fights, that really didn't have to be that long. Overall, it was a pleasant ride.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7.0/10 (C-)\\n\r\nThe animation was far from what we see today, but it doesn't mean that it was THAT bad. The OP sequences were great, however the ED sequences were just a bunch of pictures moving in cool angles. The fights were a mixture of both good and bad. But for the most part, the animation doesn't really change.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.5/10 (C)\\n\r\nThe OP/ED themes were really a great step-up than most animes, and i really enjoyed some of the lighter, lax music it had. The trouble of it was, sometimes it got to lax that it started to get boring fast. Mainly, the rest was just a mix of great tracks (Lala's Lullaby from one of the earlier episodes was a great, moving song) to plain tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.4/10 (B)\\n\r\nI can honestly say, none of the D.Gray-man characters will disappoint you. We have the polite and respectful Allen, the protective and light-hearted Lenalee, the mysterious and sometimes shady Kanda, the cheery, upbeat Exorcist Lavi, and the pessimistic time-user Miranda. Each character will leave you feeling the same way they do, and each character brings a uniqueness that leaves you wondering how it can be done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7.3/10 (C)\\n\r\nFor the most part (and that same phrase you keep reading in this review), it's a mixture of some good elements and some bad ones. I really enjoyed the light-hearted actions and the teary-eyed moments of the first season, the second season got more intense with the arrival of the Noah Clan, and the rest is ok. The animation needed a good tune-up though, and some better choices of BGM.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.5/10 (C)\\n\r\nThe Good:Great character backgrounds, interesting way of presenting each episode, the filler episodes make you feel like it's not filler\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\nLackluster animation, combined with lackluster BGM made the show more towards a &quot;good&quot; rating. Some episodes left you scratching your head more than others.",

            "content": "This is probably the most underrated show of all time. It's very unique when compared to other shounen anime, too.\r\nYou will notice how great, unique and advanced the story is as you progress. At the same time, it succeeds to keep the storyline simple and clean; Innocence and exorcists good, Akuma and Millenium Earl bad, The Heart big important, whoever finds The Heart achieves victory royale. After ridicule events that may occur in this absurd story, there're no plot holes formed and loose ends are ALWAYS tied up. In addition, there're no forced power-ups or friendship power assemblies to do the impossible. In fact, therehave been many times where I thought to myself \"crap, there's no way these guys make it out\". When Allen hits the ground, he hits it HARD. Combined with his selflessness, DGM gives a chance for side characters to prove themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development? Mmm, tasty! In over 100 episodes, there's always time to explore characters and their past, even ones with minor impact on the plot. Although it's a tad disappointing how Allen remains mysterious even after his past got slightly unveiled, it makes me glad that it wasn't disclosed in depth. You'll understand what I said when you watch DGM Hallow or read the manga afterwards. It's also worth mentioning that the antagonists are so well written that you might end up sympathizing them, which is the case with most of the DGM fans. In fact, you might begin to question who the righteous side is. Perhaps Allen will join the Noah someday? One can hope.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, for a shounen there're lots of sad episoded which will evoke your feels (also see episodes 4&5), followed by sorrowful soundtracks (also see Saikai OST and episodes 4&5 again). I'm a strong guy but damn, this anime drowned me in tears. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime has great story, characters, soundtrack, and can be tearful sometimes *whip*, but everything is followed by great humor, so you will most likely not get bored. I stayed along the journey only because the story was thrilling. Like in Neon Genesis Evangelion, so little was covered so there was always a feel of hype and excitement. I believe DGM is unlike your regular shounen anime, you should definitely give it a shot!",

            "content": "To everyone thinking \"Oh, joy. Another cliche shonen anime!\", you'll be surprised how different and fresh D.Gray-Man is from most other anime. OK, it starts off slow and has a sort of simple, definitely cliche plotline at the beginning. It seems really boring with simple and boring characters, right? Wrong.\r\nDGM (aka D.Gray-Man. I'll use this from now on - easier to type up) is definitely a more character-driven anime, instead of the usual plot-driven ones. The characters are all real and tangible; they have emotions and they show them. Each of them have different backstories, which are revealed as the story progresses and each ofthem faces different enemies and situations. Each of them has different abilities that they show as the danger increases and they all play unique and vital roles in the story. But wait, I'm jumping a bit ahead of myself. That's all in the second half of DGM; the first half is simply an introduction to their world, powers and enemies. The story arcs are very short; around 4 episodes max and quite decent. But after the 50th episode mark, DGM shows its true colours. The detailed introduction of the creator of the Akuma and his \"family\" really kicks off the story and raises the bar for everything to come.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as I've said, is more character-based, and is one of DGM's stronger points. It's unique and interesting, but the earlier episodes don't really compare story-wise to the later episodes; all hell breaks loose and it kicks into overdrive after episode 50 or so. Also, whilst watching DGM for the first time, I had no idea most of the episodes I was watching in the first half were fillers; the story arcs are so short they seem to be part of the story and just slot in with the more crucial episodes that introduce important characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation quality are top-notch. The special effects and art styles are quite something, and the character models and backgrounds are superb. There's a lot of detail for those who care to look, and there's nothing really I have to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound now. The sound's... well, decent. The openings and endings are excellent, but the background music doesn't really do much for the anime. To be honest, I just sort of blanked out the background music and when I saw a soundtrack for DGM in the shops, I thought \"D.Gray-Man had background music?\" Japanese voice acting is excellent. English? Not so much. Definitely watch in Japanese with subs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in DGM are by far its strongest aspect. They develop and mature as the series goes along, and they have real emotions, emotions which they have to accept and overcome. They aren't afraid to show their emotions, not afraid to cry or laugh, and they do so regularly. It's quite astounding how Katsura Hoshino has managed to make convincing characters and then throw them into different situations, showing them reacting accordingly without the slightest hint of forcing them to, or pushing the story along.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, I think D.Gray-Man mixes a cliche shonen storyline, convincing characters and a beautiful art style to create something completely fresh and unique. Definitely give it a try, no matter what. And if you don't like it, watch on anyway; it gets much better the further along you watch.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback much appreciated ;)",

I happen to be a huge fan of the manga; the art style has always impressed me, the pacing is just right, the humor is done well, and the characters are so well developed and interested. 10/10 in every category.\r\nThe anime has none of that.\r\nThe animation is lackluster, the filler plots are long, abundant, and dull, and the characters are simplified and just not done well at all (it's difficult to explain, but the depth and fullness of the characters just do not comethrough like they do in the manga).\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality would have to be the opening themes, and even that is a bit of a stretch (although this probably depends more on one's personal preference).\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, if you've never seen the series, go read the manga instead. If you've already read the manga and are looking for more, forget about this. If you've already watched the anime but have never read the manga, I highly implore you to go read the manga right now and compare.",

And im gonna start about what's wrong-ish about this anime >.>\r\nFirst of all, hmm... well, the Earl of Millennium is really not my favorite of villains. He looks too weird, and not-so-sinister, despite his evil laugh.\r\nAnother thing is that I think all of the Akuma are like weird emancipated bad guys, who, like their Lord, aren't so sinister looking after all. They just look weird.. >.> But.. i guess there's nothing i can do about that. Character design wasn't up to me lol\r\nALSO, meh... although Allan Walker looks really cute with his ash blond hair andboy-ish voice, his arm kinda looks weird to me o_O\\n\\n\r\nPlease tell me how many times I've used the word WEIRD already haha.\\n\\n\r\nBut okay, I have to admit that this series does have some good points. When I watched episode 5 and saw his arm [not spoiler]do really kool stuff[/not spoiler]  it pretty much put some punch into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI also like the character what's-his-face... you know? The aloof, quiet samurai type.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, the opening song by Abingdon Boys School (ah, loooooove them ^.^) is a definite plus.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think this series is still worth watching. And there are a lot of D-gray Man episodes out there that i have to download still.\\n\\n\r\nDefinite plus? ..... It's definitely something different. And at least I have something to watch while waiting for the next Bleach ^.^",

            "content": "Hoshino Katsura has created an interesting beast in D.Gray-man. It has a definite whiff of the standard shonen about it, but there's so much unique about the anime that it's easy to forgive that.\r\nFor one thing, the stylistic theme of the whole affair can only be described as \"surreal\". An interesting mixture of clown motifs and religious themes sets this anime immediately apart. The primary villain manages to be simultaneously comically ridiculous, incredibly sinister, and utterly evil, whilst the main supporting villains manage to be extremely likeable characters with a very human side, even whilst doing their master's undeniably evil bidding. The more generic enemies\u2013 the Akuma \u2013 are consistently creepy enough to maintain interest. I mean seriously. Creepy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and their abilities are also very well-executed. Unusually for a shonen, the main character is actually both interesting and likeable enough to deserve all the focus he gets; indeed, I think one area this anime succeeds brilliantly in is balancing its cast of characters. One never feels like the cast is getting stale, but at the same time it never seems to grow too large; characters get pretty much exactly the volume of screentime they deserve, and the characters who receive the most focus are generally also the most likeable. I say this in direct contrast to anime such as Bleach and Naruto, which have a huge cast of secondary characters, many of them more likeable than the main characters, but they have a distinct tendency to fail to receive any development, or often even any screentime whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is somewhat episodic. It manages not to shy away from focus on the main villains from very early on, whilst at the same time maintaining a healthy air of mystery and distance about them. Overall, it avoids the classic shonen trap of feeling like just a sequence of battles; with one major exception, progression is generally more complicated than simply battling enemies. The shonen \"power curve\" of progressively stronger enemies as the protagonists' power increases is present, but never feels forced; \"evolution\" is treated as an important theme, and often used to draw uncomfortable parallels between the heroes and the villains. The author is also not afraid to give a fair amount of focus to the characters without special abilities. Comedy is present, but generally restricted to short, more light-hearted \"relief\" segments in between the main story arcs.\\n\\n\r\nBut where the series really shines is in its emotion and conflicts. Enemies are routinely treated as sympathetic in one way or another, and the protagonists' \"heroic\" organisation is itself by no means morally perfect. The war with the Akuma is presented as just that \u2013 a war, and generally a losing one, with all the tragedies and internal/moral conflicts that come with that. Whilst the series doesn't have a habit of killing off its central protagonists, tragedy and death are central, recurring themes from the very first chapter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find D.Gray-man a compelling and entertaining series that is well worth a read. \\n\r\n(The anime had a premature ending, therefore I would suggest continuing D.Gray-man on chapter 156)",

            "content": "I finally finished D.Gray Man, just in time for the summer release of it's sequel. Was it worth the time and effort to catch up? Well, I wouuuuuld like to tell you, but if I do that you won't read the review! \r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 5/10\r\nThe concept of D.Gray Man is definitely overdone. It was certainly more unique in it's time, but was still common, even then. Even if it hadn't been overdone so much, it still wouldn't have been too interesting. Humans versus monsters isn't really that captivating. However, one of the big pluses of DGM is that it is much darker than you would expect.There is a LOT of death involved with the series, and it deals with the concepts of pain, loss, and depression rather well. I'll talk about this more in characters. For the actual plot itself... well, for the first half, it's totally garbage. It just feels pointless, like the story was being prolonged just to make money. But it's not like you can skip it either, because as boring as it is, it's important for setting the framework for the second half. Once you can get past that, though, the second half of DGM gets much, MUCH better. The story takes off from mimi arcs to a massive war between the main characters and the main villains. There is tons of death and despair during this arcs, which is quite rare to see from a shonen. However even in these climactic moments, plot armor still exists, and you know none of the main characters will die. Also, it seems that no matter how hard DGM tries to be unique, it always returns to it's shonen roots, with every character screaming 'I FIGHT FOR MY FRIENDS' and things along those lines. That said, the climax was epic and gets your adrenaline running every time the protagonists have a comeback. If I were to judge this anime on the second half alone, it would get a much higher score, but I can't forget that atrocious first half.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor shonen standards, the quality put into DGM's art is outstanding. However in the anime medium as a whole, it isn't as impressive. You can clearly note the unneeded effort put into structures, and it was clear the show wanted to make itself look as dark as possible. But, in the animation department, it falls flat. The character movements can be weird at times, and the most important part of any shonen, the battles, are majorly affected by this. In the second half not as much, but definitely in the first place I laughed during some of the grim battles, just because of how pathetically childish the animation is. \\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest problem I have with shonen is the massive amount of theme songs that come along with them. DGM is not one of those shonen. Only one, or two if you want to stretch, of the endings are really 'good', but that still makes it above average from the everyday anime! And the openings... omg, the openings... openings 3 and 4 are fantastic to go along with the dramatic improvement, bur 1 and 2 are no joke either. The theme songs power is overlooked when it comes to the soundtrack though. Remember how I was saying that I laughed during some of the serious battles? Well this is another reason why. And the main one. I would go as far as to say the soundtrack actually ruined the entire show for me, until the second half, where a couple good tracks are added. It ruined the suspense sometimes though, which may be another reason why I cannot stand the first half. The power of the soundtracks is ALSO overlooked when it comes to the voice acting department. Some of the most famous seiyu of all time voice the main characters, and they live up to their reputation and do a fantastic job. Krory, in particular, has an extremely talented voice actor, to be able to pull off his creepy voice. The power of the voice acting though, is ALSO (you must be tired of me saying this by now) overlooked b the poor sound effects. They're very typical to a shonen, and are the third and final reason why I can't take the battles seriously. It can be summed up in one word, and that is fake explosion. The directors practically spammed it during fights against akuma.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow THIS is where DGM shines, right from the start. First off, the main characters. The designs are AWESOME! Not to mention unique. I bet if you were to look at Allen or Lavi, you wouldn't forget them for a while. Now I know I said 'right from the start', but that wasn't completely true. The characters are great to start with, but are even more amazing when they go through the pain and loss of a comrade. They all have their own unique way of reacting, and sometimes they feel so real, it's... well eerie! Out of the four lead characters, though, there is one person in particular who is outshined by the rest: Lenalee. Being the only female main character, Lenalee has the plainest design and motivation of the four. However. I believe that Lenalee has the most potential out of the four of them. I feel in the future if she were to undergo a serious loss, her change would be almost psychological... something I wholeheartedly have crossed my fingers for. The supporting characters, especially the villains, are also worth mention as they are also extremely unique and outclass the characters of your average shonen. However... their designs don't, and because of this I guarantee you'll be calling characters 'Lenalee's brother' instead of 'Komui'. This isn't a problem with the antagonists, but the helping main characters certainly suffer from it.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6.15/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, is DGM worth the watch? If it was just the second half I would say YES in all capitals, but no matter how hard I try, I can't forget the first half. In the end, my answer became no. DGM is better than average, but it's not worth watching 103 episodes. If it was shorter I would say give it a go, but because of it's length, I had to answer with no. For recommendations I point you towards Hunter x Hunter (2011) which also has it's weak points but overall is a far better example of a mature shonen, and Bleach, which is similar in the sense that supernatural beings also invade the human world with a group of people blessed with special powers to defend it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! Feedback is always appreciated. This has been thelectricow, and now I shall end this review faster than lighting!",

            "content": "\"My left I give you to the Demons. My right I give you to the humans. Both are a part of me. And equally important. So neither side be disappointed. Humans as well as Demons will be saved!\" - Allen Walker\r\nSince the Death Note, I have been very much a big fan of Shounen Jump anime. D.Gray Man is a decently done anime, which completely shows Jump's spirit. If you are into Shounen anime then I recommend you watch this.\r\nStory :- 7/10\r\nIt is a typical Jump anime which contains Demons who are the nemesis of the Exorcists,people chosen by the God to fight these demonsand defeat them so that the demon's soul could rest in peace. The story's protagonist is a 15 year old boy Allen Walker who becomes an Exorcist and starts working for an organization called The Order, made solely for extermination of an evil entity called Millennium Earl, who is supposedly the creator of these demons. Condition required to make these demons is the call from someone who really longs to see his/her fallen friend or family member or a person close to him/her. All in all it has a very intriguing plot similar to what you expect from the Jump.\\n\\n\r\nArt :- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing an action anime one must have a good art which is just the case for D.Gray Man, Hoshino Katsura did a very good job in this criterion, characters are flashy ;typical Jump show; and the background art also fits well with the scene.\\n\\n\r\nSound :- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOSTs of this anime rules!!! BGM is so good that sometimes during the battle you can just close your eyes in the middle of it and still know what is happening!!. Sound editing is perfectly done there isn't a recognizable flaw with its sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters being attractive and flashy is a very good point of Jump. You might even say that this very category is the selling point of a Jump series. Hoshino did make some good characters but in some cases he didn't do a very good job like ,for an instance, what he wanted to do was make a character Kanda Yu a badass character but he failed miserably and made him into one of the most despicable protagonists of the series(Could just be my perspective though).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt has been a very joyous ride. It has some ups and downs but it is a kind of series that most people are comfy with, you simply just can't hate the series. Jokes and comedy skits are kinda lame though, just beware comedy is too little in this series(most people will agree with me on this).\\n\\n\r\nOverall :- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again I would say that, people who find Jump series like Naruto, Bleach, One Piece etc etc intersting  gotta give it a shot. In conclusion, it is a very sweet series which provides you with all kinds of feelings that you might have lost while watching too many harems, lol. * It kinda promoted theism too, which in my case was a little melancholic; Don't judge me on this kay?? *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A nice entertaining Shounen series with good, easy on the eye animation. I would recommend only watching manga based episodes as the fillers nearly put me off at episode 17 or thereabouts. \r\nThe plot is nothing unexpected, with the usual battling against evil theme. Animation benefits from some unusual images, for example the villain looks like a very harmless clown and has a lair like an oversized nursery, but is nevertheless very creepy indeed. \r\nThe only point that really annoys me is the amount of soppy dialogue in this anime whenever something that even slightly resembles moral dilemma comes into play. It really just goeson and on. I get the sense even the script writers are embarrassed by this as they have a tendency to spoil the atmosphere with what feels like to me inappropriate moments of comedy. This could just be a case of lost in translation of course.\\n\\n\r\nOverall good middle-of-the road action type anime without excessive demand for brain engagement, it's serving me well as a nice break between bouts of revision.",

            "content": "Ok if I sound biased I don't mean to be but I am reviewing my favorite anime of all time here. So first off is that if you plan to watch the DGM series do not under any circumstances watch the English version. It will kill you. The voices picked for the English version were poorly done. Only Komui's fit him and that was about it. Aside from that the beginning is a little I don't how you would say it but slow and how my sister would put it 'stupid'. Which after watching it for a second time I would have to agree. Butonce you get used to some of the characters flaws and randomness you can really start to enjoy the show. \\n\\n\r\nA friend of mine tried watching it and could barely get past the first episode because of how she didn't like the akuma and how they acted all robotic. Well trust me and this might be a bit of a spoiler or a goal setter but they don't stay that way after a while. Latter on you start to see that they have personality's. Some funny, weird, and just plan creeper status. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters might annoy you but you might as well suck it up and look at the other better aspects of the show. I know I am sad/depressed and many others as well that the series was discontinued. But not the manga. The manga has gone so far and is still going. Even the plot is hinting/turning more towards a shonen ai type of thyme. I won't tell which characters. That you will have to decided on you're own from watching it. But be warned there is character death and near character death all along the plot. \\n\\n\r\nMost of it will make you want to cry for all you sensitive types out there like me who can get caught up in an anime so much that they start screaming and shouting at the computer and have your family members look at you like you're crazy. \\n\\n\r\nNow as far as the audio goes its very good in my opinion. The openings and endings tend to go right with the story line and can be very catchy but the background music during most of the series tends to be forgotten. Even by me. But the great thing is the fillers. Now I hardly noticed the fillers but there is a lot of them if you look closely. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the characters. Now I think that the diversity of the characters was amazing. They even had people of different nationalities like Japanese, British, American, and Chinese mixed around. Even in the anime the characters do not think that they have to get stronger to defeat someone. Most of them have their doubts and have to face their feelings like real people and then they gradually get stronger through struggles and not like in other shows they just magically get stronger all of a sudden and not through deep emotional driven strife. You can then tell the plot goes more by the characters feelings and emotions. Almost like watching a child grow. You never really know how they will turn out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the lest thing. Now they have great detail in everything they do and I have yet to catch any stupid mistakes like I have caught in other anime's where they forget something in the background or the character. Along with the art they make all of their weapons connected to them in some sort of way to their personal lives and pasts. Along with that, their is no crazy art or jumpy parts where you have to pause the anime to tell what it is. Usually if i have to do that with an anime to much then I stop watching it.",

            "content": "~Story~\r\nWhen I first started watching the show, I was relatively new to anime and so I believed the plot - an organization of people who use holy weapons of sorts to defeat humans-turned-demons - to be unique in nearly every way, but now I realize that the story isn't that special as far as anime goes. However, with the Noah, I feel that the story was a little more interesting and original. My rating for the story? 7/10\r\n~Art~\r\nThe artwork in D. Gray-man is very good, there is a lot of detail in clothing, weapons, background and scenery. Each character has a different look, which makesit easy to tell them apart. The battle scenes weren't choppy and were easy to follow in my opinion. 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\nThe opening themes were great, I enjoyed listening to most of them (except maybe the last one). I disliked the ending themes in general. The background track was pretty good, nothing overly special, and I'd say it did a good job of setting up the mood for each scene. The voices of the characters - in both English and Japanese - were amazing; I felt that the voice actors/actresses did fantastic jobs on portraying their characters. The only thing I didn't really like was how high Allen's voice was in both, and how low Kanda's was in the English. 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~Character~\\n\r\nI am actually disappointed in the character portion of D. Gray-man. Each character had their own personality, but while some characters - such as Allen Walker, Lavi, Krory - had well developed backstories and whose thoughts and actions were shown and explained, most were lacking. Kanda Yu, for instance, is a hugely important character in the manga, and they just start to brush on it in the anime, which I found disappointing. I also wish that they had gone more in-depth with the Noah. And then they did that super evil, satanic thing (minor spoiler alert, but no names are mentioned) where they give a character an entire episode about their backstory so you get attached to that character, before killing them off two episodes later... Anyway, I give characters 6/10.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\nI enjoyed D. Gray-man very much. It stayed \"on task\" through out the show, with very few fillers, which is always a plus (especially if you're like me, who feels the need to watch every episode in order and refuses to skip fillers *cough* the reason I dropped Bleach *cough!*). D. Gray-man was the first anime show that I enjoyed enough to continue to watch it after they had stopped the dubs. I was only disappointed with the ending, which simply seemed cut off abruptly. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Overall Score~\\n\r\n8/10.",

            "content": "I started watching this anime because one of my favorite Japanese bands' song was used here. At first, I thought it was mediocre--the art was good, the main characters had nice outfits, a good typical shounen anime...etc. But later, after the slow start, I started to like it more and more. Not only were the characters all developing, they had realistic power growths. Now, I consider this one of the best anime I have ever watched.\r\nThe characters were, by far, the best aspect of this anime. They were based on common anime sterotypes--the antisocial humbug (Kanda), the cheerful kid (Lavi), the nice girl everyone likes(Lenalee). However, they weren't just those sterotypes--they were deeper than that. Lavi had his angry moments, Lenalee had arguments, and good ol' Kanda actually showed concern, in his own way. The side characters (Krory, Miranda) also had good development; they even became important parts of this anime. Even the evil dudes (Tyki Mikk, Road Camelot) had shown emotion throughout the anime. All the characters, unlike many other anime, had complicated and human feelings.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I didn't like was the soundtrack. It wasn't memorable, I personally didn't like some of the songs--overall, I thought they could've done better. The abrupt ending was also a letdown--they should have continued it. Along with the slow start, many watchers might not like this because of that (However, the slow beginning did help me get to know the characters :D).\\n\\n\r\nThere were many other things I liked--the good mix of comedy and mystery, the setting, the plot. I would reccommend this to anyone looking for a good shounen anime. This certainly isn't your average shounen.\\n",

Well, I did some research and D.gray-man may very well stand for Dorian Grayman, the mythic man destined to walk the earth forever. Yes, this series has me that obsessed. D.gray-man did not make a epic first impression on me, but along the way I fell in love with the unconventionally dark and gothic plot line. Now, it's on my weekly viewing list.  I've always had a weird feeling the first episode was a filler. Now, Ican't watch a fight scene without cheering for &quot;yuu-chan&quot; and lip synching his lines during that epic fight scene. To be truthful, I actually saw the first episode, got bored, dropped the series. BUT later, I Flipped through the manga, got hooked, stayed up all night with a bottle of strawberry kool-aid and some aspirin. The third-fifth episode has the potential to make emo kids seem less emo. The first episode covers the life of a character you will never ever see again in the series- a female police officer. It gave you a brief and unsatisfying taste of the plot line. Okay, young boy named Allen Walker, a weapon on his arm, wants to protect everyone and save the world...exorcist...demon machines called akuma...etc. Just a shallow anime spawned from shonen jump franchise, right? WRONG! \\n\\n\r\nAfter Allen Walker, 15, British exorcist, martyr complex saves the first episode, we get an introduction to the cast. One female character is introduced (Lenalee) and makes the male fans wonder if there will be potential for romance. Kanda Yuu, another male exorcist get into a scrap with Allen Walker. Then comes Lavi Bookman, Miranda and Krory. Then, the story just gets deeper and you wonder if the pope will agree. Honestly, the concept of innocence &quot;god's crystal&quot; is introduced. The antagonists are introduced- according to the exorcist is the unltimate source of evil, but has a human side that is not so evil. It makes you wonder more about  life in general. Watching D.gray-man spent me more brain cells than trying to figure out Full Metal Alchemist's theory of equivalent exchange in terms of love. All the characters in D.gray-man are there for a reason, whether comic relief or advancing the plot. be prepared, you may fall in love with every one of them. All in all, the music used is nothing to scoff at. The voice actors and actresses fit their roles perfectly. &quot;Sweet&quot; Allen, &quot;Shy&quot; Lenalee, &quot;Ice Queen&quot; Kanda, &quot;Boyishly good looks&quot; Lavi all have wonderful seiyuus.  Oh, and the fillers are to some point, tolerable. Don't worry, they are like episode-30 to 40 something. And they are only there because the producer strayed away from the manga's path. (Unlike those horrible 200 Naruto fillers, I only  forgive because of shippuden.) If you don't like the anime, don't blame the series. The anime is never produced by the original author, always read the manga before judging the anime. In most cases, the original manga is the masterpiece and the anime is a spin-off the masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nD.gray-man is perfect for boys and girls alike, and the best part? Your little brother/sister won't get the plot= epic win. But don't just take my word for it, go read the manga and watch the anime yourself!",

            "content": "The D.Gray-man series has a very supernatural, and biblical themed background story that will certainly interest those of you wanting to get away from mecha, ninja, or other typical genres.  \r\nThe story is set in an industrial Western world with several countries in Europe and Asia featured, to the extent that you could draw a parallel between D Gray Man and Fullmetal Alchemist.  Allen Walker, the key character, is intent on becoming an \"Exorcist\" under an organization called the Black Order that combats the antagonist, the Millennium Earl, who's rotundity and nonchalance that I think at times does not appropriately suit the sinisterimage of the villain.  A good portion of the story revolves around the Black Order's missions to obtain the divine substance know as &quot;Innocence,&quot; which grants users power to combat the Akuma (&quot;devils&quot;), minions of the Millennium.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the Black Order, Allen meets the easy-going Lenalee, the hilarious commander Komui, the carefree Lavi, and the uptight Kanda.  In describing the characters, however, one-word adjectives simply does not suffice.  A strong point of this anime is the character development of Allen and several of the supporting cast, including the many characters that are introduced throughout the series.  \\n\\n\r\nYou will find a bit of unconventional biblical elements and old medieval folklore, an instance of which is one of the initial villains - the vampire Arystar, whose story is a bit unique and becomes a supporting character later in the series.  The story of Noah and the Arc is prominently featured, modified into the background of the antagonistic Noahs, elite servants of the Earl.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the music of D.Gray-man, the opening and ending themes were quite memorable and catchy.  Although many people were indifferent to the soundtrack, I personally thought it contributed greatly to the melancholy tone of the story that frequents the plot.  The stand-alone piano tracks were very beautiful, especially the &quot;14th's Song&quot; that was featured much later at a pivotal point in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final word, I reiterate that D.Gray-man may seem like your typical shounen anime, but provides quite a refreshing, supernatural story and setting.",

            "content": "Story - Tragic, sad, dark, horror anime not for the faint of heart.\r\nStory starts off with modern civilization (advanced technologies) destroyed by Earl. Then world repopulates and the story starts in the 19th century. \r\nThoughts - The fight between Earl and exorcists is a losing battle for humanity. Humans die like ants in the anime. \r\nEarl and Noah - unaging body jumpers that jump from one human body to another when the human body dies.\r\nThoughts - There isn't much that the exorcists can do, but kill them and hope the time taken to jump to another body is long enough to prevent further deaths. Inthe anime, there isn't any permanent way to kill them. Reminds me of the Valvrave the Liberator's Council of Magiuses. \\n\\n\r\nAllen Walker - Protagonist of anime who lost his memories. In memory of dead dog (Allen Walker), he adopted its name. \\n\r\nThoughts - Mysterious person with unknown background. Could he really be a friend or foe to the exorcists? \\n\\n\r\nEarl - The main villain\\n\r\nThoughts - Another person with mysterious origins. Those watching the anime should know who is his human host by the end of episode 103. \\n\\n\r\nAkumas - The evolving machine of the Earl, the soul regresses as akuma evolves. Infant grows up, the soul goes down. \\n\r\nThoughts - If there's an infant, there may be an adult. \\n\\n\r\nLenalee - Main female character \\n\r\nThoughts - Weird past/future dreams that Lenalee always has. Another person with a past (life) unknown identity. \\n\\n\r\nKanda (thoughts) - Character that hides his emotions well, kind at heart, loyal. Mugen never leaves his side. \\n\\n\r\nLavi - Bookman tasked with the role of recording history. Unknown as to what he was doing before joining the exorcists.\\n\r\nThoughts - Friendly, helpful, kind. Character that is opposite of Kanda and who enjoys teasing others. He lets emotions interfere with his work, due to his love for his friends. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting - Pretty good. I enjoyed listening to the japanese voices. Great job. There was so much emotion in their voices. The male and female singing versions of the 14th melody was great, especially considering that it was done by the same person - Allen, who was voiced by a female. Kind of wondering if there was a complete male version of the 14th melody?\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art was great. DGM and Valvrave both had awesome art.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - Did enjoy the music, mostly sad music to suit the theme of DGM.\\n\r\nThoughts - Lala's lullaby in DGM context, the person in the song actually seems to be Allen Walker.\\n\\n\r\nPacing - The pacing was better than other anime. Credits to the staff of DGM. The stories of the various exorcists were interesting and flashed out in depth as compared to the manga. The finders were pretty interesting with their different personalities, but I did not know what happened to some of them in later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - If anyone is looking for answers to DGM at the end of episode 103, I will suggest reading the manga. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Akuma are machines created by the Millenium Earl for destroying humanity.\r\nD.Gray-Man is, in my opinion, definitely worth watching. Although unfortunately the remaining episodes of 51 onwards have yet to be dubbed it is still fun to watch with good action and humor. The characters are great, each with their own personalities, so they are easy to get attached to. The storyline is interesting as well. There are a some episodes that weren't based on the manga but itis still worth watching and a good way to spend your time. Something i'd recommend for a good show.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of my top favorite animes and it will probably be right at the top forever. I started watching this in 2006 along side Naruto and Bleach, actually if I'm not mistaken I watched this before the other two.\r\nAt first I was a bit critic mostly to the way it felt like it only wasn't deep enough but that quickly changed.\r\nAs the story progressed it became darker and deeper but also more realistic because of it's well developed characters. My emotions towards the show became deeper and I started to really care about the characters and what happend around them.\r\nWhat blew me awaywas that it wasn't the typical \"one-hero-becomes-more-powerful-just-to-beet-an-even-more-powerful-enemy\", even tho the show has a main character it just didn't only focus on him. Instead you get to follow many other characters and how they evolve in a realistic way and I don't only talk about the \"good\" characters but you will also follow the \"bad\" characters and you will (against your will) start to like and feel for them too.\\n\r\nI think this is what makes D.Gray-man different from a lot of animes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is truly splendid, with beautifully drawn characters and backgrounds. The OPs and EDs are very enjoyable to watch not only for the soundtrack but also for it's interesting animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound through out the anime doesn't rly changes and doesn't really stick in your mind, that is if you don't count the OPs and EDs, which instead will always remind you of the show if you here them afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this is a very dark anime who touches you deep. What makes it so enjoyable, is to see that even tho the characters suffer and feel despair they still have hope and really fight for everything to become right in the world.\\n\r\nBut I must also say that it can get annoying through the end of the show because I as a viewer can't really understand how they shall be able to beet the \"evil\", and win.\\n\\n\r\nEven so I was very sad when the show ended and as with other animes that have ended before it really should I picked up the manga and continued reading instead. And even now, whenever I think about D.Gray-man, all the emotions for the characters appear again.\\n\\n",

Especially the last few arcs. They were filled with so much tension and action and complications! I was but a simple observer, watching in fascination as the events unravelled before my eyes. \r\nAs for the personalities of the characters - they mostlyleft a good impression, but some were just too cliche. I also found some resemlance between these characters and those participating in the Naruto Saga. That made them sort of predictable, but overall, the comic relief provided and the unique features in some of the main figures such as Lavi and Allen elevated the impression for the character developement as a whole to pretty high grounds.\\n\\n\r\nI had a great time following through with this anime to its very end and became a huge fan of the manga afterwards. I amd part of the optimistic group that still hopes to live to see the day when an anime sequel to the series shall be given breath!",

Gray-Man is the ultimate supernatural, dramatic, action-packed adventure you'll ever dare lay eyes on. \r\nStory:10\\n\r\nThe series takes place at the ending of the fictional 18th century, with an ongoing war between two forces. The Black Order verses The Millennium Earl and his army of akuma, or demons. Akuma are wepaons created by the darkness in human's hearts after they have suffered though the despair of losing their loved ones. The Earl takes advantage of this darkness in the heart and coaxes these people to call upon their lost loved one, believing that they will come back to life. Instead, the Earl traps the recalled soul into an everlasting prision inside the akuma and forces them to do his bidding. The first order the earl always gives to the akuma is to kill the one who called them back and to use their body as a vessel. The Black Order is an order of priests and Exorcists, apostles chosen by God, to rid the world of this ominous evil. Exorcists use a divine power called 'Innocence' to exorcize the akuma and set their trapped souls free. The 'Innocence' was originally a cube used to destory the Earl and his demons hundreds of years ago, but the 'Innocence' broke into pieces and scattered across the world. It is the Exorcist's mission to find and retrieve these shards of 'Innocence' before the Earl can and destory them. \\n\r\nAllen Walker is a young exorcist, member of The Black Order and the main protagonist of D. Gray-Man. His 'Innocence' is called a Oarasite-type, anti-akuma weapon; the rarest kind. An Exorcist with a Parasite-type has one of their body parts replaced with 'Innocence' and are born with the power already inside of them. Unlike Parasite-types, Weaponized-types have weapons that contain the 'Innocence' inside the weapon and cross paths with the weapon, instead of being bron with it. Allen was cursed with a left eye that allows him to see the trapped souls inside of the akuma after he turned this foster father, Mana Walker, into an akuma. Young Walker was the first human ever to survive an attack from a newly \"born\" akuma. After his left arm awakened and he destoryed the akuma and set Mana's soul free, Allen made a vow to Mana to save the souls of the akuma and save the humans, too.\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nAs for the graphic and art, they were drawn very well. The somewhat gothic style of the manga shows in the animated version, too. The art is beautiful, and the akuma send a creeping chill down my spine. Though the animation has stunning art, I feel that the fighting scenes could have been better. Allen actually looks very cute and so does Lenalee, but Kanda doesn't look like such a \"tough guy\" with his long hair. As the story goes on, though, the art get better, and draws me in even further.\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI absoultey LOVE the soundtracks. Each note of every song holds a story within it, a story of struggles and hardship of the lives of Allen and everyone at the Order. All 4 openings of the anime are excellent and there were none that I didn't like. \"Doubt and Trust\" by Access was definately one of my favorites. And UVERworld did the 4th opening; no way I couldn't fall in love with these openings! I like the 1st ending, but I wish that the endings were a bit faster and had a change of pase. Each of the endings sounded alike, which really bothered me. And for the animation of the endings, well, WHAT animation? They just flashed still pictures on the screen. I wish they had endings to fit the tone and mood of the anime.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAllen has to be my FAVORITE character. He's not your typical main character. Usually, the main characters of anime are always hopeless idiots who can't tell left from right, especially in shounen anime. Allen, on the other hand, is seneble, honest, kind and just likeable! He has very good manners and values his friends and loved ones more than anything in the world and would do anything to save them. That's what makes a good manin  character, I think. Not to mention he's a bottomless pit when it comes to food. When not battling akuma, he is eating.\\n\r\nLenalee....Oh, Lenalee...I don't want to say much because I dont' want spoil, but geez. I really liked Lenalee at first, but...Well, let's just say she becomes the most helpless and annoying heroine I've ever seen in a shounen.\\n\r\nOk. The Millennuim Earl. He's certainly not your typical villain. Yes, he wants to destroy the world just like any other antagonist, but his design is so different than the other bad guys in anime. He's this big, fat. jolly guy who always wears this huge smile and his mouth alone takes up more than half of his entire face. He has pointy ears and always wears a top hat and a trench coat. He also laughs A LOT, and always ends his sentences with a heart. Does that not remins you of the Joker from Batman? Creepy. He's not scary, though. Usually, antagonists are scary, but no the Earl. He is definitely one of the most unique characters in this anime.\\n\r\nAlright, you fan-girls. You knew this was coming. Last but not least, there is the ever so cold and arrogant, Yu Kanda. He is also an Exorcist who uses a Weaponized-type anti-akuma weapon in the form of a katana. Kanda is the definition of negative. He is always moody and easily annoyed, glaring and hating everybody, especially Allen. Kanda has hate dAllen since the moment they met because of the misunderstanding. But knowing Kanda, he would have hated Allen anyway. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe beginning has great, middle...not so much. They had filler after filler after filler. It got to be very annoying. Some of the fller was funny, and some of it was just outright horrible. I read the manga first, so all of the filler highly disappointed me. And they ended D.Gay-Man at the best possible part. I'm hoping that as the mnga goes ahead, the anime will eventually start up again. I'd rather wait than to have filler episodes. \\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone who loves a good supernatural, dramatic, action-packed adventure that will make your head go for a spin. I know I enjoyed it, and I guarantee you won't, either!",

            "content": "Here is what I thought about D Gray Man:\r\nStory-I give it a 10. D Gray Man gives that sorta-typical shonen feeling, then turns it around completely and makes it into an awesome, not your typical type of shonen but still rocking kind of an anime, which is VERY hard to find these days.\r\nArt-Before you kill me because I didn't put 10, listen to me. I like the animation of this show very much. It is very detailed, very clear, very high quality.:D But I gave it a  9 because I prefer the manga's style of art better and the anime staff changed a fewdetailds that just made the charcters more...themselves. They were still awesome, but the manga displays more thoughtfulness and details. \\n\\n\r\nSound-Generally the music is very fitting to the mood, and unlike most other animes I watched, I enjoyed the openings and the endings very much. The seiyuus of the characters did a terrific job in voicing the charcters, though sometimes Allen sounds too feminine and Linali's voice is too high pitched, and at first Lavi's voice kinda annoyed me as it was very nasal. But you probably won't even notice it, it's just a few mistakes we make now and then.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Outstanding.\\n\r\nThe best thing I like about the characters is the fact that Allen Walker, the main character of the series, betrays the typical loud, outgoing, no manners or cares whatsoever stereotype of shonen manga.(*POSSIBLE SPOILERS!-*Like Bleach or Naruto...-_-*) In fact, Allen is very nice, well mannered, polite, and at the same time outgoing and friendly while he maintains intelligence and some coolness. This appeals to me very much.^^ \\n\r\nOther charcters are interesting as well. Kanda can be, at a first glance, be a typical shonen rival, but you'll see he's not. After all, who has long hair and likes flowers?\\n\r\nOther charcters, such as Komui, Bak, and sometimes Lavi provide some comic relief while actually contributing to the series in some way. The charcters are equally balanced, overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-A 10.\\n\r\nD Gray Man has wonderful plots, art, sound, charcters, and not too much fillers! Who can resist that?\\n\\n\r\nOverall-Perfect. I would definitley recommend this series.",

            "content": "D. Grayman is about a a boy named allen walker who is cursed with the ability to see akuma or demons.He joins the Black order to fight these Akuma with the use of special weapons known as innocence.The story focuses on the lives of the individuals in the order and their encounters.\r\nThe story of this anime is amazing. It's one of the best i've seen(possibly the best). It has a very unique feel to it for a shounen anime and inculcates a lot of drama which makes the anime so gripping. For a shounen anime it has a good mix of comedy,drama,action and adventure, notso much romance but this combo has worked wonders for this anime. The story is not cliche at all and can be a bit dark at times but it helps to contribute to the  realism in it. So if you think this is your typical shounen anime where the bad guys losing an everybody goes home happy, guess again. The anime is filled with twists and turns at every point and gets better and better as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fantastic. Details are drawn out well and the dark setting creates an excellent atmosphere. The vivd colours help to bring out focal points in the story. all the characters are drawn so well and the chibi versions now and then add to the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was not the best part of the anime. Though the opening and closing songs were great and really suited the anime. The background music here and there did help to bring out the atmosphere but i think more could have been done in this area.Nonetheless, a commendable effort in this area.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the best part of the show. The character development in the show is astounding, best i've seen. All the characters have good depth reagardless of how little showtime they get, the producers ensured that each character had ample elaboration on.The flashbacks help to create depth in the haracters and show us the reasons for their determination or lack there of. It is a very realistic anime and touches on a lot of human emotions and institutions such as friendship, duty, family and so on. The characters portray these themes very well. Plus the weapons they get are freaking cool!\\n\\n\r\nWhat else can i say, besides that the anime was the bomb! The comedy was not too lame and the fighting was awesome. The drama was gripping and leaves you wanting for more. I think another good thing about this show is that you get to empathise some of the characters, with so many different personalities in the various characters you are bound to be one of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,out of all my favourites so far, this one would be at the top. The storyline, characters, animation and sound interwoven create a master piece that is not to be missed. If you think all shounens are easygoing , try this one out...it'll definitely show you a different story to other shounen. My praises would go on and on but alas i should stop.This anime is a must see. If you are interested in knowing what is going on after the anime you can always read the manga..it's a good read as well. I hope another season wil continue from where they left off cause the manga is way ahaead of the anime.",

            "content": "D.Gray-man plays out like a macabre epic that details the struggle between the forces of good and evil. Tragedy and strife give rise to sinister and horrifying creatures known as Akuma that grow progressively stronger as time goes on, and those who were chosen by God himself to fight against the Akuma also have their own demons to battle against. Over the course of 103 episodes, we follow the story of Allen Walker: an exorcist of the enigmatic Black Order, an organisation dedicated to fighting the Akuma and the struggles that he and his comrades face in their battle against the Millennium Earl, the dementedmonster responsible for creating the Akuma. Is it without its flaws? Of course not, but there is a lot of good to be found in D.Gray-man which many unfortunately overlook whilst talking about this programme.\\n\\n\r\nIn 19th century Europe, a man known as the Millennium Earl capitalises upon the grief that people go through whenever they incur a tragic loss in order to create beings known as Akuma: self-aware puppets for the Millennium Earl that not only bring a soul back from the afterlife, but also forces them to live in torment as they are forced to do the Earl's bidding. Those who are wrought with grief get paid a visit by the Millennium Earl with the opportunity to bring back a deceased loved one, not realising that the Earl is nothing more than a cruel and sadistic genie who won't grant their wish the way they want it to turn out. The end result is a tortured soul forced to do the bidding of a complete and total monster without any say in the matter. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum, we have the Black Order: an enigmatic organisation of exorcists that whilst unknown to the general public, work to destroy the Akuma and defeat the Millennium Earl. These exorcists are able to wield a mystical substance known as Innocence: shards of was known by an ancient civilisation as the Crystal of God. Innocence has the power to destroy Akuma and free the tortured souls that inhabit them, but only those who were chosen by God himself can wield it. Those who are revealed to be accommodators of Innocence must abandon everything they once knew so that they can train to become exorcists. In the process, they disappear completely from the lives of their loved ones. When they die, their deaths are kept a secret from anyone outside the Order so that new Akuma can't be made. Though the Black Order aims to do the world a service, their actions make it evident that they're not infallible nor are they the epitome of morality.\\n\\n\r\nThe exorcists we see over the course of the programme like Allen, Lenalee, and Lavi are also shown to be more than just your standard protagonists. Yes, they want to destroy the Akuma and defeat the Earl like anyone else does but exorcists are human too. They have their own struggles and inner demons to battle against, but they must ultimately deal with that on their own as the primary goal of the Order is to destroy the Akuma and defeat the Millennium Earl.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Lenalee is someone who was forced as a child to abandon her brother to become an exorcist. As such, she harbours such a deep-seated resentment toward the Black Order and yet is terrified of standing up against them. In spite of this, she keeps fighting because the friends she made at the Order are what comprise her entire world. Of course, they're all fighting a dangerous battle against an enemy that grows stronger by the day. Who's to say what would happen to Lenalee if her closest companions fell in the line of duty?\\n\\n\r\nIn Lavi's case, this is even more evident. Even though Lavi is an exorcist, he's the heir to a clan that takes it upon themselves to document history as it unfolds whilst minimising their own impact on history and remaining as neutral as possible. Lavi cares deeply about his comrades but his role as Bookman's successor means that he's obligated to detach himself from those around him for the sake of maintaining neutrality.\\n\\n\r\nThese struggles that the characters go through along with the very conflict that exists between the Millennium Earl and the Black Order is what makes D.Gray-man such a captivating show to watch. However, it's not without its flaws. Unfortunately, the programme is marred by flaws that would otherwise hamper one's ability to enjoy the programme. Like many long-running programmes, D.Gray-man suffers from something of a slow start and these earlier episodes, whilst decent enough to watch, can come across as heavy-handed to many as they try to reinforce the tragic nature of Akuma. There's also the matter of filler to discuss. Toward the end of the second season and the beginning of the third season (Episodes 29-36 and Episodes 41-50 to be precise), D.Gray-man ends up going into some filler episodes that don't particularly mix well with the feel of the earlier episodes. They can be skipped, but it's still something to be mentioned. Speaking of which, there's also the matter of the way the anime ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe source material has a tendency to go in and out of hiatuses due to Katsura Hoshino's poor health and TMS Entertainment ended up pulling the plug on the adaptation because at that point in time, they would've caught up to the source material but Hoshino wasn't able to push out timely chapter releases because of things like her own arthritis and whatnot. Whilst the anime's ending works just fine as a conclusion, there are many loose plot threads left hanging because it's an adaptation of an ongoing manga. If you're the kind of person expecting total resolution from your programmes, you might as well look elsewhere because D.Gray-man won't satisfy you in that regard. This is a shame because there's so much that this series does well. Regardless, there's a lot this series does well and I think that there will come a time when there will be a continuation of the adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production, D.Gray-man is quite lovely to say the least. TMS Entertainment, the ones responsible for this show have proven themselves time and again to be capable producers. Their rather extensive catalogue consists of things like Lupin III, Detective Conan/Case Closed, and the film adaptation of Akira. It's safe to say that these guys have a remarkable track record for quality, with few (if any) slip-ups. With that said, the production values may not hold up to everyone's standards. This is a show that started out in 2006 and ended in 2008, so the animation quality itself is a touch dated. Thankfully, it still looks rather nice and the atmosphere is as good as ever. The entire series has this sort of dark and Gothic feel to it which is quite befitting given the subject matter. Yeah... as much as I enjoyed shows like Soul Eater and Blue Exorcist, I was put off by the lack of a dark and (mostly) serious tone throughout the entire narrative so D.Gray-man was the perfect fit for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, D.Gray-man doesn't disappoint. The background tracks are all quite lovely and fit the tone of whatever moments that they're being played in. However, the OP and ED themes are where this show really shines. It's rare for me to actually like all the OP/ED themes in a show but it's even rarer for me to like them all equally. I can't choose which one I like above all others because they all sound incredible to me. Then again, your mileage may vary but whatever. The dub is also some really good stuff, although Funimation was only able to license the first 51 episodes so you might wanna stick with the sub if you want consistency.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, D.Gray-man is a show that's definitely worth your time and is something that everyone should give a chance at some point or another. It's a shame to see people give the time of day to lacklustre programmes that ultimately end in disappointment for all when quality is easily within one's reach. It's weird how people who viscerally despise shows like Naruto and the second series of Fairy Tail keep watching those shows despite hating them so much and yet don't give good shows like these a chance. Do yourself a favour and go on Hulu or KissAnime and watch this show. Trust me, you won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nFirst review of the New Year! Wow, am I late to the party...",

            "content": "hello and welcome to a hungover shitty review.\r\nthe author puts forth a lot of good general ideas and concepts. a shounen battle series with exorcists hunting demons who are more like a mixture between machines and former human souls, created by some generic evil fat guy who claims to hate god.\r\nthis sort of setting has a lot of potential, so where did it all go wrong? execution. especially the pacing is completely FUBAR. this author may have interesting ideas but has no idea how to express them in an adequate way.\r\ntake the first 50 something episodes for instance, more like 50 shades of boredom. literallyzero to nothing happens in the main story and the purpose of those 50 episodes was to introduce the viewer to a handful of new one dimenshional characters. we are introduced to the noah as well early on but we don't get to know anything about them and for some reason the earl tries to attain this \"heart innocence\" in the most ineffective way possible instead of sending his OP noahs to smash everything to bits.\\n\\n\r\nso that's a summary of the first fifty something episodes, i was bored to tears. i asked someone on reddit if i should keep going and if it was going to get better. he told me that it would take a 180 degree turn around the 50+ mark. and in some ways it did, but it only went from painfully boring to mildly amusing and the pace was still fucked up. they latched on to the most trivial and boring stuff and stretched it out as long as possible but when things start to happen they cut it extremely short.\\n\\n\r\nor when a certain suspense manages to build up and they ruin it with lame jokes. from 50+ onward i just kept going because i wanted to write an angry review so here it is.\\n\\n\r\ni know there is a new season incoming but i will probably not watch it unless the author has realized his/her shortcomings and teamed up with someone who can actually structure this show in an interesting way.\\n\\n",

            "content": "D. Gray-Man has been reviewed a lot of times  also it gets a lot of media attention so I'm just gonna try to make this a short review. D. Gray-man is a great anime for all ages whether it's the Pokemon tykes or the more hardcore otaku, this show will entertain you on some level. I would say that this show is on the same level as Naruto or FullMetal Alchemist. I'm assuming there's gonna be a sequel, otherwise the ending leaves much to be desired.\r\n The animation is also on the same level as Naruto or FMA, it is very good in someparts with a lot of attention to the graphics and special effects. Other times it's average or it gets simple [only when they get humorous, though]. There is no breath-taking scenery or anything, it's shounen anime so it's more action based; expect characters with cool weapons, freaky looking monsters, a lot of light shows and big explosions.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the Japanese version created from a mixed bag of fansub groups, which was OK for the most part though some of the dialog appeared kinda cheeky and I'm not sure that those words were the true meaning behind the Japanese audio. But I'm still grateful for any work that a fansubber does. The soundtrack is also a mixed bag of goodies and not so goodies. I especially liked the last ED theme song because she hit that freaky, high-pitched Mariah Carey note, that was cool. The OST is worth getting because it has Pop, Rock, Techno and Rap.\\n\\n\r\nSolid story though I do have issues with the ending...also it does drag on in some areas with some battles spanning a few episodes. This is typical of shounen anime so I should have expected as much but if you are new to shounen anime then it might annoy you and you just want the plot to move along. Even so it's still a great show worth watching because if you liked Naruto or FullMetal Alchemist then you are going to like this show! It's like Naruto because the exorcists are like the ninjas from Naruto, each has their own brand of majic skills, that the fights last a few episodes. It's like FMA because it is an epic adventure quest; FMA was looking for the Sorcerer's Stone and these guys are looking for a similar artifact. Plus the Noah people are very similar to the Homunculi from FMA. All three shows are very similar in the fact that they are a perfect mix of action, adventure and humor.\\n\\n\r\nLots and lots of characters! About 7 - 10 key characters and then there's an endless list of supporting characters: good guys, bad guys and bystanders. I will say this though, for all their globe-trotting and border-hopping and meeting new faces....you never see a brown face or a black face, not even Allen's childhood friend who was supposedly \u201cIndian.\u201d you did get to see that \u201ctoken\u201d Asian face but that's about it. So that to me was kind of a set back, I will take off a point or two. If it wasn't for Lavi, I might have scored lower but Lavi is by far the best guy in the series [IMHO]! He's cute, he's funny, optimistic and a major risk-taker....he gets major points in my book. But if Lavi's not your guy there are PLENTY of bishounen to choose from. Allen and Kanda are also very cute and therefore makes this show fun to watch for those who are into bishounen. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, may be a long show but it's definitely worth watching!  You don't have to worry about it losing steam like so many of these long-ass, never-ending anime shows [i.e. InuYasha...anyone?]",

            "content": "D.Gray-Man is one of the latest anime shows that i finished and i was pretty amazed after also following up with the manga series. \r\nStory: The story starts as nothing special as it is centered to excorcists and demons. However as the story unveils there many mysteries around the main protagonists, such as Allen or Cross Marian, that make one eager to continue watching the episodes. Unfortunately the anime series has four filler arcs that are not that nice but i guess they are bearable. I believe the story would be much better without them. As for the main part the plot is about the\\n\r\nBlack Order's struggle to exterminate all demon's that are created by the Millenium Earl, a very mysterious existence.\\n\\n\r\nArt-Sound: As the anime is not very new the animation techniques are not splendid but it is common knowledge to all anime and manga fans that Hoshino Katsura's drawings of the protagonists are marvellous. As for the music, the OST's released are probably my favourite of all the anime i have watched because both the openings and the endings as well as the themes during the episodes are quite well orchestarted.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main protagonist is a 15 year-old boy named Allen Walker, who is send to become an excorcist as he is equipped with one Innocence shard, the main excorcist weapon. As a personality Allen is very kind and caring for his friends,struggling to protect them as well as pretty loyal to the Order. His main companion consists of Kanda Yu, Lavi and Lenalle Lee. Each has unique traits. Kanda is a bit antisocial,loyal,skilled as a fighter and very mysterious as well. Lenalle and Lavi are carefree characters having a lot of fun with Allen as they,as well, treasure the virtues of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The battles are quite nice, as well as the mystery that unveils and the way each person's character is formed and developed are all very well made. So it's a very enjoyable anime with a lot of fun in a lot of scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: my overall score of 9 comes after considering most of the points referred above as well as the impressions i had while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review. If you have any questions or disagree with my opinions please don't hesitate to leave a comment and discuss it. ;)",

I didn't care much, because I assumed it was a bad anime. HOWEVER, after watching the an episode (Episode 2), I just got VERY addicted and kept watching. I soon loved the anime and kept watching all the episodes.\r\nBut I do truly love watching D.Gray-man. It's VERY entertaining with a variety of things all mixed together perfectly.

There are several reason why this is and always will be only average anime. \r\nOne of those reasons is that the end is just not there even if i try really hard it is not there that means one thing and one thing only u will get no conclusion what so ever after spending half of your life watching this anime.\r\nNext one is that even thought i have nothing against shounen and those \"kill the stronger enemy so u can a dozen billion others...\" kindaanimes. There was one thing particulary annoying about this piece. I call it the resolve dilema, every third episode of the series u can see a long fight of the heroes with themselves and you get to watch closely how they strenghten their resolve to get the power and fight back the evil demons. So far... not that bad u say? But trust me.. you could skip 3/4 of the episodes and still u would know exactly what happened (since none of the main heroes is dead or missing in any way).\\n\\n\r\nBasically what we have here is a pretty boring story, which they tried to make better by adding \"personal resolve\" struggle element and failed.\\n\\n",

Gray man come alive while the manga is still outstanding and magnificent! \r\nLet's first start off that D. Gray Man has a lot of spectacular moments both heartwarming and tear jerking, as you will start to get anxious of what will happen in the next episode. Where the art work and character personality's is what makes the anime wonderful to watch, as you get to understand each character slowly and beginto love them, while the art makes the scenery's beautiful and the animation outstanding. Some may find it's slow at first because it's the start of the anime so you shouldn't expect it to go straight forward, but to me I didn't find it slow as it was a perfect introduction to the series. Id highly recommend to give D. Gray man a chance and watch it all, while enjoying the spectacular moments and learning about each character. The ost's for the anime you will find it's very catchy and then you will realized after the first couple episodes you will start humming or singing the song. \\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\r\nHas an outstanding introduction \\n\r\nHeartwarming\\n\r\nTear jerking \\n\r\nHilarious \\n\r\nWell developed \\n\r\nHeart Thrilling\\n\r\nBalanced\\n\r\nMagnificent \\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nBeautiful \\n\r\nWell Designed \\n\\n\r\n-Sound/ost-\\n\r\nBeautiful\\n\r\nCatchy \\n\r\nEnjoyable \\n\r\nAddicting \\n\r\nOn point\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nCute\\n\r\nHandsome\\n\r\nWell Designed \\n\r\nBalanced \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nFunny\\n\r\nAddicting\\n\r\nAnxious \\n\r\nHeartwarming\\n\r\nTear Jerking\\n\r\nSoothing\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give D.

            "content": "To be fair, I dropped this one quite early on, so I can't promise you that the series doesn't improve or that the overarching story isn't as great as the ratings suggest. It may not even be fair to have rated or reviewed it at all. However, what I can do is explain what went into my decision to dump the series and why other viewers should be mindful of those factors before picking it up themselves.\r\nFundamentally, regardless of where the story goes or how the characters develop, the series is flawed in terms of its story-telling ability. There are some basic problems at thecore of the writing that will colour the entire series for its duration. Building a story is like building a house: It needs a strong foundation made out of the right materials, or no amount of future patchwork can save it. Shoddy materials used in the construction of D.Gray-Man include:\\n\\n\r\n1. The Threat\\n\\n\r\nThe Big Bad of the series is a monster called the Millennium Earl who turns recently-deceased people into demons with the intent of destroying life on Earth. He is evil for the sake of being evil. The problem with villains like this, who are motivated to end the world, is that this motivation is ultimately absurd. Okay cool, you want to end the world. Once you achieve this goal... then what? Worst case scenario, you also die, and best case scenario, you then spend thousands of years alone, wandering a lifeless landscape in boredom and isolation. The motivation makes no sense because the villain doesn't benefit from achieving their goal. So to start with, the threat that our protagonists are up against is completely illogical.\\n\\n\r\n2. The World\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few rules given to explain where monsters come from and how to defeat them, but these rules are not clearly applied throughout the world in which the story is told. For example, the relationship of Akuma to Innocence and Exorcists is fairly well explained, however, the world is full of monster-like characters whose existence has no explanation and the main characters repeatedly discover new skills and magical abilities that have no source or catalyst. The main characters get themselves into tight binds and resolve their predicaments by unleashing new magical abilities they'd never demonstrated before. The lack of rules governing the resolution of conflict and the cast of characters detracts from the quality of the world created and the believeability of the story told.\\n\\n\r\n3. The Exposition\\n\\n\r\nIn story-telling, exposition is essentially how the writers deliver information about the world or situation to the viewer through the characters. Exposition done well is so subtle that the viewer doesn't recognize it as exposition. Exposition done poorly is heavy-handed, uninteresting, and slows down the plot. The first two episodes of D.Gray-Man are throwaway stories that contribute little to the long-term plot and serve only to dump massive amounts of information on the viewer before the story really begins. Poor exposition is a good indicator of poor writing that is unlikely to improve. Exposition is like a story's grammar--it doesn't matter how good the plot is, if it's full of grammatical errors, nobody will want to finish reading it.\\n\\n\r\n4. The Plot\\n\\n\r\nThe problems with D.Gray-Man's plot are somewhat more subjective than the last three \"story materials\" the series is built out of. If you watch anime for the characters, for the action, for the world-building, or pretty much for any reason other than the plot, then this isn't necessarily a deal-breaker for you. But it was for me. Simply put, I'm bored of plot lines that are theoretically unending. \"Collect all the ____\". \"Become the strongest _____\". \"Defeat all the _____\". None of these types of plots ever demands that a story come to a conclusion, because in theory you can always become stronger at ____ or defeat more of the ____. D.Gray-Man falls into this structure, which to me is a formula that means hundreds of episodes where the characters do essentially the same shit each time and a plot that can meander forever without needing to move towards a conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I know that D.Gray-Man does have a conclusion, but it's a red-flag to me if a series is longer than 50 or 60 episodes, because it's difficult to sustain a long-term plot for that kind of time without either a ton of filler OR the plot becoming an unwieldy mess. The sense I got from this series is that it's guilty of the former. As of episode 7, no overarching plot has emerged other than \"defeat stuff\". Single battles span 2-4 episodes, yet these episodes contribute nearly nothing to character development or to the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nI did my best to give this series a fair chance to hook me with the understanding that (according to many fans), the story takes a while to get underway. However, I spent each episode waiting for the episode to end, essentially so I could get far enough to justify dropping it. Ultimately, this house has too many structural problems for me to have faith in the end product. It's better to knock it down and start over again from the ground up.",

            "content": "This series offered a great deal of potential, with its dark premise and appropriately gritty art. It seemed to me like the next FMA, which I wouldn't have had the slightest issue with seeing another variant of. \r\nHowever, the ultimate execution of this groundwork falls flat, quickly. The art is the one thing that ultimately maintains a level quality. \r\nThe characters are what I found to be most unbearable. They are two dimensional and overly comical - lacking a modicum of depth. We get some insight into their backgrounds, but ultimately I found the endearment lacking, as  the investment into the characters are rushedor downright melodramatic. Including all forms so of Akuma so far presented. the villains are so superficially callous that it undermines the core dark theme. They seem to relish in evil to be, well, evil, and we are so far never presented with any insight of their core soul's struggles  besides some generic animatin showing the soul looking unhappy. Their actual behaviour ultimately delivers a central character without depth. The other side characters so far are terribly bland and forgettable, with resolute character design and an overly comical overtone. The anime seems to pride itself on its dark premise, but this strongly disjoint tone just cripples it into submission. FMA had a similar setup, but its execution was so that the humour was subtle enough to not strongly dilute the dark groundwork. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is just about the worst of the lot. He is desperately constructed to be such a pansy to the point of it being frustrating to endure his screen-time. I guess this operates under the guise of the upbringing he had to endure, but such an offensively great deal of naivety is synonymous with a hollow character with no resolve - rather more so a  character built to be overly agreeable or without faults. He will run around trying to save babies; get taken advantage of; be in the process of being murdered by a 'human'; yet in all theses scenarios, will smile throughout and find the most family friendly direction, all without any monologue. One example amongst the endless is when Allan decides to ignore the doctor collaborating with the Millenium Earl, having no resolve to act on the fact that it is not a matter that would be properly handled in a community of normal people whom have no concept of demons let alone believe his role. But killing a human would be too dramatic, so the author tries to go about it in a roundabout and uninspiring way in resolving it without Allen getting his hands dirty. You will find many more examples where Allen just overlooks the blunt atrocities committed by many of the human antagonists, and will sit around moping contemplating how a human can have bad will, all the while allowing the said antagonist to get away, one way or another. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to another point : There are Akuma EVERYWHERE at all times, yet NO civilian has any concept of it. They flood the show with the presence of Akuma, yet at the same time want to maintain some sense of mysticism in their existence. A terrible oxymoron in writing. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story has so far being tediously episodic. It seems every episode that the Akuma get the same intel at the same time as the Black Order, thus they seem to always be in the same place at the same time. This engulfment and simplicity in killing these Akuma really just dulls the drama of their existence, as it becomes more of a triviality. It doesn't offer any headroom for much narrative, compounded by the simplicity in their personalities. \\n\r\n In every corner of the world, in every episode that we are subjected to, there is an Akuma that ends up more or less killed in a rather generic and repetitive fashion. We get no insight through monologue on the combat, and is often inconsistent as they try the same thing. The combat lacks depth, and is made overly obscure and inconsistent in execution as a plot device. How many times does Allan use his explosive cannon to no effect, only to work 12 minutes later? How many times does Allan need to run in front of a line of fire to protect someone, only to serve as a cause for concern in an otherwise obvious outcome? Most the combat is just bright lights / hit and miss effects. \\n\\n\r\nI understand it is still relatively early in the series, but it is a bad execution to have an episodic layout this drawn out and expect to cling to the audience's interest for over 600 minutes with this lack of concentration in substance to serve for any momentum. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, there is no depth to the combat, as they just swing their swords or launch a barrage of missiles and miss randomly until the timing is convenient to not miss, or sustain an attack with no damage until the same attack causes damage when, again, it is convenient to be so. I didn't once come across a strategic approach to the combat and you will more or less be faced with seeing a variant technique sparsely throughout the anime, only to never be used again. Most of the time, one or two techniques are just spammed. Not to mention the terrible animation in itself, with clunky choreography and the ancient use of faded out background during an attack. Seeing a barrage of missiles flying everywhere never hitting their target also got quite old. Or even worse, using their arms or weapons that barely cover their bodies as a shield in still frame with bullets just flinging to only that point. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was creatively okay and appropriate, but the combat animation was abhorrent. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was mostly forgettable, with exception to the outro and intro. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, to be blunt, this is a FMA ripoff that fails to deliver the same quality in its execution. From losing his parents, losing his left arm, having a brutish master whom took him in as an orphan, jokes about his height, the presence of overpowered humanoids that actively fight humanity, and the underlining concept of reincarnation / taboo, it is hard to overlook the blunt attempt at emulation. \\n",

            "content": "As one of the better shounen series of its time, D.Gray-Man had a wonderfully unique setting, exceptionally good head villain and memorable protagonists.\r\nThe underlying concept of a hidden war between Exorcists and artificial creatures called Akuma presented a classical contrast of good and evil, which was easy to grasp and build upon. The early mission-based storytelling was good on fluffing up the lore and introducing characters too, though the pacing was slow and predictable. Plot twists were not employed until the Vampire arc and things only began to heat up during the Barcelona arc, more than 30 episodes in. The show took more than halfof its episodes just to get under full swing, during the Edo arc; which was way longer than what I had anticipated.\\n\\n\r\nIf fillers were the bane of shounen shows, they did a number on this one too. Plot holes were rampant during the Witch arc, involving the creation of Akuma and the effects of Akuma poison on Exorcists. The entirety of the Fortune Teller arc was rage inducing, while the supposedly comedic episodes were just as bad, nearing ruining an important fight with a Noah member.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t help when the author had no sense of balance or scale. With the Millennium Earl bolstering his Akuma army all over the world with grieving humans, it is mind numbing on how the Order was capable of keeping peace with such a small number of Exorcists. You have to account for the limited amount of innocence and suitable hosts, the amount of training and support required to field an Exorcist, along with the restricting speed of Victorian logistics. There is simply no way that an Exorcist will get anywhere on time before an Akuma has killed thousands of people.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s not even go into the details of how an Akuma could evolve from manslaughter, or the Noah Clan members that can swat Exorcists like flies. The suspension of disbelief just wasn\u2019t there for me in this show, and stuff just doesn\u2019t make sense the more I dug into it, which is a shame considering the initially good premises.\\n\\n\r\nCombats had it fair share of problems as well when there were no strategies involved throughout the whole show. You get to see a lot of pretty effects and smooth animations, but the fights are essentially \u201challow\u201d. Kanda chops a lot of stuff with his katana, Lavi plays whack-a-mole with his size changing hammer, Lenalee does her impression of Mario hops while Allen slice and shoot with his arm. Things rarely changed from that formula, if at all. The Akuma would evolve in stages, as do Exorcists achieve multiple levels of activations, all done in Dragon Ball Z style, albeit without the excessively long howling; just lots of internal monologues instead.\\n\\n\r\nIrrespective of all the nitpicking I had with this show, it was the characters that really held me to screen throughout. The Millennium Earl was simply magnificent with his aloof appearances and maniacal laughers, Allen and Lenalee was surprisingly deep with lots of story, Cross Marian always had an air of mystery around him despite the small amount of screen time. Even some tertiary characters were impressive too, such as the Finder Toma, Eliade and Chomesuke. I won\u2019t go in detail too much, or else there would be spoilers, but you get the point.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all D.Gray-Man had some shortcomings, as it would like any other shows, but the areas in which it shone more than make up for it. The time spent on watching it was well spent indeed, I would recommend it to anyone interested in shounen series.",

            "content": "A Review of D.Gray-Man:\r\nThis one has been a long time coming. I'm not one to typical watch an anime over 50 or 60 episodes. In fact, prior to this show, the longest anime I had watched was Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. And to many, this show isn't long at all (it pales in comparison of length to One Piece, Naruto, etc.). But still, 103 episodes was a commitment I decided to make with this show.\r\nAnd MAN, am I glad I did.\r\nNow, D.Gray-Man isn't too different from other shounens out there. You have your good side fighting your bad side and characters suffer wins and losses onboth sides constantly. As for the whole exorcists fighting demons motif, well I very well can't say it's original. Yet, somehow, this show manages to shine amongst many others that are a lot like it. For one thing, while being over 100 episodes, the show honestly has very little filler. You definitely have your episodes where the main characters are goofing off or fighting some non-threat just to kill time or lighten the mood between darker themed episodes, yet the overall amount of unnecessary content is very limited, which I really enjoyed. The show also takes a \"been there, done that\" idea of a plot and puts its own fun twist on it (ex: demons are 'born', they don't just appear). The story is full of entertaining moments of lightheartedness or jokes and moments that make you want to weep in despair at the sight of a tragic loss. And no one side really dominates the other, as you can watch characters weeping or beat to a pulp one second, and the next, they're arguing over stupid nicknames. It doesn't feel forced and it helps make the show more enjoyable in some of the darker moments.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters for this show, I'm not gonna lie, they're typical. You have your main \"the power of will allows me to win anything\" male protagonist, the bubbly \"friends are more significant to me than anything\" female lead, the \"I crack jokes to mask the pain and confliction I have deep inside\" best friend, and the \"everyone else is inferior to me because I'm such a badass\" rival. Though, even if the protagonists are very typical, they still manage to portray their roles very well and are enjoyable to watch nonetheless. However, where this show really shines in character comes in the form of the villains, more specifically the Noah clan. Why the Noah can be seen as just following orders and causing havoc and killing people because \"we're bad and it's what we do\", they actually express their own choice and influence in very crucial moments. Each of the Noah is radically different, yet they all possess the aire of \"we are more powerful, marvel at us\" and it makes it all the more interesting when something or someone comes along that can stand toe-to-toe with them. My main qualm with the characters in this show is that you can tell which characters get the short end of the stick. For example, Kanda, the aforementioned rival, has almost no screentime between the 25th and 55th episodes. He's there, but the opening theme's cinematic makes it seem like he'll be way more important, only to have him be shoved aside in favor of the main character. This happens with several other characters as well, and it kinda sucks, because the characters it happens to are usually the ones you want to hear more about.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is solid throughout the whole show. Even 90 episodes in, I heard a new track playing in the background and really enjoyed it. The soundtrack waits for the moments it fits most and plays the perfect song in each scenario. There'll be times when you don't know what to expect from an episode, then the soundtrack pops on and you know either \"oh, this is gonna get really heavy or dark\" or \"oh, it'll be more upbeat and lighthearted, at peast for a little bit\" and that's what soundtracks should do. They make you feel worried that something bad is gonna happen or make you feel safe in a time of respite.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation, I'll be honest, is nothing to brag about. Sure, the show came out many a year ago, but even for the time it seems typical. There were never any moments where animation seemed to slip up or anything, but I just wasn't blow away...except for the fight scenes. The combat sequences are so well animated with bright flashes and smoke and explosions everywhere, it's just enjoyable to watch each side beat the crap out of each other.\\n\\n\r\nSo D.Gray-Man seems like an amazing show that you should definitely watch, right? Well, maybe not. Ya see, the thing about this show is that IT'S NOT DONE. Sure, the final episode ends with the word \"FIN\" on screen, but it's not a real conclusion. The reason it's not really over is because there were lots of issues with the manga and the showrunners basically didn't want to continue on an original storyline and would rather stick to the source material (which is actually something I applaud them for choosing to do). It just sucks that such a great story never saw the end of its tale shown on TV. However, the manga is once again back in production, and while chances are slim, it's possible we may one day soon see the return of D.Gray-Man.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Opening themes are all good and enjoyable in their own right and they all feel drastically different and not just the same thing over and over and over again\\n\r\n+Characters, while not too special on the protagonist side, experience quite a lot of solid development (and the villains are very enjoyable to watch)\\n\r\n+Good length with little filler\\n\r\n+Soundtrack is crafted phenomenally\\n\r\n+Fight scenes are a joy to watch\\n\r\n+Good mixture of lighthearted humor and heartpulling saddness\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-The show isn't complete (and may never be)\\n\r\n-Some characters are heavily neglected in favor of others\\n\r\n-Dub is only halfway done (so while the show itself is incomplete, the dub stopped at episode 51 out of 103)\\n\r\n-Plot armor is simply TOO thick. You never know if you should really be sad for someone's death beacuse there's a high possibility that they aren't actually dead or they'll come back to life and it takes away from that emotional aspect\\n\\n\r\nSo whether or not you choose to watch D.Gray-Man is really up to you. If you want to watch a decently long show with great characters and an interesting plot and are willing to put in the time for something that is essentially not done, then I highly recommend this show to you. However, if the lack of completeness really bothers you, then stay away (unless you're fine with reading the manga). Overall. D.Gray-Man is a fantastic show that puts new twists on a common plot and will make you enjoy every second of watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why D.Gray-Man gets a 9/10",

Each scene rolls into each other. Absorbing the consequences and leaving the viewer in awe. The characters' actions are so crucial, that even one mess up, will lead the whole story into a completely alternative route. Beautifully made. \r\nArt 7/10\r\nIn this generation, this art is mostly ignored. With the new animes out there, D.Gray-Man might be overlooked.

It's well enough to createenough tension when it comes down to battles and whatnot. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAmazing voice actors and splendid build-up when it comes down to it. The sound is good enough to suit the atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely jaw-dropping character-development. They each have their own attributes. They have their quirks, and along the way, you get to view their backstories. You become to understand their emotions and why they are this way.

This anime made me sit on my bed for hours and completely watch all the episodes without getting up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, you should definitely watch this anime. I have to agree, it is VERY sluggish in the beginning. The plot is taking leisurely steps, but it will soon sky-rocket into a mass void of drama and emotions.

            "content": "D. Gray Man is one of my favorites.  The story may seem like an ordinary shonen, but, when you get farther into the series, that all changes.  Even the bad guys get a say and it's really different because they actually have their own reasons and beliefs for the things they do. \r\nStory~\r\nThe story seems dull and unoriginal in the beginning, but it becomes quite complex once you to get into it.  Allen Walker and the other \"good guy\" main characters are Exorcists who are supposed to in the beginning, simply help fight off demons that are terrorizing the world .They use \"Innocence\" which is a weapon which is unique for every person and only certain people are actually compatible into it.  Later in the story, everything gets deeper as you find out that the ones behind all the demon attacks is really a big, happy family/organization of bad guys called the \"Noah\".  They are supernatural, but still human which causes problems for Allen in the beginning.  He thinks they are just like him, but he soon finds out they are evil....and strong.  The characters have to suck it up, and attack these \"humans\" which, much to their dismay, also help in corrupting the world.  The Noah also have a leader despite being incredibly strong whom is known as \"The Millenium Earl\".  To the Noah, he is simply \"Uncle Earl\" or \"Master Earl-sama\".  They treat each other like family which makes you see two different viewpoints since of course, the Exorcists think of him as the main, pure evil villain.  In that respect, D. Gray Man is incredibly original.  Seriously, when do you actually get some bad guys that act as a family and have some brains?  \\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nD. Gray Man's art is some of the best I've seen.  The Exorcists all have beautiful uniforms, and everything EVERYTHING is gorgeous.  Along with Kuroshitsuji, this has got to have some of the best anime-style art around.\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\nAppropriate sounds are made when needed and all the voice actors have lovely voices.  Even the theme/ending songs never fail to impress.\\n\r\nCharacters~\\n\r\nThe characters all develop well.  Although slow at times, they do so because, of course, they must.  For the Noah, Earl, and demons, they have to plan new ways to stop the Exorcists.  For the Exorcists, they have to gain more strength as the enemy is always growing.  Akuma/demons actually level up which just adds to the mischief that the Noah are already causing.\\n\r\nEnjoyment~\\n\r\nI really enjoyed D. Gray Man although I must admit, it got slow in the middle and at the very end.  Even so, the fascinating action scenes that they had made up for all of it.  The suspense was killing me especially with Noah vs. Exorcist scenes.  \\n\r\nOverall~\\n\r\nOverall, I LOVED D. Gray Man.  This shonen was definitely what I was looking for, and I'm glad I discovered it.",

The whole man-made concept is something that's hasn't really been done before, and that helps make this anime freakin' awesome >.< The characters are also so weird, like Allen; he went through a lot as a kid, and has still managed to turn out nice, despite knowing Cross.\r\nIt's just so awesome that an anime like this could exist, even the few filler episodes were worth watching, and the rest of the series manages to tie some comedy into the serious parts. Lavi is a huge help with that. As well asKomui. Overall this anime would be one of my absolute favorites! I'm even getting my anime club to get the DVDs because it's so awesome ^-^",

The story has a gothic feel to it, but yet it does not strain far from the shounen genre. Yes it only has 103 episodes and it ends in a awkward way that makes you read the manga if you want to continue the story. So if your not a big manga reader and your like your anime to explain everything that happens in the manga i don't think thisis the anime for you.",

            "content": "This is a fascinating story about exorcists fighting demon like machines made from people's souls by the Millennium Earl (a strange supernatural being). The exorcists have special powers given to them by \"Innocence\" (the only weapon left to them to fight against the Earl). Much of the story involves the exorcists searching for Innocence to use as weapons against the Earl.\r\nAllen is a great main character to follow. He is shrouded in mystery, and questions are slowly answered throughout the story. He makes a lot of friends among the exorcists and even recruits a few exorcists himself. There are other great supporting characters in thisstory, and each brings something special and unique to the series. There's a little comedy through the story, but really it's very dark and emotional. If you want to see a story where the good guy rarely wins then this is it. It's almost depressing at times, but thankfully there's typically a light at the end of the tunnel. \\n\\n\r\nThe real enemies (the Noah's) appear throughout the series to thoroughly wipe the tables with the exorcists. If you're wondering who the \"Noah's\" are then think \"religion based story.\" I won't give any details but this story does have a heavy religious tone. Towards the end we get a few questions answered, but not all of them since they wrapped the anime up while the manga is still ongoing. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a little slower than the manga series, and the artwork in the manga is better. The filler is watchable in this anime, so I don't fault it, but the slowness of the story is why I rated it a 7. It could be the fillers fault but it gets a little slow at times, which lost it some points in my book. It's still a great series and worth watching. Even though it has an open ending, you can pick up the manga close to where the anime leaves off. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, worth watching, don't miss it.",

As the title implies, the show is about a man who is both black and white \u2013 a man and a monster \u2013 and we and the main character are shown both sides of the battle between the two, only to find ourselves as an observer to unreasonable chaos. \r\nBut what do I think of the show? It is decent, and present nothing new, that has not been seen. \r\nIt\u2019s a show about how the enemy is only an enemy when viewed from the foe point of view,and when presented with the enemies reasoning to the violence and their ideals, you see that the two sides fight an endless battle about a pointless matter, that could easily be resolved. \\n\\n\r\nBut where the show shines are in the action and characterization. All the different characters all have their unique quirk that is presented in their weapon and fighting style. Every person has emotions and reason behind their action, and those are especially shown in the combat as time goes on, and the characters become more despaired to survive because of the bonds that can only be gain when presented with a situation where logic is replaced by instinct. \\n\\n\r\nAn improvement to the show, which would doubtlessly have made the show more impactful, would be a variety of the background/situational music; it got old pretty quickly. But, there were times when the music was excellent and attached the story, character, and environment into one, and for that, I give the music a solid 8. \\n\\n\r\nWould I say the show was worth the 103 episodes in 2018? Possibly. If you enjoy well-written characters and action, go for it. But with that being said, there are a lot of time a million fillers and the pace of the show seems off.  \\n",

            "content": "\u2800\u2800 D gray man definitely has a more unique style than most shounen series. It reminds me of Halloween especially with the Noah's character designs idky. Allen walker is the main protagonist of the series and is 15 when you meet him. He's an exorcist who fights against demons (aka akuma). He goes to the dark order an organization who's main goal is to kill the Millennium Earl who makes demons  and fight the Noah family who work for him. Another goal of there's is to save innocence before a Noah or the Earl destroys it, the innocence is a weapon exorcists have eitherparasitic, equip, or crystal (blood). The death toll must be pretty high for this series with people being killed to become Akuma and Akuma killing humans. \\n\r\nThe first half of d gray man is really slow in my opinion mainly because of the 19 filler episodes. The fillers fit well with the story some of them were enjoyable while others felt way too repetitive. In my opinion it doesn't start getting great till episode 51 where the rest are cannon episodes! All the twists in this anime grabbed me on a thrill ride, especially episode 100 (spoilers ya know that level 4). \\n\r\nI really can't say much about the animation I mean 2006 that's kinda 10 years ago. But I will admit the fight scene definitely looked nice and did its job. And after watching d.gray man hallow I'd say the animation for season one is way better. And please watch season one, read the manga, then watch season 2. Lets just say it's disappointing, sorry off topic. \\n\r\nWhile the characters may seem kinda flat Allen the protagonist who eats a lot, like every shounen protagonist. They're not once you get to their backstories you'll cry globs. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really nice in this series it really fits the tone of the show well. All the opening were great especially the last two and most of the endings were too. I really like most of the background music the same way I do with fairy tail's only more dark sorta a cool creepy vibe.\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this series it's fun and the feels.",

            "content": "Story 10/10 - D gray man starts out super slow paced & it honestly didn't start to get interesting until I would say episode 4 or 5. The reason why is because the author spends a lot of time in the beginning explaining the show so that we're not left confused later on which is nice. Once you get to maybe episode 8 or so it's when you really get into it and it's like being on drugs. I remember the pain of waiting for a new episode to come out, I was completely addicted. Why? The plot is really interesting and the story isvery dark but also light hearted with a good amount of humor. The humor really changes the mood since the show is generally dark. Many people might not like it and would prefer it to just be dark but I actually think the humor brings a lot to the show. The plot is unique, introducing anti demon weapons aka \"innocence\" & apostle of gods aka \"exorcists\". The setting and background is also perfectly executed.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 - I love the animation. It's really nice for what it was back then. The characters are nicely drawn, with each characters looking very distinct from one another. The akumas/demons are drawn really well too. Some actually looks super creepy. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 - I can't think of an opening or ending of d gray man that is bad. They are all great. The background music comes in at the perfect moment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 - I would spend more time on this but there's just so much important characters in this series that this review would end up being too long. Let me just say that Allen Walker, the MC, is one of my all time favorite character. I love his character design from his white hair to his one demon eye (lol). Unlike a lot of MC i see in action shounen that are USUALLY depicted as either arrogant, loud, obnoxious, or something of the sort, Allen is very humble and soft spoken. I can't even recall a time in the anime where he \"yells\" except for maybe when he argues with Kanda (an important character in the series that is almost the complete opposite of allen). Allen is also brave, kind, and selfless. But what gives his character a lot of personality is his evil and cunning self that comes out when it comes to gambling. He also can be sly and funny. Throughout the series we get to see him cry, get angry, get overly happy, etc. He's a character with a lot of depth & dark background. One thing I love about the show is seeing Allen character development. Not only do we see him get stronger physically, but mentally as well. His ideology also changes as the manga progress. \\n\\n\r\nI actually like almost every character in the show - even the bad guys lol. Everyone has a lot of depth and they all have different personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - I would rather give you 100 dollars then to lie and say it's not enjoyable. One of my all time favorite anime/manga.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 - I feel like the only thing about this anime that prevents a lot of people from giving it a chance is the slow pace in the beginning BUT once you get passed the boring background explanation stuff it's truly a masterpiece.",

It's about Demons and Humans though the main character, Allen Walker, is like half-and-half. He has good friends ,a strange past shrouded with mystery, and was an apprentice who made money for his master as a kid even though his master spent it all and left him behind a lot.\r\nThe story was outstanding for that but kind of was a small cliffhanger making you want more.\r\nThe Art was great along with the sound even though only half the show was dubbed in English I think the Japanese/English Sub was stillbetter. The characters matched well with their personalities with made the series funny, serious, with great fights, and really enjoyable!",

It follows the story of a young exorcist named Allen Walker who lives in a world full of akuma. He and other exorcists dedicate their lives to destroying these demons. It starts a bit slow, my first impression was it was a bit boring and probably not for me but after 2 or 3 episodes i got automatically hooked. It definitely gets better as the story goes on and more characters are being introduced. Seriously, there wasnt a single characterin the series that i didnt love (whether they were good or evil) As I said it starts off a bit slow but around the 3rd season it really picks up and becomes more unpredictable. Definitely worth your time, I always feel a bit sad once a good anime like this one ends.",

But I have enjoyed it so very much.... the one flaw it has, is they only have dubbed half of the show. It's like up to.... 50 something. Then you have to watch it subbed, if you started out watching dubbed. I really liked their English voices and was sad to have to leave them behind, but even so, that has not dented my rating of this anime in any way. The characters are amazing, and they have super great like...perseverance? Something. They don't give up. They havelike a grumpy sort of character, the main one who is positive about everything, and the girl who seems sort of weak at first, but then shows you that she's just as strong.....(I hope that wasn't sexist.) I mean that just like...it's normal, but so much better than the average anime. I love the story, and I do find a lot of the characters attractive. It's just a spectacular anime. So you should watch it! ^_^",

Gray man is NOT its intended ending. The story should go on, but due to the writer (i believe it was) being sick he is not able to continue the work at this time. thus there was this in my eyes forced ending\r\nThe artwork is slacking a bit at somepoints, but overall i enjoyed it very much.\\n\r\nas for sounds, i think the OP's and ED's really fit the serie as well as the sounds during the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters development over the serie is quite good as well. i won't spoil too much of that though. go look and enjoy it :)\\n\\n\r\nSeriously i enjoyed it. then why the 9.... well, i had to wait for a new episode each week -_-' ya i know its unfair but he its my opinion xD\\n\\n\r\noverall i found it a good serie, here and there some flaws and sadly enough that the writer cannot continue the work at this time. i really hope it gets continued since we kinda want to know why the earl has gotten thinner, why tiki's noa is now fully released and what all the level 4 will be like. AAAAAARGH, i wanna see more of it :p",

            "content": "One of my absolute favorite animes (joint 1st place with Prison School). Sub 10 rating awarded b/c the art feels 'flat', characters and their relationships don't really evolve (a la Fairy Tail), the fight choreography is card game-ish. Also, the fights would be more rewarding if they were decided on the basis of a skill or tactical insight which the MC (or other character) had been shown acquiring through training (think Legend of The Condor Hero, 1st season, and Kenichi: TMD). In the case of D.Gray-man, battles are decided by either...\r\n1) Willpower alone (again, in the vain of Fairy Tail), or...\r\n2) The use of anability/skill acquired off-screen, or lastly by...\\n\r\n3) A last-second power-up (otherwise known as an 'ass-pull')\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story is very cohesively structured and develops at just the right pace. Also, every character, from the MC to everyone in the main supporting roster are able to nicely fit into the story, all the while being fully 'individualized', with no boring or non-essential characters among those mentioned. The music is also highly unique and fitting for this series, meshing well with the style and tone of its artwork and the series' general feel. The 'level-up' aspect is also very prominent and well executed.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC, Allen Walker, is another plus of this show. He might not be Mr. Buff-Mcbruteforce like Guts from Berserk, nor does he fit the mold of a suave anti-hero type, but he at very least doesn't have the take-shit-lying-down personality of a Harem protagonist or the neanderthal-like, tantrum-throwing character exemplified by Xin from Kingdom and Natsu from Fairy Tail. Instead I'd say that Allen is gentle without being a spaz, crafty/cheeky without entering into straight-up anti-hero territory, as well as strong while at the same time not being a retard. All-in-all, a quite tolerable, well-rounded MC that one can easily sympathize with and root for.\\n\\n\r\nI'll conclude by simply saying that I view D.Gray-man as the best 'Power-up\" anime there is. So if that's a genre you're into then this series is bound to be up your alley.",

It seemed extremely repetitive. But after watching until episode 50 I never told my friend this but I was hooked. This show was truly amazing. My only problem with the show is that it gets really really really slow at times. Half of the show is extremely slow, but once the anime picks up there is no stopping it. You couldn't stop even if you wanted to. \r\nThe story follows mostly Allen Walker, a 15 yearold boy who wants to kill all of the akuma. On his adventure he meets a bunch of fellow exorcists who share all of his goals. Now we don't get a backstory for all of the characters but even then the story does a good job at giving us some Character development making you really care about each character. \\n\r\nAnyway I would highly recommend this anime, even though its about 8 years old it is still better then most animes out there today.",

            "content": "The first thing that came into my mind when I first heard about D Gray Man in \"boring\" and I thought it's like the \"typical\" shounen anime but well yeah it is. The anime is set in somewhere in 19th century with an action, never ending battles and love interest. \r\nI'm not going to write a summary of the whole story here since they already put it up there. \r\nThe story line and the plot is really good. It's not like the other shounen anime that only have fighting and love scene through out the whole anime, It have funny scenes in there that canactually make you laugh out loud. \\n\\n\r\nI was err amazed(?) and interested throughout the whole anime, thinking about what will happen next, I was just a bit disappointed at the end of the anime. D Gray Man is like some of the anime that is already completed but its not, :/ bare with me here. there is something wrong with the end, it's like a cliff hanger. I'm not satisfied at all. I want more. I want to know what happened next after episode 103. i just wish they will make another season of D Gray Man.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing against the characters. The characters are awesome! There's a mysterious atmosphere hanging around each of the characters. We don't know them that much but you grow to love them as you continue to watch the anime. The antagonists are just awesome. They are not that evil but they are evil. Best words to describe them is the word Sadist. They love to play around with people's mind and feelings and that's what I love in every anime villains. The main guys, Allen is also awesome, he's funny and he's not like one of those annoying main dude. I don't know how to describe it but as I said before you just grow to love them good or bad characters as you watch the anime. not to mean that they are all hawwwt! LOL jks. and plus its really hard to hate any of the characters except the Hitler looking dude (well its my opinion) I really disliked him. you will probably know what when you watch the anime. :)\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to say about the art of D Gray Man, well to be honest I started watching D Gray man because of it's art. It's good, well drawn and the characters are hot :P\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is alright, I don't really pay attention to the opening or closing songs of any anime so I got nothing to say for this as well. kinda boring but its alright.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime, the anime has a fun flavor and I guess  thats what make it different compare to any other shounen anime. I'm not really into gory, bloody and ecchi anime so I really enjoyed watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I can't say that D Gray Man is one of the \"best\" anime I've watched so far but It's a really fun anime to watch. The only thing that I am not satisfied with this anime is the last episode and I want to know more about the characters. It's such a cliff hanger. I guess I should just stick to the manga. but yeah. as I've said before. Its a good anime to watch :) 8/10",

I feel it is very incomplete and that made me a bit sad. But the story is good, and it would be great with more episodes, or a movie of some sort.\r\nThe art, it follows the manga art in the funny moments, When you are supposed to laugh. You laugh, when it is sad you kinda feel the sadness, and angry when the characters are angry. The artis very good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound is great. I really love the moments between Kanda and Allen, and the times when Lavi butts in. The anime has a great sound and you feel very relived at some points.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are really something to love. They are all very different, and they are very loud in some points. They are just enjoyable to look at. I felt that they show us the the characters grow and feel more safe.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really something. Outstanding, Outstanding, Outstanding!!!",

However, lose all those hours I did. D Gray Man found a way to keep me watching it despite the fact that I knew it possessed the same outcome as any other shounen. What was particularly worthy were the opening songs and the characters -I will not lie, the vast majority is highly good looking. I shall also point that it's almost impossible to tell plot-related episodes apart from theones meant to keep you from hating the characters through laughter. Sigh, to my childish mind it got confusing at times and tiring at the very (not so epic) end. But we ought to recognize its superiority above other animes with more than a hundred episodes. For that and the entertaining trips to school during which I would enjoy it, I've decided to grant it a 7",

            "content": "So what can be said about this strange , catching and original anime that is called D gray man. Alot thats what. First of all the plot and story begins while also giving you hints in a mysterious way that you cant help but to want to know more about. Plot is strange forward in one sence kill all the Akumas and its creators but in many ways not so. You might be like me finding the bad guys that appears more appealing then some main characters in it.  You might even feel their pain even if even if some part of you thinkthey deserved it. D- gray creates that grey border between two views in many sences its not good and evil its  more two factions fighting for what they deam to be right.\\n\\n\r\nIt throws you into the view of Allen walker a cursed exhorsist who fights to help the Akumas or demons and help them find peace in the afterlife. Sounds pretty much like any other guy anime right naive stupid dude who fights for the rest of the world. Well allen walker is different in many regards. His point of view is different from exhorsist due to him wanting to save Akumas not just destroys them. His personality is that of a clown sometimes smiling and goofing  around but deep within him is the melancholy of someone who sees that which he shouldnt see but it gives him a more clear view on the world than the Pure black and white view most people have.  \\n\\n\r\nSo it might be obvious but i loved the story and plot around it and never found something to be overly boring. The small episodes there you feel like the tention has gone and it almost gets too fun is to relieve you of what is to come. Its plot might even break  you to tears at times which i can personally atest to it did to me and it might make you laugh out hard about unexpected things. All these things about the story is what i love its got everything. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters is also one of the high points you start to love how even the most grousome character can become fun or hilarious in your eyes. Allen walker for one is fun and crazy while his friends have quirks you end up just love at times. The other side of the grey border with the Akumas also have their share of colorful characters which you just have to smile and enjoy watching. \\n\\n\r\nIt has songs and music you will remember for a long time after watching it because its not only original it has its beautiful parts which you want to listen to again and again. \\n\\n\r\nthe story and characters makes this anime too fun not to watch it builds up a world filled with horror , pain , laugher and when you think you know something you might not be as right as you first thought. \\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9 because i generally have problems calling something a masterpiece but this is a great anime completely different from what is generally made and shown. The anime will want you to want more and more you want to know about everything and everyone. Atleast that was for me :P\\n\r\nSo if you bothered to read my ramble of this great anime i hope that it will help you reach a conclusion and i hope that is to watch this anime. \\n",

            "content": "(After watching episodes 1-25)\r\nVersion: Dub (Funimation) on Hulu.\r\nMusic: To me, first impressions are everything. If I don't care for the opening song, odds are I won't like the series. The first OP sequence is decent, \"INNOCENT SORROW\" performed by abingdon boys school, the same group who did \"Strength\" from Soul Eater. It gives a good first impression to the series as to what to expect. The first ED isn't bad either, but it does want the viewer to keep watching more. The score itself ranges from a creepy, heavy organ to light electronica.\r\nAnimation Style: Semi-realistic. The characters have the typical unnatural hair colors, but atleast the styles don't defy gravity. Every once and a while the characters will turn chibi, but it's no more off-putting than it was in Fullmetal Alchemist. (Which isn't surprising, considering the character design was done by Hideyuki Morioka, who also worked on FMA.) The Akuma themselves are stylized to look other-worldly but still humanoid. However, there is a distinct darkness to everything, with a vast majority of scenes covered in shadows.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: Not bad. Although Todd Haberkorn as Allen Walker tends to be a bit jarring at times. After watching The Tower of Druaga a couple of months ago, it's a bit strange to hear Jil's voice popping up again. The rest of the characters (so far) are well-matched.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Group of supernatural beings attacking humans, and the protagonist with special powers is hunting them. It's a common theme, and in this case, it's an exorcist hunting Akuma. However, the setting is around the turn of the 20th century (\"The End of Fictional 19th Century\"), and there's a pseudo-Steampunk feel to the weaponized Akuma. There's also a nice mix of science and magic, which some series cannot pull of. However, it didn't keep my attention as well as FMA or Soul Eater, and most of the time, I keep it on as background noise. However, the story arcs with Miranda Lotto and the Vampire Krory had my eyes glued to the screen for almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: A-\\n\r\nOverall, if you're a fan of either FMA or Soul Eater, you should be able to enjoy this series as well.",

The manga is still ongoing after the Ms. Katsura (Original Manga Creator - D.Gray-man) started to resume the manga whichthe anime more or less followed. She had a wrist injury from an accident and had undergone treatment for months and finally restarted her story from March 09,2009.\\n\\n\r\nWe Hajime no Ippo fans are having one hell of a season after waiting 9 years since it last aired and aren't we enjoying. Let me give you guys a piece of advice, wait for proper episodes and not week in week out fillers. For now, I have all the reasons to believe there will be a season 3 in a year time, when the weekly manga gets a breathing space for the anime to pull off. we want more dark order exorcists in action, not to mention a start of potential love triangle between allen, lenalee and lavi. you never know. and then there are the other noah we are yet to be introduced, and kanda and allen becoming new marshals.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, its more or less news rather than a review i guess, but all i can say that it was worth spending my hours (minus few fillers midway) and this anime is worth time spend at, if you are not into longer anime anymore being fed up with bleach or naruto, just give d.gray-man a try, you will definitely enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nwaiting for S3, which should be a blast, and ending with komui: LENALEEEEEE!",

            "content": "At first glance, the first episode of D.Gray-Man looks like it has a typical setup - a young hero with special powers saves innocents from a demon, complete with strange, clownish monster designs and an inspiring mini-speech. At this point, you might think that D.Gray-Man would turn out to be an average monster-of-the-week shonen with stock heroism and cardboard villains.\r\nYou would have been utterly and completely wrong.\r\nD.Gray-Man is a show that is made truly great by the strength of its characterization. Sure, the main characters have strong, multifaceted personalities (with still more to discover, even after 103 episodes!), but even the side characters are givenexcellent three-dimensionality, depth, and development. You can never really know *everything* about a person, and the show's exploration of both physical and metaphorical masks hiding the truth is nothing short of superb. \\n\\n\r\nThe characterization of the villains is something else that makes this show really shine. Don't be put off by the Earl's cartoonish appearance and demeanor in the first episode! The antagonists, their motives, and their natures are among the most interesting aspects of this series, and manage to both be genuinely terrifying and yet sympathetic all at once.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot takes a while to really get going, but once it does, it's absolutely astounding. For the first forty episodes or so, there's a lot of well-executed buildup that is very entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, it is suddenly bogged down for about ten episodes with a moronic and largely pointless, frustrating arc. Luckily, skipping or skimming through these episodes will lead you to the second season, which is nothing short of incredible. Tightly plotted, unbelievably emotional, and complex, the second season absolutely blew me out of the water and turned this anime into one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful; scenery and fights are lovingly and carefully drawn out, and the unique character designs for the demons and antagonists are part of what draws viewers in. Sound, especially with the opening and ending themes, is also very well done.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy your action with strong character development, a complex and multilayered plot, and plenty of inspiration and tragedy with just the right amount of comedy, watch D.Gray-Man. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "When I first picked up this series I'm not going to lie I was very interested. We have our young hero Allen Walker fighting off akuma and the millenium earl the mastermind behind them all. This series was an eccentric ride so many twists and turns and so many unique story devices that I was often stopping myself and rewatching episode so that I could make sure I really understood everything that was going on. My only real complaint is that even though this series is indeed 103 episodes long it is still far too short.\r\nStory- An interesting story combining a unique array of sorrow,action, mystery, and comedy in all essence this was hands down my most wisest investment of time since my days of watching Full Metal Alchemists and the first season of Death Note. My only real complaints story wise would have to be at times how rushed things felt and the occasional times where you just felt like either an enemy or a hero was too overpowered.\\n\r\nArt- The art was rather impressive we had a combination of the unique dark and serious style of an action and drama anime with the lighter and funnier side of a comedy styled drawing to ease tension and I'm sure you'll agree with me when I just say that some of the weapon (innocence) drawings were just inventive and awesome beyond all recognition.\\n\r\nSound- This series without a doubt has one of the best soundtracks and voice acting teams I have ever had the presence of gracing my ears. While yes it was not very often that a new sound track was introduced the way the creators varied and used the sound track in combination with the voice acting has earned it my perfect sound scoring.\\n\r\nCharacters- Possibly one of the most unique array of characters I have ever seen in an anime. D. Gray-man was constantly impressing me with how they didn't just stop with introducing the main characters and giving them a back story but making sure that any character that was considered of some importance was given a tiny back story and was playing relevance to the series.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- What can I say it was quite the ride watching this series there were very few moments where I regretted watching and even fewer moments where I was disappointed with the way the story was progressing all I can say is Bravo D.gray-man spite the last few episodes and a slow start you entertained me.\\n\r\nOverall- This is definitely a must see anime for any person who wants to say they are a fan of anime. I guarantee you will not be disappointed after watching this anime although you will have an intense craving to begin reading the manga.",

            "content": "Allen Walker the silver blue eye hottie in D Gray Man which is a shounen,comedy,action,supernatural and buch of blood.\r\nIn the first half of the show you get too meet Allen and Timcanpy Allen's companion and a golem given to him by his Master Cross Marian. Well Cross is missing through the show and while going in missions with Yu Kanda, Allen's first mission through out many missions he meets new friends like Lenalee,Bookman,Lavi,and Krory all become good friends and comrades. Later on this story takes a toll on going with the bad guys called the \"Noah\"which are really cool people to fight over and overagain. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is great I love how they direct this anime the only problem for was the repeting of the same soundtrack over and over again.the openings are awesome I love them all! The endings I only liked some either way the plot just good they only go back to the past on some parts like for peole who barely got their anti akuma weapons, the art is great for it's awesokme architecture and gothic clothing I just love the dresses the hottness,the lollita. The fights they sure a good amount of blood good for the people who love gore and blood there's no censoreship which is good. That's what gets people watching blood and a good plot and a twist of fate at the end that makes you want to read the manga after what you just seened.\\n\\n\r\nI sure read and up to date too, I enjoyed DGM not just for Allen who which is my favorite character not just for his hottness but also his ways of smilling and caring for his friends once you meet and see what type of friend he is you'll say now that's a true friend and theirs many more characters you will love and have a connection with.the enjoyment is over the roof maybe past that worth watching until the end the Noah are the people you have to look for though trust me you will love thios anime I like re watched like 3 times and it never seems to amaze me bored overall I give DGM a 10 for best action, comedy,love scenes,body shots,strong characters that don't give up on their dreams to become great exorcist, archtecture the op an ed songs the hot guys,fights worth re wacthing over and over. \\n\\n\r\nWell I hope you enjoy DGM like I did thanks for reading all this much.hope your choice is too see D Gray Man bye thanks again.",

            "content": "A terribly underrated anime which deserves a new season. I have been watching D.Gray Man for 3 years and I always re-watch it whenever I miss the characters so I can confidently say that I've watched 1030 episodes. Yes, I LOVE this anime and there are plenty of great reasons.\r\nSTORY \r\nHonestly, I can compare this series to Naruto or One Piece or any other typical shounen anime since it does revolve around the main male lead who continues to grow stronger in the hopes to defeat the ultimate enemy...but this is only the tip of the iceberg. \r\nThe plot itself is graced with various genresthat combines action with the darkness. Truthfully, it is a really dark anime with a dash of comedy here and there. But it is not always perky as the story takes you into the depths of grief and despair as the characters constantly are led with death, failure and many more gruesome moments but they slowly grow stronger (slowly...unlike a sudden boost of power that came from a super special training or something.)\\n\r\nOh...important note; yes, there are fillers. But they don't even look/feel like filler episodes. The first time I watched this anime, I went through all 103 episodes without even knowing that there are actually filler episodes. It's amazing. Seriously.\\n\r\nThe darkness of the story itself really attracted me from the beginning and I LOVE it.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nIt does not have the most outstanding art but it is very constant. There is not a lot of change to the art and it is always nice to see a long-paced anime having a very concise art style that does not go out of place and in my personal opinion, gets better gradually as the series progresses. I am personally very driven with good art that elaborates the feel of the actual story. As I've said, the story itself is filled with darkness so the saturation is slightly decreased in several parts of the anime but it maintains the overall emotion.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI love every single one of the OPs and I even have some of them in playlist to this day. As the OP usually exemplifies the anime, I believe they did a great job at choosing the songs as well as animating the sequences with it. They fit the anime perfectly and constantly have the same musical genre which I can appreciate. \\n\r\nThe actual soundtrack is also very fitting of the story and emotions in which we are able to hear music with a lot of classical instruments used to match the setting of the anime. It does not overpower the scenes but instead, supports them very well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThis is by far my most favourite part of this anime. I love almost every single one of its characters and definitely all of the main casts. They provide so much entertainment and depth to the story but what makes me enjoy them the most is how they all come together as one but have very distinct and almost different views and opinions throughout the entire anime. \\n\r\nAnother major point about the characters is how the mangaka created them to be very fragile and almost...realistically human. You rarely see characters that truly beat up a powerful enemy without a single scratch. You constantly see them really struggling whenever they face these powerful foes which sometimes make me feel as if the enemies are unbeatable and invincible. They would always be injured physically or are hurt emotionally. In turn, they become relatable and I truly cherish every single one of them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL\\n\r\nI am totally confident to give this anime a whopping 10/10 because...I just truly enjoy it from start to finish. It gives me the comedic vibes of Naruto with a sinister setting of Kuroshitsuji. I am very disappointed that they simply cut off the anime at a very dynamic point of the manga since they are only beginning to take on the actual enemy and I am always hoping that they would reconsider to continue this anime once the manga is finished. \\n\r\nIf you love a mix of dark and light, this anime is one worth to watch.",

            "content": "I actually really liked this show. It was rather fun to watch and though it was felt like it was done before in a couple other shows, it was mixed tastefully. They actually open the series in a way that actually explains a lot and so we know the story line behind the organization. It doesn\u2019t take to much time to actually hear the background of some of the characters, although I never felt bored of the pacing. The only thing that bugged me was some of the filler episodes that we could have done without, at least, in my mind. There was a littlebit of character development but that could have been placed in a better time more in the story. Still, it\u2019s not a really bad thing, lots of really good shows have filler episodes in them.\\n\\n\r\nAllen is actually really cute. Unfortunately, he isn\u2019t much like a hero; he\u2019s more like a little brother and actually instilled my want to protect the little guy rather then him being the one fighting. I think that\u2019s what makes it a bit interesting for me to be watching. In most other shows, the hero pretty much looks like a hero right off the back or becomes a hero within a couple episodes. He never really changes his looks even during battle. The only difference is his arm which, I\u2019m sorry but reminds me a lot of Fullmetal Alchemist. \\n\\n\r\nYu Kanda feels a lot like Sasuke from Naruto in how his personality is. He is pretty much a by the book man with a chip on his shoulders. I guess you could also think of Lenalee as having a chip on her shoulder as well and it feels ironic that she works with a group she really doesn\u2019t like. I have noticed that at least half way through, almost every exorcist in this show doesn\u2019t really want to be there. I\u2019m talking the ones that have to go out and fight, not the ones in the lab.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork mostly looks like every other show that is out there yet reminds me of Soul Eater in how dark most of the scenes are. Even through its dark, the colors do become bright during the comical parts and I never have much trouble seeing what\u2019s going on. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices are actually quite good, even if some of them are a bit whiny once in a while. Allen is played by Todd Haberkorn, the same person who does North Italy from Hetalia and Firo Prochainezo in Baccano. His voice is somewhat whiny at times but I actually liked this version of him. I can see how some would say he was bad in this but to me, all the more for my thought that he\u2019s rather cute. I guess you could say its like Edward Elric\u2019s from Fullmetal Alchemist. The music actually fits perfectly well with the scenes. I never found a point that the music wasn\u2019t perfect.",

You'll just be irritated on why the enemies are too strong for them.\r\nI was expecting something similar to that when I started watching D.gray-man, as it is a popular anime but I guess I was off the mark. If anything, D.gray-man focuses more on developing its story rather than its fight. However, it wasn't really executed wellimo and did gave me a let down.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights were..horrid.  They will fight without any improvement and keep getting beaten up by the enemies. Even when they get a power up, the enemies that appear will somehow be more stronger than them and then they get beaten up again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give a 7, just for the sole reason of the story being good enough to follow although it is still executed poorly. The character development was good enough though, because they explored more on the story they have more room to do it.",

It is also my coping mechanism for some issues in my life. I cannot be more grateful for this.\\n\\n\r\nWords will never be able to describe how lucky the world is to have D.Gray-Man in it. Why are you not recognising such perfection ;-; I swear, its the perfect things in life that aren't noticed because the world is so imperfect. Pretty much.

I did feel like alot of the things though, were dragged out, like why should fighting the Noah or the level 3 or 4 demons be like, 5 episodes long. I feel like they coulda pushed it down to two maybe three and it would have been enough, like we get it, its an epic battle.. nowlets get back to the story. \\n\\n\r\nI also feel like the journey for cross was dragged on a little to long as well, i remembering thinking to myself \"can they just find him already and move on with it?\" but that was just a minor issue.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves were easily likeable and the story-line was intriguing - however in my head i decided to ship Lavi & Lenalee together even though i knew it would never happen.\\n\\n\r\nI havent read the manga yet so i dont quite know how it ends for real but im left a little disappointed with the ending as they built it up so much and yet.. like miost animes failed to close the series properly. My BIGGEST pet peeve is when they introduce a bunch of new things and leave you hanging - fuck you cliffhanger i hate you. However i've seen worse endings and i suppose they did a fair enough job at ending it since it was already so long and it probably would have gone on forever if they didnt eventually close it off.",

            "content": "Although I was skeptical at first of D. Gray Man, thinking it would be just another mindless action-driven series that just happened to include a dark background, I decided to watch it on the recommendation of a friend... I have never been so glad that I listened to him.\r\nStory (9)- With such a (relatively) long series length, one might expect that the show's plot drags or contains numerous filler episodes, but the true reason for this unusual length is that the show just has so much plot, such great, powerful, and emotional stories that it would be a travesty (there I go again, overdoing it)to force it all into a more standard 24-ish episode length. The show's basic premise is interesting and provides great start for the series, which continues its power throughout. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8)- Even though the animations are more or less average in here, the character designs are unique and memorable. The designs of the characters and the show's intriguing environment make these amazing art designs possible. Allen Walker is one of the most uniquely designed characters in anime, and the art works with this to create a strong experience (who can forget the Millennium Earl's creepily cartoonish appearance?)\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)- For the sake of brevity, I will quickly gloss over this section, which is regrettable, since there were some truly memorable songs in this anime. (one of which almost made me cry... a remarkable feat.) The basic point of music in this anime: it is well done and contributes to the mood, but I personally wish there had been even more of those hauntingly beautiful tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharcters (7)-  The characters here do suffer from being a little flat in the beginning, such as Kanda's gruff \"I despise you all\" demeanor, but as the series progresses, these characters develop in their own time, giving them an almost organic feeling of personal growth (I've even grown a bit of a soft spot for Kanda after learning a bit more about him...)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is not a series to be missed. It consistently does well in all areas, and the only major complaint I have is that there isn't more of it. After completing the entirety of Dubbed episodes on Netflix, I tracked down the rest of the show because I simply couldn't get enough. Sadly, I still can't get enough, which has prompted me to begin the manga. But back to the review! This is a great work, that will tug your heartstrings, loosen its grip for a second, and then firmly yank them again to create a wild roller coaster ride of emotions that is exhilarating and enticing as this is a damn good show.",

Nice. However, the story get's really repetitive towards the end and at a lot of points you will force yourself to watch through it. \r\nArt - 8 :\r\nArt is really nice, great world and animation.\r\nSound - 9 :\r\nAgain, nice sounds and effects.\r\nCharacter - 5 :\r\nThe main character, Allen is not a typical character at all. Allen is not the kind of character that would go forthe greater good and isn't very emotionally strong, crying at every emotional turmoil, don't get me wrong it's good to cry once in a while, but it's taken to a whole new level. \\n\\n\r\nAlong the way, it seems the mangaka forgot who the main character is and instead decided to focus on another character, Lenalee giving her way too much attention and importance. Lenalee herself is another typical too emotional character that seems to cry at every other point, disturbing others.\\n\\n\r\nThere are quite a lot of unique characters in the mix that you love, but the above characters have the most impact.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7 :\\n\r\nThe anime itself end abruptly in the middle of a supposed-to-be long arc confusing you and leaving a lot of unanswered questions, the story has plot holes scattered around. The story also frustrates you at more than one point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nIf you want an anime where you have a typical crying girl and a hero who so conveniently shows up at the last second just to look badass, this is your anime.",

            "content": "Honestly, at the premier of its first episode, I thought D.Gray-man had the potential to be one of my top-5 animes. The first arc had a very dramatic, mystical, intense impact on me. The storyline seemed absolutely interesting to me and looked like one of those awesome shonens that weren't just all fighting but a more well-thought-out storyline possessing shonen that still retained superb action. I really do miss the feel of the first arc. But oh man, during the whole arc with just disgusting fillers, my impression of D-Gray-man just rotted. When it finally got back to the storyline, I thought it was goodbut not as much as the first episodes. Now the show is cancelled/or on hiatus? and I'm very disappointed! I hope they continue the anime soon. I plan to rewatch the first few episodes because I forgot how awesome they were. (It's been years? o_o) Anyways, it was a really awesome anime. A definite recommendation. I'm one of those fans that watch through the fillers of series just to know I watched every episode of the series; but in D.Grayman's case, I suggest people skip the fillers. >_>",

The story uses the regular shounen structure to base the entire series off of; however, a little imagination allows for an epic thriller between extraordinary powers which reside only a little ways from under mankind's nose.\r\nArt - 10. Awesome fanservice on DGM's part, everything was to proportion, and the animation was fluent and nothing short of accurate. It's as if you can experience the pain and hardships brush through your own skin as it did DGM's characters (ok, a little bit of exaggeration, but that tells you how muchI love this show).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10. I've learned to play quite a few songs from DGM on the piano; in fact, DGM is what got me started on playing the piano, and I'm proud to say their soundtrack is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10. Everyone was an individual, with their own personality, likes, dislikes, and problems. Each watcher can connect with one or another character from this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10. Loved. It. The action that ensued was mind boggling and captivating. Right up until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10. Duh, My overall is always the averaged rating the the five other categories. I loved every single episode, and they say it's finished airing, but I believe not, because episode 103 is definitely not a wrap. I've heard rumors about the death of DGM's maker, but I'm still hoping for a continuation for such a fascinating anime.",

I first started watching it on Netflix, the dubbed version (As some people are already aware, the dubbed goes all the way up to episode 51, and continues being subbed). The dubbed voices were all wrong. So I suggest the subbed over the dubbed. I simply thought it would be a shounen anime, but I was clearly wrong. The plot was at first confusing, but after several episodes it was easy to understand. Towards the end of the anime, every important detail was added in a short period of time so it was hard to follow when it's allcoming at once. Which was the only downfall I could think of, really. Other than that, D. Gray Man is very good anime that I would highly recommend. The 103 episodes are worth it.",

And i was right , it caught my attention in the first episode already . The sound was the best , it was for the first time that i listened to the ep and ed at every episode . The story itself has a very original plot , it tells the story of a young boy named Allen Walkerwho becomes an exorcist due to    his master ,Cross . His relationships with the other characters is already unique , thus the characters themselves  are unique , there isn't much of an accent  on the romance genre, but we can imagine ourselves a love triangle 'tween Allen Lavi and Lenalee. i loved the comedy moments or  even the fillers with Komui's experiments , Allen fighting with Yuu and so on .\\n\\n\r\n 'Coz every character  is so different from each other it confers  the best enjoyment to the one who's watching . Allen's personality to be so soft and gentleman like a truly Englishman  in the 18th century, very honest and sometimes childish but with an outstanding power and a unique power to see the demon's soul doubles his suffering and pain and 'sin'. He gives everything into protecting the others that he sometimes forgets  to take care of himself . \\n\\n\r\nEven though the story starts slowly and the presentation of the new characters takes kinda 20 episodes , but it's only the silence before the storm. Allen's arriving  at the Black Order's Headquarters brings everybody together . It forms a team , full of friends which  support each other ( even Yuu sometimes) . \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this to every person who  loves animes or strong bonds, friendship, drama, slow romance, unique characters and so on . 'Coz this anime has everything that an anime needs!!!\\n\\n\r\nThat's all.>-<",

            "content": "I am writing this review after a full enjoyment period of time of almost two and a half months watching D.Gray-man and its 2016 sequel Hallow. I don't know, I will become a bit personal this time and I should confess that it has been a long long time since I felt this feeling of emptiness and sadness of post-anime depression. I will leave apart any relationship with Hallow and I will start then:\r\nD.Gray-man is shonen anime that basically tells the story of an orphan who discovered the power of innocence and is trying to liberate the souls of the unfortunate that have been calledagain to rise from death as machines. As itself, the history sounds a bit trivial, a mixture of somehow a Fullmetal alchemist with some traits of Soul Eater, D.Gray-man evolves from this basic concepts to a more mature and sophisticated story in which lots of different and somehow complex characters are immersed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is remarkable: it is one of the most elaborated and congruent histories that I have experienced in animation since Shingeki no Kyojin.We have a sophisticated plot and a big group of characters that fit into it without any type of improvisation. Of course, there are a couple of filler episodes (I mean, it is a 103 chapter anime), however, I should praise that the history itself didn't require any of them to develop the plot (and some of them I should say are pretty good).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are something also to be praised. I mean, Allen Walker is in no way any annoying shonen hero as, in my opinion, is Eren Jeager. And the history does not only orbit the main character. Some other main and secondary ones, like Kanda, Lenalee, Lavi, etc are remarkable and are constantly developed in a very independent way. However, I should definitely praise the antagonists of this series: they are by far the most complex, effective and well-designed that I have seen in a long period of time. I should mention as example Tyki Mikk, Road and the Millenium Earl (although been such caricaturesque is a wonderful main antagonist)\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both remarkable. Opening 3 and 1 are one of the best openings I have heard in anime, background music is totally well-fitted and the animation itself is very good, with excellent characters and scenarios. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to end up. I should praise D.Gray-Man as probably one of the best animes that I have seen and with the title of the best Shonen anime on my list (yes, better than FMA). I should praise a wonderful imagination, an outstanding history, a group of magnificent characters and a beautiful soundtrack. Probably the history doesn't have the strong moral confrontations that other shonen animes have (again like FMA), however, the sense of loyalty and redemption that it portraits plus all the major points that I previously mentioned make it a total worth and enjoyable recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nOh D.Gray-man... I will for sure miss all the adrenaline and enjoyment that I had before each chapter.\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: \r\nMinor spoilers ahead,maybe\r\nMinor editing was done after I stopped hating the guts out of the last few episodes and got the picture of THAT demon, you know which one, deleted from my head.\r\nD.Gray-man, anime who's name you are bout to mistype around five times when searching for it online. What to say about it? It's about demons and exorcists and hot teenage boys. Y'know instead of marinating my thoughts for two or three sentence summary let me go trough this step by step like a recovering paraplegic.\r\nArt and sound! If you don't have nice art in anime nowadays you might as well just decapitateyourself,don't do that tho it hurts. Art is certainly nice,there's some in depth analysis. Art style is a nice blend of gothic elements are wankery anime of today. This is not a negative thing because it takes firm,smooth character look from modern times and mixes it with some well deserved darkness,considering the whole demon premise. Aesthetics are intriguing in many parts. Animation is used to punctuate needed moments in the anime. Sound is eh ok tho in some moments,few but still worth the mention, it's used to indulge you in the scene. The openings are so-so apart from that one opening I can't quite remember that sounded pretty neat. Arts an 8 because of all the things mentioned above. Sound is 7 but it's nearing 8 so take it as 7,5.\\n\r\nStory! Story is eeeehhh a bit too convoluted so I'll mention some parts that matter.\\n\r\nInnocence-thing that grants you weapons that can slay demons, not everybody can use it and if you abuse innocence you turn into a...thing ,honestly I can't explain what it is. So in short magical weapon thingy.\\n\r\nDemons- there's couple of levels of demons level 1 are lame ones level 2 are stronger ones and level 3 are super strong ones. They are obviously bad guys tho there are some additional baddies,but about that later.\\n\r\nExorcists-guys that fight demons.\\n\r\nThe story ,as mentioned, is convoluted and not that enjoyable. At times it feels stretched to it's limits. What I will mention in this section is power balances of characters. In one episode you'll see three characters fighting against a level 2 demon and having troubles with it but trough few episodes boom they are killing level 2's by dozens. Similar thing happened in few other occasions and I despised it because it was pretty nonsensical. The story isn't awful by any means and even tho I despised many parts of it a 7 is deserved because they made a world you can indulge in and frankly enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacteeerrsssss...are shit. Trust me on this. At the beginning you are having fun and you have three leads: Protagonist, ,,strong,, female and Sasuke(emoish guy). They are later joined by some other characters but they aren't shown frequent enough,despite having more personality than our original trio. What about our trio? Well Protagonist is okay at the beginning being the kind hearted but decisive guy with some angst, I can mostly allow it in this case considering the circumstances, but he kinda stagnates the only thing that changes is how strong and decisive he is. Sure there's character development to him so I can't call him generic but it isn't anything major that I can call it interesting. The female lead is fine for about half the anime and then she becomes the bitchy,whiny,annoying,useless,dime a dozen,obstructing cunt.  Sasuke is almost the same albeit some glimpse is given into his past so there's that. There's one red haired character that joins them who's pretty fun and has duality to him. He's torn between duty and friends etc etc. overall a fun character. What I should mention,and didn't before the edit, is that there are some interesting villains too. There's these Noah peeps,I shan't discuss much about what they are so let's get into individuals. There's four interesting Noah. Road Camelot, a sadistic girl with powers to turn area around her into Alice In Wonderland. Tykki Mikk, gentleman looking malicious asshole. The last two are twins Beavis and Butthead eermm I mean Jastero and Devit. They are numbskulls who are just a bit psychotic and a bit too much idiotic. I did come back to edit this part and now I gotta give this a 7 cause of some good characters. I do heavily dislike doing so because focus was on crap ones. And if you like yaoi your ovaries will be pleased by this anime\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Despite nice animation I didn't enjoy this much. You need something to use your wonderful animation on to amplify it and there wasn't too much of that in here.Too much time was spent on the boring main cast instead of all the fun quirky characters. Also the story doesn't move much there's a lot of dialogue that goes on my nerves,lest we forget the power levels being less solid than pudding. I did however enjoy it slightly, first review was written with bad taste from last few eps so I was a bit more of an arse there. Here's a 7 despite fight scenes being nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nI regret watching this anime because even tho it gave me temporary joy it soon fleeted away under pounds of annoyance this anime contains. I might be a bit sore because of the shite ending but as there is a continuation upcoming I might change my mind tho don't expect it to go higher than 7. \\n\\n\r\nTo be continued in D. Gray-Man: Hallow.\\n",

Even if it was just a shounen anime, they managed to incorporate things like moral gray areas and the corruption of a religion. In the end though, they always fit in down light humor. Not to mention Sanae Kobayashi's screams were fantastic :).  I think the entire first season was slow though. But that's just all the more reason to watch it, because season two gets so much better. I just wish it could've had a more filling ending. It's cancellationwas pretty heartbreaking. Even the manga is at a standstill :(. All in all, this was a great anime, with enough blood to satisfy me but not too much to seem forced. The characters were realistic and relatable. The plot was somewhat original. Allen really kicks ass in season two!",

There we're plenty of episodes to get into and the battle scenes as well as the story worked brilliantly. The only thing that stopped it from receiving a 10/10 was unfortuately the disappointing ending which really has no real signpost staying: 'Hey, he's finally defeated the earl!' It decides to end on a odd cliffhanger of winning the battle but not finishing them off. It's the only thing Ibelieve went wrong, so yeah.",

In a world where demons exist solely to steal, kill, and destroy and the only way to survive is by joining a cult that specializes in killing the demons using weapons that are majestic and known as \"weapons of God\"...I hope you know where I'm going with this, then yeah. That aside, this is my favorite(most interesting) anime. I loved how all the characters had their own melodramatic story backgrounds. During the final episodes, a fight was going down! It was tragic-emotionally and physically for everyone. I would highly recommendpeople watch this anime who enjoy religious warfare, jokes between characters here and there & protagonists who don't always live up to their promises in dire situations. To sum this up I'd say it was mostly just melodrama with cool action, although, some episodes down the line will give you the chills. This is an anime worth watching with plenty of episodes and a scarce amount of fillers.",

Bonus point for me?\r\nAnyway, just my 2 cents.\r\nSTORY: the overall story is good and really interesting. We are shown a world where you can never fully trust common people around you (unless your name is Allen Walker), a world full of mysteries, constantly at war (even if normal people are not aware of it).\r\nThe more you find out about \"Innocence\" and the characters' past, the more you realize there's something big missing and you can't help but crave to go deeper and find out more.\r\nAbout the ending:it was not really an end, but probably somewhere in the middle of the story (manga isn't over yet), so the story still goes on (and, right now, the only way to know more is to start reading the manga)\\n\\n\r\nART: well, some things can really manage to catch your interest\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: while I don't particularly pay much interest to this aspect, I found the choice of some songs to be really fitting for some scenes\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: well, you have a lovely bunch of people with different personalities: from you-have-no-idea-what-I-had-to-do-for-my-master Allen to the supervisor with a sister complex, from I'm-always-grumpy Kanda to oh-dear-god-what-did-I-do Miranda, etc...\\n\r\nThe series had enough episodes (...) to show character's development (which is something I really appreciated) which helped the story to grow and, at least for me, made me more attached to some of the characters\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: it was honestly fun. BUT! the fillers... there were... lots of them. While some of them weren't necessarily a bad thing (it actually helps sometime to change the pace and tone of the story), many others were... avoidable? \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I'm glad this series has been recommended to me and I invite people who didn't watch it to pick it up. As I said, fillers were probably the worst part of this anime (and there are quite a few of them), but they are somewhat understandable: the manga is still ongoing, even if the anime finished 5 years ago (am I the only one hoping that, as soon as more volumes come out, they'll start producing a new season?).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you think you can survive that amount of episodes, some fillers here or there, sad background stories and crazy characters you should definitely give this anime a try.",

Sure, some anime start out with some astounding plots, but towardsthe end, it loses it and turns into fan-service galore.\\n\\n\r\nWhat D.Gray Man will deliver is action, emotional attachment to the characters, and thrilling expectations from episode 1 to its final episode 103.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe originality is strong with this one. \\n\r\nThe world is in its 18th Century, where demons, \"Akuma\", lurk around, disguised as a human who should have already been dead.\\n\\n\r\nExtraordinary beings with the power to eradicate these dark existence, Exorcists, with their blessed power of Innocence, fight against the Earl who aims to grow the number of Akuma.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow Allen Walker, possibly a cute white-haired shota, as he journeys with other Exorcists to defeat the Earl, and find the missing pieces to his broken past.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is really good from something that is understandably old.\\n\r\nIt doesn't feel that cartoon-ish, that will put you off terribly like Pok\u00e9mon's art style, nor not too realistic like GTO, or Hajime no Ippo.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great point in between these two, as there are some gore parts, where Akuma are sliced and diced...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nYeah, since it was set quite in the old past, the music used might be a bit subservient to the ones you hear in anime set in recent times.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the openings for D.Gray Man is quite good, I especially liked Brightdown, might be a bit too metal for some people though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAnother thing that anime now lack is Character Development.\\n\r\n\"Is it really that important?\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you'd like to watch some show that a wimpy MC suddenly becomes some random beast for no reason, then you could totally void this section, but the process of a main character growing is especially essential in a shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nApart from Allen, we do see other guys that girls would totally go crazy for, Lavi and Kanda, for guys, Lena Lee is very pretty as well. :>\\n\\n\r\nD.Gray Man also goes into depth with these \"side\" characters as well, exploring a bit of their past with Allen, or their broken past that made them become Exorcists.\\n\\n\r\nBe ready for deaths, D. Gray Man doesn't give any mercy to deaths, even an insignificant character's death can impact you very strongly.\\n\\n\r\n*Note Episode 1, I cried.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nReally.\\n\r\nSomething that with absolutely no fan-service (or maybe I missed some?), yet that can capture me in so deep. It's really different from the Naruto or Bleach series, where the MC(s) just get stupid power-ups repeatedly, and new bad guys appear to be ridiculously stronger.\\n\\n\r\nD.Gray Man isn't repetitive, and would be ready to surprise you, positively and attract you in, even if you're not that much of a fan of Shounen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIt's really good, I usually give anime I am biased to (harem-based), 7 or 8, but rest assured, D.Gray Man would astound you with only its originality and storyline, not cheap gimmicks like panty flashes, ridiculous number of females or nipples.\\n\\n\\n",

It became pretty much a high demand watch for me.\r\nStory: There was a good and evil concept to the Anime, but there was more than just that side to it.\r\nI wish I could give it a 7 or 8 rating, but the action kind of took away the story, and character development.\r\nArt: I loved how one side of the Anime had the Harry Potter feel and then the other with the Batman-looking characters of the Noah Clan. It coordinatedvery well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The ones that stood out for me were Allen and Road. Road especially. I felt more sympathetic to the Noah Clan than I did the Exorcists. To me, they stole the show!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite the action taking most of the spotlight, I loved it. I loved all the characters, but the Noah Clan nail it! You should watch it and see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's a world you would want to be in and stay!",

The manga is still going, but only new ones volumes once a month for the past 2-3 years. \r\nI know initially the author suffered some medical issues for a whole year which ended up pausing the anime, and that's why it stopped at season 3, but since then new volumes have been coming out very slowly. Its sad to see such an amazinganime die. \\n\\n\r\nI started watching this anime back in 2006 then they stopped airing in 2008, well its 2013 and still there has been no word on any continuation of this series and with so many years going by my hopes have faded away. Voice actors are all grown up and most likely won't be apart of any continuation at this point even if they did make one, and Funimation said they are no longer supporting this anime and will not be dubbing the second season.",

            "content": "If you plan to watch D. Gray man, a small piece of advice first. Do not underestimate it. In the beginning, it might seem to you like a typical shounen. Small arcs, many fights and slow plot progression. But, if you manage to endure that you will be well rewarded with an anime that approaches perfection. The story starts to deepen and gets complicated, but that won't tire you one bit. The more you watch, the more captivating it gets sucking you inside with intesive action, mature plot and incredible character power ups. On the downside, the story finishes somewhat abruptly because of the suddencanceling of the series. Shame though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the point where DGM shines. While in your typical shounen almost noone dies, that's not the case here. You will be introduced to several supporting characters and while their background and past will be explained in detail, they will be eventually killed. Right as you begin to feel some sympathy, seeing what they've been through. The emotions the characters, main or not, carry are plenty and make you develop a bond with them. You will feel sadness many times as you will witness the deaths of people you will start to like. Not only that, the cast is what drives the plot onward, not the story itself. And that is both interesting and excellent to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is dark, with most battles taking place at night. Even in daylight, you will experience combat under rainfall and black clouds, adding more to the drama. The element of shadows is really strong but there are times where light will illuminate everything. The character models are natural, realistic and very fluent. The landscapes, cities and buildings are detailed as well and usually are bustling with life. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is possibly the weakest part of DGM and the reason it fails to reach perfection. The background music is poor and hardly noticeable, while it has no diversity. It's just the same themes over and over again. The opening and ending themes are fine though. They tend to become more \"heavy\" as the story progresses, something that matches the plot. Sadly, you will possibly find yourself skipping them many times.\\n\\n\r\nYou will enjoy it without much effort. DGM has a perfect mix of comedy, drama, suffering and matureness, all in equal and balanced doses. Even the filler episodes are hardly distinguishable and very fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's an excellent, mature shounen with a character development that is both unique and fantastic. Definitely worth watching and be certain DGM has its own way to captivate you and keep you hooked until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9",

To tell the truth, it became instant hit but declined rapidly. \r\nCurrently, I am watching it because i want to what they changed from the manga and i think they changed it too much. In other words, they took out some of the good scenes from the manga that should have been in the anime. \r\nThe pacing is fine at the same time slow. It gets a bit boring and fight scenes tend to be long. \r\nThe OPs and EDs are good and suits the anime well. \r\nSo far, it is good but notas good as the manga. I suggest reading the manga first to tell the difference. I will update this review after i finished watching it.\\n\\n",

The premise is interesting enough after all; a dark force is turning people into monsters and the Exorcists stop them.\r\nThere's a bit of mystery about where the main character comes from and what his unique role is in everything, but the reason I dropped this show is because IT NEVER GETS ANY BETTER. \r\nLook, I gave this thing over 50 episodes to show me something. Character development. Plot development. SOMETHING. In the end, it'shard to put my finger on it, but I can say that if you watch three episodes and aren't gripped by it, you should probably drop it too. It won't get any better later.",

            "content": "Even though it is pretty long, D. Gray Man is anime that keeps you on the edge with every single episode. Thus, making it pretty fast to watch. What I liked most about this anime is the little gloomy and dark atmosphere it has, the way it represents death. The pitiful Akumas with their tortured souls, who never wished to be brought back only to serve as weapons in a war they never even knew about. And on the other side are the Exorcists - often described as mere tools of the Black Order but at the same time fighting bravely, risking their own livesfor the sake of the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character - Allen is exactly what you'd expect from a main character. However, there a times when he can surprise you.  The connection with his Innocence, the way he progresses to perfect it were amazingly done. Other character that make this show even more entertaining, in my opinion, are Kanda, Lavi and the Noah such as Road and Tyki.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason here for me to give this show a score of 9 and not 10 is that, event though the story is suggesting many mysteries and plot twist, many of them were left unanswered or were rushed and not developed to their full potential. Even the fact that after so many year we got to see the continuation with  \"D.Gray-man Hallow\", I was still left a bit disappointed in the end. But that, of course, does not mean it is not worth to watch. And if you are reading this review and you haven't already seen  this amazing anime called D. Gray Man  - Do it!!! :)",
