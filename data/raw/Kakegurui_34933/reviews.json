The rest I spent foolishly.\u201d \u2013 George Raft.\r\nTo those of you who have watched Kakegurui I ask: Why did you watch this anime? Were you intrigued by the aesthetic look of the show? Or maybe what drew you to Kakegurui was the concept; gambling! The latter was what caught my eye, as past experiences with gambling anime have proven that they hold some of the most entertaining and exhilarating moments I have ever seen. These shows have given me goose bumps from sheer awe and admiration while watching psychological battles of witsand strategy between people willing to risk their very lives on even the simplest of games. Unfortunately, these kinds of anime are extremely rare to come by, as nearly all of them are practically unknown to most of the anime community and nearly impossible to watch any of them legally. So when I saw that Kakegurui was airing this season and also happened to be the most popular show of Summer 2017, I was pretty excited. I had heard good things about the manga and it was being produced by Studio MAPPA, a studio that I have high hopes for despite not being impressed with any of their previous works. All that was left for me to do was watch it, and this is where the hype for this show died for me. I was disappointed with Kakegurui from episode 1, because even after just one episode, it is obvious to see that Kakegurui is a terrible gambling anime.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui takes place in Hyakkaou Private Academy, a prestigious school where the student are the most wealthy and privileged students in all of Japan. I use the term school lightly because there seems to be no actual classes or learning happening, instead the school is more like a gambling den, where every student partakes in gambling. They bet their fortunes against one another regularly, and those who become in debt are practically slaves to the holders of their wealth. The show focuses of Yumeko Jabami, a new student who gambles for the fun of it and is really good at it; too good, in fact. Her actions end up disrupting the student hierarchy of Hyakkaou Academy, causing the Student Council to come up with ways to stop her. Throughout the show, Yumeko befriends beta cuck bitch-boy Ryouta Suzui and fellow gambling gal Meari Saotome who help her as she gambles to her heart\u2019s content. Ironically, Yumeko\u2019s first gamble at the academy is against Meari, and it is here where the first major problem of the show lies.\\n\\n\r\nThe game Yumeko and Meari play is a card-game variation of rock-paper-scissors where the crowd of people watching them write the symbol of \u201crock\u201d, \u201cpaper\u201d or \u201cscissors\u201d on cards, where they are collected and put into a box for both players to draw three cards and play the game. Meari manipulates the majority of the class\u2019 votes to her advantage, however Yumeko still wins decisively and reveals exactly how Meari cheated. Throughout the entire game, the audience is given no insight into what Yumeko is thinking or even a hint as to how she was able to figure out Meari\u2019s scheme until it is given through exposition after she has already won. As such, viewers are forced to believe Yumeko was able to piece everything together without fault. Doing this is lazy of the writers as it solely relies on having to tell the audience what happened, rather than show it as it is happening. This problem is apparent in every gamble in the show and kills the opportunity for viewers to engage with the gambling games and the characters playing said games. The games themselves are also poorly constructed; some come off as unnecessarily complex, others are just too simple and easy to beat. Being marketed as a gambling anime makes the show look incredibly dumb and retarded, taking away the chance to get excited for how these games play out. And that leads to what I feel is the 2nd biggest issue with this anime: no thrills.\\n\\n\r\nAs you watch Kakagurui, you begin to notice a couple patterns with each gamble: High-stakes are never fully realised, every female character is bat-shit insane and \u201cYumeko wins LOL\u201d. Seriously, even when Yumeko loses like in episode 3, she has no repercussions from losing. Because the audience is always watching from the perspective of either a mere onlooker or one of Yumeko\u2019s opponents, she always comes across as too good for every situation she is placed in. Because of this she rids the show of any tension it could have had. And when you figure out that most of the time Yumeko gambles, she barely even uses a complete strategy, relying on pure luck to win at random times, which feels like a slap in the face to anyone expecting consistency and/or intelligence from this show. The fact that there are no actual punishments fulfilled from losing a high-stakes gamble also hinders the joy and excitement viewers get from watching. Now while there are consequences for being in an extreme amount of debt (e.g. house pet, Meari\u2019s \u201cLife Schedule\u201d), you never actually see the show go through with these consequences and even then, the punishment for losing rarely ever matches the reward for winning. And in Yumeko\u2019s case, the money she wins never really matters to her at all. She is the kind of sadomasochist that would throw countless amounts of money away to feel satisfied with how high the risk of losing a gamble is. Yet the show never goes through with these risks. So I\u2019m left here after watching each gamble asking myself \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d. A lot of fans of the show have been saying that Kakegurui is not a gambling anime, but a great thriller, and I just cannot agree with that statement at all. It is a mediocre thriller at best and that is only if you turn your brain off.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, this show stretches one\u2019s suspension of disbelief so much that you would think this has the quality of fanfiction-level writing. Not just with the gambling aspect of it, but the entire setting is fucking retarded. From the very start I was always curious why there were so many students at Hyakkaou Academy and why they would all gamble. But as I continued watching, the curiosity turned into frustration because it became apparent that there is no proper reason why so many students would stay there or continue to engage in gambling than to make Yumeko even more perfect than what she already is. Yumeko exposes a lot of the games played in gambles as cheat ways to get other in debt, yet that never changes the amount of gambling that takes place within the academy, and that is because most of the students in the background are ignorant buffoons. I would also like to know why only one adult to my memory has appeared in the entire 12 episodes. ONE! I cannot imagine such a prestigious academy to only have one adult working at the academy, but it makes sense with the amount of betting that takes place so regularly. And how in the world are guns and kidnapping allowed? And why does being in extreme debt eventually lead to a life sentence that dictates you to a wealthy future? So many questions that are never explained because this show is not about logic. It tries to look smart but just comes off as a dumb piece of shit. Calling this show psychological is pure lunacy; if anything, it is psycho-sexual because any real sense of logic got thrown out the fucking window!\\n\\n\r\nNearly every character in this show pissed me off. I have already stated how Yumeko is convoluted out her own ass and is like a vacuum sucking all the excitement away from the show, but she seems like God\u2019s gift to this show when compared to every other character. Meari, who seemed like she had potential, starting off as a cocky bitch that is humbled by Yumeko before being humiliated by the student council. Sadly, she turned out to be a weaker clone of Yumeko by episode 4 and is only used as a way to explain other games Yumeko plays as the story goes on. Fucking waste of potential. Ryouta is their other friend, but honestly he does nothing in this show. He just reacts to shit happening around him and nods in response and is a waste of space. Fuck him. The only other characters that matter are the one-note members of the student council that only matter for the one episode they are in before getting pushed to the side. Dishonourable mention to eyepatch-girl with the revolver fetish and a chronic masturbation habit, edgy bitch. Although, there is this one supporting character who literally tried to rape Yumeko that was unironically my favourite character purely for that one moment. All kidding aside, every character is awful in their own way and make the show even more predictable and boring.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the production, from a company like Studio MAPPA I was really disappointed. The art style is not impressive, most of the female character designs are generic, backgrounds are fairly basic and visual effect are for the most part impressive. The most controversial feature of the animation has to be the facial expressions and I have mixed feelings about them. On one hand, they showcase how broken and mentally unstable these characters get at times, but these faces just do not fit the visual look of the show and come off as cringe-inducing to me. The fan-service used is also off-putting to me, seemingly thrown in at random intervals in each episode. Yumeko pretending to be a cat was a definite low point for my enjoyment and did more to prove to me that it cares more about sex appeal than anything of substance. The music used was fine to me, with the OP being perhaps the best part of the entire show, which is not a hard feat. The ED however, was nice to listen to once but afterwards was always skipped, as I don\u2019t see how Yumeko walking for 90 seconds as her breasts bounce constantly is worth seeing more than once. The voice acting was fine until characters went into their crazy stage and felt artificial and forced, but I suppose that fits the show unintentionally.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Kakegurui was pretty awful, filled with formulaic, villain-of-the-week gambling matches that felt like a waste of time once it was all over. In the end it was only trying to entertaining on a superficial level; it was never attempting to have a real identity, besides being yuri fapbait. Now I have no problem with anyone who liked the show; you are free to like and enjoy whatever anime you want to, but if someone were to ask me if I enjoyed it? HELL NAW. Lemme put it this way: If you liked Mirai Nikki and Akame ga Kill, you\u2019ll probably enjoy this. But if you are anything like myself and thought those two shows were terrible, Kakegurui ain\u2019t gonna be worth your time. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m off to watch something that is actually worth my time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Ongoing 12-episode Series Preview) \r\n\"Kakegurui\" easily won my heart from episode 1. Although I've only seen four episodes so far, I was more than excited to write a review about this, and can't wait to see more. Its premise is straightforward, but the execution is stunning. Its strengths lie in its dynamic facial expressions, fair storytelling, and high-quality artistry. The aesthetic expression, in all aspects, always manage to complement the mood and tone of the story. Small details, such as lighting, eyes, mouth, wrinkles, all contribute to the viewer's experience.\r\nThe main protagonists Jabami and Suzui both act as archetypal foils to another. This juxtaposition allowsthe viewer to further appreciate the mood, complexity, and humor of the show. The gambling matches reflect those of a videogame 'boss' battle, each having its own unique characteristics, patterns, and spins. This keeps the show exciting and leaves the viewer wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nThe result of the matches are hard to predict, and steps away from stereotypical 'cheap' wins that similar anime fall into. The insanity and savvy of the Compulsive Gambler is highlighted by their philosophy, which isn't introduced through cheap narration, rather through gameplay and thoughtful dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend \"Kakegurui\" for those who enjoy psychological thrillers, nuanced expression, and those who appreciate visually pleasing shows. I really enjoyed this anime, and I'm glad that I picked this up.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not a fan of using buzzwords but it\u2019s hard to ignore the edginess when watching Kakegurui. Based on the manga of the same name, this adaptation translates to a gambling story. I can\u2019t help but think of a wicked thriller when watching this show. It basically takes the idea of gambling and transform it into madness with its characters, setting, and ideas. However, does it live up its hype and worth watching? The answer is quite the opposite.\r\nGetting into this show for some people will likely not be easy. It\u2019s not a recommendable show for anyone unless you really fancy a psychological thriller thatdeals with a crazy cast of characters. The show itself takes place at Hyakkaou Academy. It\u2019s a peculiar school that prepares students for proficiency related to strategizing, mental strength, and of course gambling. To survive, you have to outsmart your opponents and become part of the hierarchy. In other words, it\u2019s survival of the fittest.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode definitely will get you into the mood as we meet Yumeko Jabami, the main protagonist and new transfer student. While Jabami may seem like an ordinary girl at first glance, it\u2019s easy to notice how far she is from normal once she gets herself involved in gambling games. The show chronicles her school days as she takes on opponents with high risk. I mean, it\u2019s gambling. There\u2019s always risk but what\u2019s peculiar about Jabami is that she gambles for the thrill of it rather than for fame or money. In addition, the show makes it clear that Jabami is intelligent as she quickly learns the inside and outside of the school\u2019s gambling games. In fact, there are episodes where Jabami beats her opponents at their own game. However, I can\u2019t firmly say that Jabami\u2019s personality is one that people can appreciate. She is highly unpredictable and truly enjoys the thrill of gambling. From every episode, she has orgasmic reactions when she thinks about gambling. To a certain extent, the show truly wants us to accept Jabami for who she is but I find it difficult to do so. The reason she gambles is irrational and I can hardly find her relatable to anyone. Not to mention, this show doesn\u2019t do an adequate job of getting viewers to understand her better. Her morality regarding gambling is absurd and really lacks reason. She just wants to gamble and treats it as the most exciting thing in the world. I also have to confess that Jabami\u2019s character change from an elegant beauty to a psychotic freak to be difficult to watch at times. In retrospect, Jabami has a lot of flaws in her character and this show doesn\u2019t do a decent job at repairing them.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Jabami, the majority of the cast isn\u2019t far off from their psychotic characteristics. Mary Saotome, the first gambling opponent of Jabami at the school shows her own crazy antics. The majority of the student council has various characters ranging from the mysterious president Kirari Momobami, the violent head of Beautification Committee Midari Ikishima, the calculating Kaede Manyuda, part-time idol Yumemi Yumemite, nail loving Itsuki Sumeragi, and among others. The show tries to make them appealing by injecting their personalities in the most devious way possible. What we get as a result are weak background stories, generic characteristics, and abominable morals. To me, these characters are pretty much all the same and serve as an obstacle to Jabami. The show has Jabami fighting against some of the key members of the student council but the result usually ends up being extremely predictable.  To be quite honest, the anime itself is nothing short but predictable from the start. Even though Jabami isn\u2019t invulnerable to losing, it doesn\u2019t make us feel anything about her situation when she does. Jabami herself doesn\u2019t even seem to care and in many ways, the show tries to express offbeat ideas that come out as uninspiring. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter relationships in this anime is also very questionable. The most normal character at the school would probably be Ryouta Suzui, one of Jabami\u2019s very few allies. He has a very lack-luster personality and I honestly feel like this show would be much better if he didn\u2019t exist. His relationship with Jabami is easily forgettable as the two are very polar opposites. Others also make him look like a fool and to be quite honest, it\u2019s pretty much what he is. That being said, the show makes it clear that the society has many fools. Thanks to the hierarchy that the student council president has made, there are those that are labeled as \u201chouse pets\u201d. Essentially, house pets are those that sink into large debts and are mistreated by the public. Why? It\u2019s the simplicity of social status. Unfortunately, we never really get a full understanding on why this system exists as the show focuses way too much on Jabami\u2019s gambling adventures than anything else. It\u2019s one of the major weakness of the show as everything seems to be about Jabami. The show is like a loop with the same formula. Jabami faces off against an opponent, plays against them at their own game, and gets the orgasmic thrills of it. It becomes tedious fast and lacks substance because of Jabami\u2019s morals. I also don\u2019t really find the games themselves to be thrilling as most are predictable. The games puts emphasis on psychology rather than strategy so don\u2019t expect this show to be smart in any way. I mean, a good majority of the gamblers cheat, manipulate, and do anything to win. Then, there\u2019s Jabami who just wants to enjoy the ecstasy of gambling. On the plus side, adaptation standards remain mostly faithful as the show captures the expressive faces of the characters. Each chapter is adapted carefully with panel by panel storytelling. However, it\u2019s still an incomplete adaptation because manga itself is ongoing. A 1-cour adaptation like this really leaves open a lot of questions and doesn\u2019t tie any loose ends in the end. There\u2019s also original content added in for this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Studio MAPPA, the producers apparently went all out to bring out the sheer entertainment value as much as possible. First, there\u2019s the character expressions that really borderlines inhuman insanity. The art shift is pretty noticeable for almost every gambler in this anime. One minute, they look normal but as soon as gambling business picks up, they go full facial with highly stylized features. Jabami is the guiltiest of this with her psychotic eyes, intense blushing, and body language. The show decorates itself with fan service although this sometimes looks like a satire. Also, it seems this show can\u2019t sometimes hold back on the violence so don\u2019t be surprised if you see blood, vomiting, etc. It\u2019s a crazy world after all.\\n\\n\r\nBy technical elements, Kakegurui\u2019s soundtrack, music, and voice acting is impressive. The theme songs are very stylistic with piano chords, eerie beats, and haunting lyrics. Both theme songs also have a clever tempo that matches the momentum of its creativity. Plus, it\u2019s also hard to ignore the show\u2019s OST during any gambling match when it\u2019s at its highest point. Finally, I have to admit that a good amount of character personality comes from the voices. This could likely be Saori Hayami\u2019s best role to date as Jabami. She had a lot of different voice acting roles in the past before but to me, her character in this show stood out the most. If there\u2019s anything to take away from this anime, it\u2019s to remember the talents of the voices.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kakegurui turned out to be a cheap cash grab that serves as a giant advertisement of the manga. It\u2019s hard to forgive this show when the storytelling is so blend and the characters are brutally depressing to watch. The anime tried far too hard to sell whatever it intended to and ended up delivering a nakedly dumb adaptation. Some of the visual elements, music, and voice acting saved this show from total catastrophe. However, it still makes this show look like a crude joke.\\n",

            "content": "For over the past few years in the anime industry, they brought as so many ''Game'' genre animes like SAO, Accel World, Log Horizon, Btooom! and other ''Game'' animes out there. But the thing is, most of them or should I say ''Almost'' of the anime with a ''Game'' genre are about going into a video game itself and it's getting boring tbh. Summer 2017 season is going to end along with one of its unique ''Game'' anime which is very different to other animes this season because not only it excels to the ''Game'' genre with being different to other animes out there butalso it excels on the psychological part of it. Welcome to Kakegurui. A 12-episodes anime that offers both the craziness of gambling and mechanism of it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nKakegurui brought as a simple story where a student (Jabami Yumeko) just wants to gamble even further, exceeding the expectations of a normal human being like her subordinate Suzui Ryouta.\\n\r\nGambling for her is like soft drinks which has a very good feeling to the body. Not only she's crazy but also she's competitive that from the beginning of the anime (Episode 1 - 3) she has taken an interest to gamble every member of the school's Student Council. The story focuses about competition and power through gambling. If one is a failure, he/she is automatically dropped on this anime's atmosphere. If one is successful, he/she will be consider as an elite on this school. Kakegurui is unique itself from its setup of the school. Normally, school animes are about high school life, romance and other stuffs, but here, competition is a must.\\n\r\nThat's what makes Kakegurui a worth-to-watch anime this season because of its characters focusing on one goal. To be the best. But of course Yumeko is an exception. She just loves gambling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime famous this season is the art of the anime. Mostly, it's about the facial expression of each characters whenever they are thinking, devastated, or confident on winning. Some actually see it as a disturbing one but on my opinion, it reflects the character's attitude and thats the reason it's excellent.\\n\r\nThough it's not only the facial expression. The normal sketches of the anime is already good you know. Though sometimes you think that the normal face is lacking something but when the expression changes drastically, you are quite shocked.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nDo you ever get the feeling that something is going to happen when the sound changes? Or something feel ''uneasy'', well there are parts on Kakegurui that will offer you some a little bit of suspense. Just a little because if it goes high, well this will be a horror anime. Speaking of sound, the opening is excellent with the jazz and music on it. Then followed up by a change of music with the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, from episode 1 - 12, we have seen all the character's traits and development because of the good plot that Kakegurui brought as, though some are lacking history while others are rich of it. As for the MC she's an exception though we can see her development pretty quickly along with some other characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this anime is pretty simple. To see how the character's react, think and make decisions on every game and the anime did it on a splendid well. With gambling as the main core, they derived their strategies and make it simple for the audience to understand like us. I don't know any rules about any gambling games but I understand it a little because of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.. I rate this anime as 8.5/10 or 8/10 for the fact that it focuses on its genre more, character development and the craziness it offers to us this Summer 2017 season.",

            "content": "Gambling is a fairly common topic in manga, though it is seldom adapted into an anime. There is good reason for this: there is little in the way of action that would benefit from adaptation, and exposition really drags on when it needs to be voiced rather than just read. And alongside these conceptual problems, there's the moral repugnancy that Kakegurui revels in, which should serve to further alienate any potential audience. But despite all of this, Kakegurui has somehow won against a stacked deck, and in this review, I'll take a look at how this oddball became a mainstream success.\r\nThis anime covers the first27 chapters of the manga, and then adds on an anime exclusive ending. These chapters essentially serve as an introduction to the world of Kakegurui, establishing the characters and the rules that the world follows. It\u2019s really just setup for the much more interesting second arc, though considering the events of the new ending, I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nIn gambling, there are always two games going on. There\u2019s the game that the characters are playing on the table, but there\u2019s also all of the mind games and cheating that are going on surrounding it. Pretty much all of the games played in Kakegurui are original, though simple and straightforward enough that the audience can quickly understand them. On the other hand, some of the tricks employed are poorly explained, which can be frustrating. But despite the occasional misstep, the gambles generally succeed in remaining tense throughout.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the cast of Kakegurui are terrible. And by that, I don\u2019t mean that they\u2019re terrible characters, but that they\u2019re terrible people. They\u2019re manipulative and sadistic, and with few redeeming traits. But while their actions are regularly cartoonishly evil, there is actually a bit of humanity behind them. For example, there\u2019s a scene in episode eight where one of the villains talks about her ambitions of becoming an actress, and while it in no way justifies any of her behavior, it begins to make her understandable. This pays off when once-villains return as allies, which happens twice in the territory covered by the anime, and a lot more in the next arc. These are easily my favorite games in the series, because Yumeko isn\u2019t actually a very interesting gambler. She can fix dice rolls and memorize things to an insane degree; she\u2019s too good for there ever to be any worry of her losing, and she lacks motivations that the viewer can get behind. Luckily, the show seems to understand this, and often adopts the perspective of her opponents, which keeps tensions high.\\n\\n\r\nBut while I may not particularly like Yumeko, her portrayal by Hayami Saori is easily the highlight of the series. She seamlessly transitions between ladylike calm, playful teasing, and manic edge, and I could not imagine any other seiyu being as perfect a fit for the character. Besides that, the rest of the cast also delivers nicely, but Yumeko is a step above. In regards to the music, it does an excellent job of setting the mood, both through its fantastic opening and the almost constant jazzy background music, and the only place it really stumbles is in the ending theme, which falls behind the standard set by the rest of the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s been a lot of praise given to this anime for its faithfulness in recreating the wild facial expressions from the manga, and I\u2019m not sure that I agree. These faces worked great as single frames, but when they need to be put into motion, they lose the sharpness that made them so iconic. In addition, by focusing so much on faces, other details can suffer. In particular, hands are regularly animated with 3dcg, which is really off-putting once you begin to notice it. But credit where it's due, the opening theme, directed by Yamamoto Sayo, is a real spectacle. Kakegurui is always visually ambitious, and when it works, it can be fantastic, but more often than not, it\u2019s more than Studio MAPPA can handle. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kakegurui has its faults, but it has also demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to make a gambling adaptation work. I would love to see more gambling shows in the future, and hopefully Kakegurui's success will pave the road for that to happen.",

            "content": "A word of caution before getting into this review: There will be minor spoilers. \r\nI thought that overall, Kakegurui was pretty damn fun and enjoyable. 6 may seem like a bad score, but I think it's fair. I scored it based on what it says by it, and it means \"Fine\". Perfectly how I would describe this when I look at this as objectively as possible in my review, and not out of pure enjoyment (else it'd be a 7 or 8, to be honest). Now with that out of the way, into the review. \r\nCHARACTERS \r\nLet's start out with the characters. The majority ofthe notable characters are female. I find this rather unique in a gambling anime since this very rarely happens. The majority of characters also show a crazy side, most of them being female since, as I've said before, most of the notable characters are female. While this isn't anything new, it's understandable since this is gambling themed and gambling can make people go nuts, and this sort of side can add to the excitement or fun of the series, it can also understandably get either dull or ridiculous at times, more likely than not being ridiculous since it often displays most of the characters' crazy side in an exaggerated fashion. There's also one who is just insane all-around, which is the one with the eye-patch, as you probably already would have expected when judging sorely on her appearance in the opening. With how she is, I sometimes wonder to myself why she is even allowed to attend the school. Even when this trait often comes in with the characters, there's quite a good number of characters who either have character development or depth. This even includes Ryouta Suzui, the male main character and one of the most \"normal\" notable characters of the series. Despite the fact that he mostly sits around and watch the games that the main character (Yumeko) participates in while asking and answering questions, even he will gain bits of a type of character development over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is one thing I noticed about the characters, and that all you pretty much ever see are teenagers. Not really any adults. That's not to say that there aren't any in the series, because there are, but with the exception of the one and only teacher you'll ever see that appeared for a very short time and practically the only time in the very first episode, the few that appear in flashbacks, and a few of them talking a little bit to a character in one episode,  there's practically no adults shown to be present. I find this very weird. Who is running the school? Is that person or are those group of people running it indirectly? If they are, do they even care much as to what is going on around the school, like what the student council president making such a system for every student in it to follow? We never know these answers.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move onto the main character, Yumeko. She is your typical character in gambling series that is very good or intelligent that rarely loses. In fact, Yumeko is the usual \"mysterious transfer student that is surprising good at what is essential to this series\" general trope. She's also the usual crazy girl trope when it comes to gambling, having traits like being aroused in a few of them. So you can see that she's quite the typical character in numerous ways. Despite being crazy in gambles, she has likable qualities, the main thing being that she's very kind and actually cares about her friends. There are quite a number of things that I find about her that is more unique or enjoyable to me as the main character. One thing is the fact that she doesn't mainly gamble for the sake of others, because if she did, she would have aimed to defeat the student council in order to stop the sort of corrupted system and to put an end to the corrupted student council. As it usually goes with mysterious main characters, you will learn more about Yumeko as the series progresses and understand even more about her character. The series will unwrap more and more about her personality, which is what the ending theme of this series symbolizes. You will learn things like how she enjoys both herself and her opponent feeling the same pain while both having the chances of winning or losing, and since she likes to risk as much as she could, she'll make sure that her opponent does the same, which would bring great worry to them. The way she feels and witnesses pain in the gambles is full of pleasure. Pretty much a type of hedonist, in short. With these types of numerous aspects of her character, you will understand why many other characters who has a crazy side and are in such a crazy environment will even deem her as being insane, which includes the one who is pretty much completely insane all-around. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, you will only learn the mysteries of her personality. You will not learn much when it comes to her background. It'll unravel a little bit of it at one point in the series, but nothing more than that, and it doesn't look like we'll be able to get anymore than that in the anime series due to how the series ends with it's own, anime-original ending (so it looks like there won't be a second season, though I could be wrong on this). You'll have to go through the original source of it all, the manga of this series (which is still on-going by the time I've made this review) if you want to possibly know more about her background. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY AND SETTING\\n\\n\r\nNext, I talk about the story and setting. The story is simple to follow and know what is going on. Nothing really complicated. The premise, the general setting's rules and what they need to do in order to survive around the school, and even the games themselves are easy to follow. As the anime progresses, you will learn more and more about the school and some things behind the main character. The pacing, for the most part, is also fine. The roller coaster keeps on going nonstop without anything feeling slow-paced, and, for most of what is going on, not rushed at all. Surprisingly, even though this series is filled with pretty looking high-school girls, there's not that much fanservice, or at least anything as strong as the ones in the opening and ending. That's pretty much the most you'll get when it comes to fanservice. There's quite a number of teases, and there are a few scenes like bouncing boobs and boob grabs, but they are very minor in numbers. In fact, as far as I remember, the manga of this has a lot more fanservice than this adaption of it. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all of this however, when you think about it, the story is pretty basic and average. Not really much special, even though there are some nice twists here and there, this in a gambling high school, and the main character doesn't gamble for justice. The usual mysterious transfer student who turns out to be good at what is essential to the series is gambling and defeating anyone standing in the main character's way while aiming to challenge the big-bad is what you can pretty much say about what is going on the whole time. There's also the fact that the setting is literally only in high school. There is almost nowhere else they go. Nearly everything that happens in this series happens only at that exact same school. So if you're expecting them to go literally anywhere else outside of the school grounds even a decent amount of times, then you'll be disappointed. In fact, you would very rarely even see them even going outside of school. You will never see any of the characters' homes. It's pretty weird, as if it wasn't weird enough that you don't really see any adults. \\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the series is quite dark, but not that serious, to be honest. It is marked as a drama series and definitely does have some serious moments, along with very dangerous and risky elements, but still not that serious overall. I would say that despite how dark it clearly is, it mainly portrays itself as being lively and fun, so if you are expecting this to be something pretty serious, you might be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAs an adaption of the manga, it has done pretty well for the most part. It has been extremely faithful to the manga while doing a few things in it's own styles, although they did skip a notable amount of things, and the final episode went into it's own original direction to end things instead of continuing to being faithful to the manga, which is odd when this suddenly happened. To be honest, I find the way it decided to end things in the final episode to be disappointing, and that it just gave me even more of a feeling that this really should have had a couple more episodes in order to adapt the next event that would have been a worthy stopping point to the series in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nGAMES\\n\\n\r\nI would now like to talk about the games. Pretty much all of them are simplistic, straightforward, and pretty much basic plays. This also includes most of the strategies being used. You'll probably quickly understand what's going on throughout. While these aren't necessarily bad things since there's actually not really anything wrong with the gambles themselves, apparently it makes certain others want more from the games, if not much more since it doesn't help that, much like other gambling anime/manga series, the pattern of how the games basically go as are pretty similar (and it's in a basic shounen way), the outcomes of the overall games are mostly very predictable, and that this series focuses a lot on cheaters. Despite all of this, I find that the games can still be enjoyable. Why? The characters themselves and how they exaggeratedly bring out their various emotions and personalities in the different situations of whatever games with the great or ridiculous looking art. This is probably the main aspects in what makes it fun for me to watch through. Seeing the ridiculous reactions from the characters never really gets old for me, but if you're expecting depth in the games from this series, then this will disappoint you. \\n\\n\r\nART AND ANIMATIONS\\n\\n\r\nNow for the art and animations. I think MAPPA did pretty good in the art department. They make the cards and poker pieces look very well done at times, and there is a lot of impressive visual moments and effects in this series. While the character designs themselves mostly look pretty standard, the amount of details they put on certain aspects of the close-up faces impressive to me. This especially goes for their eyes. Not often do I see such beautiful looking eyes nearly everywhere in an anime series, with some of them having nice-looking visual effects. They also added little extra details on different parts on the faces at times, most noticeably on the insane faces, such as bits of wrinkles on the lips and making the nose drawn to look a bit more realistic. This is helpful for the type of faces since it helps give you that ridiculous, shocked, or cringing feeling to the viewers like most were purposely made and presented to be as, and it can even help add into the excitement and feeling of whatever is going on, but the insane faces are understandably not for everyone. Due to the amount of details they often put on them, they can look over-the-top, even when ti comes to  anime usually making things over-the-top. There have been a few to some faces that look absolutely hilarious to me, and I unfortunately mean that in a bad way since I'm not talking about the ridiculous ones that were clearly made purposely to look funny, which are also hilarious looking. As for the animations, they're mostly standard and decent, but there have been a fair number of very good ones. The opening itself is just filled with great animations.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND AND VOICE ACTING\\n\\n\r\nLast I will talk about is the music and voice acting. Starting with the opening and ending, it's honestly a couple of my most favorite songs of the whole season. They're very good and I find them perfectly emphasizing how energetic and upbeat the anime portrays itself as despite how dangerous and dark it is. The opening will take a bit of getting used to, but still great and very stylish. As for the overall soundtrack of the series, I would say it's decent to above average. There's a few weird and questionable tunes, but overall everything else has either been fine or enjoyable, and they fit well in the situations present. The crazier tunes help add to the fun and insanity of the situations the type of songs it's used in. There's not really much to comment on the voice acting to me, but I think they did fine. I think Saori did very well as the main character, Yumeko.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, I think that wraps up the review. If I would have to score and summarize each aspect I've talked about,\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10. A lot of the characters are your typical anime characters, but a good number of notable characters have depth or character development.  \\n\\n\r\nStory and Setting - 5/10. Not really anything special when you think about it, and nearly everything only happens in the school. Not to mention with the way they've ended it at the final episode is pretty disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nGames - 5/10. Not really bad since it didn't do anything wrong, but will probably leave you wanting more from them.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animations - 6.5/10. Great details and sometimes visual effects on numerous things such as the items and certain parts of the faces, especially the eyes, but the insane looking ones are a major hit-or-miss.\\n\\n\r\nSound and voice acting - 7/10. Fantastic opening and endings with a lot of decent to enjoyable tunes in the overall background music, but there are a few questionable or weird tunes. The voice acting is fine to me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10. A very stylish and lively series overall, but it could leave much to be desired, since it's pretty basic when you think about it. As long as you don't expect too much or have very high standards, then I think you'll be fine. I highly suggest watching through the PVs first in order to know what you'll pretty much be getting into throughout if you're still interested.",

            "content": "It where two reasons that I started to watch Kakegurui (Compulsive Gambler) this season. The first where that I\u00b4m planning to read the manga, and was curious about it. And the second and more important one, is that Kakegurui is produced by studio MAPPA. Which happens to be one of my favourite studios after seen what magic they created with the \u201cShingeki no Bahamut\u201d-series. Their animation quality is nothing but as close to flawless as you can get, and they do have a brilliant way of bringing forth the specific design of the show they produce \u2013 they surely know how to place the effectsfor maximum output. And that applies to what they have done with Kakegurui as well. Stunning work indeed. \\n\\n\r\nBut as we all know, that great animation quality is just a factor to the whole experience of an anime. Other factors such as how the story appeal to us, how it\u00b4s narrated, it\u00b4s pacing, and how coherent it is, are also very important to us viewers. For not to speak of the characters. They have to intrigue us, make us feel with them, and feel like real life like persons to capture our interests. But you aren\u00b4t reading this review for a philosophical discussion of what makes up a great anime, you are reading this because you want to know if Kakegurui is a show for you, and/or maybe to see what opinion I have on it. So, let\u00b4s get to the point.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like stunning art and animation? Do you find gambling interesting? Do you find an exclusive high school setting with an almighty student council interesting? Do you find slightly insane gamble addicts, that gets off on high stakes games as entertaining characters? Do you find it exciting to watch people outsmart each other in various games, by the means of reading their opponent? Do you find an almost female only cast appealing? And yes, it\u00b4s sexual innuendos between many of those said female characters, if you were wondering.  \\n\\n\r\nIf your answer is yes on most of those questions, you will probably love Kakegurui. Because that\u00b4s what\u00b4s it\u00b4s all about. Nothing more, nothing less \u2013 it\u00b4s very straight forward. But it\u00b4s done in a very fluent and fashionable way, Kakegurui oozes of class and quality. Everything from the characters body language, facial expression, to the conversations they have, fills out what otherwise is pretty flat story perfectly. Grinding teeth\u2019s, sweat that trickles down the forehead, insane glowing eyes, and the thought process the gambler has is all details that are nicely highlighted.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the animation quality is excellent, studio MAPPPA have really out done themselves again, in their way of capture the core of the story and characters, and brilliantly bring them to life in their unique style. The psycho faces, cards or dices that are thrown in glee on the table, or the excited eyes of a gambler, they captured it all. The colours are strong and vivid, with a fancy for sinful red. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story is very even, not to slow, and not to rushing. And even if Kakegurui has an episodic feeling to it, and that each episode is build up in the same pattern, it feels coherent, and not reparative or to predictable. Because just when you think you figured the whole show out, it does a double take and does something that you weren\u00b4t prepared for. But at the same time, it still follows the same episode pattern. Easily put, in each episode the new student Yumeko Jambai, faces new opponents in different games, and works her way towards the top by very conventional means. Our protagonist isn\u00b4t gambling for power, money or glory, just for the pure rush of the game. That characteristic makes her a very hard opponent to both read and predict, which she uses to climbs up the schools gambling latter.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are really doing a great job to portray their characters, so props to the cast. They all feel very well matched, except the vice president, but I guess that\u00b4s intentional. And when speaking of sounds, the sound effects are the little extra spice in the Kakegurui stew. The sound of grinding teeth\u00b4s, a pulse speeding up, or a sweat drop finding its path down someone\u2019s face to splash on the gamble table, it\u00b4s all very effectual and pronounced. It\u00b4s gives the scene life and feeling, and combined with the great visuals the result it masterly done. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy my time with Kakegurui? Sure, to a certain extent. The story itself isn\u00b4t one of my usual cup of tea, with such a narrow story line and lack of personal growth- and interacting of the characters. The choice to only focus on gambling was risky, either that will appeal to you or it won\u2019t. I fall a bit to the second category, I can absolutely appreciate gambling, or competitions as an element in a story, but to have a whole show around it didn\u00b4t capture my full interest. Had they combined it with more elements, such as character development and relationships a bit more, the final product would\u00b4ve appealed to me much more. But the stunning animation with those little extra sound effects made this a visual feast for me, and the reason that I watched it to the end. The story and its characters I find mildly entertaining, absolutely not boring, just not deep-heart-and-soul-catching, which I highly appreciate in a show. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to come to some sort of conclusion, I would recommend you to watch Kakegurui purely based on the amazing animation, if not the plot seems like your thing, it\u00b4s worth it. But if you indeed find this type of show appealing, then you are in for a treat.\\n\\n",

            "content": "As the players take their seats, excitement fills the air. Cards, gathered up in one quick swoop, become the weapons of this match, as each fighter tries to gather their wits under the intense stress and tension at play. Pulse quickens, the heart accelerates, at the sight of their weapons, as each fighter stares at their enemy in silent anticipation, awaiting any indication into the contents of their hand. As time passes the air grows all the more incredibly heavy and thick, sweat adorning both of these brave warriors, as, suddenly, the signal to throw down their cards to determine the victor is called. Whowill receive Lady Luck's blessing this time?\\n\\n\r\nGambling! High octane stakes and tension! Narratives surrounding the use of gambling are supposed to be exciting, tense, give us a sense of utmost euphoria, and, most of all, be entertaining  as hell! Kaiji is a series that excels in this department, and, while I haven't seen every episode of the show yet, the first eight episodes that I have seen have been everything I look for in a gambling-centric narrative. The stakes are high, being that each game involves the consequence of death if someone were to lose, it's easy to care for our main character after the huge debt that has been left to him and each game is insanely interesting since it becomes a huge psychological battle with players trying to deceive and outwit each with other, with the great animation and soundtrack enhancing each element. Watching the show is essentially like having one giant adrenaline rush, which makes you want to keep watching episode after episode, which is a sign of well-crafted and written thriller around the use gambling. However, Kakegurui (or, if you prefer, Bukkakegurui, which is what I'll be referring to the show as for the rest of the review) is one of the most downright boring shows I've ever had the displeasure of watching, despite having similar ideas and premise to that of Kaiji. But, why is that? Why does Kaiji succeed where Bukkakegurui does not? Well, let's find out! Let's grab a chair, bet some insane amount of money, and remember to have about twenty orgasms as we play, since gambling, for some reason, gets us completely wet! \\n\\n\r\nBukkakegurui's narrative is set inside a prestigious academy which is a tad bit different than conventional schools. While, during the day the school adopts the typical lessons that any student from any school undergoes, at night the school becomes a gambling den, where those who are seeking power and money go to gamble. The series sees our protagonist, Yumeko, an obsessive and insane gambler who experiences an orgasm every time she plays, gamble her way through the student council until the climatic game with the student council president at the very end of the series. In terms of narrative structure, the series is incredibly linear and straightforward, and adopts a \"monster of the week formula\", whereby Yumeko will play off against a new member of the student council of increasing difficulty before coming to the big finale. This structure of storytelling is not inherently bad, and since the focus of the show, and the appeal is based around the games itself, I don't mind the narrative being rather simple. However, there is one problem I have with this formulaic structure, and that is, that Yumeko never grows or learns throughout the duration of the series or in her matches. She never acquires any new tactics or skills during the games that could be applied in later scenarios, and she wins more so because the script tells her to win rather than putting any actual effort into her character winning through clever manipulation, strategy, or anything else that would be remotely interesting. For the sake of argument, let's compare Bukkakegurui to the 1995 series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, which also adopted a \"monster of the week\" formula for much of its duration. The reason why Evangelion succeeds is because during every Angel encounter and fight in the series, we are learning as an audience, both about the nature of the world, and of the characters, in their mental state and emotions. Shinji, Rei and Askua grow, not only in their physical abilities against the Angels, but also as people as well, as they begin to grow to like themselves as the series progresses, and work together as a team. By doing so, it grounds the characters in a more realistic way, and makes them feel far more like actual people, which Yumeko fails at completely, as she is more akin to an over powered Mary Sue who wins just because. While her personality suggests that she gambles so much for the thrill and excitement it brings, which is a fine motivation for her character, it also makes her feel rather boring and one dimensional as we never learn anything about her beyond what is presented at surface level. While there is a mini flashback that suggests that Yumeko is gambling in order to raise money for her sister's operation, or something along those lines, we're never given any more information regarding that aspect, and this idea should have been introduced at the very start of the show, to give Yumeko's matches some actual emotional weight and narrative stakes, but they didn't do that so each match feels incredibly inconsequential.  Speaking of narrative stakes, let's dive into that next!\\n\\n\r\nIn Bukkakegurui, the school is divided into sub sections dependent on how much money you have, with those losing money and being in debt at the bottom, being treated as house pets, while those with money get to rule at the top. If, at some point, you get into enough debt while at the school, the student council will write you out a life plan which determines every element in your life in the future, all planned out for you, from who you will marry, how many children you will bear, among other things. So, there are elements that are at stake here, such as your entire life being ruined forever by this life plan or crippling debt, but the stakes presented in the matches don't work because the characters are all completely one dimensional and it's hard to care for anyone at all. Who cares if Yumeko becomes a house pet or gets a life plan written up for her, when she'll pay back her debts anyway through her gambling? Who cares that someone like Meari ends up with a life plan when she has been nothing but a horrible bitch throughout the show and gets what she deserves? WHO CARES? It's one thing to have narrative stakes, but another thing to have characters who we care about having those stakes inflicted upon them.\\n\\n\r\n In order to better convey what I mean, imagine a scenario in which I have two rocks. The first rock, rock A, represents the characters presented in Bukkakegurui; they're all horribly one dimensional, lack personality and are hard to care for in the slightest. We don't learn anything about them as actual people, despite the fact that they're all hungry for power or vast amounts of wealth, nor do we feel any connection to them on any personal level since there is no time devoted for fleshing them out. The other rock, Rock B, represents a character that we have had time to care for. They're here not, because they find thrill for gambling, but because they have no other choice. Perhaps they have a large debt to pay off, or have to gamble for money for an operation to save a love one or something, but what's important is that we learn about this character in order to feel some kind of connection, and the fact that they're an underdog will make the audience root for them more, and will make the games more exciting as the character will have to come up with new strategies constantly, driving more investment in the narrative. The audience should experience the world through this character's eyes, so not only do we become more attached to them as an actual person but also so that we can see how they grow and think. Now, with both rocks categorised, let's say I bring in a sledgehammer, thus introducing the concept of death and smash them both. Now, which rock do you care for? Obviously the rock with more of a personality, back-story, and have had time to care for. And this is why I find no excitement whilst watching the show and why I don't care about anything that is happening.\\n\\n\r\nNow, people may argue against me by suggesting I am taking the anime too seriously and should just shut my brain off and enjoy the series as a rule of cool, dumb show, since there are plenty of pretty silly elements, and the games in the anime are the reason why I should be watching it since that is the main appeal of the show. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad stance to take, and I want to clarify now that I don't begrudge anyone who has actually managed to derive entertainment from this show, but I can't see the show in this light since I found most of the elements to pretty boring, especially all the games, which, for a show that is focused completely around this idea, is a pretty bad sign on the quality of the work!\\n\\n\r\nEach game in Bukkakegurui is boring, lifeless and we don't learn anything during the match about either participant involved, other than, sometimes, very short back stories consisting of only thirty seconds or so. Most of the games are essentially just Yumeko winning by either complete luck, or figuring out how her opponent is cheating in some way and the way she determines this and discovers how they are doing so feels so contrived and stupid that I want to slam my face into a wall. Now, luck is a HUGE aspect of gambling, so therefore her wins through luck are not necessarily that bad (even though it really pushes it in plenty of places) but there's no attempt at creating anything interesting. Aside from the games being incredibly simple anyway, there is no psychological battles taking part, none of the characters are attempting to outwit one another and there is hardly anything present that made Kaiji's games interesting. You never really get that cathartic feeling when you witness an intense match go on for ages when a character outsmarts another in some creative way as you say to yourself, \"Ah! How clever!\" The few times they do try and throw a curveball into the games or when Yumeko tries to outwit her opponent it feel so weak and dry since the in-the-moment logic is incredibly shallow and the way the story tries to awkwardly implement in these elements is so insulting to the intelligence of the audience as the show thinks that by throwing some random curveball at the final moment is a plot-twist or a smart way to deceive the audience since they didn't see it coming, because it appeared out of thin air. The only time the anime ever comes close to being somewhat entertaining during a match is in episodes six and seven where Yumeko gambles against someone who, believe it or not, is even more insane than she is, by the name of Midari Ikishima, a girl who finds pleasure in harming herself through the use of gambling. During her match with Yumeko, they both decide to play Russian roulette, which raises the narrative stakes and tension since it introduces the consequence of death into the game, although it is hard to care for anything that is going on, because, as I've said, the characters are dry and boring, and also because it's pretty obvious that nobody will actually die during the match anyway, but still the scene comes the closest out of any to actually entertain me, and, even then, the scene is still incredibly weak.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, as I've previously mentioned, are all incredibly hard to care for, and are pretty much all absolutely insane! Most of the characters take the utmost pleasure in laughing hysterically at their enemies, smiling and looking down upon them during a game if it is going in their favour, which makes everyone feel like an unlikeable, one dimensional asshole. The show often utilises cheap victimisation in a pathetic attempt to manipulate us into feeling sorry for these cardboard cut-outs, and nowhere is this more evident than in episode nine, where, a student council member who also happens to be an idol with a huge following, has her secret revealed to all of them, in which, recorded on a tape, she proclaims that she finds all of her fans to be absolutely disgusting and she hates the fact that she has to even shake their hands since it makes her puke. Despite that already sounding incredibly horrible anyway, she as a person is a complete and utter twat, with no redeemable qualities, hiding behind the facade of being a wonderful idol. During the episode, when the secret is revealed, she breaks down crying, as she comes to the realization that her dream is now ruined. I expect that the creators of the show wanted the audience to sympathise with her, but how can we when she is such a horrible twat who got everything she deserved? And, if that's not already bad enough, the audience gets a direct kick to the nuts straight after when all of her fans forgive her! That's right! If you're a horrible person with no likeable traits who gets what they deserve, all is forgiven if you simply have a dream you want to uphold!\\n\\n\r\nI could go on more and more about each one of the other characters, but at that point I'd be beating a dead horse since they all suffer from the exact same problems I've talked about before. Perhaps the only character who doesn't fit into this mould is one of our main protagonists, who offers so little to the narrative that you could omit him from the plot entirely and it wouldn't make a single difference! Now THAT'S a good main character! I suppose his main purpose is to act as the voice of reason and rationality in the story since he is the only sane character, and the one the audience can relate to the most, but if that's what they were attempting to do with his character, then they failed horribly since I honestly forget this guy is even here half the time. They try and make it out that he and Yumeko have this deep friendship, since she helped him recover from his debt in the beginning of the series, but their relationship feels superficial, as if the only reason they're even friends in the first place is just because the script dictates as such. His main purpose in the show is to deliver random expository dialogue and that's pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that Bukkakegurui gets right, then that's in the animation and art department. The show is very visually appealing, with pretty attractive and striking character designs, that blend well with the rather unique school uniform designs too. Not only that, but the show has plenty of super detailed close-up shots of character's faces to convey, not only the insanity of each one, but to also represent the sexual euphoria each character attains whilst in the games, and Bukkakegurui does a good job in that area. It's clear that the animators put a lot of work into making the show as visually interesting as they possibly could, but it's not without its inconsistencies however. CGI is sometimes used during close-up shots of the player's hands when dealing with cards, and it not only looks terrible, but is so jarring as well. Luckily CGI isn't used all too much aside from this one instance for some odd reason, so I can let it slide for the most part. The music is overall fine, and pretty forgettable, mostly consisting of free-from jazz that is way too suave and sophisticated for a show at this level of trashiness. The opening and ending tracks however are both damn great! The opening especially I love, with its use of stylish visuals and fantastic music, which almost tricks you into thinking that the actual show will carry the same energy and charisma. The voice actors as well all do a pretty stellar job in their respective roles, perfectly capturing the voice of someone who is insane!\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Bukkakegurui was a massive disappointment, and I think that's what makes the show ultimately more aggravating for me. While I dislike using the word to describe anything, I feel it is pretty appropriate when talking about this one, and that word is cringey! The show reeks of desperation, and tries way too hard to be edgy, and ends up just being embarrassing instead since many of the scenarios presented in the show, such as a scene in which Yumeko acts like a cat on all fours, feel as if they were written by a twelve-year-old. It fails as an intense thriller, it fails as a character study, it fails as a gambling show, but most importantly it fails at the most basic level to achieve any emotional connection with the audience. Bukkakegurui is a show more interested in over blown theatrics than it is in characters and the actual games itself, and the reason why this show is so bad. I can't even recommend this to be people on the grounds that it is \"so bad that it's good\". Just watch Kaiji instead...\\n\\n\r\nBukkakegurui is a word trademarked by the great NFMaster! All credit goes to that sexy bastard!\\n",

However, knowing that this is going to be a Netflix show made me pretty frustrated, but I went on to watch the show through other ways.\r\nWhat do I think about Kakegurui? It's very faithful to the original source material. Kudos to MAPPA for getting much of what made the manga great, with the art and character expressions being accurate. Though not as interesting and suspenseful like other gambling anime, the show still keeps it entertaining throughout. Characters add so much emotion tothe anime and basically carry it through predictably boring gambling scenes. This show is great gateway material and its good and exciting enough to hold up as one. Possibly the best OP of the season (and maybe the entire year),  Kakegurui's OP is fantastic. It has so much symbolism and connection to the manga that it contests any JJBA anime openings. BGM isn't really something to write home about, but it does well to build up the tension and atmosphere. The ED might seem like fanservice at first, but there's a sort of hidden symbolism in it, representing the change of Yumeko as a character.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the manga, you should definitely watch this. If you're coming in blind, I would recommend reading the manga first and watch it later (which you can actually do, since there's no legal way to watch it with english subs yet), since you won't be able to appreciate much of the what anime is doing right. Overall, if you're looking for an anime to watch this season, this definitely should be something that you need to consider.",

            "content": "I was a bit sceptical about this anime after reading its description but after watching the first episode I became addicted to it.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWhile the plot isn\u2019t something extraordinary, \u201cKakegurui\u201d is focused more on the psychological aspect of the story: how do you escape from critical situations, what do you do when your future is at stake, when you\u2019re about to lose your family\u2019s fortune in a game?  The whole plot revolves around Jabami, a transfer student that happens to be obsessed with gambling and makes her name widely known in her school from the first day of attendance. Even though each episode hasa repetitive storyline, there\u2019s always a plot twist that keeps you intrigued and prevents boredom.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nEach and every character is unique and represents a stereotype. Jabami, the main character, is by far the most complex out of them all: she is beautiful, insanely smart, and crazy (not necessarily in a good way). The way she expresses her emotions and theories always drives the people around her to the point of madness and breaks their masks allowing them to show their true identities. Some of the supporting characters are well portrayed, though there are fewer details about them but their interaction with Jabami relieves fragments of their stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nI have rarely seen emotions so well portrayed in an animation. They literally made every feeling come to life on the faces of the characters and in their eyes. Especially in the most intense scenes, the expressions of the gamblers are so exaggerated; their eyes are so vivid that it feels like the whole moment is coming to life before your eyes. The animation is the work of a perfectionist, the details are amazing and everything is well placed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI love the innocent voices of the characters and the way they change under stress. The music is beautiful and the opening and ending are both perfect in illustrating the theme of the whole anime. The music matches the atmosphere of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs I previously said, this anime is totally addictive, especially for the way the characters (mostly Jabami) think. With every episode I can\u2019t wait to discover more about the wicked lifestyle of these rich students and their gambling strategies. It\u2019s truly the best anime of this season and one of the best of its kind. \\n",

            "content": "(ONLY 4 EPISODES HAVE BEEN RELEASED AS OF THE TIME I'M WRITING THIS. RATING WILL MOST LIKELY CHANGE TOWARDS THE END OF THE SHOW.)\r\nHaving read the manga, it's needless to say that I was totally hyped when an anime for Kakegurui was announced to be in the works. I still remember getting so excited for episode 1 that I ended up waiting all night just to watch it. Of course, there were still doubts on the back of my mind. What if this adaptation turns out to be disappointing? But the thing was, I didn't even need to worry about that stuff, because this adaptationdidn't disappoint me at all.  \\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nThis is basically a high school anime in which high school students are required to gamble each other for rank, status, and popularity. If a student finds himself in a huge debt, then it's anything but good since those who are in the bottom 100 are to be labelled as \"housepets\", the lowest of the low. This is the situation that one of our main characters, Ryouta Suzui, finds himself after losing in a gamble with another main character, Saotome Mary.\\n\\n\r\nIt is said that if you find yourself in the housepet position, then it's impossible for you to get your status back. Suzui thought so too, that is, until a gambling maniac by the name of Jabami Yumeko suddenly transfers into the school.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime mainly follows Yumeko as she gets involved in various gambles with a lot of people, with her goal being the cause of the gambling madness: the student council president.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in this anime is good. It's not too fast, and it's not too slow. In my opinion, it's just right. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nI absolutely adore how this is animated. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of certain scenes. For example, the anime is in a normal school life kind of part, the animation is more normal and calm, but when a gamble begins, then the whole feel of the show changes because of the way the animation slightly changes. The whole scene suddenly becomes more tense and gripping. This is most obvious in scenes where Yumeko becomes truly mad in gambling.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, special mention the OP animation, I think it's just gorgeous and sets the tone for the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI immediately fell in love with the OP and ED when I first heard them both. But I have to say that I like the OP more. How should I describe it, I wonder? Well, Kakegurui [i]is[/i] a show about gambling, and, this OP is, for lack of a better word, jazzy. A perfect match, if I do say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nI have no issues with the voice acting. Everything is exactly how I imagined it to be, especially with Yumeko and Mary. Yeah, Yukino, the always calm and collected high school girl from OreGairu, she's a gambling maniac now. Feel old yet? \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nNow, what I consider to be the weakest aspect of this series is the characters. Yes, all of them are interesting in their own little ways, but I find it difficult to point out characteristics that \\n\r\nmake them unique, and as a result, they're quite forgettable. Well, except for Yumeko, I guess. She has the \"going crazy in gambles\" thing going for her, so good for her. However, the other characters aren't as memorable. Especially Suzui (who is ironically a main character), he's kind of \"just there\" all the time so the viewers have someone to explain what's going on to them.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 10\\n\r\nWhat were you expecting? The Kakegurui manga is in my favorites, so I still would have given this a 10 based on personal enjoyment even if it did end up being a terrible adaptation. I've been hooked since episode one, and I can't wait for all the future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nHonestly, I'd give this a 10, but I think it's still too early to give this adaptation a final verdict. All I know is that I'm really enjoying what the Kakegurui anime is offering us right now. (Will most probably change overall score as the show progresses.)\\n\\n\r\nEven if you haven't read the manga, or aren't into this kind of anime, I still recommend trying to at least watch the first episode. Who knows? You might just come to like it too.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I finished watching this a week ago. Don't believe everything I said here. The original ending turned this potential great anime into  a piece of shit. Go read the manga. My final rating is a 5/10.\\n",

The soundtrack in the background makes you keep going on watching and makes stuff look more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI'm enjoying this show for myself now.

            "content": "Kakegurui- The Great Value Brand of Kaiji: Now with Chicks!\r\nThe dim, incandescent can light burns the back of your head from above. Your mouth is a desert, lips parched as you struggle to even swallow your own saliva. An irregular heart beat increases its oscillations, and your vision blurs as you attempt to read your own cards. You're a house pet, a term coined only for those drowning in the debt of the student council and this one hand of poker could either seal your fate for the rest of your life, or set you free of the shackles of your dues. Anger, guilt, nervousnessand tension well up inside your brain, clouding any sense of strategy once present in your arsenal. The remaining cards are dealt, each one like a subsequent dagger being driven into the heart. Your fingers dig into the cheap felt table lining and begin to burn from the friction. As the last card approaches, thousands of scenarios race through your mind, and your opponents stoic appearance does nothing to ease the pressure. Will you survive? Will your reputation and existence be dismantled, succumbing to the hands of the tyrannical council?\\n\\n\r\nThe final card slams down with a thunderous echo\u2026\\n\\n\r\nGambling is a subject rare to take center stage in the realm of anime. Kaiji, Death Parade and Liar Game are some of the only examples I can think of in the medium, until studio MAPPA\u2019s (Zankyou no Terror, Yuri!! On Ice) Kakegurui landed this season. From a viewer\u2019s perspective, for the gambling to really have an impact on our senses the scenes must comprise a balance of suspense, mind games and creativity. Kaiji the Gambler, arguably the best example I can think of features a main character literally gambling for his life, in games that are either very intricate or require a large degree of mental fortitude to participate in. The result is white-knuckle tension that has your finger hovering over the skip button, ready to binge through the entire anime in one sitting. Kakegurui attempts to mimic Kaiji\u2019s critical success with a different target audience by introducing better animation and a more familiar setting, high school. Because, you know, that makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a \u201cwell visioned\u201d setup, with taboo setting of school in which students engage in lavish betting and gambling once the last bell rings for the day. We witness firsthand the daunting effects of losing in this school: you're deemed a \u201chouse pet\u201d and everyone treats you accordingly. This wouldn't be quite as ridiculous if it weren't for the fact that kids are ridiculed and treated like shit in high school to begin with. In essence, this significantly dilutes any ounce of realism with regards to the stakes these students are playing for, and ultimately the entire premise from the beginning. The \u201cupside\u201d is that IF you are successful at gambling and start raking in the dough, your family is already rich as fuck so\u2026. none of this betting really even matters to begin with. See my point? From its inception, Kakegurui\u2019s narrative is faulted. The whole premise of the anime seems pointless in that if you win, you'll be rich and if you lose, you'll still be rich but get treated like that awkward kid who frequently gets stuffed into lockers. The student council seeks to rule the school with an iron fist, but I'm not sure what they actually do; except cheat to win, fly in fancy helicopters and wear terrifying androgynous masks.\\n\\n\r\nUnassuming transfer student Yumeko Jabami looks to shake things up at this school by winning any and every gambling match she's in. Countless opponents fall victim to her innate ability to see through tricks and deftly play each person for a fool. This can be frustratingly similar to the No Game no Life effect, in which Sora and Shiro\u2019s victory was assumed prior to them even starting the game. To top it off, Jabami seems to get off on the thought of risking \u201ceverything\u201d on each of her matches. Each of her mental orgasms is brought to our attention in exhausting detail, as her eyes leer red and her legs tremble with excitement. The anime progresses almost episodically with a \u201crinse, repeat\u201d effect. New characters are introduced, Jabami challenges them, a new game is played and Jabami emerges victorious yet again. This process repeats over and over and over again in a due loop merry-go-round. There\u2019s no sense of doubt, no uncertainty built into the script. It\u2019s a perpetual nightmare from a scripting perspective.\\n\\n\r\nWith Jabami at the helm, we as viewers never really experience her thoughts about anything. Neither her strategy, intuition or objective ever becomes clear and the games themselves often end up narrated by her foes. Long, overthought monologues about what they \u201cthink\u201d she is planning through each and every move, which began to take a toll on my attention span since I knew the eventual outcome prior to each match taking place. And since a majority of the anime is spent \u201cin game\u201d and we don\u2019t catch a glimpse of what Jabami is thinking, her characterization is thrown out the window. The rare occurrence of a line of dialogue from our \u201cheroine\u201d is spent devilishly coercing another one of her pawns to help her with a bet in the game. The main protagonist in the anime doesn\u2019t even have fucking character development\u2026 it\u2019s embarrassing.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention how edgy Kakegurui is? I was legitimately interested to see where the plot would unfold when I started the series, but my supposition quickly dissolved when I uncovered the anime\u2019s true nature. It\u2019s 2017, so I\u2019m not sure what I expected, but the initial consensus was that I was at least intrigued. So a girl gets her jollies by gambling, who cares? But, when EVERY character acts as if they\u2019re on the verge of insanity? Now we have an inherent problem. Not to mention the horrifically unattractive adrenaline slut who gets wet thinking about having her head blown off from a game of Russian Roulette. It\u2019s a sex scene away from being a dumpster fire Sundance film about how fucking \u201craw and gritty\u201d some teenager\u2019s life is. Again, it\u2019s the tactical diversion producers craft to steer the audience away from how dreadfully written a show can be, simply because it\u2019s dark or shocking. I don\u2019t always mind this level of scheming when the veil is at least entertaining. But in Kakegurui, you get the worst of both worlds: badly written and boring.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be a disservice to anime fans everywhere if I didn\u2019t at least attempt to address the comparisons between Kaiji and Kakegurui. Kaiji as a protagonist is someone you can really root for. His awful luck is inviting, in a sympathetic manner. He basically starts from nothing, and risks his actual life for a chance at redemption. Jabami comes from out of nowhere, with no clear motive and little to no relatability. Kaiji\u2019s gambling games are fewer, but are better explained and have a more intricate explanation. Kakegurui falters, partially due to a shorter run time, and that the games are changed so quickly that less attention is given to their development. It feels like the writers are more focused on getting through everything vice making an impact on what they introduce. Kaiji is primarily a male cast, making it harder to attract female viewers but ideal for a seinen genre. Kakegurui has more females than you can shake a stick at: loli\u2019s, tsunderes and yanderes to boot. Hence my opening statement in the review. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, most of Kakegurui\u2019s dialogue comes from the opposition, creating a wall between the viewer and the character appearing to be the main protagonist (Jabami). In Kaiji, this internalizing is shared between he and his adversaries. It creates an equilibrium that helps the viewer rationalize either end of the gamble. \\n\\n\r\nI think it\u2019d come off as redundant if I expounded any more about the characters in Kakegurui. Despite having significantly less screen time, Ryouta and Meari receive significantly more development than Jabami, inflating my unpopular opinion of her ten-fold. We do get some back story on a few minor characters, but nothing short of a plot device in order to propel the story forward. Possibly the most interesting character from the entire cast is Manyuda, who actually has a clearly defined motive, is cutthroat and calculating and doesn\u2019t seem to break character as much to partake in edgy escapades. Oh yeah, and he\u2019s the only member of the student council who actually gambled fairly, at least in his own game. If you\u2019re looking for relatable or enticing characters, Kakegurui may not be the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything I learned from watching Kakegurui, it\u2019s that facial expressions are apparently everything. In an environment where maintaining a \u201cpoker face\u201d is often sought after, the animators in this anime decided to do the exact opposite and emblazon a crazy face on almost every character in the cast. It\u2019s brilliant in some respects because it helps distract the viewer from the rest of the anime\u2019s inadequacies by giving them a fresh dose of ADHD, but is entirely unnecessary. It does helps manifest some false suspense, only it ends up making some of the scenes more irritating. The rest of the animation is quite good, and the overall tone it sets for the show works well for the subject matter. The character models are attractive and proportional, and the flashier scenes with dialogue-heavy moments please the eye. One major blemish on the art side would be the complete lack of animation with the Jabami idol karaoke scene. It came across as complete laziness, with the still image of Jabami fading out into the completion of her song. I\u2019m not sure if this was intentional, but it was jarring to say the least. To help make up for it, they at least added a completely random duet between her and Yumemi to close the episode.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, I absolutely love the OP for the show. It\u2019s a psychedelic, sexy acid trip with a risque\u2019 jazz track narrating the visuals. If you look closely, it even tells a small story relating to the story progression of the anime itself. The ED on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired, sans the mystery of what\u2019s underneath Jabami\u2019s outer layer of clothing. The song isn\u2019t even catchy, a quality I can at least cling to in an ED. The rest of the soundtrack existed to create false tension and accentuate the mood of its corresponding scenes, and I can\u2019t recall it being necessarily bad. Voice acting in Kakegurui is one of its strong points, and I can only imagine how much fun the seiyuus had considering how edgy the series can be. The actors actually had a chance to break character and have a good time.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an entertainment perspective, Kakegurui hits all the wickets. It has hot girls, great animation and an almost avant-garde approach to storytelling that could be incredibly appealing to young, impressionable audiences (aka, most of the anime community). This being said, I can\u2019t be baffled by how well the show was received, even if I didn\u2019t agree with it. This is the main purpose of a reviewer or critic, to point out enjoyment as well as flaws. I\u2019d be lying to you if I said I didn\u2019t enjoy Kakegurui. But is it a good gambling anime? Hardly. It suffers from a severe lack of character development/relatability and has an edgy stigma about it I can\u2019t shake. The previous negatives coupled with the unrealistic premise can create some harsh criticisms and overall disappointment. I\u2019d recommend this to fans of shows like Re:Zero, No Game No Life or any other similar series, due in part to it being edgy and appealing to a certain audience.

This anime.\r\nOkay, I admittedly started watching it because the OP looked like a jazzy rendition of a girl gathering a bunch of other girls into her lesbian harem, but I certainly wasn't disappointed with what I actually got when I watched it, because holy crap. \r\nYumeko is a girl who starts a new school where Gambling is used to basically decide the school's hierarchy. Yumeko is 100% on board with this.\r\nThe way this anime handles it's facial expressions and characters is just godly. Some people might think the expressions are TOO exaggerated, but I think they're rad and really represent how evil therush of gambling can make people.  Yumeko herself is perfect, I absolutely adore how they didn't go with the whole 'lets thrust this innocent character in this awful gambling world and watch her beat people in the name of JUSTICE AND LEARN A LESSON IN THE END'\\n\\n\r\nYumeko's genuinely enjoying every second of this school and can go cold-blooded in a second if someone says something that isn't what she wants to hear. This, and tons of other things is what makes this anime a must-watch, in my opinion.  I'm loving this so far, and can't wait to see where it goes next! 9/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEDIT on 8/29/17: Okay, I'm now on episode 8, and holy SHIT. This series hasn't gotten any less amazing. It's gotten even better, in my opinion, adding on more quirky/insane/conniving characters and giving tons of depth to characters I thought we'd never see much. \\n\\n\r\nYumeko is still the scummy, genius of a goddess that we all love. Suzui is still...well, he's sweet and gives the anime a cute dude to be on par with all the cute girls, and I'm sure more use'll come of him later. \\n\\n\r\nMary's blown me away honestly. I can't say much without spoilers, but...I didn't think we'd see much of her and know of her as anything more than 'the girl Yumeko beat first', and BOY was I wrong! The way they manage to keep her in character, aka cocky, overbearing and tsundere as hell and still make her lovable and pretty damn cute is quite impressive. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, before writing Kakegurui off as the overrated hype series of the season, give it an episode or two. Even people who despise it have to admit the way the anime goes about things is interesting as hell, and so engaging that I'm all over the newest episode as soon as it comes out. \\n\\n\r\nI genuinely don't want this anime to end, but I can't wait to see how they wrap the first season up, and I have complete faith they'll make it an amazing finale. I'm sorry for adding so much more, but I feel like I really didn't praise this series enough before and it's only gotten better, so I just had to add more. (I'll most likely add one more edit when it finishes.)\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui, keep being rad :D!",

I'll try to work around spoilers and keep it short. And I assure you this review is completely unbiased (wink wink). That is to say I absolutely love it.\r\nLet me tell you this: it's hard to represent mania, and this anime has it on lock. It's rare to see a chaotic character represented in media that it's not psychopathic or lacking any emotion or empathy, in fact this is quite the opposite, the characters are so overwhelmingly filled with all kinds of emotions that theykeep exploding in this maniacal behavior. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly simple, the setting is not something incredibly innovative but the execution of the rest makes it completely believable and perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe art its absolutely amazing, it gets you excited, it makes you laugh, it's aesthetically coherent, it fits perfectly. It makes you scream \"YES!!! STEP ALL OVER THEM!!\" while making the same faces they do in the games. Even the CG is on point.\\n\r\nThe sound is impeccable. Sound effects in moments of pure caricature are just enough to get the crazy visuals over the edge, not to mention the soundtrack (that freakin' opening).\\n\r\nThe characters are super-exaggerated humans, they aren't your typical Hollywood casino movies lot, they are absolutely insane and to say that is an understatement. They steamroll over their enemies while making insane expressions, while still being cold and calculating... most of the time.\\n\r\nThe content of this review must have revealed my enjoyment with this so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I see amazing potential in the episodes to come and it got me hooked up, I will eventually update this review if my opinion changes over the course of the episodes. Let's hope it'll keep the current score. If you are looking for a fresh anime, this is sure to keep you entertained.",

            "content": "\u201cPart of it went on gambling, and part of it went on women. The rest I spent foolishly.\u201d \u2013 George Raft.\r\nTo those of you who have watched Kakegurui I ask: Why did you watch this anime? Were you intrigued by the aesthetic look of the show? Or maybe what drew you to Kakegurui was the concept; gambling! The latter was what caught my eye, as past experiences with gambling anime have proven that they hold some of the most entertaining and exhilarating moments I have ever seen. These shows have given me goose bumps from sheer awe and admiration while watching psychological battles of witsand strategy between people willing to risk their very lives on even the simplest of games. Unfortunately, these kinds of anime are extremely rare to come by, as nearly all of them are practically unknown to most of the anime community and nearly impossible to watch any of them legally. So when I saw that Kakegurui was airing this season and also happened to be the most popular show of Summer 2017, I was pretty excited. I had heard good things about the manga and it was being produced by Studio MAPPA, a studio that I have high hopes for despite not being impressed with any of their previous works. All that was left for me to do was watch it, and this is where the hype for this show died for me. I was disappointed with Kakegurui from episode 1, because even after just one episode, it is obvious to see that Kakegurui is a terrible gambling anime.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui takes place in Hyakkaou Private Academy, a prestigious school where the student are the most wealthy and privileged students in all of Japan. I use the term school lightly because there seems to be no actual classes or learning happening, instead the school is more like a gambling den, where every student partakes in gambling. They bet their fortunes against one another regularly, and those who become in debt are practically slaves to the holders of their wealth. The show focuses of Yumeko Jabami, a new student who gambles for the fun of it and is really good at it; too good, in fact. Her actions end up disrupting the student hierarchy of Hyakkaou Academy, causing the Student Council to come up with ways to stop her. Throughout the show, Yumeko befriends beta cuck bitch-boy Ryouta Suzui and fellow gambling gal Meari Saotome who help her as she gambles to her heart\u2019s content. Ironically, Yumeko\u2019s first gamble at the academy is against Meari, and it is here where the first major problem of the show lies.\\n\\n\r\nThe game Yumeko and Meari play is a card-game variation of rock-paper-scissors where the crowd of people watching them write the symbol of \u201crock\u201d, \u201cpaper\u201d or \u201cscissors\u201d on cards, where they are collected and put into a box for both players to draw three cards and play the game. Meari manipulates the majority of the class\u2019 votes to her advantage, however Yumeko still wins decisively and reveals exactly how Meari cheated. Throughout the entire game, the audience is given no insight into what Yumeko is thinking or even a hint as to how she was able to figure out Meari\u2019s scheme until it is given through exposition after she has already won. As such, viewers are forced to believe Yumeko was able to piece everything together without fault. Doing this is lazy of the writers as it solely relies on having to tell the audience what happened, rather than show it as it is happening. This problem is apparent in every gamble in the show and kills the opportunity for viewers to engage with the gambling games and the characters playing said games. The games themselves are also poorly constructed; some come off as unnecessarily complex, others are just too simple and easy to beat. Being marketed as a gambling anime makes the show look incredibly dumb and retarded, taking away the chance to get excited for how these games play out. And that leads to what I feel is the 2nd biggest issue with this anime: no thrills.\\n\\n\r\nAs you watch Kakagurui, you begin to notice a couple patterns with each gamble: High-stakes are never fully realised, every female character is bat-shit insane and \u201cYumeko wins LOL\u201d. Seriously, even when Yumeko loses like in episode 3, she has no repercussions from losing. Because the audience is always watching from the perspective of either a mere onlooker or one of Yumeko\u2019s opponents, she always comes across as too good for every situation she is placed in. Because of this she rids the show of any tension it could have had. And when you figure out that most of the time Yumeko gambles, she barely even uses a complete strategy, relying on pure luck to win at random times, which feels like a slap in the face to anyone expecting consistency and/or intelligence from this show. The fact that there are no actual punishments fulfilled from losing a high-stakes gamble also hinders the joy and excitement viewers get from watching. Now while there are consequences for being in an extreme amount of debt (e.g. house pet, Meari\u2019s \u201cLife Schedule\u201d), you never actually see the show go through with these consequences and even then, the punishment for losing rarely ever matches the reward for winning. And in Yumeko\u2019s case, the money she wins never really matters to her at all. She is the kind of sadomasochist that would throw countless amounts of money away to feel satisfied with how high the risk of losing a gamble is. Yet the show never goes through with these risks. So I\u2019m left here after watching each gamble asking myself \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d. A lot of fans of the show have been saying that Kakegurui is not a gambling anime, but a great thriller, and I just cannot agree with that statement at all. It is a mediocre thriller at best and that is only if you turn your brain off.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, this show stretches one\u2019s suspension of disbelief so much that you would think this has the quality of fanfiction-level writing. Not just with the gambling aspect of it, but the entire setting is fucking retarded. From the very start I was always curious why there were so many students at Hyakkaou Academy and why they would all gamble. But as I continued watching, the curiosity turned into frustration because it became apparent that there is no proper reason why so many students would stay there or continue to engage in gambling than to make Yumeko even more perfect than what she already is. Yumeko exposes a lot of the games played in gambles as cheat ways to get other in debt, yet that never changes the amount of gambling that takes place within the academy, and that is because most of the students in the background are ignorant buffoons. I would also like to know why only one adult to my memory has appeared in the entire 12 episodes. ONE! I cannot imagine such a prestigious academy to only have one adult working at the academy, but it makes sense with the amount of betting that takes place so regularly. And how in the world are guns and kidnapping allowed? And why does being in extreme debt eventually lead to a life sentence that dictates you to a wealthy future? So many questions that are never explained because this show is not about logic. It tries to look smart but just comes off as a dumb piece of shit. Calling this show psychological is pure lunacy; if anything, it is psycho-sexual because any real sense of logic got thrown out the fucking window!\\n\\n\r\nNearly every character in this show pissed me off. I have already stated how Yumeko is convoluted out her own ass and is like a vacuum sucking all the excitement away from the show, but she seems like God\u2019s gift to this show when compared to every other character. Meari, who seemed like she had potential, starting off as a cocky bitch that is humbled by Yumeko before being humiliated by the student council. Sadly, she turned out to be a weaker clone of Yumeko by episode 4 and is only used as a way to explain other games Yumeko plays as the story goes on. Fucking waste of potential. Ryouta is their other friend, but honestly he does nothing in this show. He just reacts to shit happening around him and nods in response and is a waste of space. Fuck him. The only other characters that matter are the one-note members of the student council that only matter for the one episode they are in before getting pushed to the side. Dishonourable mention to eyepatch-girl with the revolver fetish and a chronic masturbation habit, edgy bitch. Although, there is this one supporting character who literally tried to rape Yumeko that was unironically my favourite character purely for that one moment. All kidding aside, every character is awful in their own way and make the show even more predictable and boring.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the production, from a company like Studio MAPPA I was really disappointed. The art style is not impressive, most of the female character designs are generic, backgrounds are fairly basic and visual effect are for the most part impressive. The most controversial feature of the animation has to be the facial expressions and I have mixed feelings about them. On one hand, they showcase how broken and mentally unstable these characters get at times, but these faces just do not fit the visual look of the show and come off as cringe-inducing to me. The fan-service used is also off-putting to me, seemingly thrown in at random intervals in each episode. Yumeko pretending to be a cat was a definite low point for my enjoyment and did more to prove to me that it cares more about sex appeal than anything of substance. The music used was fine to me, with the OP being perhaps the best part of the entire show, which is not a hard feat. The ED however, was nice to listen to once but afterwards was always skipped, as I don\u2019t see how Yumeko walking for 90 seconds as her breasts bounce constantly is worth seeing more than once. The voice acting was fine until characters went into their crazy stage and felt artificial and forced, but I suppose that fits the show unintentionally.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Kakegurui was pretty awful, filled with formulaic, villain-of-the-week gambling matches that felt like a waste of time once it was all over. In the end it was only trying to entertaining on a superficial level; it was never attempting to have a real identity, besides being yuri fapbait. Now I have no problem with anyone who liked the show; you are free to like and enjoy whatever anime you want to, but if someone were to ask me if I enjoyed it? HELL NAW. Lemme put it this way: If you liked Mirai Nikki and Akame ga Kill, you\u2019ll probably enjoy this. But if you are anything like myself and thought those two shows were terrible, Kakegurui ain\u2019t gonna be worth your time. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m off to watch something that is actually worth my time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Ongoing 12-episode Series Preview) \r\n\"Kakegurui\" easily won my heart from episode 1. Although I've only seen four episodes so far, I was more than excited to write a review about this, and can't wait to see more. Its premise is straightforward, but the execution is stunning. Its strengths lie in its dynamic facial expressions, fair storytelling, and high-quality artistry. The aesthetic expression, in all aspects, always manage to complement the mood and tone of the story. Small details, such as lighting, eyes, mouth, wrinkles, all contribute to the viewer's experience.\r\nThe main protagonists Jabami and Suzui both act as archetypal foils to another. This juxtaposition allowsthe viewer to further appreciate the mood, complexity, and humor of the show. The gambling matches reflect those of a videogame 'boss' battle, each having its own unique characteristics, patterns, and spins. This keeps the show exciting and leaves the viewer wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nThe result of the matches are hard to predict, and steps away from stereotypical 'cheap' wins that similar anime fall into. The insanity and savvy of the Compulsive Gambler is highlighted by their philosophy, which isn't introduced through cheap narration, rather through gameplay and thoughtful dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend \"Kakegurui\" for those who enjoy psychological thrillers, nuanced expression, and those who appreciate visually pleasing shows. I really enjoyed this anime, and I'm glad that I picked this up.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not a fan of using buzzwords but it\u2019s hard to ignore the edginess when watching Kakegurui. Based on the manga of the same name, this adaptation translates to a gambling story. I can\u2019t help but think of a wicked thriller when watching this show. It basically takes the idea of gambling and transform it into madness with its characters, setting, and ideas. However, does it live up its hype and worth watching? The answer is quite the opposite.\r\nGetting into this show for some people will likely not be easy. It\u2019s not a recommendable show for anyone unless you really fancy a psychological thriller thatdeals with a crazy cast of characters. The show itself takes place at Hyakkaou Academy. It\u2019s a peculiar school that prepares students for proficiency related to strategizing, mental strength, and of course gambling. To survive, you have to outsmart your opponents and become part of the hierarchy. In other words, it\u2019s survival of the fittest.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode definitely will get you into the mood as we meet Yumeko Jabami, the main protagonist and new transfer student. While Jabami may seem like an ordinary girl at first glance, it\u2019s easy to notice how far she is from normal once she gets herself involved in gambling games. The show chronicles her school days as she takes on opponents with high risk. I mean, it\u2019s gambling. There\u2019s always risk but what\u2019s peculiar about Jabami is that she gambles for the thrill of it rather than for fame or money. In addition, the show makes it clear that Jabami is intelligent as she quickly learns the inside and outside of the school\u2019s gambling games. In fact, there are episodes where Jabami beats her opponents at their own game. However, I can\u2019t firmly say that Jabami\u2019s personality is one that people can appreciate. She is highly unpredictable and truly enjoys the thrill of gambling. From every episode, she has orgasmic reactions when she thinks about gambling. To a certain extent, the show truly wants us to accept Jabami for who she is but I find it difficult to do so. The reason she gambles is irrational and I can hardly find her relatable to anyone. Not to mention, this show doesn\u2019t do an adequate job of getting viewers to understand her better. Her morality regarding gambling is absurd and really lacks reason. She just wants to gamble and treats it as the most exciting thing in the world. I also have to confess that Jabami\u2019s character change from an elegant beauty to a psychotic freak to be difficult to watch at times. In retrospect, Jabami has a lot of flaws in her character and this show doesn\u2019t do a decent job at repairing them.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Jabami, the majority of the cast isn\u2019t far off from their psychotic characteristics. Mary Saotome, the first gambling opponent of Jabami at the school shows her own crazy antics. The majority of the student council has various characters ranging from the mysterious president Kirari Momobami, the violent head of Beautification Committee Midari Ikishima, the calculating Kaede Manyuda, part-time idol Yumemi Yumemite, nail loving Itsuki Sumeragi, and among others. The show tries to make them appealing by injecting their personalities in the most devious way possible. What we get as a result are weak background stories, generic characteristics, and abominable morals. To me, these characters are pretty much all the same and serve as an obstacle to Jabami. The show has Jabami fighting against some of the key members of the student council but the result usually ends up being extremely predictable.  To be quite honest, the anime itself is nothing short but predictable from the start. Even though Jabami isn\u2019t invulnerable to losing, it doesn\u2019t make us feel anything about her situation when she does. Jabami herself doesn\u2019t even seem to care and in many ways, the show tries to express offbeat ideas that come out as uninspiring. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter relationships in this anime is also very questionable. The most normal character at the school would probably be Ryouta Suzui, one of Jabami\u2019s very few allies. He has a very lack-luster personality and I honestly feel like this show would be much better if he didn\u2019t exist. His relationship with Jabami is easily forgettable as the two are very polar opposites. Others also make him look like a fool and to be quite honest, it\u2019s pretty much what he is. That being said, the show makes it clear that the society has many fools. Thanks to the hierarchy that the student council president has made, there are those that are labeled as \u201chouse pets\u201d. Essentially, house pets are those that sink into large debts and are mistreated by the public. Why? It\u2019s the simplicity of social status. Unfortunately, we never really get a full understanding on why this system exists as the show focuses way too much on Jabami\u2019s gambling adventures than anything else. It\u2019s one of the major weakness of the show as everything seems to be about Jabami. The show is like a loop with the same formula. Jabami faces off against an opponent, plays against them at their own game, and gets the orgasmic thrills of it. It becomes tedious fast and lacks substance because of Jabami\u2019s morals. I also don\u2019t really find the games themselves to be thrilling as most are predictable. The games puts emphasis on psychology rather than strategy so don\u2019t expect this show to be smart in any way. I mean, a good majority of the gamblers cheat, manipulate, and do anything to win. Then, there\u2019s Jabami who just wants to enjoy the ecstasy of gambling. On the plus side, adaptation standards remain mostly faithful as the show captures the expressive faces of the characters. Each chapter is adapted carefully with panel by panel storytelling. However, it\u2019s still an incomplete adaptation because manga itself is ongoing. A 1-cour adaptation like this really leaves open a lot of questions and doesn\u2019t tie any loose ends in the end. There\u2019s also original content added in for this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Studio MAPPA, the producers apparently went all out to bring out the sheer entertainment value as much as possible. First, there\u2019s the character expressions that really borderlines inhuman insanity. The art shift is pretty noticeable for almost every gambler in this anime. One minute, they look normal but as soon as gambling business picks up, they go full facial with highly stylized features. Jabami is the guiltiest of this with her psychotic eyes, intense blushing, and body language. The show decorates itself with fan service although this sometimes looks like a satire. Also, it seems this show can\u2019t sometimes hold back on the violence so don\u2019t be surprised if you see blood, vomiting, etc. It\u2019s a crazy world after all.\\n\\n\r\nBy technical elements, Kakegurui\u2019s soundtrack, music, and voice acting is impressive. The theme songs are very stylistic with piano chords, eerie beats, and haunting lyrics. Both theme songs also have a clever tempo that matches the momentum of its creativity. Plus, it\u2019s also hard to ignore the show\u2019s OST during any gambling match when it\u2019s at its highest point. Finally, I have to admit that a good amount of character personality comes from the voices. This could likely be Saori Hayami\u2019s best role to date as Jabami. She had a lot of different voice acting roles in the past before but to me, her character in this show stood out the most. If there\u2019s anything to take away from this anime, it\u2019s to remember the talents of the voices.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kakegurui turned out to be a cheap cash grab that serves as a giant advertisement of the manga. It\u2019s hard to forgive this show when the storytelling is so blend and the characters are brutally depressing to watch. The anime tried far too hard to sell whatever it intended to and ended up delivering a nakedly dumb adaptation. Some of the visual elements, music, and voice acting saved this show from total catastrophe. However, it still makes this show look like a crude joke.\\n",

            "content": "For over the past few years in the anime industry, they brought as so many ''Game'' genre animes like SAO, Accel World, Log Horizon, Btooom! and other ''Game'' animes out there. But the thing is, most of them or should I say ''Almost'' of the anime with a ''Game'' genre are about going into a video game itself and it's getting boring tbh. Summer 2017 season is going to end along with one of its unique ''Game'' anime which is very different to other animes this season because not only it excels to the ''Game'' genre with being different to other animes out there butalso it excels on the psychological part of it. Welcome to Kakegurui. A 12-episodes anime that offers both the craziness of gambling and mechanism of it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nKakegurui brought as a simple story where a student (Jabami Yumeko) just wants to gamble even further, exceeding the expectations of a normal human being like her subordinate Suzui Ryouta.\\n\r\nGambling for her is like soft drinks which has a very good feeling to the body. Not only she's crazy but also she's competitive that from the beginning of the anime (Episode 1 - 3) she has taken an interest to gamble every member of the school's Student Council. The story focuses about competition and power through gambling. If one is a failure, he/she is automatically dropped on this anime's atmosphere. If one is successful, he/she will be consider as an elite on this school. Kakegurui is unique itself from its setup of the school. Normally, school animes are about high school life, romance and other stuffs, but here, competition is a must.\\n\r\nThat's what makes Kakegurui a worth-to-watch anime this season because of its characters focusing on one goal. To be the best. But of course Yumeko is an exception. She just loves gambling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime famous this season is the art of the anime. Mostly, it's about the facial expression of each characters whenever they are thinking, devastated, or confident on winning. Some actually see it as a disturbing one but on my opinion, it reflects the character's attitude and thats the reason it's excellent.\\n\r\nThough it's not only the facial expression. The normal sketches of the anime is already good you know. Though sometimes you think that the normal face is lacking something but when the expression changes drastically, you are quite shocked.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nDo you ever get the feeling that something is going to happen when the sound changes? Or something feel ''uneasy'', well there are parts on Kakegurui that will offer you some a little bit of suspense. Just a little because if it goes high, well this will be a horror anime. Speaking of sound, the opening is excellent with the jazz and music on it. Then followed up by a change of music with the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, from episode 1 - 12, we have seen all the character's traits and development because of the good plot that Kakegurui brought as, though some are lacking history while others are rich of it. As for the MC she's an exception though we can see her development pretty quickly along with some other characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this anime is pretty simple. To see how the character's react, think and make decisions on every game and the anime did it on a splendid well. With gambling as the main core, they derived their strategies and make it simple for the audience to understand like us. I don't know any rules about any gambling games but I understand it a little because of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.. I rate this anime as 8.5/10 or 8/10 for the fact that it focuses on its genre more, character development and the craziness it offers to us this Summer 2017 season.",

            "content": "Gambling is a fairly common topic in manga, though it is seldom adapted into an anime. There is good reason for this: there is little in the way of action that would benefit from adaptation, and exposition really drags on when it needs to be voiced rather than just read. And alongside these conceptual problems, there's the moral repugnancy that Kakegurui revels in, which should serve to further alienate any potential audience. But despite all of this, Kakegurui has somehow won against a stacked deck, and in this review, I'll take a look at how this oddball became a mainstream success.\r\nThis anime covers the first27 chapters of the manga, and then adds on an anime exclusive ending. These chapters essentially serve as an introduction to the world of Kakegurui, establishing the characters and the rules that the world follows. It\u2019s really just setup for the much more interesting second arc, though considering the events of the new ending, I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nIn gambling, there are always two games going on. There\u2019s the game that the characters are playing on the table, but there\u2019s also all of the mind games and cheating that are going on surrounding it. Pretty much all of the games played in Kakegurui are original, though simple and straightforward enough that the audience can quickly understand them. On the other hand, some of the tricks employed are poorly explained, which can be frustrating. But despite the occasional misstep, the gambles generally succeed in remaining tense throughout.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the cast of Kakegurui are terrible. And by that, I don\u2019t mean that they\u2019re terrible characters, but that they\u2019re terrible people. They\u2019re manipulative and sadistic, and with few redeeming traits. But while their actions are regularly cartoonishly evil, there is actually a bit of humanity behind them. For example, there\u2019s a scene in episode eight where one of the villains talks about her ambitions of becoming an actress, and while it in no way justifies any of her behavior, it begins to make her understandable. This pays off when once-villains return as allies, which happens twice in the territory covered by the anime, and a lot more in the next arc. These are easily my favorite games in the series, because Yumeko isn\u2019t actually a very interesting gambler. She can fix dice rolls and memorize things to an insane degree; she\u2019s too good for there ever to be any worry of her losing, and she lacks motivations that the viewer can get behind. Luckily, the show seems to understand this, and often adopts the perspective of her opponents, which keeps tensions high.\\n\\n\r\nBut while I may not particularly like Yumeko, her portrayal by Hayami Saori is easily the highlight of the series. She seamlessly transitions between ladylike calm, playful teasing, and manic edge, and I could not imagine any other seiyu being as perfect a fit for the character. Besides that, the rest of the cast also delivers nicely, but Yumeko is a step above. In regards to the music, it does an excellent job of setting the mood, both through its fantastic opening and the almost constant jazzy background music, and the only place it really stumbles is in the ending theme, which falls behind the standard set by the rest of the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s been a lot of praise given to this anime for its faithfulness in recreating the wild facial expressions from the manga, and I\u2019m not sure that I agree. These faces worked great as single frames, but when they need to be put into motion, they lose the sharpness that made them so iconic. In addition, by focusing so much on faces, other details can suffer. In particular, hands are regularly animated with 3dcg, which is really off-putting once you begin to notice it. But credit where it's due, the opening theme, directed by Yamamoto Sayo, is a real spectacle. Kakegurui is always visually ambitious, and when it works, it can be fantastic, but more often than not, it\u2019s more than Studio MAPPA can handle. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kakegurui has its faults, but it has also demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to make a gambling adaptation work. I would love to see more gambling shows in the future, and hopefully Kakegurui's success will pave the road for that to happen.",

            "content": "A word of caution before getting into this review: There will be minor spoilers. \r\nI thought that overall, Kakegurui was pretty damn fun and enjoyable. 6 may seem like a bad score, but I think it's fair. I scored it based on what it says by it, and it means \"Fine\". Perfectly how I would describe this when I look at this as objectively as possible in my review, and not out of pure enjoyment (else it'd be a 7 or 8, to be honest). Now with that out of the way, into the review. \r\nCHARACTERS \r\nLet's start out with the characters. The majority ofthe notable characters are female. I find this rather unique in a gambling anime since this very rarely happens. The majority of characters also show a crazy side, most of them being female since, as I've said before, most of the notable characters are female. While this isn't anything new, it's understandable since this is gambling themed and gambling can make people go nuts, and this sort of side can add to the excitement or fun of the series, it can also understandably get either dull or ridiculous at times, more likely than not being ridiculous since it often displays most of the characters' crazy side in an exaggerated fashion. There's also one who is just insane all-around, which is the one with the eye-patch, as you probably already would have expected when judging sorely on her appearance in the opening. With how she is, I sometimes wonder to myself why she is even allowed to attend the school. Even when this trait often comes in with the characters, there's quite a good number of characters who either have character development or depth. This even includes Ryouta Suzui, the male main character and one of the most \"normal\" notable characters of the series. Despite the fact that he mostly sits around and watch the games that the main character (Yumeko) participates in while asking and answering questions, even he will gain bits of a type of character development over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is one thing I noticed about the characters, and that all you pretty much ever see are teenagers. Not really any adults. That's not to say that there aren't any in the series, because there are, but with the exception of the one and only teacher you'll ever see that appeared for a very short time and practically the only time in the very first episode, the few that appear in flashbacks, and a few of them talking a little bit to a character in one episode,  there's practically no adults shown to be present. I find this very weird. Who is running the school? Is that person or are those group of people running it indirectly? If they are, do they even care much as to what is going on around the school, like what the student council president making such a system for every student in it to follow? We never know these answers.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move onto the main character, Yumeko. She is your typical character in gambling series that is very good or intelligent that rarely loses. In fact, Yumeko is the usual \"mysterious transfer student that is surprising good at what is essential to this series\" general trope. She's also the usual crazy girl trope when it comes to gambling, having traits like being aroused in a few of them. So you can see that she's quite the typical character in numerous ways. Despite being crazy in gambles, she has likable qualities, the main thing being that she's very kind and actually cares about her friends. There are quite a number of things that I find about her that is more unique or enjoyable to me as the main character. One thing is the fact that she doesn't mainly gamble for the sake of others, because if she did, she would have aimed to defeat the student council in order to stop the sort of corrupted system and to put an end to the corrupted student council. As it usually goes with mysterious main characters, you will learn more about Yumeko as the series progresses and understand even more about her character. The series will unwrap more and more about her personality, which is what the ending theme of this series symbolizes. You will learn things like how she enjoys both herself and her opponent feeling the same pain while both having the chances of winning or losing, and since she likes to risk as much as she could, she'll make sure that her opponent does the same, which would bring great worry to them. The way she feels and witnesses pain in the gambles is full of pleasure. Pretty much a type of hedonist, in short. With these types of numerous aspects of her character, you will understand why many other characters who has a crazy side and are in such a crazy environment will even deem her as being insane, which includes the one who is pretty much completely insane all-around. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, you will only learn the mysteries of her personality. You will not learn much when it comes to her background. It'll unravel a little bit of it at one point in the series, but nothing more than that, and it doesn't look like we'll be able to get anymore than that in the anime series due to how the series ends with it's own, anime-original ending (so it looks like there won't be a second season, though I could be wrong on this). You'll have to go through the original source of it all, the manga of this series (which is still on-going by the time I've made this review) if you want to possibly know more about her background. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY AND SETTING\\n\\n\r\nNext, I talk about the story and setting. The story is simple to follow and know what is going on. Nothing really complicated. The premise, the general setting's rules and what they need to do in order to survive around the school, and even the games themselves are easy to follow. As the anime progresses, you will learn more and more about the school and some things behind the main character. The pacing, for the most part, is also fine. The roller coaster keeps on going nonstop without anything feeling slow-paced, and, for most of what is going on, not rushed at all. Surprisingly, even though this series is filled with pretty looking high-school girls, there's not that much fanservice, or at least anything as strong as the ones in the opening and ending. That's pretty much the most you'll get when it comes to fanservice. There's quite a number of teases, and there are a few scenes like bouncing boobs and boob grabs, but they are very minor in numbers. In fact, as far as I remember, the manga of this has a lot more fanservice than this adaption of it. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all of this however, when you think about it, the story is pretty basic and average. Not really much special, even though there are some nice twists here and there, this in a gambling high school, and the main character doesn't gamble for justice. The usual mysterious transfer student who turns out to be good at what is essential to the series is gambling and defeating anyone standing in the main character's way while aiming to challenge the big-bad is what you can pretty much say about what is going on the whole time. There's also the fact that the setting is literally only in high school. There is almost nowhere else they go. Nearly everything that happens in this series happens only at that exact same school. So if you're expecting them to go literally anywhere else outside of the school grounds even a decent amount of times, then you'll be disappointed. In fact, you would very rarely even see them even going outside of school. You will never see any of the characters' homes. It's pretty weird, as if it wasn't weird enough that you don't really see any adults. \\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the series is quite dark, but not that serious, to be honest. It is marked as a drama series and definitely does have some serious moments, along with very dangerous and risky elements, but still not that serious overall. I would say that despite how dark it clearly is, it mainly portrays itself as being lively and fun, so if you are expecting this to be something pretty serious, you might be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAs an adaption of the manga, it has done pretty well for the most part. It has been extremely faithful to the manga while doing a few things in it's own styles, although they did skip a notable amount of things, and the final episode went into it's own original direction to end things instead of continuing to being faithful to the manga, which is odd when this suddenly happened. To be honest, I find the way it decided to end things in the final episode to be disappointing, and that it just gave me even more of a feeling that this really should have had a couple more episodes in order to adapt the next event that would have been a worthy stopping point to the series in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nGAMES\\n\\n\r\nI would now like to talk about the games. Pretty much all of them are simplistic, straightforward, and pretty much basic plays. This also includes most of the strategies being used. You'll probably quickly understand what's going on throughout. While these aren't necessarily bad things since there's actually not really anything wrong with the gambles themselves, apparently it makes certain others want more from the games, if not much more since it doesn't help that, much like other gambling anime/manga series, the pattern of how the games basically go as are pretty similar (and it's in a basic shounen way), the outcomes of the overall games are mostly very predictable, and that this series focuses a lot on cheaters. Despite all of this, I find that the games can still be enjoyable. Why? The characters themselves and how they exaggeratedly bring out their various emotions and personalities in the different situations of whatever games with the great or ridiculous looking art. This is probably the main aspects in what makes it fun for me to watch through. Seeing the ridiculous reactions from the characters never really gets old for me, but if you're expecting depth in the games from this series, then this will disappoint you. \\n\\n\r\nART AND ANIMATIONS\\n\\n\r\nNow for the art and animations. I think MAPPA did pretty good in the art department. They make the cards and poker pieces look very well done at times, and there is a lot of impressive visual moments and effects in this series. While the character designs themselves mostly look pretty standard, the amount of details they put on certain aspects of the close-up faces impressive to me. This especially goes for their eyes. Not often do I see such beautiful looking eyes nearly everywhere in an anime series, with some of them having nice-looking visual effects. They also added little extra details on different parts on the faces at times, most noticeably on the insane faces, such as bits of wrinkles on the lips and making the nose drawn to look a bit more realistic. This is helpful for the type of faces since it helps give you that ridiculous, shocked, or cringing feeling to the viewers like most were purposely made and presented to be as, and it can even help add into the excitement and feeling of whatever is going on, but the insane faces are understandably not for everyone. Due to the amount of details they often put on them, they can look over-the-top, even when ti comes to  anime usually making things over-the-top. There have been a few to some faces that look absolutely hilarious to me, and I unfortunately mean that in a bad way since I'm not talking about the ridiculous ones that were clearly made purposely to look funny, which are also hilarious looking. As for the animations, they're mostly standard and decent, but there have been a fair number of very good ones. The opening itself is just filled with great animations.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND AND VOICE ACTING\\n\\n\r\nLast I will talk about is the music and voice acting. Starting with the opening and ending, it's honestly a couple of my most favorite songs of the whole season. They're very good and I find them perfectly emphasizing how energetic and upbeat the anime portrays itself as despite how dangerous and dark it is. The opening will take a bit of getting used to, but still great and very stylish. As for the overall soundtrack of the series, I would say it's decent to above average. There's a few weird and questionable tunes, but overall everything else has either been fine or enjoyable, and they fit well in the situations present. The crazier tunes help add to the fun and insanity of the situations the type of songs it's used in. There's not really much to comment on the voice acting to me, but I think they did fine. I think Saori did very well as the main character, Yumeko.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, I think that wraps up the review. If I would have to score and summarize each aspect I've talked about,\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10. A lot of the characters are your typical anime characters, but a good number of notable characters have depth or character development.  \\n\\n\r\nStory and Setting - 5/10. Not really anything special when you think about it, and nearly everything only happens in the school. Not to mention with the way they've ended it at the final episode is pretty disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nGames - 5/10. Not really bad since it didn't do anything wrong, but will probably leave you wanting more from them.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animations - 6.5/10. Great details and sometimes visual effects on numerous things such as the items and certain parts of the faces, especially the eyes, but the insane looking ones are a major hit-or-miss.\\n\\n\r\nSound and voice acting - 7/10. Fantastic opening and endings with a lot of decent to enjoyable tunes in the overall background music, but there are a few questionable or weird tunes. The voice acting is fine to me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10. A very stylish and lively series overall, but it could leave much to be desired, since it's pretty basic when you think about it. As long as you don't expect too much or have very high standards, then I think you'll be fine. I highly suggest watching through the PVs first in order to know what you'll pretty much be getting into throughout if you're still interested.",

            "content": "It where two reasons that I started to watch Kakegurui (Compulsive Gambler) this season. The first where that I\u00b4m planning to read the manga, and was curious about it. And the second and more important one, is that Kakegurui is produced by studio MAPPA. Which happens to be one of my favourite studios after seen what magic they created with the \u201cShingeki no Bahamut\u201d-series. Their animation quality is nothing but as close to flawless as you can get, and they do have a brilliant way of bringing forth the specific design of the show they produce \u2013 they surely know how to place the effectsfor maximum output. And that applies to what they have done with Kakegurui as well. Stunning work indeed. \\n\\n\r\nBut as we all know, that great animation quality is just a factor to the whole experience of an anime. Other factors such as how the story appeal to us, how it\u00b4s narrated, it\u00b4s pacing, and how coherent it is, are also very important to us viewers. For not to speak of the characters. They have to intrigue us, make us feel with them, and feel like real life like persons to capture our interests. But you aren\u00b4t reading this review for a philosophical discussion of what makes up a great anime, you are reading this because you want to know if Kakegurui is a show for you, and/or maybe to see what opinion I have on it. So, let\u00b4s get to the point.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like stunning art and animation? Do you find gambling interesting? Do you find an exclusive high school setting with an almighty student council interesting? Do you find slightly insane gamble addicts, that gets off on high stakes games as entertaining characters? Do you find it exciting to watch people outsmart each other in various games, by the means of reading their opponent? Do you find an almost female only cast appealing? And yes, it\u00b4s sexual innuendos between many of those said female characters, if you were wondering.  \\n\\n\r\nIf your answer is yes on most of those questions, you will probably love Kakegurui. Because that\u00b4s what\u00b4s it\u00b4s all about. Nothing more, nothing less \u2013 it\u00b4s very straight forward. But it\u00b4s done in a very fluent and fashionable way, Kakegurui oozes of class and quality. Everything from the characters body language, facial expression, to the conversations they have, fills out what otherwise is pretty flat story perfectly. Grinding teeth\u2019s, sweat that trickles down the forehead, insane glowing eyes, and the thought process the gambler has is all details that are nicely highlighted.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the animation quality is excellent, studio MAPPPA have really out done themselves again, in their way of capture the core of the story and characters, and brilliantly bring them to life in their unique style. The psycho faces, cards or dices that are thrown in glee on the table, or the excited eyes of a gambler, they captured it all. The colours are strong and vivid, with a fancy for sinful red. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story is very even, not to slow, and not to rushing. And even if Kakegurui has an episodic feeling to it, and that each episode is build up in the same pattern, it feels coherent, and not reparative or to predictable. Because just when you think you figured the whole show out, it does a double take and does something that you weren\u00b4t prepared for. But at the same time, it still follows the same episode pattern. Easily put, in each episode the new student Yumeko Jambai, faces new opponents in different games, and works her way towards the top by very conventional means. Our protagonist isn\u00b4t gambling for power, money or glory, just for the pure rush of the game. That characteristic makes her a very hard opponent to both read and predict, which she uses to climbs up the schools gambling latter.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are really doing a great job to portray their characters, so props to the cast. They all feel very well matched, except the vice president, but I guess that\u00b4s intentional. And when speaking of sounds, the sound effects are the little extra spice in the Kakegurui stew. The sound of grinding teeth\u00b4s, a pulse speeding up, or a sweat drop finding its path down someone\u2019s face to splash on the gamble table, it\u00b4s all very effectual and pronounced. It\u00b4s gives the scene life and feeling, and combined with the great visuals the result it masterly done. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy my time with Kakegurui? Sure, to a certain extent. The story itself isn\u00b4t one of my usual cup of tea, with such a narrow story line and lack of personal growth- and interacting of the characters. The choice to only focus on gambling was risky, either that will appeal to you or it won\u2019t. I fall a bit to the second category, I can absolutely appreciate gambling, or competitions as an element in a story, but to have a whole show around it didn\u00b4t capture my full interest. Had they combined it with more elements, such as character development and relationships a bit more, the final product would\u00b4ve appealed to me much more. But the stunning animation with those little extra sound effects made this a visual feast for me, and the reason that I watched it to the end. The story and its characters I find mildly entertaining, absolutely not boring, just not deep-heart-and-soul-catching, which I highly appreciate in a show. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to come to some sort of conclusion, I would recommend you to watch Kakegurui purely based on the amazing animation, if not the plot seems like your thing, it\u00b4s worth it. But if you indeed find this type of show appealing, then you are in for a treat.\\n\\n",

            "content": "As the players take their seats, excitement fills the air. Cards, gathered up in one quick swoop, become the weapons of this match, as each fighter tries to gather their wits under the intense stress and tension at play. Pulse quickens, the heart accelerates, at the sight of their weapons, as each fighter stares at their enemy in silent anticipation, awaiting any indication into the contents of their hand. As time passes the air grows all the more incredibly heavy and thick, sweat adorning both of these brave warriors, as, suddenly, the signal to throw down their cards to determine the victor is called. Whowill receive Lady Luck's blessing this time?\\n\\n\r\nGambling! High octane stakes and tension! Narratives surrounding the use of gambling are supposed to be exciting, tense, give us a sense of utmost euphoria, and, most of all, be entertaining  as hell! Kaiji is a series that excels in this department, and, while I haven't seen every episode of the show yet, the first eight episodes that I have seen have been everything I look for in a gambling-centric narrative. The stakes are high, being that each game involves the consequence of death if someone were to lose, it's easy to care for our main character after the huge debt that has been left to him and each game is insanely interesting since it becomes a huge psychological battle with players trying to deceive and outwit each with other, with the great animation and soundtrack enhancing each element. Watching the show is essentially like having one giant adrenaline rush, which makes you want to keep watching episode after episode, which is a sign of well-crafted and written thriller around the use gambling. However, Kakegurui (or, if you prefer, Bukkakegurui, which is what I'll be referring to the show as for the rest of the review) is one of the most downright boring shows I've ever had the displeasure of watching, despite having similar ideas and premise to that of Kaiji. But, why is that? Why does Kaiji succeed where Bukkakegurui does not? Well, let's find out! Let's grab a chair, bet some insane amount of money, and remember to have about twenty orgasms as we play, since gambling, for some reason, gets us completely wet! \\n\\n\r\nBukkakegurui's narrative is set inside a prestigious academy which is a tad bit different than conventional schools. While, during the day the school adopts the typical lessons that any student from any school undergoes, at night the school becomes a gambling den, where those who are seeking power and money go to gamble. The series sees our protagonist, Yumeko, an obsessive and insane gambler who experiences an orgasm every time she plays, gamble her way through the student council until the climatic game with the student council president at the very end of the series. In terms of narrative structure, the series is incredibly linear and straightforward, and adopts a \"monster of the week formula\", whereby Yumeko will play off against a new member of the student council of increasing difficulty before coming to the big finale. This structure of storytelling is not inherently bad, and since the focus of the show, and the appeal is based around the games itself, I don't mind the narrative being rather simple. However, there is one problem I have with this formulaic structure, and that is, that Yumeko never grows or learns throughout the duration of the series or in her matches. She never acquires any new tactics or skills during the games that could be applied in later scenarios, and she wins more so because the script tells her to win rather than putting any actual effort into her character winning through clever manipulation, strategy, or anything else that would be remotely interesting. For the sake of argument, let's compare Bukkakegurui to the 1995 series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, which also adopted a \"monster of the week\" formula for much of its duration. The reason why Evangelion succeeds is because during every Angel encounter and fight in the series, we are learning as an audience, both about the nature of the world, and of the characters, in their mental state and emotions. Shinji, Rei and Askua grow, not only in their physical abilities against the Angels, but also as people as well, as they begin to grow to like themselves as the series progresses, and work together as a team. By doing so, it grounds the characters in a more realistic way, and makes them feel far more like actual people, which Yumeko fails at completely, as she is more akin to an over powered Mary Sue who wins just because. While her personality suggests that she gambles so much for the thrill and excitement it brings, which is a fine motivation for her character, it also makes her feel rather boring and one dimensional as we never learn anything about her beyond what is presented at surface level. While there is a mini flashback that suggests that Yumeko is gambling in order to raise money for her sister's operation, or something along those lines, we're never given any more information regarding that aspect, and this idea should have been introduced at the very start of the show, to give Yumeko's matches some actual emotional weight and narrative stakes, but they didn't do that so each match feels incredibly inconsequential.  Speaking of narrative stakes, let's dive into that next!\\n\\n\r\nIn Bukkakegurui, the school is divided into sub sections dependent on how much money you have, with those losing money and being in debt at the bottom, being treated as house pets, while those with money get to rule at the top. If, at some point, you get into enough debt while at the school, the student council will write you out a life plan which determines every element in your life in the future, all planned out for you, from who you will marry, how many children you will bear, among other things. So, there are elements that are at stake here, such as your entire life being ruined forever by this life plan or crippling debt, but the stakes presented in the matches don't work because the characters are all completely one dimensional and it's hard to care for anyone at all. Who cares if Yumeko becomes a house pet or gets a life plan written up for her, when she'll pay back her debts anyway through her gambling? Who cares that someone like Meari ends up with a life plan when she has been nothing but a horrible bitch throughout the show and gets what she deserves? WHO CARES? It's one thing to have narrative stakes, but another thing to have characters who we care about having those stakes inflicted upon them.\\n\\n\r\n In order to better convey what I mean, imagine a scenario in which I have two rocks. The first rock, rock A, represents the characters presented in Bukkakegurui; they're all horribly one dimensional, lack personality and are hard to care for in the slightest. We don't learn anything about them as actual people, despite the fact that they're all hungry for power or vast amounts of wealth, nor do we feel any connection to them on any personal level since there is no time devoted for fleshing them out. The other rock, Rock B, represents a character that we have had time to care for. They're here not, because they find thrill for gambling, but because they have no other choice. Perhaps they have a large debt to pay off, or have to gamble for money for an operation to save a love one or something, but what's important is that we learn about this character in order to feel some kind of connection, and the fact that they're an underdog will make the audience root for them more, and will make the games more exciting as the character will have to come up with new strategies constantly, driving more investment in the narrative. The audience should experience the world through this character's eyes, so not only do we become more attached to them as an actual person but also so that we can see how they grow and think. Now, with both rocks categorised, let's say I bring in a sledgehammer, thus introducing the concept of death and smash them both. Now, which rock do you care for? Obviously the rock with more of a personality, back-story, and have had time to care for. And this is why I find no excitement whilst watching the show and why I don't care about anything that is happening.\\n\\n\r\nNow, people may argue against me by suggesting I am taking the anime too seriously and should just shut my brain off and enjoy the series as a rule of cool, dumb show, since there are plenty of pretty silly elements, and the games in the anime are the reason why I should be watching it since that is the main appeal of the show. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad stance to take, and I want to clarify now that I don't begrudge anyone who has actually managed to derive entertainment from this show, but I can't see the show in this light since I found most of the elements to pretty boring, especially all the games, which, for a show that is focused completely around this idea, is a pretty bad sign on the quality of the work!\\n\\n\r\nEach game in Bukkakegurui is boring, lifeless and we don't learn anything during the match about either participant involved, other than, sometimes, very short back stories consisting of only thirty seconds or so. Most of the games are essentially just Yumeko winning by either complete luck, or figuring out how her opponent is cheating in some way and the way she determines this and discovers how they are doing so feels so contrived and stupid that I want to slam my face into a wall. Now, luck is a HUGE aspect of gambling, so therefore her wins through luck are not necessarily that bad (even though it really pushes it in plenty of places) but there's no attempt at creating anything interesting. Aside from the games being incredibly simple anyway, there is no psychological battles taking part, none of the characters are attempting to outwit one another and there is hardly anything present that made Kaiji's games interesting. You never really get that cathartic feeling when you witness an intense match go on for ages when a character outsmarts another in some creative way as you say to yourself, \"Ah! How clever!\" The few times they do try and throw a curveball into the games or when Yumeko tries to outwit her opponent it feel so weak and dry since the in-the-moment logic is incredibly shallow and the way the story tries to awkwardly implement in these elements is so insulting to the intelligence of the audience as the show thinks that by throwing some random curveball at the final moment is a plot-twist or a smart way to deceive the audience since they didn't see it coming, because it appeared out of thin air. The only time the anime ever comes close to being somewhat entertaining during a match is in episodes six and seven where Yumeko gambles against someone who, believe it or not, is even more insane than she is, by the name of Midari Ikishima, a girl who finds pleasure in harming herself through the use of gambling. During her match with Yumeko, they both decide to play Russian roulette, which raises the narrative stakes and tension since it introduces the consequence of death into the game, although it is hard to care for anything that is going on, because, as I've said, the characters are dry and boring, and also because it's pretty obvious that nobody will actually die during the match anyway, but still the scene comes the closest out of any to actually entertain me, and, even then, the scene is still incredibly weak.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, as I've previously mentioned, are all incredibly hard to care for, and are pretty much all absolutely insane! Most of the characters take the utmost pleasure in laughing hysterically at their enemies, smiling and looking down upon them during a game if it is going in their favour, which makes everyone feel like an unlikeable, one dimensional asshole. The show often utilises cheap victimisation in a pathetic attempt to manipulate us into feeling sorry for these cardboard cut-outs, and nowhere is this more evident than in episode nine, where, a student council member who also happens to be an idol with a huge following, has her secret revealed to all of them, in which, recorded on a tape, she proclaims that she finds all of her fans to be absolutely disgusting and she hates the fact that she has to even shake their hands since it makes her puke. Despite that already sounding incredibly horrible anyway, she as a person is a complete and utter twat, with no redeemable qualities, hiding behind the facade of being a wonderful idol. During the episode, when the secret is revealed, she breaks down crying, as she comes to the realization that her dream is now ruined. I expect that the creators of the show wanted the audience to sympathise with her, but how can we when she is such a horrible twat who got everything she deserved? And, if that's not already bad enough, the audience gets a direct kick to the nuts straight after when all of her fans forgive her! That's right! If you're a horrible person with no likeable traits who gets what they deserve, all is forgiven if you simply have a dream you want to uphold!\\n\\n\r\nI could go on more and more about each one of the other characters, but at that point I'd be beating a dead horse since they all suffer from the exact same problems I've talked about before. Perhaps the only character who doesn't fit into this mould is one of our main protagonists, who offers so little to the narrative that you could omit him from the plot entirely and it wouldn't make a single difference! Now THAT'S a good main character! I suppose his main purpose is to act as the voice of reason and rationality in the story since he is the only sane character, and the one the audience can relate to the most, but if that's what they were attempting to do with his character, then they failed horribly since I honestly forget this guy is even here half the time. They try and make it out that he and Yumeko have this deep friendship, since she helped him recover from his debt in the beginning of the series, but their relationship feels superficial, as if the only reason they're even friends in the first place is just because the script dictates as such. His main purpose in the show is to deliver random expository dialogue and that's pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that Bukkakegurui gets right, then that's in the animation and art department. The show is very visually appealing, with pretty attractive and striking character designs, that blend well with the rather unique school uniform designs too. Not only that, but the show has plenty of super detailed close-up shots of character's faces to convey, not only the insanity of each one, but to also represent the sexual euphoria each character attains whilst in the games, and Bukkakegurui does a good job in that area. It's clear that the animators put a lot of work into making the show as visually interesting as they possibly could, but it's not without its inconsistencies however. CGI is sometimes used during close-up shots of the player's hands when dealing with cards, and it not only looks terrible, but is so jarring as well. Luckily CGI isn't used all too much aside from this one instance for some odd reason, so I can let it slide for the most part. The music is overall fine, and pretty forgettable, mostly consisting of free-from jazz that is way too suave and sophisticated for a show at this level of trashiness. The opening and ending tracks however are both damn great! The opening especially I love, with its use of stylish visuals and fantastic music, which almost tricks you into thinking that the actual show will carry the same energy and charisma. The voice actors as well all do a pretty stellar job in their respective roles, perfectly capturing the voice of someone who is insane!\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Bukkakegurui was a massive disappointment, and I think that's what makes the show ultimately more aggravating for me. While I dislike using the word to describe anything, I feel it is pretty appropriate when talking about this one, and that word is cringey! The show reeks of desperation, and tries way too hard to be edgy, and ends up just being embarrassing instead since many of the scenarios presented in the show, such as a scene in which Yumeko acts like a cat on all fours, feel as if they were written by a twelve-year-old. It fails as an intense thriller, it fails as a character study, it fails as a gambling show, but most importantly it fails at the most basic level to achieve any emotional connection with the audience. Bukkakegurui is a show more interested in over blown theatrics than it is in characters and the actual games itself, and the reason why this show is so bad. I can't even recommend this to be people on the grounds that it is \"so bad that it's good\". Just watch Kaiji instead...\\n\\n\r\nBukkakegurui is a word trademarked by the great NFMaster! All credit goes to that sexy bastard!\\n",

            "content": "As someone who has been keeping up to date with the manga, Kakegurui was an anime I've been looking forward to this season. However, knowing that this is going to be a Netflix show made me pretty frustrated, but I went on to watch the show through other ways.\r\nWhat do I think about Kakegurui? It's very faithful to the original source material. Kudos to MAPPA for getting much of what made the manga great, with the art and character expressions being accurate. Though not as interesting and suspenseful like other gambling anime, the show still keeps it entertaining throughout. Characters add so much emotion tothe anime and basically carry it through predictably boring gambling scenes. This show is great gateway material and its good and exciting enough to hold up as one. Possibly the best OP of the season (and maybe the entire year),  Kakegurui's OP is fantastic. It has so much symbolism and connection to the manga that it contests any JJBA anime openings. BGM isn't really something to write home about, but it does well to build up the tension and atmosphere. The ED might seem like fanservice at first, but there's a sort of hidden symbolism in it, representing the change of Yumeko as a character.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the manga, you should definitely watch this. If you're coming in blind, I would recommend reading the manga first and watch it later (which you can actually do, since there's no legal way to watch it with english subs yet), since you won't be able to appreciate much of the what anime is doing right. Overall, if you're looking for an anime to watch this season, this definitely should be something that you need to consider.",

            "content": "I was a bit sceptical about this anime after reading its description but after watching the first episode I became addicted to it.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWhile the plot isn\u2019t something extraordinary, \u201cKakegurui\u201d is focused more on the psychological aspect of the story: how do you escape from critical situations, what do you do when your future is at stake, when you\u2019re about to lose your family\u2019s fortune in a game?  The whole plot revolves around Jabami, a transfer student that happens to be obsessed with gambling and makes her name widely known in her school from the first day of attendance. Even though each episode hasa repetitive storyline, there\u2019s always a plot twist that keeps you intrigued and prevents boredom.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nEach and every character is unique and represents a stereotype. Jabami, the main character, is by far the most complex out of them all: she is beautiful, insanely smart, and crazy (not necessarily in a good way). The way she expresses her emotions and theories always drives the people around her to the point of madness and breaks their masks allowing them to show their true identities. Some of the supporting characters are well portrayed, though there are fewer details about them but their interaction with Jabami relieves fragments of their stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nI have rarely seen emotions so well portrayed in an animation. They literally made every feeling come to life on the faces of the characters and in their eyes. Especially in the most intense scenes, the expressions of the gamblers are so exaggerated; their eyes are so vivid that it feels like the whole moment is coming to life before your eyes. The animation is the work of a perfectionist, the details are amazing and everything is well placed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI love the innocent voices of the characters and the way they change under stress. The music is beautiful and the opening and ending are both perfect in illustrating the theme of the whole anime. The music matches the atmosphere of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs I previously said, this anime is totally addictive, especially for the way the characters (mostly Jabami) think. With every episode I can\u2019t wait to discover more about the wicked lifestyle of these rich students and their gambling strategies. It\u2019s truly the best anime of this season and one of the best of its kind. \\n",

            "content": "(ONLY 4 EPISODES HAVE BEEN RELEASED AS OF THE TIME I'M WRITING THIS. RATING WILL MOST LIKELY CHANGE TOWARDS THE END OF THE SHOW.)\r\nHaving read the manga, it's needless to say that I was totally hyped when an anime for Kakegurui was announced to be in the works. I still remember getting so excited for episode 1 that I ended up waiting all night just to watch it. Of course, there were still doubts on the back of my mind. What if this adaptation turns out to be disappointing? But the thing was, I didn't even need to worry about that stuff, because this adaptationdidn't disappoint me at all.  \\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nThis is basically a high school anime in which high school students are required to gamble each other for rank, status, and popularity. If a student finds himself in a huge debt, then it's anything but good since those who are in the bottom 100 are to be labelled as \"housepets\", the lowest of the low. This is the situation that one of our main characters, Ryouta Suzui, finds himself after losing in a gamble with another main character, Saotome Mary.\\n\\n\r\nIt is said that if you find yourself in the housepet position, then it's impossible for you to get your status back. Suzui thought so too, that is, until a gambling maniac by the name of Jabami Yumeko suddenly transfers into the school.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime mainly follows Yumeko as she gets involved in various gambles with a lot of people, with her goal being the cause of the gambling madness: the student council president.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in this anime is good. It's not too fast, and it's not too slow. In my opinion, it's just right. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nI absolutely adore how this is animated. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of certain scenes. For example, the anime is in a normal school life kind of part, the animation is more normal and calm, but when a gamble begins, then the whole feel of the show changes because of the way the animation slightly changes. The whole scene suddenly becomes more tense and gripping. This is most obvious in scenes where Yumeko becomes truly mad in gambling.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, special mention the OP animation, I think it's just gorgeous and sets the tone for the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI immediately fell in love with the OP and ED when I first heard them both. But I have to say that I like the OP more. How should I describe it, I wonder? Well, Kakegurui [i]is[/i] a show about gambling, and, this OP is, for lack of a better word, jazzy. A perfect match, if I do say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nI have no issues with the voice acting. Everything is exactly how I imagined it to be, especially with Yumeko and Mary. Yeah, Yukino, the always calm and collected high school girl from OreGairu, she's a gambling maniac now. Feel old yet? \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nNow, what I consider to be the weakest aspect of this series is the characters. Yes, all of them are interesting in their own little ways, but I find it difficult to point out characteristics that \\n\r\nmake them unique, and as a result, they're quite forgettable. Well, except for Yumeko, I guess. She has the \"going crazy in gambles\" thing going for her, so good for her. However, the other characters aren't as memorable. Especially Suzui (who is ironically a main character), he's kind of \"just there\" all the time so the viewers have someone to explain what's going on to them.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 10\\n\r\nWhat were you expecting? The Kakegurui manga is in my favorites, so I still would have given this a 10 based on personal enjoyment even if it did end up being a terrible adaptation. I've been hooked since episode one, and I can't wait for all the future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nHonestly, I'd give this a 10, but I think it's still too early to give this adaptation a final verdict. All I know is that I'm really enjoying what the Kakegurui anime is offering us right now. (Will most probably change overall score as the show progresses.)\\n\\n\r\nEven if you haven't read the manga, or aren't into this kind of anime, I still recommend trying to at least watch the first episode. Who knows? You might just come to like it too.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I finished watching this a week ago. Don't believe everything I said here. The original ending turned this potential great anime into  a piece of shit. Go read the manga. My final rating is a 5/10.\\n",

            "content": "Kakegurui- The Great Value Brand of Kaiji: Now with Chicks!\r\nThe dim, incandescent can light burns the back of your head from above. Your mouth is a desert, lips parched as you struggle to even swallow your own saliva. An irregular heart beat increases its oscillations, and your vision blurs as you attempt to read your own cards. You're a house pet, a term coined only for those drowning in the debt of the student council and this one hand of poker could either seal your fate for the rest of your life, or set you free of the shackles of your dues. Anger, guilt, nervousnessand tension well up inside your brain, clouding any sense of strategy once present in your arsenal. The remaining cards are dealt, each one like a subsequent dagger being driven into the heart. Your fingers dig into the cheap felt table lining and begin to burn from the friction. As the last card approaches, thousands of scenarios race through your mind, and your opponents stoic appearance does nothing to ease the pressure. Will you survive? Will your reputation and existence be dismantled, succumbing to the hands of the tyrannical council?\\n\\n\r\nThe final card slams down with a thunderous echo\u2026\\n\\n\r\nGambling is a subject rare to take center stage in the realm of anime. Kaiji, Death Parade and Liar Game are some of the only examples I can think of in the medium, until studio MAPPA\u2019s (Zankyou no Terror, Yuri!! On Ice) Kakegurui landed this season. From a viewer\u2019s perspective, for the gambling to really have an impact on our senses the scenes must comprise a balance of suspense, mind games and creativity. Kaiji the Gambler, arguably the best example I can think of features a main character literally gambling for his life, in games that are either very intricate or require a large degree of mental fortitude to participate in. The result is white-knuckle tension that has your finger hovering over the skip button, ready to binge through the entire anime in one sitting. Kakegurui attempts to mimic Kaiji\u2019s critical success with a different target audience by introducing better animation and a more familiar setting, high school. Because, you know, that makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a \u201cwell visioned\u201d setup, with taboo setting of school in which students engage in lavish betting and gambling once the last bell rings for the day. We witness firsthand the daunting effects of losing in this school: you're deemed a \u201chouse pet\u201d and everyone treats you accordingly. This wouldn't be quite as ridiculous if it weren't for the fact that kids are ridiculed and treated like shit in high school to begin with. In essence, this significantly dilutes any ounce of realism with regards to the stakes these students are playing for, and ultimately the entire premise from the beginning. The \u201cupside\u201d is that IF you are successful at gambling and start raking in the dough, your family is already rich as fuck so\u2026. none of this betting really even matters to begin with. See my point? From its inception, Kakegurui\u2019s narrative is faulted. The whole premise of the anime seems pointless in that if you win, you'll be rich and if you lose, you'll still be rich but get treated like that awkward kid who frequently gets stuffed into lockers. The student council seeks to rule the school with an iron fist, but I'm not sure what they actually do; except cheat to win, fly in fancy helicopters and wear terrifying androgynous masks.\\n\\n\r\nUnassuming transfer student Yumeko Jabami looks to shake things up at this school by winning any and every gambling match she's in. Countless opponents fall victim to her innate ability to see through tricks and deftly play each person for a fool. This can be frustratingly similar to the No Game no Life effect, in which Sora and Shiro\u2019s victory was assumed prior to them even starting the game. To top it off, Jabami seems to get off on the thought of risking \u201ceverything\u201d on each of her matches. Each of her mental orgasms is brought to our attention in exhausting detail, as her eyes leer red and her legs tremble with excitement. The anime progresses almost episodically with a \u201crinse, repeat\u201d effect. New characters are introduced, Jabami challenges them, a new game is played and Jabami emerges victorious yet again. This process repeats over and over and over again in a due loop merry-go-round. There\u2019s no sense of doubt, no uncertainty built into the script. It\u2019s a perpetual nightmare from a scripting perspective.\\n\\n\r\nWith Jabami at the helm, we as viewers never really experience her thoughts about anything. Neither her strategy, intuition or objective ever becomes clear and the games themselves often end up narrated by her foes. Long, overthought monologues about what they \u201cthink\u201d she is planning through each and every move, which began to take a toll on my attention span since I knew the eventual outcome prior to each match taking place. And since a majority of the anime is spent \u201cin game\u201d and we don\u2019t catch a glimpse of what Jabami is thinking, her characterization is thrown out the window. The rare occurrence of a line of dialogue from our \u201cheroine\u201d is spent devilishly coercing another one of her pawns to help her with a bet in the game. The main protagonist in the anime doesn\u2019t even have fucking character development\u2026 it\u2019s embarrassing.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention how edgy Kakegurui is? I was legitimately interested to see where the plot would unfold when I started the series, but my supposition quickly dissolved when I uncovered the anime\u2019s true nature. It\u2019s 2017, so I\u2019m not sure what I expected, but the initial consensus was that I was at least intrigued. So a girl gets her jollies by gambling, who cares? But, when EVERY character acts as if they\u2019re on the verge of insanity? Now we have an inherent problem. Not to mention the horrifically unattractive adrenaline slut who gets wet thinking about having her head blown off from a game of Russian Roulette. It\u2019s a sex scene away from being a dumpster fire Sundance film about how fucking \u201craw and gritty\u201d some teenager\u2019s life is. Again, it\u2019s the tactical diversion producers craft to steer the audience away from how dreadfully written a show can be, simply because it\u2019s dark or shocking. I don\u2019t always mind this level of scheming when the veil is at least entertaining. But in Kakegurui, you get the worst of both worlds: badly written and boring.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be a disservice to anime fans everywhere if I didn\u2019t at least attempt to address the comparisons between Kaiji and Kakegurui. Kaiji as a protagonist is someone you can really root for. His awful luck is inviting, in a sympathetic manner. He basically starts from nothing, and risks his actual life for a chance at redemption. Jabami comes from out of nowhere, with no clear motive and little to no relatability. Kaiji\u2019s gambling games are fewer, but are better explained and have a more intricate explanation. Kakegurui falters, partially due to a shorter run time, and that the games are changed so quickly that less attention is given to their development. It feels like the writers are more focused on getting through everything vice making an impact on what they introduce. Kaiji is primarily a male cast, making it harder to attract female viewers but ideal for a seinen genre. Kakegurui has more females than you can shake a stick at: loli\u2019s, tsunderes and yanderes to boot. Hence my opening statement in the review. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, most of Kakegurui\u2019s dialogue comes from the opposition, creating a wall between the viewer and the character appearing to be the main protagonist (Jabami). In Kaiji, this internalizing is shared between he and his adversaries. It creates an equilibrium that helps the viewer rationalize either end of the gamble. \\n\\n\r\nI think it\u2019d come off as redundant if I expounded any more about the characters in Kakegurui. Despite having significantly less screen time, Ryouta and Meari receive significantly more development than Jabami, inflating my unpopular opinion of her ten-fold. We do get some back story on a few minor characters, but nothing short of a plot device in order to propel the story forward. Possibly the most interesting character from the entire cast is Manyuda, who actually has a clearly defined motive, is cutthroat and calculating and doesn\u2019t seem to break character as much to partake in edgy escapades. Oh yeah, and he\u2019s the only member of the student council who actually gambled fairly, at least in his own game. If you\u2019re looking for relatable or enticing characters, Kakegurui may not be the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything I learned from watching Kakegurui, it\u2019s that facial expressions are apparently everything. In an environment where maintaining a \u201cpoker face\u201d is often sought after, the animators in this anime decided to do the exact opposite and emblazon a crazy face on almost every character in the cast. It\u2019s brilliant in some respects because it helps distract the viewer from the rest of the anime\u2019s inadequacies by giving them a fresh dose of ADHD, but is entirely unnecessary. It does helps manifest some false suspense, only it ends up making some of the scenes more irritating. The rest of the animation is quite good, and the overall tone it sets for the show works well for the subject matter. The character models are attractive and proportional, and the flashier scenes with dialogue-heavy moments please the eye. One major blemish on the art side would be the complete lack of animation with the Jabami idol karaoke scene. It came across as complete laziness, with the still image of Jabami fading out into the completion of her song. I\u2019m not sure if this was intentional, but it was jarring to say the least. To help make up for it, they at least added a completely random duet between her and Yumemi to close the episode.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, I absolutely love the OP for the show. It\u2019s a psychedelic, sexy acid trip with a risque\u2019 jazz track narrating the visuals. If you look closely, it even tells a small story relating to the story progression of the anime itself. The ED on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired, sans the mystery of what\u2019s underneath Jabami\u2019s outer layer of clothing. The song isn\u2019t even catchy, a quality I can at least cling to in an ED. The rest of the soundtrack existed to create false tension and accentuate the mood of its corresponding scenes, and I can\u2019t recall it being necessarily bad. Voice acting in Kakegurui is one of its strong points, and I can only imagine how much fun the seiyuus had considering how edgy the series can be. The actors actually had a chance to break character and have a good time.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an entertainment perspective, Kakegurui hits all the wickets. It has hot girls, great animation and an almost avant-garde approach to storytelling that could be incredibly appealing to young, impressionable audiences (aka, most of the anime community). This being said, I can\u2019t be baffled by how well the show was received, even if I didn\u2019t agree with it. This is the main purpose of a reviewer or critic, to point out enjoyment as well as flaws. I\u2019d be lying to you if I said I didn\u2019t enjoy Kakegurui. But is it a good gambling anime? Hardly. It suffers from a severe lack of character development/relatability and has an edgy stigma about it I can\u2019t shake. The previous negatives coupled with the unrealistic premise can create some harsh criticisms and overall disappointment. I\u2019d recommend this to fans of shows like Re:Zero, No Game No Life or any other similar series, due in part to it being edgy and appealing to a certain audience. Thank you to all for reading this review, and be sure to check out the rest of my Summer 17 ones!\\n\\n\r\nStory-2\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nSound-7.5\\n\r\nCharacter-3\\n\r\nEnjoyment-5\\n\r\nOverall-4.45",

            "content": "Holy GOD. This anime.\r\nOkay, I admittedly started watching it because the OP looked like a jazzy rendition of a girl gathering a bunch of other girls into her lesbian harem, but I certainly wasn't disappointed with what I actually got when I watched it, because holy crap. \r\nYumeko is a girl who starts a new school where Gambling is used to basically decide the school's hierarchy. Yumeko is 100% on board with this.\r\nThe way this anime handles it's facial expressions and characters is just godly. Some people might think the expressions are TOO exaggerated, but I think they're rad and really represent how evil therush of gambling can make people.  Yumeko herself is perfect, I absolutely adore how they didn't go with the whole 'lets thrust this innocent character in this awful gambling world and watch her beat people in the name of JUSTICE AND LEARN A LESSON IN THE END'\\n\\n\r\nYumeko's genuinely enjoying every second of this school and can go cold-blooded in a second if someone says something that isn't what she wants to hear. This, and tons of other things is what makes this anime a must-watch, in my opinion.  I'm loving this so far, and can't wait to see where it goes next! 9/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEDIT on 8/29/17: Okay, I'm now on episode 8, and holy SHIT. This series hasn't gotten any less amazing. It's gotten even better, in my opinion, adding on more quirky/insane/conniving characters and giving tons of depth to characters I thought we'd never see much. \\n\\n\r\nYumeko is still the scummy, genius of a goddess that we all love. Suzui is still...well, he's sweet and gives the anime a cute dude to be on par with all the cute girls, and I'm sure more use'll come of him later. \\n\\n\r\nMary's blown me away honestly. I can't say much without spoilers, but...I didn't think we'd see much of her and know of her as anything more than 'the girl Yumeko beat first', and BOY was I wrong! The way they manage to keep her in character, aka cocky, overbearing and tsundere as hell and still make her lovable and pretty damn cute is quite impressive. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, before writing Kakegurui off as the overrated hype series of the season, give it an episode or two. Even people who despise it have to admit the way the anime goes about things is interesting as hell, and so engaging that I'm all over the newest episode as soon as it comes out. \\n\\n\r\nI genuinely don't want this anime to end, but I can't wait to see how they wrap the first season up, and I have complete faith they'll make it an amazing finale. I'm sorry for adding so much more, but I feel like I really didn't praise this series enough before and it's only gotten better, so I just had to add more. (I'll most likely add one more edit when it finishes.)\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui, keep being rad :D!",

I'll try to work around spoilers and keep it short. And I assure you this review is completely unbiased (wink wink). That is to say I absolutely love it.\r\nLet me tell you this: it's hard to represent mania, and this anime has it on lock. It's rare to see a chaotic character represented in media that it's not psychopathic or lacking any emotion or empathy, in fact this is quite the opposite, the characters are so overwhelmingly filled with all kinds of emotions that theykeep exploding in this maniacal behavior. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly simple, the setting is not something incredibly innovative but the execution of the rest makes it completely believable and perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe art its absolutely amazing, it gets you excited, it makes you laugh, it's aesthetically coherent, it fits perfectly. It makes you scream \"YES!!! STEP ALL OVER THEM!!\" while making the same faces they do in the games. Even the CG is on point.\\n\r\nThe sound is impeccable. Sound effects in moments of pure caricature are just enough to get the crazy visuals over the edge, not to mention the soundtrack (that freakin' opening).\\n\r\nThe characters are super-exaggerated humans, they aren't your typical Hollywood casino movies lot, they are absolutely insane and to say that is an understatement. They steamroll over their enemies while making insane expressions, while still being cold and calculating... most of the time.\\n\r\nThe content of this review must have revealed my enjoyment with this so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I see amazing potential in the episodes to come and it got me hooked up, I will eventually update this review if my opinion changes over the course of the episodes. Let's hope it'll keep the current score. If you are looking for a fresh anime, this is sure to keep you entertained.",

Even though the story might have some flaws about gambling, it is enjoyable seeing how everyone cheats and in the end, I find this anime to have a very high potential and surely might be one of MAPPA's best anime yet. Has some flaws and is also pretty faithful after reading some of the manga chapters while waiting for each episode to air and I recommend it to everyone who loves watching high stakes related anime and is pretty unique in the anime media but not so much in the manga.",

            "content": "I really never thought this show were about to become a slow pace, but then since the first episode released, it all suddenly kept the edge my seat and felt interested to this show. The thing about Compulsive Gambler is that it's all about gambling, specifically it's all about money for reality in what we do nowadays. But this could be different actually. I haven't read the manga yet and I was too lazy to read it, so I've decided to get on with it. Although it doesn't lie to us, it promises something what we wanted to have when the hype is been approved.\\n\\n\r\nThere are three main protagonist characters but I've decided to discuss two instead. Suzui Ryouta, who is in Yumeko's classmate before she transfers into Hyakkaou Private Academy. Suzui became a livestock after he lost the game against Maeri and suddenly ended up being treated as Maeri's livestock, and is called 'Pochi' (a common name for a dog). Yumeko Jabmai, like I mention earlier about the private academy where she transfer to those. The thing about Yumeko is she's actually a \"Kakegurui\", 'someone who finds pleasure in taking risks.' I always felt anxious as an audience, not because she's my favourite character. It has potential risk of money while gambling and how it plays. She's one of the individual character that would describe reckless but flawless at the same time and it becomes kinda disturbing. It does add that all the characters have a crazy personalities. Although Yumeko has a sense of irony when it comes execution. It's all about a philosophy how she suddenly manages to figure out. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are in the matches, it is hard to predict how result will end up. The audiences/fans don't have good potential theories to pick up while they're watching the real game and it ain't who they suppose to be, I'm just saying to be honest. But Compulsive Gambler does featured their philosophy, it also justify the game modes throughout the gameplay. \\n\\n\r\nI do constantly say it's highly recommend to watch for those who enjoy these genres. Although the popularity is increasing pretty fast but slow at the moment. This show is fairly far more entertaining actually, I really don't want to explain too much about it. So I think it's fun to watch and not to say it's 'worth to watch' but that's my impression.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nDo you like cute anime girls making crazy facial expressions? Do you like male mc\u2019s who are completely inconsequential to the plot? Perhaps this is the right show for you? But not so much for me. Find out why after this commercial break. \r\n*Please go out and buy this product. You can hit the skip button after five seconds.*\r\nAnd we\u2019re back.\r\nKakegurui is a highly unconventional anime that happens to be set in a high school. The show begins with Ryouta \"Pochi\" Suzui, our unheroic protagonist who\u2019s essentially relegated to background character by episode four. In the first episode we find that thatRyouta has just lost a game against our first head case named Meari Saotome. As a result, he becomes a house pet, which is what happens when a student is unable to pay back the debt. \\n\\n\r\nDid I mention that gambling is the only thing that matters in this school? It\u2019s explained early on this is a school for rich kids who are taught that in order to succeed as heirs to their parent\u2019s stacks of cash they must learn how to be good gamblers. As outrageous as this sounds, it\u2019s just fiction, so I\u2019ll suspend my disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Yumeko Jabami, our main female protagonist and obligatory best girl. The show is named after her personality as a \u201ckakegurui\u201d which means someone who finds pleasure in taking risks (when I right clicked on the word kakegurui it suggested that I was misspelling fruitcake. True story.) And that term can\u2019t be taken lightly. Gambling makes this girl wetter than Yuno in the pool with Yukki in episode 3 of Mirai Nikki. I all seriousness, I find her behavior awkward. She's far more interesting than Ryouta, and has some inkling of a heroic nature. Overall she seems to be the most emotionally strong character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here onward the story is mainly about Jabami gambling against other students, which include: Itsuki Sumeragi, yet another psychotic girl (seriously this school of full of them) who likes collecting the fingernails of those she defeats in gambling. Basically later in life this girl could be a likely successor to Elizabeth Bathory. Bet your nails on it (but seriously, don\u2019t.) Jabami\u2019s next opponent is  Yuriko Nishinotouin, a 3rd year student who looks like she should\u2019ve graduated thirty years ago. Once again we find ourselves watching yet another obscure gambling game that has the suspense of waiting in line at McDonalds. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also some obscure fan service, which has overall been pretty meh in this series. You don\u2019t really see that much skin. The closest we get to that is watching Midari Ikishima briefly masturbate whilst playing Russian roulette with herself. Yeah, that\u2019s a thing. This show can\u2019t seem to go five minutes without one character acting as though they\u2019ve just escaped a mental institution.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve watched up until this point. I\u2019ll update my review accordingly. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: It\u2019s strange, yet entertaining. The music is well done and adds well to the atmosphere. The animation is also fairly strong (it better be in the current year) but that\u2019s about it on the positives. The story is so fixated on its gambling matches that it feels like I\u2019ve barely gotten to see any other side to this world.  The characters all feel too similar to one another with the exception of our wooden plank of a male mc. Most of the characters of focus thus far have been females with varying degrees of crazy. The games are okay, but I don\u2019t feel much suspense watching them. They\u2019re slightly unpredictable, but I am starting to pick up on the formula being used. I\u2019ll probably continue this show so that I can finish this review. So far it\u2019s a 6/10 for me. \\n",

            "content": "Kakegurui, an anime that solely revolves around the idea of social stature, as well as your life in general, all depend on your ability to gamble. Of course in some arbitrary wealthy high school.\r\nBefore I start rating the anime, I want to first state that I intended on dropping this anime after the first episode. This was due to the fact that in the beginning, the way the characters acted came out as cringe and cliche to me. I will explain this further in the review. \r\nStory: 6/10: The story of this anime takes place at Hyakkaou Private Academy, and it starts off with yourclassic and cliche hot transfer student, to which one of our protagonists was forced to show her around the school. I'm sure there could have been plenty of other ways to approach this, but it was necessary in order to lead up to important dialogue which in turn strengthens the bond between these two characters. Throughout the story so far, our two main protagonists have been sticking with each other, one being useless, and the other being a complete genius. What really made me stay was the introduction of the student council. They were shown as bosses, and since the gambling battles that took place before their introduction were very intense, you could imagine how it would be going up against these \"bosses\". This is what kept me going. Well that and the insane plays and reads that took place.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10: The art is absolutely fantastic. The reason I'm not rating it a 10/10 is because sometimes it's a little too much for me. The artists did an amazing job reflecting the mood with certain facial expressions. But I wasn't ready for what was to come, even though I knew that this anime would be filled with horror and intensity, I still wasn't prepared. There isn't much to say about the art other than how crazy good it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: I'm a little disappointed with the sounds, and how it couldn't complement the art as much as I wanted too. Especially in scenes where they go energetic and crazy, or when the opponent is suffering from a crises because they are losing, the soundtrack really isn't attention grabbing. In fact, I'm paying more attention to the art without realizing that there is an OST playing in the background, because it's not fit for the occasion. Hopefully this will change in the future. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: The characters in Kakegurui bring insanity to a whole new level. Even if they are introduced as kind or calm at one moment, the next they'll be engulfed by this eerie aura. It's surprising to say the least. The only problem that I have with this, is that they are trying too hard. When the characters have their occasional insanity tick, it feels like it's way to forced, and what would seem to be eerie and creepy just ends up being cringe. I would hope they include some development in the main protagonist rather than just keep him as some useless moral compass for our other protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Despite all these negatives, I've been really enjoying this show. As said previously, I'm a big fan of hard reads and insane plays, which is why this anime has got me hooked. Not only that, but I feel as if it has a lot of potential, especially with the development of character and the upcoming battles (I haven't read the manga).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: Overall, this is a good anime to watch. I'm not too sure I would recommend this to anyone so far, but as the show progresses my opinions are prone to change, so right now a final conclusion would be meaningless.",

            "content": "Overall i'd say this serie is worth a 8.5. I explain why not a 9 or 10 with the cons at the end of my review.\r\nStory 8/10: A school anime, how original huh ? Well but this school is different, isn't about the typical single classroom with the male MC and the typical cliche classmates.\r\nIn this school everything is about gambling, gambling is life. The serie introduces you about what's going on since the episode 1 and keeps you asking for more after each episode. \r\nAlso, isn't regular gambling, the games aren't the usual ones everybody knows like blackjack or roulette, they aren't also themost complex games neither, the key is the gambling, betting ridiculous amounts of money and trying to win by cheating if possible.\\n\\n\r\nArt  9 & Sound 10 : The art is good, characters faces are something memorable. But the music is just outstanding, the opening is kinda unique and so is the music in it. The sound deserves a solid 10, it goes just too well with the anime theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10: In this anime u will see some of the most mental broken girls you won't find in like 9/10 of series out there, starting by the female MC. I rate this a 10 because i didn't find any classic cliches that most animes uses nowadays and because there is a very nice combination of characters personality and a very good use of faces expressions (watch to understand this)\\n\\n\r\nThe cons (which aren't really bad anyways):\\n\\n\r\n- The story doens't seem to be anything big or special, it's pretty clear who are the \"baddies\" and where the plot is trying to go.\\n\r\n- The gambling games could be more sophisticated or original.\\n\r\n- The school theme is way too overused so is the elitist student council, this anime would have worked perfectly in any other environment\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kakegurui is an outstanding anime that I loved the moment I saw it. There isn't much I want to go too deep into, but this is what I thought of it:\r\nThe story was pretty original in my point of view, as I haven't seen anything else related to gambling. I think what really topped Kakegurui off was it's capitalization of your skill at gambling being what determines your social status; it's truly, by definition\u2014awesome. I really do look forward to seeing what the conclusion to this anime is, and I hope that the male lead, Suzui, get's more screen time then he already does, andI also hope that he has more involvement with the plot, considering he is labeled as a \"main character.\" I'm not saying I dislike the fact that he's a main character, it's just that I've seen characters from other anime being the same length in season, having them being put as \"support\" even though they've received 10x the screen time. But, I guess it's just because how important his character is and all that. Blah blah.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is truly outstanding. I adore the detailed close-ups of the character's faces during scenes of suspense, as it unbelievable boosts the level of enjoyment that I receive while watching it. Not only the artwork is what I think is good\u2014the soundtrack is amusing as well. Both are something to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I give Kakegurui 10/10 despite the fact that it's still an ongoing anime.",

            "content": "So, I decided to drop it after episode 7. Not for any particular reason; it was actually a pretty enjoyable episode but I felt that it was a natural end to a mini arc (which I consider to be one for each member of the student council) so it felt like an okay place to stop.\r\nThe artwork is great - loved all the different facial expressions. Not just the crazy ones, but ones used for comedic purposes, or simply to highlight how beautiful some of the girls are. This, for me, was the highlight of the entire show - the music is pretty good butnothing outstanding and the characters I find to be just above average.\\n\\n\r\nLeading in from that last point: the array of characters, on the surface, are pretty cool and diverse in both personality and design but I never felt it go anywhere. This show is pretty shallow on character development, save for perhaps Jabami and Mary, but even with them it felt like painfully slow baby steps watching them develop...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my enjoyment was just slightly above middle of the road. I could have continued with the last 5 episodes left to air, but as I mentioned before, this felt like a comfortable places top stop. I can't see any kind of \"plot twist\" beyond this point that would shake up the show enough to keep my interest, and I feel like I can completely predict how the last 5 episodes are going to play out. I might be interested in picking this series back up in the future though, if I find out that the plot gets some kind of shake up down the road. If it's more of the same though I'll have to pass.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say give this show a try if you've already blown through all the great stuff because it's not TERRIBLE. But don't expect anything life changing either.",

            "content": "Welcome to Hyakkaou Private Academy, a gambling paradise where success is rewarded with wealth and prestige and those who fail are punished with massive debt and dehumanization. In this twisted establishment, taking big risks and cheating profusely are a commonality amongst the school's student body. While many may be turned off by these extreme conditions, protagonist Jabami Yumeko, a major gambling addict, finds herself right at home when she transfers to the academy. She doesn't have any elaborate plans or aspirations and only desires one thing; the ecstatic feeling she derives from gambling.\r\nWARNING: The plethora of psychotic lesbians in this anime may be too muchfor the weak of heart to handle. Proceed with caution.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist in the show is Ryouta Suzui. He's basically your average guy and falls under the \"I'm useless and have to rely on the heroine to do everything\" trope. His primary purpose is to serve as the juxtaposition to Yumeko's character so that her damaged psyche and general insanity is made more apparent. And not just her, but practically every other member of the cast as well, who all seem to add their own little bit of crazy to the show. Seriously, some of these characters make the infamous yandere Yuno Gasai look like a domesticated housewife in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui's plot is really quite simple. There's no intricate story at play and characters (with the exception of the twintailed  blonde Meari) don't receive much development. This anime instead focuses on a multitude of unique games played by the characters. Now these aren't fun family matches. They are games with high stakes played by demented yet intelligent characters, and it's just a thrill to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, these games are incredibly exaggerated in order to engross the show's audience. The producers are even able to make a basic game of rock-paper-scissors intense. Now while I'm sure this approach didn't work on everyone, it was enough to entertain me personally and keep me invested in the anime, so I'd say that Kakegurui's presentation was a success. The highlight of these gambling matches was when Yumeko managed to turn the tables on her foes with her amazing analytical skills and luck. It was so fun watching her completely own her opponents.\\n\\n\r\nI just love the distorted faces made by the characters in this anime. Whenever they're experiencing a high or a low during a match, the characters always seem to have amazingly detailed and demented expressions. Their visages often made watching them gamble even more enjoyable and managed to make them seem crazier than they already were. The rest of the animation was often high in quality as well, and it assimilated with the soundtrack quite nicely. \\n\\n\r\nI was really tempted to give Kakegurui a lower score. The story is quite simplistic (bordering the nonexistent range) and there really isn't an explanation on why the school is so fixated on gambling. Also, I found myself constantly wondering things like where the heck are the teachers? I guess they were massacred by the student council. I wouldn't put it past that group of psychos. The fact that only one character had any marginal development while the rest remained generally stagnant was also a negative factor against Kakegurui. But the show is just so damn entertaining. It's honestly one of the most enjoyable seasonal anime that I've seen in awhile. And while the characters aren't that developed, they make up for it with their eccentric personalities. Yumeko commanded my attention every time she appeared on screen, and the majority of her gambling matches were intense and fun to watch, even if they were over dramatized and often served no significant purpose.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui is clearly not for everyone. In fact, from a technical standpoint, the anime is actually quite poor. But unlike many other shows that I've seen, Kakegurui was able to make me not completely focus on its shortcomings thanks to its its explosive cast and atmosphere. If you're into the game and/or physiological genre, then I'd recommend giving Kakegurui a chance. And if you have a thing for crazy women, then you don't want to miss out on this anime. Trust me.",

            "content": "Kakegurui does nothing for me. It just doesn't work.\r\nI was really wondering how I would approach this review at first and I really struggled trying to figure out why this series felt so uninspired. I knew a lot of people would be praising it and maybe not without good reason, however the point of a review isn\u2019t to be correct, but to present a viewpoint. I realized I couldn\u2019t review this series without deviating from the standard format, but I think I finally figured out what\u2019s been bugging me about this series for so long and I must get it off my chest. Kakegurui forall its effort with glitter and glamour, ironically lacks one very important element that the series constantly pushes in your face\u2026.\\n\r\nHigh stakes.\\n\\n\r\nTo explain why the purpose of this series falls so flat in my book, I had to look back to a series I\u2019m sure many people are tired of hearing about, Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders. I won\u2019t spoil anything, but this will help me get my point across. There\u2019s this two-part episode that focuses on the heroic protagonist of that series, Jotaro Kujo facing off against the current villain of the week, D\u2019Arby the gambler. It\u2019s one of the best episodes of that series and a prime example of how to make two characters just gambling, \u201cfun\u201d. I want you to ask yourself, why are series like Jojo\u2019s, Berserk, Hunter X Hunter so beloved, what makes them \u201cfun\u201d? To my point Kakegurui, is a series lacking proper tension building leading to equally unsatisfying payoffs, that doesn\u2019t put in the effort that those series do to make them \u201cfun\u201d. In stardust crusaders, the heroes have clearly defined end goals, interest and motives to beat the ultimate bad guy at the end while facing other challengers each with their own skill sets, D\u2019Arby being one of them.  Scenarios in that series are clever, some of which seem impossible for the characters to get out of and sometimes\u2026..they actually are. However, it is that unpredictability that makes that series so gripping. There isn\u2019t always a perfect solution to every problem and there shouldn\u2019t be. Each encounter between heroes and villains, in such a short amount of time have copious amounts of valuable exposition and build-up presented through unique dialogues that give us the reason why that encounter is important as well as why the hero must overcome it. Because the series has proper build up those, \u201cHe\u2019s got him\u201d or \u201cOh shit, he\u2019s screwed\u201d moments are equally satisfying payoffs.\\n\\n\r\nPresenting characters with life or death scenarios can be interesting and help the audience see a different side of the cast. Conflict is also and important aspect, it\u2019s what makes an action series, well an action series. I want to feel like rooting for the hero. I want to feel scared that she may not make it out of a situation. I want to feel like punching the villains teeth in. I want to scream at my T.V in anticipation when all the pieces of the puzzle align, the climactic moment of the episode is about to happen and I have the characters plan all figured out and I say \u201cEND IT!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nYeah there\u2019s none of that in Kakgurui. The problem with Kakegurui is that it feels extremely misguided on what makes series like this fun in the first place. Jabami Yumeko, is a character that has nothing special about her, she has no goals, she feels no fear. Jabami is simply not the type of character that belongs as the lead role of a series like this, in fact she would probably work better as an antagonist. Her only defining trait is that gambling makes her horny\u2026\u2026which is a trait of like 5 other characters in the series.  If turn of that \u201cWILD AND CRAZY\u201d switch, what\u2019s left of Jabami would barely constitute as a background character in any other given series. What I\u2019m saying is when the majority of characters tend to ACT the same in regard to the same topics, just because it\u2019s the focus of the series, makes everyone feel extremely one note even though they might turn out to be an exceptional character if they were introduced in a completely different series. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the battles largely don\u2019t matter because the outcomes don\u2019t matter either, as again, Jabami really has no problem with any of the radical or absurd consequences that come from losing, so why should I care? In fact, calling any of this a game a wits sounds like a poor cover up as with every episode there tends to be an introduction of some new fetish from pet names to obsessions with toenails. It really feels like another one of those series made simply to normalize as well as capitalize off a certain fetish. Most of the matches are predictable in that Jabami will spot a cheat and then reveal the opposing sides plot, even if she loses it never comes back to bite her. Outside of the tone and writing of the series, there are also some things in regard to the structure of the series that don\u2019t really make a lot of sense the more you think about them like\\n\\n\r\n-How can there be a system based on rank and money if even the people at the top are literally too broke to pay debts in the in the instance they actually do lose?\\n\r\n- How the hell is a system like that even remotely balanced? If the student council is on top of everything shouldn\u2019t everyone NOT on the student council be slaves?  There is absolutely no benefit to the antagonists on running a system like this as they actually lose out on possible benefits by letting other students have the chance at the same exact benefits or even greater?!? It makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nand plenty of other problems like this.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the lackluster story and characters, mostly everything else ranges from ok to fine. The art style looks nice each character standing out just enough to make them recognizable. The animation itself isn\u2019t bad, but it isn\u2019t really what I call stellar, outside of the bombastic facial animations, during scenes of dialogue you\u2019ll notice a lot of standing, bland backgrounds and extras with little detail. The soundtrack is actually really good, especially the intro.  Much of the background music sounds like it came straight out of a video game and is overall pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kakegurui is one of those anime that months prior to actually watching you see the trailers to in passing and say \u201c Now THAT is going to be anime of the year!!! Such style, such a unique concept, it is going to be absolutely brilliant. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d and when it finally comes time to watch it, you come to find that without a shadow of a doubt the show IS\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOkay. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nAs someone who has never read the manga, I came to this anime adaption with an open mind. Firstly, the idea of an anime based on gambling intrigued me, and from the various trailers online it was being sold as an anime based around \"battles of the wit\", where attempting to 'read' your opponent, and skills such as risk taking, negotiating, and to a degree \"deception\" were crucial and thusly encouraged and honed in the students of Hyakkaou Private Academy. \r\nThe main premise is that the richest and most powerful families of Japan, send their children to this academy which is designedto create the NEXT \"future leaders\" of Japan. And what is the best way to create future leaders? Gambling. The whole school's curriculum centres on gambling, because the idea is that individuals who can thrive and rise to the top in such an environment will be fit to lead the country somehow (anyway).\\n\\n\r\n1) Character Development.\\n\\n\r\nSo the first person we see is a guy called Ryouta Suzui, initially we expect him to be the protagonist of the anime but he's literally only important for the first minute or two. His character is summarised as \"cowardly and poor\". Throughout the 5 episodes that have been released so far of this anime, he has had no role, no development, no important dialogue, nothing. He literally just follows the main character around, warning her when she's about to gamble against a difficult opponent, then praising her when she wins. At the most, the anime sometimes let's us hear his voiced out thoughts while the main character gambles as a way of building suspense - His character is a textbook example of the \"pathetic male character\" trope. Don't expect him to do anything else, except ask questions about how the M.C. does a certain thing so that the viewer at home understands. This for me was a red flag when it came to analysing the quality of the writing itself. It's just lazy, and unacceptable for an anime today.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have the Main Character, Yumeko Jabami, a random girl who transfers into the school and on the first day challenges the mean girl, Meari Saotome who was bullying the pathetic, generic Ryouta Suzui. After experiencing gambling for the first time Jabami finds herself addicted, hence the title Kakegurui which translates to compulsive gambler. She's shown to be this extremely intelligent character who manages to figure out how her opponents are \"cheating\" and through a bit of mental logic manages to work out what bets have the best probability. Her personality is jarring, going from nice and pleasant then to sudden \"orgasm\" faces where she stares her scared opponent in the eyes and declares her victory over them. In fact a lot of these characters have these really stupid facial expressions, I guess as a way to intimidate one another? It would make sense if the situation warranted it, like the characters were getting riled up or backed into a corner, but they're literally just making these retarded expressions every time they gamble against each other...And this is nothing like how people actual gamble. The anime doesn't even try to suspend your disbelief. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the same applies to all other characters. Every one of them has some random quirk, and plays into that \"box\". Some characters are completely unbelievable. One of them being this eye-patch wearing psycho girl who runs around the school with a revolver, playing Russian Roulette, because gambling with her life turns her on, so much so that she rubs one off in the school toilets...Right. Much dramatic. \\n\\n\r\n2) Story. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the anime does nothing to try and stay grounded in any form of reality. Don't interpret this as me saying that every aspect of an anime has to be realistic, no, that is far from the truth. I'm all for fictional liberty and pushing outside of the realm of reality, as long as the anime actually tries to make it believable. But it just fails at that. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is lacklustre, every episode is about challenging a difficult enemy opponent who has their own gambling game that they like to play, and surprise, most of them are cheating. This anime doesn't teach you any real world wisdom about gambling, and there is no intellectual battle of wits, no mind games, no nothing. The M.C. will deduce her best chances of winning, and will expose the opponent for cheating, and then stare at them with another orgasm face. The story appears to be headed towards fighting against the members of the student council, who are presumably some of the best. \\n\\n\r\nWhat else? If you end up in debt, you become a \"human pet\", where you basically get treated as subhuman and told to clean up coffee spills, or to be a leg stool. Which really makes no sense...there are no adults in this school, no staff, no actual classes...Just a bunch of students who sit around gambling and then when someone ends up losing, they just treat them like shit, and vandalise their desk? And that's it. These are the future of leaders of Japan? Rich parents are sending off their children to throw their money around and gamble at this prestigious academy...which has no structure, just a group of stuck up misfits as the \"student council\" all with their unique, deep plot, quirks, one even wears a mask...OooohoOOoOOoo - How will she make an orgasm face? Who knows - Suspense. Imagine, Bill Gates or Warren Buffet...Or any rich person. Who in the right mind would send their kids here, and give them all this money. That's something ain't it?\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you can't repay your debt? This student council of \"special\" individuals will arrange a \"life plan\" for you. When the protagonist finds herself in a large amount of debt, she gets this pamphlet instructing her on her future, it's basically human trafficking - she's supposed to marry some random preselected guy and bear his children and live out the life specified by this student council of \"special\" kids...How do they enforce this? Through \"powerful political connections\" of course. Oh yeah, remember, there are no adults in this school, it's just this student council made up of \"cool\" students, some with masks, some like to play video games. And they somehow have the ability to arrange for a student to be trafficked. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing rewarding about this anime, you don't get any new insight into the gambling world. It's just a lazy, trope-filled, piece of shit with no redeeming qualities, except hot girls with orgasm faces. I'm going to end it here. The art and music is average, that's the only thing they really succeeded in. Is this anime memorable in any way? No. Are you going to want to watch it? Depends on who you are I guess, because there's clearly a demand for this anime.",

            "content": "[On Going Review, I have seen all episodes thus far]\r\nDidn't know what to expect from Kakegurui, but boy am I hooked. \r\nThis is quite the anime with the story and the characterization at the forefront of what makes this so great to watch. \r\nKakegurui is taking something that seems as simple as gambling and diving into its darkest depths and intricacies. The anime picks apart what makes gambling so fun for some but so frightening for others and really gives a refreshing take on what it means to put everything on the line. The fact that his high stakes gambling is the driver for thesocial ladder that exists at the school is yet another plus to the whole story. It isn't something that is completely original but the execution is captivating. The sheer gravity this gambling system holds seems inhumane and brutal at times and it draws you deeper into the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters and how they are personified is the other strong point for the show. These are really complex characters, across the board. The MC Jabami is an extreme wildcard and it is tantalizing watching her develop as the show carries on. She is truly enthralled with the ecstasy that comes from gambling, so much so that some would say she is mad. She comes off as someone who would just watch the world burn for the sake of it. Jabami is the motor that propels the show forward and the fuel that sparks a change in the characters that surround and come into contact with her. She is truly OP and a monster but since the basis for this show is gambling the outcomes can never be 100% assured. It's a real thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat as you watch the matches\\n\\n\r\nJabami isn't the only complex one, the rest have their motivations and certain relationships with gambling and I think that this is the shows strongest point. For some they only care for the money that comes from gambling, others care for the joy of gambling itself, some care about the high that comes from the possibility of losing it all. These many characterizations of gambling are shown all over the characters. Sometimes it comes off as a little TOO fan service oriented, especially with the immense focus and prominence of female characters in the show. There's lots of sexualized behaviors stemming from the gambling as well, but it really sells how deep gambling can go. It's kinda of a step up from what you may be familiar with in Shokugeki no Souma.\\n\\n\r\nThe run of the show focuses on Jabami, her introduction to the school, the development as she is shown to be quite the wildcard and her many battles with the ruling body at the school, the Student Council. It feels very much like the run of the mill boss battle in a way as she topples each rung on the pyramid for a chance to go 1v1 with the president of the student council. The student council is quite diverse and Jabami herself is Pandora's Box personified, we are still learning and have so much more to learn about her. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, it looks quite nice all around. The highest praise has to be given to the facial expressions these characters are given as they gamble, it's true artistry. My one reservation is the use of CG to animate some of the more fluid moments that require a higher level of dynamic movement. These moments are few and far between thus far, but they do stick out like a sore thumb. \\n\\n\r\nSo far the pacing has been great. The characters are unraveling and revealing in a well timed and interesting way. I am very much looking forward to seeing how the battle between Jabami and the student council unfolds.",

            "content": "Kakegurui sends us to an elite school where betting decides not only the future of the student, but also the future of his assets and career. For me it is something unheard of in this area. Although I've seen RPG series of games to fantastic fantasy worlds where life is based on games, Kakegurui [at least for me] has brought something unprecedented in proportion to the bets in a realistic way! I intend to be a bit truthful in my criticism, without overdoing it like some people who have entered the show and have often made revisions ahead of time, before they even have eventried a few episodes. The psychological part of Kakegurui for me worked a little more towards the middle, however, it fell a little from the middle to the end. Even then, there were parts that even if they did not work, sometimes they could get some tension in others. You can count on the fingers the episodes that were psychologically strong and others that were somewhat weak.\\n\\n\r\nIn this respect, we can get the director's attention. And while I keep in mind the number of episodes that I may consider psychologically \"weak,\" I will not do it here, as I believe people should check for themselves, and also spoiler. I also want to point out that there has been a lack of better [and deeper] development of some characters, which I believe is a deficiency of the adaptation itself and the number of volumes that have been adapted, not having to do with direction. And even though there is not a deep development of the main characters, [something I reiterate: it has to do with the volumes that were adapted, it is not the director's fault, but the arches being adapted] was at least interesting to see how some characters evolving , albeit infrequently, in order to become auxiliaries in the saga of the main protagonist. Kakegurui was an interesting journey through the betting world in a dress never seen before [by me at least], and I recommend it to anyone who likes the theme. Although this first adaptation did not bring a darker aspect of the elite bets --- as the play proposes --- I believe that for whoever finishes it the manga will be able to reserve great surprises.",

            "content": "Plot:\r\nObsession, repression, insanity, and thrill-seeking, these are all topics primarily emphasized in Kakegurui. What was interesting in the show was that gambling, for me, was really just a tool to deliver a message; because if we are to judge Kakegurui simply as a gambling show it would be plain awful. The setting is rather generic as the show occurs in a school, although to be fair it is a rather \u201cspecial\u201d school that is built on gambling. The hierarchy is constructed based on who has the most money, which the general rule of thumb anywhere, and who is the most competent gambler, meaning who isthe most adept in psychological warfare. Consequently, fortunes can be overturned since practically all students are engaged in gambling their assets away with hopes of securing their immediate and long-term futures; giving those who are financially disadvantaged a chance at a better life, or so it would seem. The first few episodes were very intriguing as we are introduced to how the organizational construct within the school functions. The school employs a system similar to the one demonstrated in Assassination Classroom, where a specific class (a social class in the case of Kakegurui) is designed for those at the bottom of the pile; who are naturally repressed, ridiculed, and discriminated against by their peers. Individuals who accumulate large amounts of debt sink into the lowest tier possible within the hierarchy, a social class known as \u201chouse pets\u201d whose job is to basically be used to increase the morale of other students. The system would incentivize students to continuously enhance their gambling skills by showing them what would happen if they are to fail, a message conveyed by the misery that house pets usually suffer. On the other end of the spectrum, you would have the student council who sit on top of the food chain and basically dictate everything that goes on in the school and are the ones responsible for implementing and maintaining the contemporary structure. \\n\\n\r\nAll was working just fine until our main character, Jabami Yumeko, arrives and turns the system on its head, as is expected. Now, this all sounds nice and interesting, but things start to turn south as the show progresses and the world building rather comes to a halt. Many things in the show seem illogical or perhaps unexplored, we were never shown what the role of instructors or even adults was in general, which is very odd since they are within a school. The show depicted the school as being an independent organization functioning with minimal interference from the principal or teachers, as the only ones who actually wielded any form of power and were in charge of basically everything were the student council. This becomes more apparent as the show progresses since members of the council seemed to have the ability to do anything including having interrogation rooms or even weaponry. We do not really know how the council came to hold so much power or who granted a student council so much authority. The show justifies the extensive jurisdiction of student council members by stating that they hail from prestigious families whom are highly influential and are the root cause for students have such vast authority. Furthermore, even if we are to overlook such elements the show grows to become rather repetitive and formulaic, unfortunately, as Jabami Yumeko battles a new villain each week in order to reach the top; defeating each opponent in rather similar and predictable means. \\n\\n\r\nAnimations:\\n\r\nThe animations in the series were just fine meaning that they were not bad nor special, but rather represent the standard you would expect of a modern day anime. Although, I must say that two things stood out while watching; the facial expressions of students and the fanservice. I must admit, I was not a fan of either. The facial expressions that were displayed by many of the characters were rather disturbing, especially at the beginning of the show, though luckily they tuned things down towards the end. Meanwhile, the fanservice was rather distasteful to say the least; as characters would normally become increasing aroused as the stakes would go higher. Though their heightened \u201csensations\u201d were depicted in a rather disconcerting manner as characters would exhibit suicidal tendencies rather than pleasurable emotions, which was a turn-off for me. Though on a positive note their uniforms looked really good.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe ending for the series was the one musical piece that stood out for me, I really enjoyed its rather \u201chip\u201d style. I did not enjoy the opening so much, though I was interested in the images it was showcasing which displayed and foreshadowed some of the events in the anime. I do not recall paying much regard to the music that was playing during the show, as no single track attracted my attention through the anime; which rather means that it was neither bad nor good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI think this is the dimension that the series suffered the most. I honestly did not care for any of the characters, including Yumeko, Suzui, and Saotome, even though they are considered to be the main cast. In fact, asides from Yumeko whose name was brought up 100 times each episode, I had trouble memorizing the names of any of the characters. I felt disconnected from all of them, especially that the show did not explore their backgrounds, motives, and experiences;  despite the presence of adequate material to go on. A fine example of this would be not displaying the relationship of Yumeko and her sister, who is supposedly bedridden in a hospital. The show simply does not explore issues that are considered essential for the progress of a solid plotline. Another seemingly important issue that was not explored in-depth was what were the true motives for students who are apparently poor to join such a prestigious school, aside from money? Plus what prevents them from leaving immediately once they become house pets? Issues that could have easily been explored if the spotlight was given to Suzui for an episode or two. Moreover, I truly wished that the show had focused on the morality of having such an oppressive system, showing the life that house pets have to endure; something that, again, could have been focused upon if Saotome was given some screen time off the gambling table. \\n\r\nThough on a more positive note I did enjoy the political game that was played between students, where alliances would constantly shift depending on who is in power and what certain situations require.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nNonetheless, despite all the downsides of the show I still found it entertaining at the very the least. I came back to watch it every week even though I knew what the outcome was going to be, and that is where the show\u2019s value lies, entertainment. It never really attempts to do anything more than being an episodic anime that gives its viewers an injection of adrenaline week in week out. Although, question marks will be raised as to whether the show will be given a chance to rectify its errors in a second season since the series received an anime exclusive ending. Either way, I can recommend the show for those who want a spike of adrenaline from a series that relies on the psychological aspects of stress in general, and gambling in particular, to thrill its audience.  Though be prepared for an anime that goes directly into its main themes, without giving much thought to any other sideline or underlying concepts.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading\\n",

            "content": "You know, a bad show, to me, is not simply a matter of the quantity or size of the flaws you can find in it, however it is that you decide to measure such an arbitrary idea, but what kind of flaws it has. I can deal with some plot holes, for once (I mean, even the almighty FMA has 2 big ones at the end) as long as the work can properly contextualize them and not make me care. Members of the cast being inconsistent, though, make it tougher to stomach. I\u2019m also not someone who asks for absolute realism, but simply verisimilitude andconsistency. Disregard all of those and the work starts to go sour for me. The worst offenses, though, are when the work becomes morally bankrupt, when it asks me to sympathize and side with people who are clearly contemptible. Kakegurui is one of those shows.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nWell come to Hyakkao Academy, the land of insane teenage gambling, horrendous abuses of power and blatantly criminal acts of bodily harm. The school is supposed to be a place for the children of the filthy rich, but most definitely the filthy, where the future elite of Japan is meant to be prepared for a future where they\u2019d lead the business of their families. In this institution, gambling is not simply a pass-time students can engage for their own enjoyment, but a core part of the social-structure of the school. Since the current student council president took over, she instituted a system where students who stack too much debt become \u201ccattle\u201d, considered second class among their classmates and have to remain subservient to the students with more money. Obviously, they also become primary target for bullying. For the viewer who shares that pesky desire to have the elements in the story making sense, this plot point will immediately raise a number of eyebrows, so let\u2019s go bit by bit.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, how is this system even allowed existing? None of the students here are of legal age, so they should never be allowed to gamble outrageous amounts of money from their parents net worth. Is this a version or Japan where legal restrictions for underage gambling don\u2019t exist? If that\u2019s the case, what about the restrictions for underage driving, drinking and sex? None of these are even mentioned, so I suppose the gambling premise is entirely based on \u201cdon\u2019t think about it, bro\u201d. Now, you might at this point throw at me my previous statement about realism vs. verisimilitude, but let make it clear: that goes for simple stuff, like my tsunderes being a bit more violent than what the real world would tolerate or children being a bit more mature than normal, it doesn\u2019t apply for a universe where an entire legal system seems to operate backwards.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the fact that the existence of this scenario is a contradiction in itself, why would anyone enroll their children in a school like this one? These students are supposed to be future business leaders, people with enormous responsibilities in their hands, so a cast system that allows them to be bullied, humiliated and sometimes even physically harmed by their classmates goes completely opposite to the goal their education is supposed to provide, that of shaping them into capable, resolute and strong-willed adults. I\u2019m not sure any parent would allow their children to frequent a place like this if such practices are not only allowed, but incentivized. Then there\u2019s the money issue: the students make their bets with money from their families, which means that they are stocking up on massive debts their parents will have to pay. At long-term, this set up would make the cost of such education extremely expensive, making this school a lot more trouble than is worth. The list of absurdities doesn\u2019t stop there, but let\u2019s get to know the cast before we can dive head first into more nonsense!\\n\r\nJabami Yumeko is the main culprit of the story. She generally keeps a playful and polite demeanor, but shifts to intense obsession when it\u2019s time to gamble. I\u2019m pretty sure she is supposed to be a sociopath! Not a realistic depiction of a sociopath, though, but what fiction believes a sociopath to be like. Truth be told, Yumeko is no more than a Mary Sue. It may seem like a stretch to claim this, since general misconception is that this kind of character is also supposed to be virtuous (or at least framed as such by the narrative, even when the audience can clearly see that the opposite is truth), but she does have the basic traits of a Mary Sue:  she clearly has complete disregard for how much money she bets, the supply of money or her disposal is not even hinted at in the anime, so in how much danger she\u2019s is unclear, at no point displays any signs of being the least bit worried, constantly displaying the face of someone who\u2019s always on top, even though her behavior is so needlessly risky. Ironically, at one point she even drops this gem: \u201cTo realize one\u2019s ambitions, risks must be taken\u201d. Funny, since she seems to have no ambition besides having a gambling playground for herself.\\n\\n\r\nBesides being nice to the already shitty-characters from the main cast and keeping a constant sweety-kitty-diabetes fa\u00e7ade when not gambling, is there any reason for Yumeko to be seem as an actual force for good in this narrative? When it comes to motivations and general personality, she\u2019s no less psychotic, abusive, deceiving, manipulative and sadistic than the members of the student council (or any other scumbag in this school), so what are the guaranties that once her main source of entertainment in the school is gone, or at least significantly diminished, she\u2019ll bring any positive change to the status quo? And even if she does, do any of these characters actually deserve it? They\u2019re all simplistic, poorly realized figures and most often just despicable people, despite the laughable attempts from the show on making them sympathetic by introducing last minute backstory.\\n\\n\r\nSuzui Ryouta, the closest friend to Yumeko, is an inconsistent pussy. He strangely seems to have no problem talking to multiple attractive girls at school, but from the first moment Yumeko enters the scene, becomes strangely flustered when first interacting with her. Besides that, his role is essentially to tell the audience how risky her situation is when she makes a crazy bet and to be mesmerized when she pulls off a victory out of some strategy the audience has no knowledge off.\\n\\n\r\nMomobami Kirari is the student council president, or Seitokaichou in Japanese, responsible for the creation of the cast system in place in Hyakkao Academy. She sees her fellow schoolmates as pets she can control and play with, as well as manipulate to gain power, although the goals she wants to achieve with such power are not explained in the story. Through an outrageous ass-pull in episode 11 (not a Deus ex Machina, stop using this term wrong) she proves to also be willing to backstab her own fellow student council members, which leads me to question how would anyone ever trust and help this bitch again, when she can betray them on a whim.\\n\\n\r\nOther members of the student council that matter are:\\n\\n\r\n-          Ikishima Midari, who\u2019s completely insane for life-threatening thrills and CARRIES A GUN TO THE SCHOOL! Seriously, how is this ever allowed? Why would anyone accept be put into a school that looks more like an asylum for demented shitbags?\\n\r\n-          Yomozuki Runa, the loli dressed in a bunny hoodie who helps Seitokaichou on her schemes, gleefully plotting against the other members;\\n\r\n-          Kaede Manyuda, the treasurer of the student council, very ambitious and arrogant, quick to dismiss the students he doesn\u2019t consider worthy enough of battling him. By all accounts, he\u2019s the least awful creature in the cast;\\n\r\n-          Sumeragi Itsuki, another crazy bitch, who likes to collect nails from other students, which she rips off whenever they lose to her in gamble;\\n\\n\r\nSo, besides allowing its students to be bullied and made into servants, potentially putting them in emotional distress that can severely affect their learning, this schools also allows bodily harm to be inflicted on them, as well as bets that involve possible death. Not crazy enough for you? The institution is also equipped with special sealed rooms, for when Ikishima feels the need to \u201carrest other students\u201d for her games. Let me spell this out again: this crazy cunt KIDNAPS people and locks them into special cells where she can bet on deadly games with them, using a FIREARM! Do you see why this setting is so hard to buy into?\\n\\n\r\nAs soon as Yumeko arrives at the institution, her one and only goal is to gamble with every strong opponent she can find, climbing the ladder until she can get the opportunity to challenge Seitokaichou, so the bulk of the narrative is focused on the multiple games she engages in with other members, occasionally crushing their spirit by revealing the manner they cheat, before beating them. Not always successful, though, as early on she manages to lose a serious bet, although it\u2019s implied that was only possible through cheating, and becomes a pet. Interestingly enough, as soon as a previously successful character suddenly becomes a pet, it seems their winning record is instantly forgotten by the scumbag token extras, who immediately shift to bully mode. If you\u2019re like me and has near zero suspension of disbelief for stories where everyone is an asshole, you\u2019ll have a hard time with this one.\\n\\n\r\nAs Yumeko uses her status as a pet to attract and challenge other student council members, she finally reaches the top members, challenging first Manyuda and ultimately the president. This is the point where the anime turns simply from rage-inducing bad to morally bankrupt filth! Through a seriously logically questionable trick played with the help of Sumeragi, who has an old grudge with Manyuda, they lead him into betting such a high amount of money, that the loss of that game would put him indefinitely subservient to the student council president and destroy his influence in the council, as well as potentially compromising his future and relationship with his father. Yes, it\u2019s that serious! So, of course, he loses and the defeat is followed by Yumeko and Sumeragi gleefully explaining how they manage to reach their ridiculously contrived victory, with the final blow being delivered by the president, by telling him \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d, making him snap and pass out. In the follow up, Yumeko and Sumeragi discuss what just happens and the way their dialogue is frame tries to imply they had the moral high-ground, somehow. That last bit, to me, is the most infuriating part.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, what exactly was Manyuda\u2019s crime that was apparently so much more despicable in relation to the other students? Seitokaichou introduced a cast system that locks students into the role of cattle, where they remain subservient and bullied by other students, Sumeragi, who now we\u2019re supposed to root for, used to rip people\u2019s nails off, which basically amounts to torture, and Midari makes bets with people\u2019s lives; Am I really supposed to believe that this guy is so much more deserving of having his livelihood and future sadistically crushed because he underestimates his fellow students? When did arrogance become the worst of crimes? I call this idea bullshit and this anime a hypocritical piece of toxic waste.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the ending is a complete cop-out too.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nSo, do you like variety of facial expression for your characters to help flesh them out as credible, or at least likeable human beings? Tough luck, baby, here it\u2019s ahegao up the ass for you!\\n\\n\r\nFor those not aware of what I mean, \u201cahegao\u201d is the term in Japanese for the orgasm face, which despite the definition is not relegated exclusively for porn, but also used in comedic fashion to convey when the character goes through emotional ecstasy. You might have noticed by now that Kakegurui is quite the fan of quantity over quality, and it\u2019ll sure run that trope into the ground whenever it\u2019s needed to convey that the fuck-sticks it passes for humans in the story are going through anything that might be classified as excitement. IT\u2019L ALL THE BLOODY TIME! Whenever someone pull off some maneuver to outsmart or cheat their opponent in a gamble or even when it\u2019s simply to explain the \u201cgenius\u201d plan, they will pull off insane orgasm faces and laugh like maniacs. Of course, the biggest offender here has to be Yumeko, because someone up in Valhalla hates me.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it\u2019s not ahegao, it\u2019s contorted maniacal expressions every antagonist feels the need to break into when they feel superior and about to win on a game, or when they try to be threatening. It\u2019s quite laughable, actually, when bunny-loli tries to pull one of these off, as if the show seriously thinks she is in any way the slightest bit scary. Seriously, any of the girls in the main cast can break her in half and this attempt from the show is just pathetic! Characters seem to break into such expressions almost to the same degree as the ahegao, as if to painfully remind you to not ever expect anyone here to have personality any deeper than a spit puddle, and that subtlety died and we buried its corpse when we allowed this disgrace to be written, published and animated. Along with the stupid story, the presentation here is another big problem for the anime, due exactly to the habits just mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nIs the voice acting of any help? Not really, although not as egregious as the horrendous faces, no character really demands anything more than two different modes of acting, so it\u2019s nothing to write home either.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to thank my dear kitten Nana, who in the last 3 months patiently endured my screams of agony and, even when hungry, waited for me to regain consciousness after bashing my head against the wall. It genuinely felt like this anime was specifically crafted with the perfect combination of traits that can make my blood boil. From the sickening emphasis on the disgusting faces, to Yumeko\u2019s insufferable \u201ckind and innocent girl\u201d demeanor, along with the inconsistent, impossible to buy into setting and the fact everyone here is a douchebag, this whole show was intensively infuriating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI swear, I\u2019m not really that hard of a person to please, and it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t enjoy a story where characters are also morally bankrupt or just outright evil. I mean, two of my favorites are Shiki and Black Lagoon, and I don\u2019t think you can say the main characters in those shows are safely good people, what I ask is simply that the show frames that exactly as it is, not as if the horrible people on screen are supposed to be likeable or admired in any way. I am fascinated and genuinely find likability in well written morally ambiguous or evil characters, and I admire characters who display the responsibility and strength of morals I wish I had in my personality, but when the moral center of your story is a selfish, manipulative sociopath who can\u2019t be trusted to have anyone\u2019s well-being in mind, I say you got your priorities kind of backwards!\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you excuse me, I\u2019ll look for something trashy to wash away this memory.",

            "content": "I have been watching anime for a long time. Hell I\u2019ve just been on this planet for a long time. \r\nThroughout that time I do not remember a situation where I was so fixated on one certain aspect that completely capitulated everything else. \r\nThat is where I am with the faces in Kakugurui. \r\nThese issues with obnoxious faces is nothing new for me and can be seen in my Daily Lives of High School Boys review as well as my opinions on Drifters.\r\nBut Kakegurui has achieved a level of obnoxious faces into a territory that has not been explored that I shall deem as egregiousfaces. \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s art style is presented in a way that resembles sadistic hentai with these faces.\\n\r\nI for one am not a masochist nor a sadist that will get enjoyment from an entertainment medium that way. \\n\r\nI also am not a hentai fan so when add the sweat and the lips/drool helps take it to that egregious level. \\n\\n\r\nThis shows theme is based on a school where gambling gets you to the top of the totem pole. \\n\r\nI for one am someone who likes the game of poker. I watch the World Series of Poker every year. I even had a favorite poker player in Phil Hellmuth. \\n\r\nSo I was optimistic that at least like the action in Drifters I can find satisfaction in the gambling of the show. \\n\r\nUnfortunately the gambling we got was a mix of redundant themes and girls over-powering on masochism.\\n\r\nBut even if the gambling was more satisfactory it is hard to enjoy any battle of strategy when your bombarded by egregious faces left and right. \\n\\n\r\nNow by this point I already had all these negative feelings towards Yumeko. This is more than just \"compulsive gambling\". \\n\r\nSo enter stage left a Yumeko on steroids named Midari Ikishima. \\n\r\nDuring her dedicated episodes is where I just lost all hope for this show because when you put the theme of death into the show that changes everything. \\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t about riding the economic train to the top of a gambling school. \\n\r\nYour bringing in the theme that you can actually die in this school. That put that stake in the heart for the setting. \\n\\n\r\nMidari is apart of the student council that are the main villains of the show. \\n\r\nThey are a conglomerate of individuals that have come together to hold a monopoly on the school. \\n\r\nThe basis of the show is for Yumeko to take them down one by one. \\n\r\nThe entirety of the show continues to try and make the student council even more sadistic than Yumeko herself. \\n\r\nThey try to establish a higher-level sadism that is not accepted to make you not like these characters. \\n\r\nBut if you already have Yumeko pass that level the effect is just completely negated. \\n\\n\r\nWhen considering my rating for the show I need to remember that the bottom score is not a 0 but a 1. \\n\r\nSo to not give this show a 1 out of 10 are there enough aspects to push something up to a 2 and so forth. \\n\r\nBasically every character was doing these gambling orgasms. It is the same issue the entire show. \\n\r\nEven when they gave me an architype that I tend to enjoy in a villain in glasses. \\n\r\nThe enthusiasm dwindled away quite quickly thanks to once again from Yumeko\u2019s gambling orgasms. \\n\r\nSo I can confidently say that the Characters, Enjoyment, and Art are all a 1 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already covered how the setting is disseminated. But we do have progression. There is an end game to the show. \\n\r\nThey do not waste much time with frivolous OVA content. That is something I can put up as a 2 out of 10. \\n\r\nNow bringing it up to a 3 out of 10 is another story. There was a lot of empty transition from going to the next student council member.\\n\r\nThere also was never a proper hierarchy build out so I can understand the level of difficulty increasing. \\n\r\nThey don\u2019t really have much time to build up to it though. Their goal seemed to be to have the main event match-up in this entry. \\n\r\nI can settle on a borderline 3 out of 10 with the story. \\n\\n\r\nSo what it comes down to is music. I tend not to deviate my music score much from the rest of the show. \\n\r\nI tend not to value it that highly. The ending song is okay but I do have major issues with the performance from Tia in the OP. \\n\r\nThere was a real turn-off for me listening to this nasally running on voice she used in the song. \\n\r\nI\u2019ve skipped the OP every time since episode 2. So with that I\u2019d have to give another 1 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t given a show a 1 out of 10 since 2015 and if I was going to pull the trigger to change that. Right now feels like the right time.\\n\r\nI\u2019ve never experienced something so off-putting in anime like Kakegurui and it is going to be a benchmark for me when it comes to off-putting themes.\\n\r\nIf anything is as off-putting as the egregious faces and gambling orgasms then it will be a contender for a 1 out of 10 on my rating scale. \\n\r\nSome people are complaining about having an original ending but for me this was far gone before that. This is an abomination of the highest order!",

            "content": "I've never reviewed something that has yet to finish. Although I'm seeing a lot of premature high scores given by other users. I feel those reviews are based off enjoyment as there is no substance in Kakegurui. I'm going to explain why this anime is not worth any of your time.\r\nThis is an in depth spoiler free (as much as I can be spoiler free) analysis of Kakegurui episodes 1-7. \r\nI wanna start off in a weird place \r\nSound/Voice Acting: 4/10 \r\nAll of the voice actors feel amateurish and don't have that much flair. Characters like Yameko and Ryouta are passable but there are tworeally bad voices for characters I want to address. I can tell Ms. Udono is trying but her voice for her character is just very unfitting and irritating. Now Udono doesn't have a lot of experience under her belt so I can't judge her too harshly but when making a big budget adaptation you should TRY not to get inexperienced voice actresses. Personally I blame the direction and irresponsibility of the studio over the low experienced actress.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one other voice that is just so fake and atrocious is borderline unbelievable. Like I was legitimately disappointed when I saw the voice actress for Midari Ikishima. It was none other than Mariya Ise herself. The VA for Stocking Anarchy and Killua in 2011's HxH. She is incapable of voicing this character. Her crazy voice is just as fake and poor as her crazy laugh. I find her performance in this work to be incredibly bad. Her tone and acting is so forced. Every scene hearing her is tedious. Now she's not working with a good script and the direction probably sucks but she's so much better than this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is good I guess. It's not perfect for every situation or memorable. The Op is good but it wouldn't find itself on any Top 100 openings. The low score on the sound is prominently due to the lack of solid actors. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10 \\n\\n\r\nThey are in a school that allows gambling and that can decide your life for you if you get in too much debt. It's insane and there's been no good explanation. Midari is capable of carrying a weapon on campus and bullies try to rape other students in this high class school. The Student Body also are capable of inflicting bodily harm against the students without any repercussions. ( SPOILER example: Midari, who was threatened to have her eye taken out and took it out herself to prevent the shame and to get it over with. ) This show isn't like Prison School though. It wants us to take it seriously and adds no comic relief to the atmosphere. The author probably just didn't get the memo, that Prison School was a psychological comedy that didn't try to make you take its bizarre concept seriously but the dilemmas and punishments in Prison School gave a real sense of stakes and urgency. Prison School also had great characters, a lot of psychological elements, and was hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nWhy it fails as a gambling anime:\\n\\n\r\n It stretches suspension of disbelief and doesn't give us insight on the reasoning behind the characters deductions. Yameko just tends to magically call out the cheating of her opponent with a contrived explanation that we never even get to see. Seeing Yameko's dissection of the cheat would actually add more depth to her character. Give you a sense of humanity and urgency in her. The thrills are also non existent. Every situation and stake is extremely low and since Yameko is the love child of a Gambling Mary Sue and Yuno Gasai (What an amazing combination) she will never lose that great of something. The most she'll lose is money but she throws that around so who cares? Even when she has a gun in her face we still know shes gonna be okay. She's perfect in every single way. Right? She never has really any human reaction. So we can't relate to her and put ourselves in her situation. Remember this. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is VERY formulaic. Like same thing every time with almost no difference. This makes the thrills and stakes nonexistent. The show is extremely unentertaining unless you have underdeveloped taste or have turned your brain off. After thorough dissection there is nothing necessarily redeemable or well executed about this story. Which is extremely unfortunate because I like gambling and cute girls. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10 \\n\\n\r\nDear god. No character in this anime is anything more than one dimensional. Yameko is a perfect gambler who wins without even having to work for it. We don't feel any humanity in her. And because of this we cannot relate to her whatsoever. As she is completely emotionless until she starts shit talking. She has no depth or layers as a character. She is so perfect. She finds out the villains way of cheating without us even hearing or seeing it. And the anime isn't smart enough to where we are given the opportunity to figure it out ourselves. The opponent who is cheating gives a nonsensical, not-foreshadowed scheme in their head like any bland shounen villain. It's so convoluted. Yameko's only character traits are she's crazy but acts like she's not and she's a sore winner when she magically finds out how the opponent is cheating.\\n\\n\r\n A character I believed I would like's name was Meiri. As she is a cocky ass who contorts her face to bizarre, funny expressions in the first episode and acts like a boring shounen mustache twiddler until she is humbled by Yameko in that episode. I expected that by destroying Meiri in the first episode they were gonna build her character up through the entire season. Honestly, that's how you can make a cocky character like Meiri likable. Give them a taste of their own medicine. There is even a scene where Meiri is forced to clean up a mess, after being laughed at and left in the lunch room alone. I felt genuine sympathy because I felt like that would be a pivotal moment for her character. Then we see her accumulate EVEN MORE DEBT by the culture club representative and see that her pride is shattered and she is completely humiliated. But I clearly gave this show way too much credit. Now I thought this would lead to an arc where Meiri realizes she relies too much on cheating to gamble and gets too cocky before the cards are shown. And she'd blossom into this great, smart, analytic gambler. NOPE, SHES YAMEKO 2 BY EPISODE FUCKIN 4. She stays bland, stagnant and becomes another boring character.\\n\\n\r\nThe final lead is Ryouta Suzui. He just... reacts and sometimes helps Yameko. Literally could be written out so easily. He's one dimensional too. He feels like a side character. I actually forget he's there sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone is one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nAll the antagonists and side characters are JUST crazy. Some are a lil crazier than the others. Like some will cum while playing. And I guess you're supposed to get intimated or aroused when the crazy girl cums when she's winning or thrilled. That's it. The insanity is so over saturated in the anime it stops being unique, entertaining, or unexpected. \\n\\n\r\nWhich makes how everything plays out very boring and predictable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very reminiscent of Prison School but it doesn't go to the extent of Prison School or do it frequently enough. All the crude facial contortions happen on almost every character in the same situation with the same face so it's not well executed or unpredictable or entertaining or funny or intimidating, etc. The budget is very clear though and I can't say its not at least a 7/10 through aesthetic alone. As you kinda get the tone through the art even though the tone is super ridiculous in the story and scenario.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow I don't mind anyone enjoying this but lets be real; this anime is horrible. Everyone is just enticed by the attractive character designs. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I tend to repeat myself but often the most serious criticism of a show is usually the kind you hear and throw around the most. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a predictable, overly formulaic, shallow, boring, low thrills, poorly written, poorly executed, complete mess of an thriller anime with terrible characters who don't develop or evolve. \\n\\n\r\nRight now this is without a doubt one of the worst anime of 2017. Up there with Berserk and World End. I really did wish I could like this show but almost everything it tries and does fails miserably. \\n\\n",

            "content": "*No Spoiler Concise Review*\r\nTL;DR: If Kaiji and Shokugeki no Soma had a forbidden love child, you get Kakegurui: a show that throws all realism out of the window and the female MC orgasms every time she whispers \"Kakegurui\" or \"Let's Gamble.\"\r\n[Story: 3/10 , Characters: 5/10, Art: 8/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 5/10]\r\nWhat is Kakegurui? It's a psychological mystery anime where the MC, Jabami Yumeko, a transfer student, starts attending Hyakkaou Private Academy, a normal school by day & a gambling heaven/hell by night, whose sole purpose is to teach their rich spoiled brats in the art of dealing with money & manipulating people. This show throwsall realism out of the window and declares that the best gamblers are those who are addicted to gambling, not those who stay calm. This show is both sexy and risky. It's always fun to watch a na\u00efve sexy self destructive intelligent gambler destroy and toy with the school government because she finds it fun and stimulating. Viewers will soon realize that the outcome will always be the same, yet it's the 'how' that makes this show great. If you are into gambling and you love psychopaths yet cute characters then this anime is for you! \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is very straightforward. It's your run-of-the-mill high-school anime where the MC wants to throw a wrench at the flawed school council system. This time the entire school council are epic/loaded Boss Gamblers. How do you get to the top? Through boss battles of course. Here's a fun fact, they are all cheaters, except the MC of course. She just wants to get her fix of orgasms through the thrill of gambling. The show revolves around Yumeko and Suzui, both archetypal foils of one another, trying to unearth the \"system\" and win the boss battles to reach the top, aka face the Student Council President. Although the start of the show was amazing, mid-way the story takes a huge nose dive of boredom and it barely comes back up with the anime having an original ending instead of staying true to the manga. Guess, MAPPA isn't fully sold on the success yet for second season despite going all out by bringing together director Hayashi Yuichiro (Garo: Divine Flame) alongside writer Kobayashi Yuichiro (Attack on Titan) and Akita Manabu (Fullmetal Alchemist\u00a0) as character designer. \\n\\n\r\nThough the story is very predictable, aside from figuring out how each gambler is cheating, it's the characters that really fuels the fun in the show. The MC, Yumeko, is a naive beautiful kawaii girl on the outside but inside she's an intelligent yuri obsessed psychopath who needs to gamble to quench her compulsive gambling addiction. Juxtapose her with Suzui, her partner in crime, who is just there to make viewers feel smart because all the other characters in the show are psychopathic gambling geniuses. The members of the student council, despite being one-dimensional, are all unique from one another as seen through their gambling personality and the type of games they like to play. The epic Boss, President and Yumeko, if looked at closely, are just same psychotic characters on the inside except their outer characteristics are inverted from each other. Moreover, what really accentuates the characters in this show are the voice actors. The voice actor for Yumeko, played by Saori Hayami, just steals the show. Who knew the calm lady like seiyuu from AnoHana could portray the role of a horny psychopathic addict. \\n\\n\r\nAside from its predictable story and one-dimensional characters, the show does a phenomenal job in the art, animation & sound department. Nothing short to be expected from studio MAPPA. The OP, Deal with the Devil, is actually a refreshing change from usual Jpop to classy jazz for that smooth chill vibe. The background score really heightens every tense mood in the anime and just overhypes every little reveals. The ED song is alright but not as good as the OP song. The character designs were toned down to reflect better on screen compared to the actual manga. However, the crazy psychopathic facial expression of each characters and the shrills that captures every thrills really hammers down the central slogan of \"Let's Gamble.\" Hands down, the show has great camera working, much like Edgar Wright with its cut scenes that adds a lot to the plot. Moreover, the blended CGI animation with bold vibrant colours really brings out the inner psychopath that exists not only in the characters in this show but in our hearts. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kakegurui is just one of those crazy psychotic animes you want to watch because you love going on a thrill ride fully knowing the end destination. Though the anime will have an original ending the show is a faithful adaptation of the manga. If you love gambling and you love cute characters having earth-shattering pseudo orgasms while getting their gambling fix, give this show a watch. It's different yet same as other game related shows like Kaiji and NGNL. Anyways, give it a watch and tell me later how fast you caught on how the Boss Gamblers were cheating. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "One thing to note is that Kakegurui never trying to be a smart. It isn\u2019t exactly gambling show like Kaiji where the attention to detail is high. The games are more akin to the sorts of things teens make up for overnight school trips rather than what you\u2019d see in a proper casino, the anime main feature is just to shows people acts unrealistically with an addition seeing female gets sexually aroused by the excitement of of gamble. It was cringy to watch, but you can\u2019t deny quite possibly other people would find charms on its style.\r\nHaving said that, despite being rather more onto stylishapproach, the anime doesn\u2019t forget about the substance; the plot is very simple and straighforward and never gets derailed by the constant overreaction of the characters.  I\u2019d say that the 60 percent of the show is plot while the other 40 is fanservices.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the plot itself was dissapointing and I guess the blame for the most part goes to those handle the adaptation rather than its source material. The basic plot itself is utena like on which the main characters trying to take down the members of student councils. The problem is that the plot was moving overly fast; there is no break/breathtaking, just constant gambling againts student council one after another each episode. At least in Utena or in many battle series. There\u2019s always some break between an arc/fights; whether it is a comedy episodes, character\u2019s background episodes; or training episodes, well maybe training episodes is not needed to because it was about gambling and Yumeko\u2019s already overpowered from the very beginning, but you get the drift here. The point is that the show got old fast; the first or two episode maybe was quite refreshing but when you go to the third and latter episode with the same plot structurs, same formula and characters defined with one trait because there\u2019s not enough time and constant overreaction bombarded to viewers to the point of disgusted; seriously there\u2019s a scene where characters feels joys and stabbed his eyes and I have no idea anybody on earth would find enjoyment in that. In short, the show become repetitive and tedious. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s happened on screen is dissapointing too. Essentially the game was hit and miss for entertainment but understandeit\u2019s come from preferences, the lack of planning is something that I don\u2019t mind too because that wasn\u2019t the main intention. The thing is it become ridicoulous to the point the gambling went on to a child game where the characters themselves and some future carreer could be in line as a stake, Not to mention the finale is joking by basically creating tension at first then resetting the ending for the sake of teasing a second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe major characters are very weak. Suzui is basically lifeless observant who could be replaced with anyone irrelevant in the school and you still won\u2019t find any difference. Yumeko is just defined by her crazyness towards gambling. Mary is basically Vegeta of the show and student council just arrogant- dark-as-night villains. The rostrum of sideline characters, however, makes up for it. I think it\u2019s nice to see Sumeragi as not someone who just became throwaway and play role in the last few episodes, though she might not be the height of brilliance as an aspiring guitar player but at least is designed in such a way that he fits in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is very limited and I think quite unappropriate. The show just revolved around high school with generic background to it, you hardly see any characters not wearing their school uniform throughout the series. It is unappropriate because there\u2019s no single teacher appearred. Seriously the show should just set in a casino with the special rooms for \u2018elites\u2019 and \u2018farmers\u2019 and there is no difference with the setting the show already has. Maybe the creators thinks it was cool to create a gambling school while in the end, the adaptation making the setting quite pointless and seemingly just a thrown away premise.\\n\\n\r\nToo its credit though. There were screamings, a lot. But the voice acting did deliver presenting it to the point the overreaction of  the characters is passable and maybe joyful at times. This is the main reason I keep continue with the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nVisually the anime was alright and didn\u2019t do much wrong. Art and background wasn\u2019t inspirative and imaginative but when gambling occurs it is quite easy to follow. The things that will struck you though, are the constant zoom of eyes and the teeth. There\u2019s a lot of gritting and gnashing of teeth when characters drop their poker faces and either taunt their opponents or reel in pain at an impending loss. And in many of these shots, we see every single individual tooth one can possibly see in whatever grimace or smile being made. Then you couple that with the characters\u2019 eyes on which show their crazyness towards gambling \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it\u2019s hardly to say that Kakegurui is an enjoyable show. It is not thrilling because it\u2019s very predictable. It is tensionless because the consequences of the loser is not quite explored enough aside treated badly as a \u2018farmer\u2019. The comedy that could be ended up as cringe rather than funny. It\u2019s characters were awful, because lacking of depth, and the plot is just one trick pony.The finale that was absolutely nothing and the laundry list on and on and on. The constant overreaction with visual zooming might count for something to make it memorable. But even then, it is never worth your time. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway the anime wasn't horrible, because the series never making the fanservices derailed from its focus. Just a bad one. A type of show that\u2019s you just watch, finished and move on with it because it has absolutely nothing, morally or anything to take on.\\n",

            "content": "When I think of the term \u201cmodern anime,\u201d there\u2019s a host of intrinsic ideas that immediately pop into my head. Fanservice, zany characters, over the top emotional delivery, and bizarre plot concepts\u2014just to name a few. Sure, generalizing like this is unfair to a lot of the shows that break the mold, but by and large, the seasonal crap forced down our throat every year is usually just the same alphabet soup with a different name on the can. Kakegurui is no different. It has all of these stupid tropes in abundance, and hardly anything else.\r\nFor what it\u2019s worth, it at least has a highconcept premise. Boarding school with strange administration --> constant gambling amongst the student body --> perverse social hierarchy. Here, the richest of the rich game away their inheritance and either rise in the ranks and dominate the competition, or become \u201cpets,\u201d and have to do what they\u2019re told to do by those above them, humiliated with the nickname \u201cFido\u201d for boys and \u201cMittens\u201d for girls (at least, it\u2019s this way in the dub. The katakana on their nametags said \u201cPochi\u201d and \u201cMike\u201d so I think this might be a localization thing). \\n\\n\r\nGiven that the story is so concerned with gambling, you\u2019d think that the games are well thought out battles of the mind with perhaps some really well defined suspense, but no. It suffers from the exact same problem No Game No Life does, in that the games are nonsense games, with rules created by the author to maximize bullshittery. There\u2019s no classic Poker, Craps, or even Russian Roulette\u2014everything has to be randomized and have specialized rules, or involve magnets or extra cards of some sort, or any other number of stupid ideas specifically designed to make the lead character seem smarter when she dismantles her opponent and how exactly they\u2019re cheating. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I know it\u2019s important to distance yourself from the setting of anime sometimes, but quite frankly the story is so implausible that suspension of disbelief shatters like a broken window. A school where gambling takes up the entirety of extracurricular activities\u2014but can end up permanently destroying the students\u2019 lives? Even going so far as creating sex slaves and human furniture out of them? Why does anyone stay enrolled? How is this legal? I would forgive these failures if the games or the tension were developed at all, but they aren\u2019t, and it\u2019s so easy to tell what will happen next that it\u2019s just painful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nGoing back to my aforementioned point of zany anime characters, the cast is trope after trope after trope. Yumeko is a boring protagonist that explains why she won after the fact. Ryouta is an awful second lead with literally no personality at all. Mary is annoying and honestly stupid to a fault. All the other characters are functionally retarded, one-note perverts and snobby elitists. Terrible villains, unconvincing motivations\u2026 what\u2019s left to enjoy here?\\n\\n\r\nDespite some awful CG hands, most of the animation is actually really smooth, and it at least manages to tango in its own style well enough to make the visuals enjoyable. It\u2019s not a bad aesthetic; the hyper-polished, billiards-style mural art edge to the show works well enough to keep it at least fun to look at. Food symbolism, dark colors, and overblown, sexually villainous expressions aren\u2019t anything new, but they suit the tone pretty well for the way the rest of the show fails. The music is fun too\u2014jazz and bossa nova, blues, stuff you\u2019d hear being preformed live in an actual casino. \\n\\n\r\nBut unless the look and sound of a show work in tandem to present elements of the story in an important way, they are not enough to salvage it. The plot still makes no sense, the characters all suck, the games are actually unplayable nonsense, and unless you want to be frustrated or bored to death, I suggest looking elsewhere. The only reason I don\u2019t score it any lower is that these problems are just so common nowadays. Kakegurui reflects a type of mediocrity that you can only get in most \u201cmodern anime,\u201d going back to how I opened up the review. At the very least, this anime is by the numbers enough to give you a solid example of how NOT to write things like tension, payoff, character intrigue, etc. \\n",

            "content": "In writing this review, it's all too easy to forget to write a proper review of this show, and instead just \"Why Kaiji is better than Kakegurui\", and there's nothing inherently wrong with that, people will always compare one show to other similar shows, if it were a mecha anime with existentialist themes, comparisons to Evangelion would be inescapable. But still, Kaiji is a good example of a well-made gambling anime, so while I'll try to avoid making comparisons too often (largely for the sake of those who haven't actually seen Kaiji), some will undoubtedly appear.\r\nTo start off, a basic overview of the plot: Kakeguruitakes place in an elite school wherein people's ability to gamble properly is what gives them their status, from the student council at the top, and house pets at the bottom, with the story taking place upon the transfer of Yumeko Jabami, who is addicted to gambling, and cannot resist a good gamble.\\n\r\nNow, one thing I can commend the show for is it goes for a nice aesthetic. The lighting in particular helping to focus, and Yumeko's eyes going red, or characters being animated in grotesque amounts of detail when shocked/excited (the best parallel I can think of would be the \"I need it!\" scene from Spongebob). Additionally, the voice acting for the eyepatch girl with the gun was quite good as well, and this is where my praise for the show ends, with considerably more complaints to come.\\n\\n\r\nThe first gamble happens in the first episode, which is a rock-paper-scissors based card game (just like Kaiji), wherein Yumeko spots that her opponent is cheating, but still finds a way to circumvent it and win, through single-digit percentage levels of luck, which is hard to suspend your disbelief for when you know it's not actual luck, just plot convenience. For some brilliant gambler, a plan so reliant on luck certainly is questionable, but I'm partially convinced I put more thought into writing this review than the author did the manga. Additionally, she gives a little speech about how \"In a capitalistic society, money and life are the same\", which isn't too dissimilar to a speech made by Tonegawa in Kaiji, the only difference being that not only did Kaiji wait about 8 episodes before giving this speech, but in Kakegurui it just feels completely artificial, and I think this is embedded by the fact that in Kaiji, Tonegawa does make a good point. We do see Kaiji, and many other characters risk life and limb for the sake of money, meaning that his statement is quite impactful. Yumeko bets 10 million yen in the first 10 minutes like it's all Monopoly money, and at the end of the day, it is. It's also worth noting that as a very rich Yakuza boss, for Tonegawa to say it actually makes sense, but Yumeko's saying it in front of a woman she's just met, in a school she's only just been to for the first time, and doesn't even know how things properly work yet. She has such a high amount of money that no gambles are impactful, it's like playing a video game with cheat codes. If she wins, ok she had a fun time, but that money doesn't matter to her, nor the viewer. If she loses, it doesn't matter either, because she can not only pay that money off easily, but if she gets a \"Life Plan\", and is forced to marry some rich bloke, well that's in ten years, it doesn't impact the story right now. It's like the shonen cliche of using a special power that takes off a tiny amount of life, which the viewer never sees the impact of, so it might as well not even happen. It seems like something really basic, if you're making a gambling anime, make the gambles impactful to the viewer. Imagine if John Rambo was completely incapable of being killed. The action wouldn't be engaging at all, and it's the same here. In fact, given that she is the daughter of a CEO or politician or something else, maybe we could see her getting disowned, or at least ostracised for a huge failure as well as her addiction? Doesn't happen. There's little point it even being a school other than because girls with big asses in schoolgirl outfits is where the money is. Speaking of which, I really didn't appreciate the very heavy and blatant BDSM overtones in the show, and I liked Prison School, for crying out loud. It was just really poorly handled, and a bit of a disappointment all things considered. In fact, sexual imagery as a whole is poorly handled, I really don't know why Yumeko or any of the other girls were so sexually excited by gambling, sometimes even having to touch themselves, it's just absurd. It's not even trying to be funny, and I really don't think anyone could've appreciated it.\\n\r\nSo I should probably also speak about the sound design. With the aforementioned eyepatch girl with the gun, who I will not give the respect to look up the actual name of, the voice acting was very poor. Yumeko's the main character, but she's disappointingly average with her voice acting. With the adrenaline rush from gambling that's meant to be tantamount to cocaine, when she's shouting in her opponent's face, she should at least speak at a bit louder in volume, and with a more enthusiastic tone of voice. Not to mention most the time she just sounds like, for a lack of a better term, a fake bitch. Perhaps I'm just too used to anime characters who make their emotions clear as day, but she just sounds so distant from everything, and just about every instance during the gambles in which she spoke, I could just tell that she was speaking in such a manner to aggravate their opponent. This isn't because I'm brilliant at detecting fake personas during gambling matches, nor because I'm an expert on emotions. Rather, it was just poorly done, and I'm half convinced this show was programmed by a computer. Schoolgirls, fanservice, and a poorly implemented gimmick, but no human actually checked to make sure everything works.\\n\\n\r\nSo to conclude, Kakegurui is exceptionally poor. On its own merits, it is an utter failure. The characters are uncompelling, the omnipresent fanservice does no favours in actually making the show any easier to stomach, the gambles are about as poorly written as I can imagine, just having the formula of Yumeko wins at first, then she starts to lose and says something along the lines \"Oh, now things are getting interesting\", then the villain taunts her and gets overconfident, then she makes a comeback and explains how it was all according to keikaku and exploited something that the viewer had no actual way of seeing or knowing, and then walks off triumphantly.  Even as just a SOL, it's got nothing going for it, and as a gambling anime, and thereby contender to head honcho Kaiji, it is an embarrassing failure. The only reason I got as far as episode 4 was to see how the arc would end, but it got so unbearable I couldn't even manage that. That it was popular enough to receive a second season is a mystery I'm just waiting for Yumeko to laugh in my face and explain the reason behind, because it's well beyond me.\\n\r\nGenuinely and utterly contemptuous in all regards, and one last note, what the fuck are wrong with the school uniform trousers/skirts, most bizarre pattern I've ever seen.",

            "content": "This anime got my attention for its animation and the gambling theme, and obviously all the hype that got when it was aired. I was hoping to see intellectual fights and feel the risk of the gamble itself. But my hopes died the more I watched Kakegurui. Actually, there wasn't any sensation of risk! Not because they weren't gambling, but because the main character didn't mind loosing money or any other consequences that may cause.\r\nStory. There is this private school, where students gamble, and there are consequences if you lose and benefits if you win, simple. But everything moves in benefit of Yumeko, our maincharacter. Following a Villain-of -the-week model, it's repetitive and predictable, and that makes this a boring story. 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt. It's decent, as I say before, it's one of the main reasons why I watched this show, but it's really rude the way it uses exaggerations unnecessarily, making the characters look crazy and sadist just to \"impact\" us. Also, have a few proportions mistakes and the CGI looks kinda weird. 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound. The opening is good, the ending is decent. The OST in the show it's generic, simple. Fits the theme and the atmosphere but just that, doesn't stand out. 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Yumeko, the main character of this anime, it's just absurd. Doesn't have any motivation more than gamble for the emotion of the risk. Oversexualized, gets turn on when she's gambling. The side characters are more of the same, super hyped when gambling and have sadist, sexualized or violent behaviour. 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. After the first episode, I already knew what was gonna happen in the rest of the anime. The other games were not even interesting. It's really offensive that a show tried to capture my attention with only crazy characters overacting, and using the animation to make them look interesting and sadistic. 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. Simple, boring, predictable. 2/10.\\n",

            "content": "In a school where a bet could decide your future, Jabami Yumeko defies the current system by simply not worrying about the consequences. The thrill of the game is what matters. She\u2019s a compulsive gambler, after all.\r\nHyakkaou Private Academy is a place that only the children of the richest can go. It\u2019s an institution with a very peculiar curriculum: it isn\u2019t based on the regular school matters, neither on athletic prowess of the students. Rather, it is based on making the rich richer. So, what ability is revered when it comes to business? Reading your adversary. That\u2019s the pillar of stock market bets. Then, whatdoes Hyakkaou have that is so special it creates this competitive ambience of betting? They revolve around gambling.\\n\\n\r\nBlackjack, poker, roulette or even rock-paper-scissors, everything can be made profitable, everything can be made payable. Here, one starts drowning in debt before university \u2013 or swimming in money. In this academy, the winners and losers are very separated. If one loses a match, they got attached to the person who won, like a slave, having a chain collar with a plate written \u201closer\u201d so everyone can see their condition. The Student Council isn\u2019t better, in fact, it\u2019s harsher on gambles, with more than the financial debt as a problem; they often put more consequences on the games, such as arranging marriages and forcing people to not live their lives as they want, everything according to their \u201cLife Plan\u201d designed to the students who lose by playing against them.\\n\\n\r\nBut this oppressive system isn\u2019t the only problem: many of the students -- and that includes the ones from the Council --, are what they call \u201ccorrupted\u201d, or, in other words, a compulsive gambler. Some drown in debt by not thinking before playing, some are intelligent and get better, and some don\u2019t care about money, life plans, or any other consequences at all -- including death --, and that is what makes Jabami Yumeko so special, because no one can manipulate her through games, making her a challenge to the current system \u2013 the only thing someone can trick her  into is to feel the frisson of the games.\\n\\n\r\nTo counterbalance her impulsiveness, hesitant Suzui Ry\u014dta becomes \u201cthe voice of reason\u201d (or sanity) in this place filled with craziness. But, of course, he\u2019s never listened to. And that\u2019s what makes him an important character because he finds himself needing to work around difficult situations in which sanity or wisdom don\u2019t help.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish the main pack of characters, Saotome Meari is the not compulsive, but greedy gambler. Greedy in a way that she feeds off this system, loving the power that it offers to the winners. Living like a queen, she is the blueprint student of her academy, until important events make her reconsider how she plays in this jungle of cheaters, enablers, kings and slaves.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime revolves around this trio, either combining them to make unthinkable plays or simply to put both extremes of taking risks and being afraid to test. The trio starts relating, not aware of that, but drawing the attention of other students, from common ones to higher-ups \u2013 including the head of the Student Council, Kirari Momobami --, but not without reason: Jabami Yumeko is a new animal in this jungle, bringing new habits and spreading havoc by her compulsive yet mastermind plays. And something about the plays must be said.\\n\\n\r\nOn the beginning of a game, Yumeko is like an unarmed kitten, knowing nothing, but by the end of the day, the kitten has manipulated everyone to bring it food. That\u2019s how Jabami sucks all that is near to her, as a hurricane of madness, to the point of completely changing her complexion, from her normal, round, dreamy eyes to slanted, cold calculating globes, turning them into igneous rubies, and her face into a crooked inhuman grimace, sending the signal of the definite presence of her madness and her control of any game that she\u2019s in. \\n\\n\r\nBesides her eyes, another mark of the visuals of the anime is distorted facial expressions. They generally appear on people who are humiliating others, either by game or socially. The distorted complexions give a unique touch to Kakegurui, pinching the viewer\u2019s and defining the atmosphere of the Academy, its hostility carved in the faces of the students.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the things are not so black and white \u2013 although one can define \u201cto gamble or not to gamble\u201d as a dilemma --: the motives for gamble are varied, they can range from people trying to save their families\u2019 debts to lunatics rebelling against the world for no reason, and this variety is shown on the multitude of characters. Each personality, each resolve, each way of playing, everything becomes a web of interests. Not without a main tone, however. The cast always strives to the most common desires of the human nature: power, status and, of course, money, everything as the underlying cause, and, evidently, under the Hyakkaou Academy ruthless structure.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui is a work of psychological thriller that uses gambling as a stage to play its overarching theme: human corruption and mind games, not in the superficial, petty sense, but in the grim, wicked and limitless ways that only money and power can create the drive for. The viewer might appreciate the \u201clast straw\u201d, \u201ctwist\u201d moments in the anime, when the tables can (and will) be turned at right (or wrong) moments, rapidly, a mismatched look or a misplaced arrogance and maybe wishful thinking, but always with a daunting psychological strategy. The key here is to use the characters as wells and bring viscerally everything from them, pouring them on the table, on the games, showing all wickedness and desires that can only be shown when despair occurs. After all, the thrill of the game is all that matters.",

Welllllll.....\r\nBeing a Minnesota Vikings fan in real life has more than conditioned me for the soul crushing disappointment that this has left me,only this time I happen to be in the minority, at least as these reviews seem to be going by, generally anything under a total 7.95 on here has some controversial opinions but I had to dig a bit to find similar sentiments to mine to see if there was anything I was missing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is where the tryhardness of Kakegurui shows and flaunts it in your face, everyone has to be so batshit insane that batshit insanity loses all appeal. The male guy from the beginning? Who gives a fuck about the only normal guy in here let's toss him aside, who needs a healthy amount of contrast anyways? Everyone rich is spoiled and has 15,000 screws loose, even our sexbait Yumeko, focus on her because she's so smart and great, she'll take down those evil cheaters while being wild herself to the point of almost orgasming, please like her and buy a fuckton of dakimakuras of her as well! She's that amazing that the front of your pants will instantly have gaping holes in them  *internal screaming and shame over my keyboard vomit* Speaking of that...\\n\\n\r\nThe blatant sex appeal and art style: Normally I don't mind a fucked up art style but when they're so busy trying to give you an erection maybe you'd want a more appealing art style rather than having the main girl look like she's gonna have an orgasm from heat stroke. I just don't dig MAPPA's art style here for the tones and color usage, I'm not typically an expert on that and I'm very sorry that I can't go into further details on why I don't like that besides the fact that I'm still shocked on how it's not an actual hentai, because being hentai would explain quite a bit here.\\n\\n\r\nThe gambling: I get that the appeal of the show is the insanity which I don't like that much, but surely the gambling scenes are worth it, right? Absolutely not and you know why? They don't reveal what the character is thinking so it feels like an asspull out of left field! I'm not saying to let us in on the plot like a chess player monologuing their moves or anything, but there should at least be subtle hints so that when I feel floored it feels justified and smart. Instead it feels like they're trying so hard to make Yumeko so great in comparison to these rich cheaters that I feel loss and disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of these episodes were always going to be obvious since protags are usually given plot armor, so even if they do lose it's not going to ever be anything important to them, so the ride better be damn excellent and it wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kakegurui is a huge disappointment beyond my words, it's not the absolute worst thing ever and far from it (looking at you Asterisk War) but it focuses on all the wrong things for me. I can't help but being envious of those who genuinely love it though, I really wanted to like this and have gambling anime be a bit of a thing for a while if done well, but unfortunately this show is just not what I was looking for and the things that appeal to those who love it happen to be what I just can't like for the life of me and I tried my hardest. Most shows are just unfortunately not for everyone, and I'll have to label Kakegurui as my disappointment of the entire year right now.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review might contain spoilers on the anime \"Kakegurui\". Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don't understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.\r\nKakegurui is infinitely entertaining, but it has a flagrant flaw: the bets\r\nNetflix released Kakegurui today, an anime of the summer season and once completed, I understand perfectly why it was so popular. It is supremely fun.\r\nBut that does not mean it's a perfect anime, far from it.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs a gambling lover and quite familiar with the subgenre of manga and anime bets, I have to say that what Kakegurui gives us on entertainment takesaway from us when it comes to betting.\\n\\n\r\nThere is the king of this subgenre Kaiji, but there are also other titles like Gambler Fish, Akagi that better handle the issue of betting. Not to mention Liar Game and One Outs, which although they are not specifically gambling, capture very well the feeling of risk after bets. But I will detail this point, first let's talk about this anime of 12 episodes with second season approved.\\n\\n\r\nYumeko Jabami, Kakegurui's compulsive bettor\\n\\n\r\nSimplifying a little the plot of this anime, Kakegurui is the story of Yumeko Jabami, a girl who at first glance seems to be an elegant, educated and attractive young woman. A Yamato Nadeshiko. However, her true character is that of a compulsive player.\\n\\n\r\nBy transferring to the private academy Hyakkaou, an institution that prides itself on preparing its students for the real world, promoting betting and gambling, Yumeko reaches its particular heaven. During the day it is a normal educational institution, but at the end of the classes the bets start and not only the money is at stake, so is life.\\n\\n\r\nBut for Yumeko no matter win or lose, the important thing is the emotion of the bets, to gamble everything. The anime adapts the first 27 chapters of the manga and then adds an original ending that seems to give some closure to the story, but with a confirmed sequel we know it will not be like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episodes are an introduction to the world of Kakegurui and its rules. In the school there are the \"humans\" and the \"pets\". Students who make financial contributions to the Student Council are considered human. Those who get into debt and are unable to do so, become pets. Men are called Fidos and women are Kitten, and are humiliated by their companions.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yumeko win or lose is irrelevant, falling to the status of Kitten is not important and in fact gives you more opportunities to bet everything at ease. On the way, she will make enemies and these will end up becoming her allies. The first one is Ryota Suzui, who is fascinated with her and her crazy way of betting.\\n\\n\r\nA story of bad people and Yumeko, the perfect\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the time of betting there are always two games, the one that is waged at the table and the mental game between the participants. In Kakegurui there is no shortage of cheating players and the complicated plans they make. However, the games themselves are easy enough to follow and understand. What is sometimes very superficial are the traps and especially the ways in which Yumeko disarms them. This becomes frustrating, because as a player our protagonist is too perfect and that is a problem.\\n\\n\r\nIn a cast full of bad people, so bad that they come to look like caricatured villains, Yumeko is the one you can least identify with at times. This is because despite being the protagonist, the story is more narrated from the point of view of their rivals than from theirs. We never hear the voice in her head, we only know her plan when she reveals it before winning.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this problem, there is nothing to complain about the performance of her seiyuu, Hayami Saori, who manages to interpret the character perfectly. She goes from her role as a delicate lady to a seductive woman to a complete deranged woman. What really subtracts as a character is her lack of motivation beyond the game itself, and her infallibility as a bettor, thanks to her prodigious memory and observation skills.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why characters that start looking cruel and abusive like Mary Saotome or Itsuki Sumeragi end up being more interesting than Yumeko. Midari Ikishima becomes really annoying and her behavior borders on the unbearable. However, she makes what is perhaps the only understandable emotional reaction of our protagonist: The anger of ruin the pleasure of a bet.\\n\\n\r\nMAPPA studios comes out well\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the technical section is where this anime shines. The direction was in charge of Yuuchirou Hayashi for Mappa, with character design by Manabu Akita. In this section there was a lot of fidelity with respect to the original art of Kawamoto Homura. The exaggerated and twisted reactions of the characters were very well captured, although their translation of the manga to animated format may be a bit excessive.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in general maintains a consistent level. There are few instances in which frame savings are abused. His bright and intense palette of colors goes perfectly with the design of the characters, far from the usual moe aesthetics of modern anime. The girls of Kakegurui do not look like girls, but women. It could be argued that they look like hentai exits, in fact.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is any technical complaint, it was the use of 3D CGI in the animation of the hands, which could sometimes be annoying. However, the direction of the opening by Yamamoto Sayo is the true visual spectacle of this series. Added to the great song that is \"Deal with de Devil\" by TIA, we have the recipe for one of the best OP of 2017 (feel free to read my blog post on that).\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the music in general of this series, with its jazz vibes, is a strong point of this show. The ending is less attractive, but considering that it is precisely the final theme, it gives a little bit the same, we can skip it. Despite these complaints, we can say that the MAPPA studios comes out well in this adaptation with its failures, but of great quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem bets\\n\\n\\n\r\nReturning to the issue of betting, although Kakegurui has some fascinating psychological elements, with attractive characters and a little deranged -some perhaps too much- it is predictable on the bets.\\n\\n\r\nEven some may seem boring, if you remove the black humor and the caricatured evil of the characters. Along with the sexualization of betting, which also gives a touch of interest.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui tries to tell us that its bets are all or nothing, but it is a hoax. The value of what is the bet is not well defined, because Yumeko bets with such abandon that tension is felt only on occasions.\\n\\n\r\nIf the risk is too great and the reward little, what is the purpose? It is true that Yumeko is a compulsive gambler, so these logical rules of betting do not apply to her, but it does not stop being wrong to exaggerately raise what is at stake.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, being fair, Yumeko never loses. In her only losing bet she is in fact the moral winner and only lost effectively by the manipulation of someone outside the bet.\\n\\n\r\nFor Yumeko what she bets does not matter at all. Being an addict, you can play life just for the excitement of doing it. Money does not matter to her, that they decide her life for her does not matter. Being humiliated does not matter. Basically lose does not matter and, being a millionaire, in the end the consequences for her are not such.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime betting without consequences is not a good betting anime. But that does not mean that it is a bad anime, as I said, it is entertaining until rage. Perhaps the problem is that the real risk is not established, in large part because of how fast each bet is resolved. Even the confrontation with the President of the Council, Kirari Momobami, is solved in a very simple game and almost instantaneously, without consequences.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, I insist, it is so entertained by its twisted cast of characters and its subtext full of black humor, that I can not help but recommend it. Not for nothing I saw it in one sitting, it is ideal for marathons.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui is easy to see in one sitting, this is testimony to how much fun it is. However, with a protagonist with whom it is difficult to empathize and with the total absence of risk in betting, it loses a little.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Jabami, Yumeko a girl transferred to a school where gambling is everything. If you are good at gambling your life will be good, wealthy and happy; if you are bad at gambling you will work, and be a slave until you pay the debt on you.\r\nThis is a world where gambling decides everything. Of course, the person who always wins in gambling must be cheating, and here is where your mind will work. The different gamesthat are played in this anime are truly astonishing. Once the game has started everything will become crazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe tense and thrill in this anime are so good. The characters are mostly crazy and that suits the anime. I mean gambling without being crazy. especially when you gamble on everything you have? It's just not right. The anime has a good artwork and it's suited for the anime. However, only 12 episodes for this anime is not enough at all. I'm hoping for a second season to be released soon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime has good and well-made games that will take you to a world full of thinking and excitement. I would say that one of the bad points about this anime is that it rushed things a lot. Like really only 12 episode for this anime is really not enough, and that effected on the story. The story could have been better if the anime was longer than 12 episodes. However, I really want to see more from this anime and I'm looking forward to the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rate: 9/10\\n\r\nA highly recommended anime.",

Even though there could be a second season, because some of the things are still vague.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI don't have many ways of describing how beautiful they've made this anime, it has a LOT into it, I couldn't ask for better for an anime of mystery and drama !!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music, the sounds all fit SO perfectly in the moments of suspense, and the opening is so well made that is one of my favourite ones now !!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nAll the characters are so good the way they are until the end, you see from the start how they look like and it shows how they were not what you thought they were !! The only problem that I find about this anime is that it doesn't develop much about their past or their story, which is fine since it's only a 12 episode anime I won't ask to show all the past like Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI think I've enjoyed it way too much, if you are going to watch it, be prepared for the suspence that won't let you breathe !!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nSuch unique anime, it is just like nothing you've seen before, all of it just fits so perfectly, the art, the story, the sound, are just amazing and again, I couldn't ask for more for an anime that has 12 episodes.\\n\r\nI think I've found it really unique since this year we had a lot of animes that just look like ripoffs of some others, and I think if you watch it until the end you will enjoy it.\\n\r\nI gave it 9/10 because of the character development is not perfect, season 2 would make sense and I would come back to change all this.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if I repeated myself too much even thoough this is not an excuse, my mother tongue is not english, I've tried my best to express myself and I hopefully made you guys look forward to watch this one !\\n",

            "content": "Slight Spoiler about Episode 11 and a \"Major\" Spoiler about Episode 7\r\nKakegurui is more of an experimental anime than a gambling one. How much plot armour can you use in a single story before the viewers started to get annoyed? Apparently, the answer is a lot. As you can see from the MAL score, people seem to love this anime. It's crazy characters and intense drama was able to create a fanbase that loved every single part of Kakegurui. However, with every show, especially the popular ones, comes a significant number of people that just weren't able to enjoy what this show had to offer,and I guess I fall into the latter of Kakegurui's watchers.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the cast of Kakegurui, most of the characters are pretty messed up in the head. We have one that collects human nails, another that loves playing Russian Roulette with herself and our main Yumeko Jabami, who literally gets off by taking risks in gambles. In fact, the only one without an eccentric personality is Ryouta Suzui, although he's only really there to occasionally comment on how the game's going and serves no other purpose but to worry over Yumeko as she throws herself into another gamble. Back to the nutcases, it's perfectly fine to have insane characters to spice up your cast, but when you have this many to this extent, you start to forget they're supposed to be actual people within their world. Their personalities are so exaggerated that it's hard to take any of them seriously, and when you factor in the anime's formula of moving from one big game to another, most of the characters just become another crazy face for Yumeko to defeat, only popping back up a few more times to remind us that they still exist within this school.\\n\\n\r\nNow the other important side of Kakegurui is the drama. Each gamble usually has the same set of steps, Yumeko faces off against someone, the opponent makes it look like they have the upper hand with either a cheating method or their intellectual superiority, but Yumeko soon turns the tables on them and mind breaks them harder than a hentai heroine. Now for the first few games, it might have been entertaining to watch, but after a while, you start to get tired of seeing it happen over and over. A number of issues also pop up, further bringing down my enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, plot armour and convenience. Yumeko will never lose an important match, the story won't allow her. With stakes like massive debt, slavery and sometimes even death, it would be problematic if Yumeko lost too many times as she would no longer be able to participate as our main character. So the obvious solution is to make her incredibly lucky. Sure you could try to make each game a battle of wits, allowing our MC to come up with ingenious strategies while crushing her opponent's plans in the process, but who wants to see something like that? Mind games are boring, I'd rather just watch Yumeko shine her shinigami eyes and win over and over. Games that hold no dramatical impact are much better than an intense showdown between two people, ain't that right everyone?\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, shock factor. No, I'm not talking about the twisted and contorted faces each character makes, I'm fine how messed up each cast member looks during the show. I'm more focused on the actions that some of the characters make during an episode. For example, Yumeko asks Itsuki Sumeragi for a loan so that she could defeat Kaede Manyuda, but Manyuda taunts Sumeragi by saying she has no chance of reaching the top. In an act to show off how determined she is to become the best of the best, Sumeragi bites down on her nails and rips them out with her teeth. Now, why the fuck would you do that? Just give Yumeko the money and make a speech about how you do have the guts to take a risk, you didn't need to physically injure yourself. There is only one reason why you'd do this, and it's to create shock factor. The show wants to make you feel squeamish, so they pull off these ridiculous scenes to make you squeal while covering your eyes in fear. It doesn't work that way, guys. You need a reason behind gore and other messed up scenes, just mindlessly showing off stuff like this all the time causes it to feel forced and lessen the amount of impact the scene would have originally had.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly and finally, plot developments that make no sense. Now granted, this doesn't happen as often as the first two issues I mentioned, but it's something that needs to be addressed. In episode 7 where Yumeko is facing off against Midari Ikishima, playing a game called ESP Roulette. Someone in a separate room creates a pattern by placing a set of cards face down, each marked with different symbols, and a live feed is broadcasted to the room where the players are. The two opponents must then place their cards face down, each with the same set of symbols to try and guess the order. Of course, once all the cards are revealed, the person who guesses the most wins that round, and the chance to shoot their opponent with a revolver filled with a varied amount of bullets, hence the roulette part of ESP Roulette. (Again shock factor and plot armour wow so intense) Now, Yumeko figures out that Midari is cheating by occasionally inverting the video feed, changing the order shown on the screen. However, this provides neither an advantage or disadvantage for any of the players. Midari still has no idea what order the cards are set up until they're revealed, and her partners on the other side have no idea how well Midari guessed the cards, she's just changing the order up for no reason. It makes no sense to have her do this when it makes no difference to whether she has a better chance of winning or losing.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui has nothing to offer to us but its characters and drama, but these two factors end up feeling more bland then exciting. There were still times where I thought the show did things well, as I consider the debt replacement game in episodes 4 and 5 to be the only good gamble in the anime, but overall I just feel like taking my chances with another gambling anime and see how much better that fairs. I hear Kaiji is really good, should probably watch that.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading, Send Feeback if You Have Any!",

            "content": "One of the greatest, yet basic testaments to a compelling portrayal of gambling is a genuine awareness of its risks. Surrounded by the absence of guarantees, high rewards are often packaged with high risks that can end in one\u2019s complete self-destruction and devastation. Regardless of experience, intellect and judgement, an unrelenting, strict reality is that gambling is scary, unpredictable and can be psychologically taxing.\r\nKakegurui is certainly a show that makes interesting efforts to present itself as a thriller brimming with risks and uncertainty. The story takes place at Hyakkaou Private Academy where the school grounds have become gambling dens and the art of money makingand manipulation are common actions. With such a premise and school system, a common expectation would be intense, psychological warfare that could have very well been a selling point for the series. Unfortunately, the series falls short by leaving this crucial aspect undeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there seem to be conflicting receptions that might suggest that this show is \u201cambiguous\u201d about its main ideas. Is the show one that specifically explores the inner, psychological depths of gambling one's life away? Or is the major focus of the series to explore the craze and self-destructive addiction of Jabami Yumeko? While many might argue the latter because of the title, \u201cCompulsive\u201d Gambler, it is worth mentioning that both arguments are rendered somewhat irrelevant because both are part of a gambling show. Jabami Yumeko IS someone with a potentially self-destructive addiction to gambling however, that does not change the fact the show is Jabami\u2019s life in a school where gambling is a judge of social status and is full of the potential to render participants completely broke. Secondly, the latter does not justify a high-stakes environment not being present for the other characters. Even IF the show is just about exploring Yumeko\u2019s addiction, absolutely no tension is not justified in the slightest. We know that Yumeko is addicted to gambling so the argument that Kakegurui is more of a character study than a gambling show loses its weight because it leaves a character\u2019s gambling craze as the sole point to be conveyed. If this is acknowledged, it becomes more apparent that the awareness of stakes should be more pronounced in Kakegurui\u2019s presentation.\\n\\n\r\nAside from a few highlights, the risk of gambling, while still present, does not present itself as a strong foundational concept in the series. Caution is by no means thrown into the wind however, a realistic level of anxiousness that is derived from the possibility of losing it all is rarely made apparent before the characters start gambling. Rather, reactions become a pattern of worrisome expressions when a seemingly perfect plan begins to wither away at the hands of Jabami Yumeko. To its credit however, the first episode does a decent job of showing the thought process and hesitation of making a move. Its way of handling the prediction of one\u2019s opponents\u2019 moves and whether or not it would lose them the game, while predictable, is somewhat believable. Doubts, second thoughts and hesitation are all compelling fundamentals for a realistic gambling portrayal. Unfortunately, the believability of the show quickly sinks into a foreseeable pattern of consecutively defeating and/or humiliating known gamblers around the school. While there is no problem with this direction, there are rarely obstacles, failures are minor, and the viewer is never really given a reason to doubt Yumeko\u2019s success.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if this were solely an internal exploration of Yumeko\u2019s addiction, the atmosphere would pretty much remain the same. Her addiction to gambling is evident from the first episode so the repeated lack of threat to her matches is inexcusable. With enough insight into her mindset, the next thing to do would be to set up a genuinely risky/threatening atmosphere to increase the sense of dread and apprehension that should be present during such psychological activities. This would leave a subtle question in our minds of \u201cWhat if?\u201d that is so desperately needed. We would gradually see the matches unfold with little reason to know what the outcome would be. In this case, Jabami Yumeko losing (and losing something of significance) would really fit the whole gambling idea of the show, as we would be able to explore whether or not her demeanor and perspective would change or be challenged.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as a choking atmosphere of uncertainty can torture a gambler to no end when actual gambling happens, risk should have been the concept to open the door to an action-packed puzzle of thrilling uncertainty that could have really kept the viewer at the edge of their seat. Unfortunately, the general lack of hesitation to gambling, the absence of real stakes, and Yumeko\u2019s constant win streak (no threat to her success) breaks the heart-stopping intensity and thrill that this series should have had. If this is not a vital component to a gambling show, what else can take its place? While not boring, these missing factors render the series quite repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the above is to say that Kakegurui is not interesting. It has lots of interesting games and ways to gamble that are somewhat unconventional and entertaining. Had the series done better with its atmosphere, this layer of creativity would have been much more rewarding to the show\u2019s presentation and overall quality. In addition to this, with multiple interesting character designs and motivations, the ways in which challenges are brought to Jabami Yumeko are unique and enjoyable. Most of the gambling challenges issued were based on the passions of the characters issuing the challenge in a way that gave it some sort of special relation to them or left their trademarks. The games range from playing cards to idol contests, or firing pistols, and this made for a weird yet fascinating experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does well to represent shock through the most interesting of facial expressions. Throughout the series, hostility is shown through the most deranged of looks that would have actually been well place if the narrative itself would pull its weight. While cheesy at times, some of the details and edits are really cool and give certain scenes some hype. The emotions and what the characters are feeling are not only visible (sometimes too visible) but captivating enough to make one feel the most out of the moment. The art style is not particularly dark but is extremely flexible, capable of alternating between benign and malicious looks that fit the tone of the series. It supports the flow of ideas and thoughts of Kakegurui effectively and fits quite well. For where it was focused, the show does an excellent job in its art.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kakegurui are generally crazy with some type of quirky personality. Most characters have one kind of obsession that makes them somewhat unpredictable and fascinating to watch. For example, we have Jabami Yumeko who derives pleasure from the \u201crisk\u201d of gambling and is addicted to this. We also have a character who is addicted to near death situations which makes her demeanor weird and well\u2026crazy. Generally, these characters do only have one character trait. They are not particularly deep and one might find it hard to care about them and their progress. Nevertheless, they are still memorable and a trademark for the show. Depending on who you are, this can keep the show entertaining where the gambling aspect fails.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this show. Personally, it was entertaining through and through. While the show falls flat in its gambling presentation, there are cool game ideas, unique character designs and some crazy moments that might (at least for me) make the show an interesting watch. As shown by the conflicted fandom, this show is not for everyone but what the fandom says should not deter you from watching this show if you please.\\n\\n\r\nNow, keep in mind that this is just my opinion and not the be-all-end-all of the show and you are free to think whatever you wish about the series. Whether you think the show is a masterpiece or the most despicable piece of garbage on television is not up to me to decide and I hope that I am not conveying my thoughts in this manner. This is just what I saw when watching the series and what I felt the show did and did not do. This is my first review, so feel free to give me your opinions and CONSTRUCTIVE criticism (not a rant about why I was wrong and did not see the point of the show) in my comment section. Thank you for reading!\\n",

            "content": "If there's one thing Kakegurui did right, it's how it perfectly demonstrated how to not do a gambling anime. In fact, if you have not yet seen Kakegurui, I would recommend you to not think of it too much as a gambling anime at all when you do so. Otherwise you will most likely only end up reducing your enjoyment of the show in the process. I learned that lesson the hard way.\r\nAs someone who absolutely loves anime about games, gambling, battle of wits and similar in general, I was really looking forward to Kakegurui, and I was hoping it could provide the same fixas series like Kaiji, Akagi, Liar Game and One Outs for example did so well in the past. But as I quite quickly found out, Kakegurui is not really about gambling per se, but rather about gambling addiction and the people playing. However, even with that taken into account there are still numerous problems at work here, and as a result what was initially my most anticipated anime of the Summer season eventually ended up becoming one of its weaker shows instead.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui takes place in Hyakkaou Private Academy: a high school for ultra-rich students which has turned into a sort of gambling den after school hours where the students play each other in various games with huge amounts of money at stake, and whoever manages to manipulate the others the most and gain control of the most amount of money will quickly gain power within the society. This is where we find Jabami Yumeko: a complete nutcase addicted to the adrenaline rush of high-stakes gambles who enters the school and rapidly starts gaining recognition throughout it during the post-class activities. Kakegurui follows her blaze of glory across the academy.\\n\\n\r\nSo why did I suggest that this is not a very good gambling anime then? Well if you've seen any of the shows I mentioned earlier then the differences should be rather noticeable, but I'll try to explain for those of you haven't. There are numerous reasons really. The first problem with the gambles in Kakegurui is the bets. Most of the time the stakes consist of nothing but enormous sums of money put on the line. However, it's pretty clear from the start that Yumeko doesn't really care about this at all. She's more than willing to put every single yen that she owns on the line just for the thrill, and even if she ends up losing it all, the only thing that will happen is that she'll go into debt and become a so-called house pet, in which case she can just win it back the next time. It basically feels like the outcome of the game barely even matters to her, and in that case why should it matter to us as the viewers either?\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, during the rare occasions where some other bet is made, things aren't a whole lot better either, for example there's one game of Russian roulette where Yumeko and her opponent literally bets their lives, which is terrible from a writing standpoint because there's 0% chance of Yumeko getting killed since she's the protagonist and the story would just end if she did. Even if she were to lose the game, you already know the plot will somehow change the stakes at the end so that she would survive because the story demands it. In other words it's pointless to even have that kind of bet in the first place, because it utterly fails at creating the kind of tension which the author is looking for. That's probably the key word here: tension. Kakegurui lacks it entirely as the games always either feel predictable or unimportant. You never really have a reason to desire any particular outcome of a game without already knowing who will win. If you're going to have games where you always know who is going to win beforehand then the games themselves need to be so entertaining that you don't really care about the outcome regardless (best example of that is probably No Game No Life), but unfortunately Kakegurui doesn't have that either.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because the second problem actually lies with the games themselves. In my opinion, part of what makes a gambling anime like Kaiji so good is how many additional layers of complexity it creates throughout its games when one side starts cheating somehow and the other side tries to find a way to one-up their opponent's cheat without them noticing, then the first side does the same in return, and the chain continues. What might seem like a simple game at first ends up becoming an incredible mental game of chess with tons of variables in play, and it's super interesting to watch. But the games in Kakegurui never really do this as they always remain very simple. Whereas Kaiji can dedicate a whole season to just one extraordinary game, Kakegurui never has more than 1-2 episodes per gamble, and as a result they never have the time or opportunity to go very far beyond their basic rules. In addition, there's also the problem that since Yumeko is such a gambling addict, she isn't actually trying to outsmart her opponent very much at all, because she's actually okay with just letting fate decide the winner as she desires the thrill that comes from taking risks. In other words instead of bending the rules and completely outthinking her opponent to achieve victory, sometimes she just relies on plain luck to decide the winner in the end. The problem is nothing is ever truly random in fiction, so letting a game be decided by RNG is really cheap writing to me, because in reality it basically just means that one side arbitrarily wins because the author said so; nothing more, nothing less. It's extremely unsatisfying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some occasions where I feel like it was left annoyingly vague whether or not something was decided by luck or skill, for example there's one episode where Yumeko has to roll a pair of dice where she effectively has a 1/100 chance of winning, and of course she gets the roll she needed. Now, if this is actually nothing but fortune then that's just ridiculous writing for the aforementioned reason, but if Yumeko actually knew how to rig die rolls\u2014in other words how many times the die will roll on the ground by flicking your wrist properly to get the number you want\u2014as has been showcased in other gambling anime like Shoubushi Densetsu Tetsuya in the past, then it'd be perfectly logical that she could win that bet without any dumb luck involved. But did she? I don't know; we never get to find out. Either way, I firmly believe that luck should never be a big factor in gambling anime, because the concept of randomness doesn't really work in the same way in fiction as it does in real life, but Kakegurui doesn't seem to understand this.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the worst of all is one of the games towards the end of the anime where Yumeko is playing a customized version of Poker with someone, where whoever bets the most money gets to decide if the player with the stronger hand or the weaker hand wins when the cards are revealed. In this game both sides just keep on throwing unbelievable amounts of money onto the table until Yumeko eventually can't raise the stakes anymore and her opponent who then has the largest bet gets to pick the victory condition. This is stupid for multiple reasons: first of all they try to somehow make the game feel more hype by adding more money into the mixture, but as I've already said Yumeko doesn't care about cash so it doesn't really increase the tension for the viewers at all, and the specific size of the stakes doesn't change how the game works in practicality either, all that matters is that someone bets more than the other. And then in the end it is still a game of imperfect information, in other words the author gets to arbitrarily decide the cards in the players' hands and thus choose the winner, regardless of which victory condition was picked. Oh and did I mention that on top of the money, Yumeko also put her life on the line here again here (albeit in a different sense) so that she basically had a 100% chance of winning regardless? I was honestly shocked to see so many things done so poorly in such a short amount of time for such a simple game.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, I also think the characters don't really fit the premise of a gambling anime at all. Almost every single character in Kakegurui is seemingly a psychopath to some extent. Yumeko herself is addicted to the adrenaline rush of gambling as mentioned, but she's far from the only crazy person in this school\u2014for example there's a girl who's basically a suicidal freak who orgasms on screen from the thrill of perhaps getting killed in Russian roulette. Everyone seems to be an asshole with some sort of messed up ulterior motive for their actions, and the show seems to do everything it possibly can to help emphasize the girls' craziness with highly exaggerated close-up reaction faces, maniacal speeches and similar. Unfortunately, the mind games which gambling anime normally generates are supposed to be both quite serious and intellectual in nature, so when the girls are simultaneously getting drunk off their own insanity while playing... it's basically impossible to take the show seriously anymore. And that is why I say that you should not think of Kakegurui as a gambling anime: the emphasis is on how messed up all the girls are, not the games they play and how they do so. In other words despite the gambling premise, in reality Kakegurui is mostly an anime about crazy girls doing crazy things, plain and simple. And honestly I don't dislike the idea of crazy anime girls at all, in fact I'd say I rather like yanderes, yangires and just plain insane characters in general. Whether it's certain insane characters from Mirai Nikki, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni or Prison School we're talking about, they all have different types of craziness but I enjoyed them all (though there are certainly some insufferable cases such as Love-pon from Mayoiga too). However, in this case I just feel like they don't fit the setting of the show itself whatsoever. If the whole purpose was to show off crazy characters competing against each other for money or other bets, why even have this game-based academy premise in the first place? They could just as well have been playing football, fought each other, competed over grades or something. It's like the method of competition itself doesn't matter; only the fact that they are actually competing somehow and that there is a bet involved. Hell if all that's needed is a bet then they don't even need to participate directly; they might as well have been in the peanut gallery betting on horse racing instead and it wouldn't have made much of a difference. The only seemingly normal character in the whole anime is the male lead Suzui Ryouta, however in practice this guy adds absolutely nothing of value to the series at all as he's basically just a spectator to the gambles week in and week out. His sole purpose in the show is to be someone for Yumeko to show off to (kind of like Shoutarou in Sakurako-san), and I don't really think he can be considered a main character in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSo ultimately I can't help but find Kakegurui to be a rather unsatisfying series in general. If you're looking for a good gambling anime, there are way better alternatives. If you're looking for a good anime about crazy characters, there are *also* way better alternatives. Regardless of which side you decide to watch this anime for, it ends up feeling like something of fairly low priority either way. I guess the best way to watch Kakegurui is to just turn your brain off as they say and don't take it seriously at all. In that case the sheer stupidity of it all might be enough to transform into a sort of twisted comedy instead which you might be able to get some enjoyment value out of. Maybe if I had known about all of this from the start, that's what I would have done. I don't know. But either way, I personally found Kakegurui rather frustrating to watch more often than not, and while I don't hate the show I truly expected so much more from it than what I got, so I don't really think I can recommend it in the end.",

            "content": "If I had to describe Kakegurui in simple worlds, I would say it is an monotone anime that loops constantly with the next features: Yumeko wants to gamble + she makes crazy faces + she starts to gamble + she makes crazy faces + she somehow always knows that her opponent is cheating + she makes crazy faces + she drives her opponent crazy + she either win or lose but will surely make a crazy face = repeat\r\nTL;DR: Overall Section\r\nIts a shame that Kakegurui became so monotone and boring withing time, it had a nice potential because In my opinion was a pretty uniquesetting that I haven't seen before (I'm watching Kaiji at the moment and its pretty good so far) But leaving all that aside... What IS Kagegurui, and what it has to offer?\\n\\n\r\nThe story is way too simple to begin with, there is no depth and it is full of plot conveniences. There is a high school that allows students to gamble huge amounts of money that they get off from their asses. If one of the students lose and then, get itself into a large debt, it will become a \"pet\" or maybe an slave. When you are a pet, everyone will make crazy faces against you and will treat you like shit, also if you can't repay your debt you may be forced to have a \"life plan\" that includes marrying someone and have kids. About how is such a school possible and how the heck did the parents approve such a behavior that may end ruining the life and reputation of their children is unknown. That's pretty much what I can tell you about Kakegurui's plot, there is no world building, there isn't a significant plot that add details to the story, the main thing that this show has to offer is fanservice of Yumeko and the detailed monotone looping that I stated before. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a very interesting addition that helps the show to have that \"dark\" atmosphere that also works well with the several crazy faces that the characters constantly do. From my POV this is a plot convenience to keep the viewer hooked while they get them to drink their low-tier milk, it might taste bad depending on how hooked you are into this anime. The character designs are quite generic, some of them look all right, some of them look pretty dull and soulless, and some of them look uninteresting. On the other hand, the crazy faces are very detailed on a very disturbing way, its possibly the best feature of this anime. I admit, that I were attracted to this faces at first, but after the constantly monotone looping this show fell on, it feels pretty boring, uninteresting and even disgusting (I'm watching you, crazy finger nail girl) 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department does a decent job portraying the insane personalities of the characters while they are lost in gambling, the voice acting feels nice at first, it adds tension alongside the animation when it comes to settle a gamble, but after a while you may find better to turn off the sound... I certainly wouldn't want to hear 6 hours straight of random noises, insane noises or even a girl that mentally (and also physically) masturbates while having the most intense session of death on her mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack also fits well when it comes to add tension and the OP is fancy and catchy. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, alongside with the poor story, comes the poor characters that this show has. They are not only uninteresting, they are also 1 dimensional and will probably never develop. The male \"main character\" only serves as a plot device to describe what the gambles are about, otherwise his presence wouldn't even matter. Yumeko's role (*cough cough* plot armor *cough cough*) is basically breaking the mind of her opponents while doing crazy faces. Aside of the main duo and the insane suicide girl that has mental boners each time she has a \"chance\" to kill herself, there is nothing else from the character cast that is interesting or meaningful. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, as for enjoyment, if you like to see some crazy faces and bitches getting owned for 12 episodes, you will probably like this show. Otherwise you will probably find it boring and repetitive 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10: Crazy faces, monotone and looping story line, uninteresting characters, plot holes, plot devices, plot conveniences, plot armors, 1 dimensional characters for a premise that could have worked better if there were an actual sense of danger from the gambles and a proper development and buildup for the characters.",

            "content": "FIRST REVIEW: Read at your own risk\r\nKakegurui, or Compulsive Gambler, is an anime about the effects of gambling. Adrenaline, excitement and many other feelings are what we should apparently feel while we play for money and for even more important things, according to this anime. However, this one absolutely fails to deliver these emotions to its viewers due to its numerous flaws and its terrible execution.\r\nOne of the main problems resides in the setting in which the story takes place. What do we really know about it? Students are gambling in a school to be ready to enter the real world, described as a terribleplace made of money as well as ambitious, greedy and selfish people. Yeah, interesting, but how does it work? People will tell you: \u201cUh, they gamble a lot of money, and when they have no money left, they become \u201cpets\u201d, which means they have to do what other students tell them to do. Their future even gets planned by the council student when they are really dried up! Talking about it, the council student is reserved to the elite, its members are la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of this school, that\u2019s why they can decide on everything.\u201d I don\u2019t mind having a surrealistic setting, if it has a purpose and it is well established. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. Everything, I mean, EVERYTHING is exaggerated: the sum of money the students are able to gamble, their reactions, their faces, and so on. The only goal it has, and, honestly, it is a goal the anime isn\u2019t even able to achieve due to an important issue I will mention in the next paragraph, is to \u201cshock\u201d the viewer, such as jump scares in horror movies. It tries to make him care for what\u2019s happening on the screen, to enforce him to feel what the characters are supposedly feeling themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIt fails because the setting lacks of consistency. Indeed, watching Kakegurui is the same as watching only the action scenes from an action movie, what happens before and after the games is not exhibited. Then, how are we supposed to empathize with the characters if we don\u2019t know what are the real consequences of their gambles? Here\u2019s the main problem of the anime: there\u2019s no information about the outside world, apart from the \u201cpet\u201d and \u201cplanned life\u201d system. The show doesn\u2019t answer an enormous quantity of questions, and there\u2019s particularly one that would have been great to answer: What are the consequences? Apparently, you can lose tons of money and then win it back. It seems that, eventually, these gambles don\u2019t really matter. This prevented me to get into the anime and to enjoy it, because I couldn\u2019t feel what it wanted me to feel at first: the power of gambling. The only episodes I was partially able to enjoy were those in which the students wager something else (I won\u2019t tell what it is to avoid spoilers), since the consequences of the \u201cgame\u201d were straight. However, these episodes heavily rely on shock factor, and that\u2019s why I won\u2019t praise them as well.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, this lack of concern I had for the show is also a result of the terrible characters it offers. Even Kirito from Sword Art Online is less generic than the male MC, Suzui Ryouta, whose only purpose is to introduce our dear Jabami Yumeko, the female lead, (obviously one-sided, as expected) who is here to turn on the traditional otaku. Don\u2019t expect any development, her only character trait (except she is smart) is that she gets excited (sexually) while gambling. What? They all are excited by gambling? NEXT! There\u2019s another main female that no one cares about: Saotome Meari, who is nearly as useless as Suzui. She is \u201cJabami number two\u201d, their only difference (except the hair color and breast size, lol) is that she is selfish and greedy, while Jabami is \u201cexemplar\u201d. Shade doesn\u2019t belong to this world as well.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, some supporting characters get more development than the main ones. We learn a little bit about their past and their motivations, which makes the show a bit more enjoyable when Jabami encounters them. However, the supporting cast still is strongly unidimensional and is not particularly interesting. I won\u2019t even tell you how omnipresent fanservice is and how much the characters serve it. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s give credit where credit is due. The OP is catchy, the ED is\u2026 uh\u2026 cancel that, let\u2019s assume it doesn\u2019t exist, the music and the voice acting are somehow fine, as well as the art and animation, even if their purpose is to exaggerate everything. Some of the games are engaging, despite the lack of characterization and worldbuilding. \\n\\n\r\nTo make it short, Kakegurui is your typical bad seasonal anime. Overdose of fanservice, lack of characterization, terrible worldbuilding, but decent music and visuals. Although this show was the most popular of summer 2017, it won\u2019t be remembered for a long time before disappearing in the pile of mediocrity which is delivered to the anime community each season. You should rather gamble in real life to feel adrenaline, it is certainly more entertaining and rewarding than watching this anime. By contrast, don\u2019t expect too much of it, because there probably won\u2019t be a hot girl touching herself in front of you in the real world.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Be careful, gambling can lead to debt, dependence, and so on. :)\\n",

It irrefutably portrayed gambling in an idiosyncratic way which deserves utmost acknowledgement. More than a gambling anime ( an attempt to make gambling look sexual which did hit the mark ), kakegurui is a psychological thriller with characters rare to be found. These living looming shadows of madness exhibiting eccentric behavior and visually stunning nuanced expressions, consented to bet their own lives as a proof for their solemnity towards a mere gamble fills the entirety of the show and holds the audience even more spellbound withits characters based riveting plot. And yes it's an absolute visual feast with compelling dialogues and hypnotic voice acting. Highly recommended as a peculiar yet distinctive \"game\" anime.",

            "content": "Kakegurui follows themes for sure, but does it fit those themes well? Well ehh, no, not really, but is it a damn fun experience? It is subjective but god yes, I was never left un-entertained watching this anime. \r\nIt follows the premise as being a gambling anime but is not really that as there is never really any stakes, and always seems to find a safe way to do things. The more you watch the show you get a grasp of how it does things, and it becomes very predictable, you usually are always aware of the outcome, but how you get there, pushes youto watch more and find out. The gambling games presented in the show are very exciting and unique and seeing how they are played out is very entertaining, however the stakes always stay the same no matter what they seem to put on the line.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is beautiful, there are many scenes that look pretty good but mainly the characters are something that catch your eye. The girls are all very pretty in their design and the facial expressions are what really makes Kakegurui, Kakegurui. The faces are so unique and exaggerated and convey such a strong feeling of emotion, it's just so thrilling to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the show is marvellous, the OP to the general soundtrack. The songs in the show are of a jazzy feel and are usually exciting and fast paced but still have a feeling of dread in them. The intro is very catchy and the sound effects used throughout the show are very powerful and add a strong sense of feeling to each scene. The voice acting in the show is also wonderful to listen to and adds so much to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is presented in a very colourful and exhilarating way, making everything seem so much more exciting and fun to watch than it really is. The feeling put into each scene with the art, the music, the sounds, the voice work, it's all so powerful. Although the show is very entertaining to watch I cant stress enough that it is rather predictable and that makes it feel less intense. I feel that the show would highly benefit by taking risks and being more brutal, having gore or real stakes on the line, but it takes a safe route so that all of the characters you love can stay healthy and happy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is a joyful experience but is lacking real consequence which makes everything predictable and feel less strong, although the show really artificially pushes those feelings in with its spectacular art and sound work. I recommend it as an exciting game show with wonderful art and many a waifu to pick as your favourite, but not as an actual 'gambling' anime or something with any kind of risk.",

            "content": "At first glance Kakegurui is an anime about a high school for rich students where they gain and lose status by gambling, and you can watch it as such, as the matches are intelligent and exciting. But it is quite obviously a satire, social criticism, about roles people get forced into, in working life, through gender roles etc., about oppression, humiliation, ostracism, psychological, physical and sexual abuse and, of course, money and power, tose who are born with them, those who cheat to gain them, those who gain them with pure recklessness and maliciousness, those who abuse them.\r\nYou might probably have guessed by now, thisanime is not for the faint-hearted, there are a few cruel scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI seriously hope nobody gets all infuriated feeling the setting/premise is too unrealistic and implausible, just as with Gulliver's Travels (also a satire on human nature and society, well, the book at least) taking it too literal is not the point here. For once, the almighty Student Council is actually justified, as it is symbolic/figurative.\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad, Kakegurui's got a real female main protagonist, at first I thought the male protagonist would be the main, as with those anime with one or more female protagonists who advance the story, but a male narrator/main protagonist (e.g. Haruhi Suzumiya).\\n\\n\r\nFrom my point of view this series doesn't have any major shortcomings, I enjoyed it very much, the story is smart, most characters are interesting and you get to understand their motivations and thought processes very well. Characters tend to be a little one-dimensional, but that's a given in a satire. Music, voice acting and art is very good, too, and most importantly, very fitting reagrding the story and its mood.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might have noticed there is a second season to be expected, thus you shouldn't expect an ending that ties up all loose ends, but it gets close enough. Definitely no cliffhanger in the middle of a game or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Kakegurui to anyone who likes dark, shrewd, twisted, satirical stories, with characters that are even more twisted.\\n\\n",

I deliberately say 'weeb' because of the type of fake \"dominant\" women and weak \"feminist\" males who were the heroes of the series. They were trying to support these heroes with the illusion of them being smarter than the highly respected first-class business-world players they are to be taking life lessons for, but being an ex-poker league player- the scenarios were poorly conceived: mainly focusing on there being a \"clever\" cheat to be discovered and photographic memory, instead of actual intellectual gambling strategy which would have made each episodic scenario much more fascinating. There waslittle character development of the main characters, instead a repeat of the same episodic structure over and over swapping out different antagonists and game types. The inevitable loss of each egotistical antagonist became boring, especially since their never ending spoilt money pool made the risk so small and the idea that they would have their VIP lives planned for by mere students laughable, and I become desperate for either a) the main hero to get ****ed on in order to go through a much needed character arc; or b) for us to stop being so weak with the fan service and just get around to ****ing on the card table already so we can at least thinly praise it for being well animated hentai.

You don't come to this anime for things to make sense, you don't come to this anime expecting down to earth, realistic gambling matches. \r\nNo.\r\nYou come to this anime to witness a spectacle. To watch sexy women play mind games with one another in a school that makes zero sense, yet draws you in all the same with its complete and utter insanity. Mix in some strong sexual overtones, fantastic animation, and some of the craziest facial expressions you'll see anywhere and you'll have one good time.\r\nI'm not here to criticizing the finerdetails of gambling in this show. That has been done to death by people with different preferences. Nor am I here to criticize the series main protagonist Yumiko Jabami. She is a catalyst protagonist. She does not need complex motivations, a rich backstory, or any of that nonsense to tell the tale that this anime wishes to tell. She is a compulsive gambler. She does it for the fun of it. The title of this anime tells you everything you need to know. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't about how she grows and changes. This is an anime about how she affects and forces change around her. She is a veritable force of nature, and too often do these types of protagonists get confused for the result of weak writing. She is perfectly suited for this story. Insane and sexy all rolled up into one package.\\n\\n\r\nA perfect descriptor for this entire show actually. Insane and sexy.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking for some grounded show that approaches gambling realistically, then look elsewhere. Go watch Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you are looking for a heavily stylized, off the wall, shounen battle story dressed in the guise of a gambling anime... - If you are looking for a well animated spectacle with sexy women playing mind games with one another, then grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy. You'll not find another anime like this anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nJust try not to get too swept up in Yumiko's utterly infectious passion for gambling.",

            "content": "** There are no \"spoilers\", but there is a quirky art description that could rob you some of the experience, be advised **\r\n                   Finally a review that is going to be tricky to put into words so bare with me.  I binged this show in one night.  I had to finish it once I \r\n started it, as I knew I would never return to it ifI stopped in the middle.   The final effect after seeing the whole show has this bizarre charm about it, making the show almost hypnotic and mystical.    On the other side of the coin I found viewing it to be a repulsive experience.  The five point rating system rolls the dice out to a 6.4,  that rounds down to a simple 6. \\n\\n\\n\r\n              The synopsis covers the story of the show.  A female protagonist with a seemingly OP gambling prowess causing a ripple in a school environment rich in a culture of chance takers.  Kakegurui is not quite an underdog story and not quite a sports anime.  I would label it a high stakes slice of life drama.  Events in the show just happen,  and there is never a definitive predictable plot line.   A very come what may type direction,  and it works very well.  I loved how it all revolves around how the character's respond to the results of their choices,  and not the results or choices themselves.  A very enjoyable focus for a gambling anime. \\n\\n\r\n                   Now for the killer,  THE ART, [2/10]      I'm sure this art style was carefully chosen for a reason, but I can't think of what that reason would be.   All the characters in this show constantly are making some sort of \"meme troll\" face that you would expect a demon that is touching children to make.   You could call it the \"I am a fat bad guy about to sexually assault this girl\"  type anime face.  Every main and first tier support characters wore these expressions almost countless times. Constantly setting up flags that all persons involved in this show are evil or gross. That art style might have been chosen to sell some sort of depravity to the activities of gambling, or the over all wickedness of this world,  I do not know.   All I know is that I did not find it attractive or fitting.  Kakegurui while good,  is not visually pleasing,  and this really put a hurt on the over all score for me.  \\n\\n\r\n                  No issues with the soundtrack,   the voice actors and musical scores chosen were very excellent. The acting really brought the show to life.  All the characters and their expressions were always audibly believable.   The art work for those emotions were way out of any kind of sane standard,  but the commitment of the actors involved balances it back and makes the entire show work. \\n\\n\r\n               Kakegurui is an environment constantly stress testing the characters of that world.  Pulling on the human psyche in multiple and extreme ways.   Some of the characters are broken,  some are teetering,  and others are the ones doing the breaking, and all for the thrill of it.  While finding it hard to relate to any of them on a personal level,  I still appreciated the human concepts the characters of Kakegurui brought before me.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n             While I did not find anything good to say about the art of this show,  I still enjoyed watching it.   I almost feel bad for these fictional characters over of the lost potential from not being presented in a more attractive light.  Hey, sometimes things gotta be ugly.  While I did NOT appreciate that aspect of the show,  I didn't let it ruin it for me completely.  \\n\r\nIf you are ever bored and wanting a unique experience,  maybe give Kakegurui a watch.    HOWEVER,  Grizzziff Kingsbeard is gonna fold his hand with an overall [6/10].",

            "content": "Kakegurui is an anime with a simple, average plot we've seen quite a few times, with a theme of Gambling!School going on, rather typical execution of the said plot and with few to no actual surprises, and a whole lot of absolutely bat*hit insane characters who coincidentally make the supreme reason why this anime is worth the watch. I'm sure we have all seen countless shitty plots in which school X is special because of the Y and that's where it ends, while the romance/harem/shounen plot goes on between empty, boring, BORING characters.\r\nLuckily for us, Kakegurui knows where its strong pints lie and makes roomfor cool games and insane bets (or was it the other way around?). While not the masterpiece of anything, really, Kakegurui manages to be both interesting with the truly cruel and engaging concept of gambling as presented in the anime and hilarious with it's questionably clinically insane characters, way too detailed animation and way too invested voice acting - all paying off as the quality over-the-top experience. \\n\\n\r\nIt is very easy to invest yourself in it, enjoy it all to the max and yet realize it is truly not all that great - in a way, it's what makes it so good.  It's not trying to be the master of an art but is rather a jack-of-all-trades, using an old concept and working on everything around the old concept to bring a bit different, enjoyable experience to the table.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI like to gamble now and again.\r\n\u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em\u201d is my card game of choice because I grew up playing it and watching it. And I\u2019ll throw in ten dollars or so to get some easy picks for the mega lotteries if they get high enough to make it worth the risk. I don\u2019t always win of course, but part of the fun comes from that thrill. The maybe-it-will-happen ideology and the there\u2019s-always-a-chance buildup.\r\nKakegurui takes this thrill-of-the-gamble concept to the absolute extreme, gambling with some of its own decisions that earn more wins than losses.\r\nSTORY\r\nAschool structured around a gambling system where bets consist of millions of yen and the students most in debt become slaves with no rights. Most wouldn\u2019t enter such a backwards place. Yumeko Jabami, however, is not like most people.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all the info required to setup Kakegurui. For, as this info hints at, the content contained in this anime has two goals in mind: gambling and absurdity. The former is easy to understand: students take part in games that revolve around gambling in some fashion. A variant of rock-paper-scissors, memorization, forced deception. The latter must be seen to be believed: the ridiculously ridiculous becomes the norm. Threats of rape and potential accidental suicide turn these games from simple bouts of fun into life-altering scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, this anime is neither for the squeamish nor the sensitive. That\u2019s even after the audience realizes that Yumeko will somehow come out victorious regardless of the absurdity (because there wouldn\u2019t be a story to tell otherwise). As a result, the narrative does succumb to a repetitive format: Yumeko is challenged to a game of some kind, she starts to lose badly, she turns her luck around completely, and then she moves on to the next cycle.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui somewhat pigeonholes itself into this structure. While the show does explain the different games and their rules, it ultimately needs to showcase them in action for their full effect and their construction to take hold. Indeed, if Yumeko succeeded immediately, the buildup beforehand would be for nothing. So, to provide the full extent of each played game \u2013 showcasing the opponent as a big meanie head, letting the game itself do the talking, and highlighting Yumeko\u2019s comeback \u2013 she almost always loses first before she wins as a massive payoff.\\n\\n\r\nThis repetition does not do the show any favors, but it does achieve an important part of its direction regardless: tension. At the end of the day, Kakegurui wishes to entertain its audience not with complex themes or incredible plot points but rather with several instances of the baddies being put in their rightful place.\\n\\n\r\nAn argument reinforced by the fact that these games often do not strictly follow gambling in the probabilistic sense. Instead, the various villains rig these matches in their favor with biased helpers, special marks, and magnetic grips. They attempt to cheat their way to a win. And so, when Yumeko inevitably crushes her opponents through wit, skill, and power, the positive outcome tastes all the sweeter.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the higher focus on the absurdity and the tension, the anime does try to infuse a semi-relevant subplot with Kirari and her behind-the-scenes machinations. Unfortunately, these events are never fully realized, so their inclusion is less an intriguing aside and more of a small distraction to the chips already in the pot.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Kakegurui tends to toss aside a lot of its characters once their moment in the spotlight concludes. Not mainstays like Mary and Itsuki, but sides like Nanami, Yuriko, Midari, and Yumemi either do not contribute much past their prime or oddly disappear altogether.\\n\\n\r\nThese narrative troubles aside, the games and their ridiculousness allow the story to capitalize on entertainment first and foremost. And because the anime keeps this approach intact for all twelve episodes, it remains consistent in its purpose as well.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nFor Kakegurui, its visuals pride themselves most on the reactions that Yumeko and the other gamblers so regularly embrace.\\n\\n\r\nOrgasmic explosions, derisive stares, manic expressions, shocked looks, frightening faces. A set of glowing eyes here and a wagging tongue there give them an extra helping of craziness, too. No matter what their reaction may be, though, these over-the-top depictions push the characters\u2019 physical emotions to the absolute limit, coinciding with the show\u2019s extreme tendencies in its actual content.\\n\\n\r\nSuch reactions are vital to the show because said content, at its core, isn\u2019t the most involved. The games they play usually only entail them sitting at a table, flipping cards, or pushing chips around. So, to offset their inherently lackluster actions, Kakegurui relies on this insanity, achieving the desired effect of making these games much more fun to watch unfold as the audience awaits that next wacky reaction.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these reactions, the anime also puts a lot of care into the designs of its characters. Yumeko and Mary are attractive ladies who introduce yet another facet to follow on-screen, and Ryouta\u2019s extreme normalcy blends him into the background where he wishes to belong. On the opposite end, the menacing student council seem like final bosses. Their masks, hoodies, stars, glasses, piercings, and ribbons create distinct, intimidating looks for the lot that reflect their status within the school without any trouble.\\n\\n\r\nThe coolest detail, though, comes from their regular school outfits. Their black-and-red coloring coincides with the same color scheme of a common casino roulette wheel and table layout. Such colors not only tie the designs back to the gambling motif but also subconsciously keep the premise on the minds of the audience as the characters go about placing bets and reacting away.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the rest of Kakegurui\u2019s visuals, they do not impress as much as the reactions and the designs, but they remain in good standing regardless. Detailed lips and CG hands provide movement when necessary. Cool camera cuts and operations also add dynamism to the many games showcased.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting itself does leave much to be desired, but, when everything else within the art and the animation covers what it can already, this missing element barely impacts the engaging presentation on display.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFor Kakegurui\u2019s cast members, showmanship matters most.\\n\\n\r\nRemember, this anime is built around ridiculousness. So, in keeping in line with this idea, the anime highlights the eccentricity and the quirkiness of the different people that Yumeko squares off against in the gambles at hand. Someone like Yumemi is a cutesy, flirty idol on the surface but a complete dirtbag when the cameras stop rolling. Similarly, Midari not only isn\u2019t afraid to walk around with a loaded gun but also proves, in flashback fashion, her unbelievable masochistic tendencies.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say that Yumeko\u2019s enemies don\u2019t have more going for them. For instance, Itsuki was little more than the daughter of a father who owned a prolific toy-and-playing-card company. She also happened to collect the fingernails of the victims she defeated. However, later in the series, the show shows her holding a relationship with Kaede due to their likeminded goals, and she turns her ambition into something tangible as well, ditching her own fingernails as a neat (albeit grotesque) progression to her character arc.\\n\\n\r\nItsuki and the other characters encounter change of this nature thanks to Yumeko (either directly or indirectly). One by one, she dismantles their personas, forcing them to look inward on themselves. They contemplate their drive and their desires as she manipulates them with nothing besides smarter tactics. For some, she breaks completely. For others, she befriends them mostly. No matter the case, her arrival marks for a turning point in the school and its direction.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps not so surprisingly, Yumeko herself is the most insane of them all. Indeed, she sort of must be given the environment and the undeniable influence she exerts on those she crosses. She\u2019s the most insane for a single reason: she only cares about the gamble.\\n\\n\r\nMoney. Status. Livelihood. Even just winning and losing do not enter her thoughts. Seriously, all she strives for is that insatiable rush. The druglike feeling as probability and luck dictate fate. As she puts it in episode nine, \u201cThe absurdity of being helpless to do anything of your own will. That right there is the essence of gambling, after all.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile Yumeko revels in chance, the characters around her sometimes ponder her mysterious arrival and her purpose for being here. Surely, there must be some other need, an ulterior motive for enrolling beyond gambling. Unfortunately, the anime never truly delves into it. Very small backstory items are alluded to, and she seems to have a fixation on going up against Kirari, the mastermind at the head of the student council. But her past sadly remains unexplored, leaving her character as the epitome of the showmanship that laces throughout this entire set of characters.\\n\\n\r\nWell, almost the entire set, for one character neither wishes nor wants to take part in any of the nearby ridiculousness: Ryouta. His presence in the anime hardly rises above mere existence since he almost never takes part in any of the gambles personally. Sometimes, he even disappears for large stretches of (episode) time. As such, he represents the audience\u2019s lens with which to view Kakegurui as his normal, everyday self contrasts against the strange people and the odd games that take center stage.\\n\\n\r\nRyouta also serves another important role. To Yumeko, he is the only constant chip on the table. His kindness, honesty, and innocence make him someone that she can trust with all her heart, giving their relationship a playful and supportive edge. He worries about her during every risk she takes, and she in turn relies on him for some minor-to-major moments that get him out of his comfort zone.\\n\\n\r\nComfortable or not, the anime clearly emphasizes its characters\u2019 aptitude for showmanship over their individual importance on a writing level. However, when the story also focuses on a similar direction, they find themselves not needing to do or be much else anyway.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui does not let its music and its sound go to waste.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track \u201cDeal with the devil\u201d has this energized tone that primes the audience for the games to come while also reveling in the mystique that Yumeko delivers. Dancing piano keys, a step-wise saxophone, and the distinct noise of a police radio at the beginning twist the song with erratic noises that also give its energy more of a frantic feel, following the tension contained in most of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, a groovy bassline and a prominent jazz band then add in a classy vibe that matches the anime\u2019s own upscale premise. And the playful vocals throughout the piece bring on a last layer of charm to keep the song coasting along. A fun, catchy, and fitting OP, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the OP catches the audience\u2019s attention with its energy, the ending track \u201cLAYon-theLINE\u201d instead celebrates Yumeko in all her glory. The futuristic sounds that weave into and out of the song almost argue for Yumeko herself being the \u201cfuture\u201d. Multiple vocalists and the slight orchestral instrumentation raise the grandeur and the scale of the music, increasing her importance. And the six-time lyrical rhyme as the closer signs off this track in poetic fashion for this equally poetic lady.\\n\\n\r\nThis ED makes for a wonderful addition to the sound work in the show as well, and Saori Hayami as Yumeko Jabami likewise does the same with her voice acting as the star gambler. Easily flipping between cute and psychotic, excited and arrogant, Ms. Hayami demonstrates once again why she is a household name at this point (for anime fans at any rate).\\n\\n\r\nEven the rest of the original soundtrack puts its money where its mouth is. While it does have the rarer slice-of-life tune, the music shines best when it channels the tension that runs rampant throughout the gambles. Blaring saxophone notes, wild piano keys, grating violin strings. These sounds slam the different scenes in Kakegurui with a horror-esque mood that aligns both with the creepy craziness and the Vegas vibe of the events therein.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of the punchy sound-effects when revealing cards and the drowned-out noises when dread kicks in, the audio design for Kakegurui arguably stands as the show\u2019s strongest collective offering.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun with this anime. For me, this joy comes from three factors: some of the characters, the nature of the content, and those games played.\\n\\n\r\nOn the characters, I couldn\u2019t not like Yumeko. Her moe and insane moments were simply a treat to watch. She didn\u2019t carry the entire anime by her lonesome, but she certainly proved why she is the star. Mary was cool, too, if only because she moved away from acting like a stuck-up jerk and towards being a friend of Yumeko herself.\\n\\n\r\nOn the nature of the content, watching the enemy lose almost always made for a cathartic experience. I knew that Yumeko\u2019s unnatural calms would soon give way to yet another glorious beatdown, turning the anime into a jackpot of evil people receiving their comeuppance. Something that I for sure approve.\\n\\n\r\nOn the games, I liked how they relied mostly on who could be cleverer. Sure, a couple of the exchanges were perhaps overly silly or maybe required too much of an explanation. But, seeing them seeped in tactics and manipulation (especially from Yumeko), these gambles turned into mind battles that were more interesting than a regular contest.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot say I adore everything in the anime. I do wish that Kirari was around more because her allure and her supposed excellence seemed too intriguing to pass up as much as the show did. It also would have been nice if the content went outside of the Yumeko-versus-opponent structure, letting her sit out on occasion to create new scenarios. And the games that involved money rather than some other commodity up for grabs (e.g., threats, life itself) lacked the same gravitas because, realistically speaking, money didn\u2019t really matter in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, specific characters, the content\u2019s nature, and all those clever gambles made for quite the enjoyable time. With the knowledge that a second season is also arriving sometime soon, this series may very well become a compulsive habit.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui reveals its hand with a ton of confidence. An entertaining set of story beats and individual characters create a weird yet inviting tale that does not let up for its full run. While these elements have small problems, the art and the music have next to zero, supporting the project through audiovisual awesomeness. Altogether, perhaps not the easiest bet to make in the world, but it\u2019s worth the risk all the same.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, gambling and absurdity reign supreme even as narrative integrity does not\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, over-the-top reactions, cool character designs, and other stylistic choices for the visuals keep the artistry extra engaging\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Yumeko manipulates everyone around her as they focus on showmanship, and Ryouta contrasts with the everyday craziness\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, an energized OP, a celebratory ED, strong VA performances, and a creepy OST land on triple sevens at the audio slot machine\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Yumeko, catharsis, and mind battles swirl together as lots of undeniable fun\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Kakegurui, which everyone seems to like to compare to Kaiji since it is also a gambling show, is an inferior representation of the genre, in that regard. The entire series is a smashing success thanks to Saori Hayami\u2019s voice. Not joking, her amazing, crazily erotic voice is what makes this show as entertaining than the typical knife brandishing psycho show. Though I did enjoy School Days. The ludicrous, over-the-top edgelord type of stuff would be written off as another Deadman Wonderland if it weren\u2019t for her voice \u2026 wait, people actually liked that show, didn\u2019t they?\r\n\t\u2022 So, I guess it\u2019s a smart marketing move! Thestory starts with the most generic of generic protags that serves as a voice of reason among a sea of crazy gamblers. He befriends Yumeko (Saori\u2019s character) that happens to be an insane, gambling addict with good luck. The show can\u2019t really go very many places, when there is no real tactic to Yumeko winning, since she doesn\u2019t cheat like LITERALLY every other character. So, I guess the thrill lies in the fact that she might lose? Even though, as a viewer, you know that a protagonist rarely loses in a death gamble.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 She\u2019s an intellectual crazy and discovers the advanced cheating techniques of the other participants and uses those to outsmarts them, but it gets dry when the same thing happens in every single battle between her and a member of the student council and in all actuality, if the student council is so crafty and wealthy, they should be able to defeat her unfairly every time. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Why would a monarchy cave to a transfer student? Who knows! I mean, it is an anime, but it\u2019s not very believable from a critical, adult stance. I don\u2019t like anime series that expect you to believe ridiculous things, without establishes extra-dimensional world lines, and encourages the viewer to shrug it off as \u201canime logic.\u201d That\u2019s why so many people don\u2019t take Japanese cartoons seriously! The music and production values are outstanding. Studio MAPPA has been shown to make good-looking shows, but looks aren\u2019t all that matter. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 If you want to hear Saori Hayami literally having an orgasm over gambling, then you should FOR SURE watch this show, but if you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s original, makes sense, and is not episodic, then this probably isn\u2019t the series for you. Oh, and there\u2019s a terribly contrived anime-original ending. I give Kakegurui a 4/10.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free!~ \r\nKakegurui is the kind of anime you start on a whim and continue for only one reason. Amusement. \r\nI'm not saying that's a bad thing though, in fact, I enjoyed this anime a ton and if a second season were to come out I'd definitely watch that too. I'd suggest this anime to anyone who enjoys character based anime that revolve less around a plot and more around characters. I'd also suggest it to people who enjoy overdramatic scenes and high school anime with a twist. \r\nNow to go over each aspect...\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is where this anime really lacked. It began with thehints of a plot but in the end stuck to over dramatic scenes and showdowns every episode. That said an anime doesn't need to have a perfect plot to be fun to watch. The story wasn't good or bad, it just wasn't there. You could say the relationships the characters made was their story but even then it's a stretch. If you only watch anime for a good story this anime is not for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis anime's art style was enjoyable, to say the least. With producers like MAPPA who's more current anime have had art that's won awards (Best Animation of YoI in the Anime Awards) and very few anime that run short of eye candy. The character designs were interesting and not one character (besides the male MC) seemed to look boring. Besides character design the animation was smooth and the art was fun. The only downsides to the art were the unnecessary ecchi scenes and almost mediocre designs. Although I have nothing to complain about towards the art I also can't say it took my breath away. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell recorded, clear and fun. The voice actors were not boring and played their characters well. The sound was not muffled or distorted and the volume never felt like it was unbearable or blowing out your eardrum. Background music was fine but nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nThe characters were fun and quirky. Personally, I think the characters are the only reason the show can be rated above a five. The cast is colorful and the interactions between characters is really what makes the show. The only downside is that no characters really get much personality or dimension and several characters are used as stepping stones for the gain of characterization of other characters. Overall the characters really make this anime worth a watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed this anime. It didn't have much meat to the story but the characters and setting made it fun to watch. It's as simple as the interactions between the characters that made this anime fun for me and the premise of gambling brought in an unexplored topic in the world of anime. It was a creative anime that I'd suggest to people who can ignore a lacking plot and unneeded ecchi to enjoy fun characters and interesting dynamics.",

When I started to watch it, I didn't thought that the story, the art, etc would fit in so well as it did in the manga.\r\nThe story is really interesting, the way everything is put up together is simply amazing. Jabami, aparently naive and shy, turns out to be a 'psycho' girl who loves to gamble and enjoy it risking, many times, her own life. She give a new meaning to the word 'courage'.\r\nAs for the art, besides being slightly worse than the manga, isgood and reaches perfection mixed with the sound and the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI'm happy to say that I enjoyed very much watching this anime. I wish they would make a second season, to be honest, but I think the ending, not fateful to the manga, made a good end to the anime itself. I would recommend it to everyone who likes drama, psychological and games.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 9",

            "content": "Please note this review assumes that you have already finished watching Kakegurui and though care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may be spoilers within character analysis.  \r\nWhat happens when a gambling addict manages to get into a special academy that instead of teaching you languages and maths instead teaches you how to gamble and read people and decides to win her way to the top of the school by challenging each and every member of the student council.   \r\nBased off the manga of the same name Kakegurui is a school based anime that also feature elements of mysteryand psychological genre\u2019s. The main premise of the series is that of this specific academy\u2019s rather unique curriculum which rather than teaching you languages or social skills instead focuses on gambling and how to read people. By using the skills that you learn from these lessons you will be able to read people and allow you to outsmart your opponents and win big. Perhaps more than anywhere winning in this school counts more than anything as winning brings you money, prestige and allow you to ascend the ranks of the school hierarchy and maybe even gain entrance into the student council the most powerful students in the school.  \\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot of this series follows the life of Yumeko Jabami a transfer student that joins the strict but well known Hyakkaou Academy in the beginning of the series and in the process, turn the whole academy around with her amazing gambling skills and her unique take on what gambling is. The main themes that this anime has is gambling and its nature and the two-faced nature of people that gets revealed when they get pushed into a corner. \\n\\n\r\nYumeko \\n\\n\r\nYumeko Jabami voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and Yamada Kun and the Seven Witches fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the show. A teenage girl and a freshman that at the beginning of the series joins the school as a freshman. Personality wise Yumeko is a kind, polite and well-mannered person that as a result of having little ego or pride in her personality is able to bond and make friends easily with her classmates which is helped greatly by the fact that she cares about each of her friends and allies deeply even though it would have been better to leave them which shows how kind of a person Yumeko actually is. Notably Yumeko is someone that can be rather persistent in trying to make friends with others with the best example of this being her friendship with Meari.  In Yumeko\u2019s base personality its noted that even when pressed and abused by others Yumeko is someone that does not get angry at all and instead seems to prefer being submissive a trait that more than once scares her would be bullies away. Like every other character that appears on the show and in line with the shows main theme of two faced personalities Yumeko also has a different side to her personality that reveals itself when she\u2019s gambling. In this new side to her personality that I like to call the ecstatic Yumeko on account of ecstasy that she loves to enter Yumeko\u2019s personality changes quite a bit though she still retains her base personality traits. In this new personality of hers Yumeko becomes very serious but also very perceptive and cunning that shows that she is completely focused in the game that she has found herself to be in. It\u2019s important to note that while Yumeko in this state can be rather rash with her decisions that each and every one is made when Yumeko is in a calm mindset which often clashes to what we see in the matches themselves. In this state, we can clearly see a glimpse of what Yumeko\u2019s true personality and what she see\u2019s gambling as which in this case means that she see\u2019s gambling as a contest where you put everything on the table and use all of your skill and intelligence to out think your opponents and in doing so attain the ultimate victory of destroying your enemy utterly and totally. As a result of this Yumeko is someone that hates people that doesn\u2019t take this sacred tenant of gambling seriously and instead tries to cheat their way through it. \\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent trait of Yumeko\u2019s is undoubtedly her skill at determining how each game type that her opponent uses works and using this to turn the tables on them and beat them using their own method. This trait of hers is often married with Yumeko\u2019s alternate personality when she demands her opponent to get serious by betting what is most dear to them. Seeing Yumeko demolish her opponents by using their own advantages against them in a game that was designed to let them win overwhelmingly really was satisfying to see. As a character, I thought that Yumeko was an interesting one that showed that despite the odds arrayed against you and despite the fact that the enemy cheats to get an advantage against you that calmness, perception and skill and a little luck can still enable you to turn the tables around and allow you to attain a surprising victory against all odds. Saori Hayami I felt really did a fantastic job here in a role that is very unlike the ones that I usually see her in. It\u2019s nice that Saori is starting to try her hand in roles that until now are unknown to her and I hope that she continues to surprise us with her skill and talent. \\n\\n\r\nMeari \\n\\n\r\nMeari voiced by veteran seiyuu Minami Tanaka of Schwarzesmarken fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yumeko\u2019s main allies though this is something that she is loath to admit. A fellow student of Yumeko\u2019s that also belongs in the same class as her Meari in her initial appearance was a manipulative, cruel and possessive person that seemed to have the hallmarks of being the queen bee of the class. In the beginning Meari\u2019s most prominent traits was her overconfidence and her prideful nature which ensured that she had almost no actual friends within the class only lackeys that obeyed her because of the power and prestige that she had. In the beginning of the series Meari served as Yumeko\u2019s first serious opponent and rival and their match showed just what things were like in this unique academy that both of them are in. After Meari\u2019s humbling by Yumeko as a result of her defeat Meari\u2019s personality changes significantly as the series progresses. Now no longer wielding the absolute power that she had wielded in the past Meari finds herself isolated and lonely and having to deal with the realization that she herself was now a normal person without power essentially a mike. However rather than giving into despair and hopelessness that many people would do in a situation like this Meari instead learns to become humble once more and also becomes more understanding of others. Despite having lost to Yumeko Meari though still disliking her becomes a reluctant ally to Yumeko and her plans and brings to the table a number of skills that she used in the past notably her intelligence, perception and skill at reading people. The fact that Yumeko and Meari actually become friends despite still hating each other I thought was an interesting move and reflected the fact that in this unique setting having one more ally is better than having one more enemy. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on it can be seen that Meari also developed personality traits that both define her and also show what her true personality is like. The first of these is Meari\u2019s determination to live her own life that she wants it without worrying about what people think and say about her which I thought was admirable given the setting. The second trait which ties in with the first is that Meari is someone that doesn\u2019t like being controlled by others which highlights her independent nature and moreover she dislikes being looked down upon and being underestimated by others which ensures that she will always be the one that will oppose the power and authority of the school\u2019s student council. As a character, I felt that Meari was a rather interesting girl that showed some really good character growth and development as the series went on. While the queen bee in the beginning of the series her subsequent defeat and reversal of her position within the school and her subsequent development in personality as she clawed her way back up was something that I was impressed with. In terms of character I also felt that Meari served as a good contrast with Yumeko as well. Minami Tanaka is not someone that im familiar with since I only seen her in one role to date unlike Saori who\u2019s my fourth favourite seiyuu on account of her many roles but I thought that she really did an excellent job portraying the character of Meari here. \\n\\n\r\nKirari \\n\\n\r\nKirari voiced by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of Sword art online and Granblue fantasy fame is one of the main support characters in the series and serves as one of the main villains in the series. A third-year student and the student council president of the school. Kirari who actually never gets referred to as such in the series is a very enigmatic person who is shown to be extremely perceptive, cunning and devious able to find out about all manner of things that happen in the school and elsewhere quite easily. On the surface Kirari is a calm, composed and intelligent person that is also shown to take her duties as student council president seriously. Indeed, this serious nature of hers manifests in her determination to ensure that each of the students that she represents will have a path that is laid out for them in the form of their life forms should they not show a determination and a willingness to excel in their studies which in this school means at gambling. Beneath her initial and her surface personality Kirari is someone that is shown to be extremely smart and is someone that understands quite well how faction politics work within the school but rather than coming down hard on people that overstep their bounds or get too ambitious she instead elects to observe events from afar and let things run their course while at the same time manipulating events from behind the scenes. Kirari\u2019s devious nature also comes into play when she comes up with methods for the paying back of debts to the council some of which really is frightening. Throughout the series it can be seen that Kirari is someone that detests the old-style management that the world relies on which also helps foster he belief that the weak should always be ruled by the strong and that those without strength should aspire to do so. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character Kirari has a number of personally traits that define her. The first of these is her rather unique belief that everyone that she sees is merely a tool that is to be used and not people which rather than stemming from her arrogance actually comes from her own beliefs. The second is that while she is a seeker of knowledge she does so only to use them to subdue others more efficiently and effectively. The last and most likely her most prominent trait is her unpredictability which ensures that you will never know what her plan is until she actually reveals it to you. As a character, I felt that Kirari was a very well-designed character that in addition to being very adept at gambling was also someone that was intelligence and cunning that made her such a powerful opponent and threat to Yumeko and her friends. Indeed, even when not directly facing Yumeko her hand and the actions that it performs behind the scenes is just as much of a threat as it is when she is physically present. I thought that Miyuki Sawashiro really did an excellent job of portraying the character of the intelligent and devious student council president of Kirari Momobami  and though a support role is still one of her best roles I seen.  \\n\\n\r\nMidari \\n\\n\r\nMidari Ikshima voiced by veteran seiyuu Mariya Ise of Madan no Ou no vanadis and Masamune Kun\u2019s revenge fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of the main villains that Yumeko and co face in the series. A fellow student of Yumeko and also a member of the student council with her appointed position being the head of the beautification committee. Midari is someone where the word intense is probably too kind to her in terms of personality with the word of unhinged being a more appropriate term instead. A focused, determined and eccentric person Midari is someone that can be seen as a dark mirror to what Yumeko could become as like Yumeko Midari enjoys gambling but the risks that she takes is of a much higher level than Yumeko. All members of the student council and indeed all students that attend the academy will specialize in a specific form of gambling and in Midari\u2019s case this takes the form of Russian Roulette. In looking at Midari\u2019s behavior during the course of her arc it can be seen that Midari has a rather unhealthy obsession with Russian Roulette more specifically the thrill that one gets from tempting death which I suspect is also how she got her eye patch in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to her normal personality Midari also has a number of personality traits that only stand to define her even more so. As stated earlier Midari views gambling with the same reverence as Yumeko does but rather than approach it with the calmness that Yumeko would Midari approaches it with rather reckless abandon and even when things go her way displays elements that indicate that maybe her sound of mind in abnormal such as she mutters to herself. Midari is also noted to get angry quite easily which is something that I think matches her personality quite well. In the course of her encounter and subsequent battles with Yumeko Midari I note also developed an obsession with Yumeko that I actually found to be quite creepy and indeed I was glad that in the end Yumeko was able to put Midari behind her.  The character of Midari is felt was a hard character to portray due to her questionable mental capacity but I felt that she served as a great reminder to what could happen to Yumeko should she ever become unhinged. I felt that Mariya Ise really did a great job in portraying the character of Midari. \\n\\n\r\nItsuki\\n\\n\r\nItsuki Sumeragi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yuki Wakai is one of the main support characters of the show and is one of Yumeko and co\u2019s allies in their struggle with the student council. A first-year student and thus a fellow freshman of Yumeko\u2019s Itsuki differs somewhat from the rank and file students that form the majority of the student body in that she comes a well-known family that manages a large business. This unique origin also has a hand in shaping the personality and ambition that Itsuki actually has as well as in the way that she approaches things. Personality wise Itsuki is someone that resembles a first-year schoolgirl such as she would be expected to display being a confidant, happy and positive person that\u2019s kind and sweet to everyone that she meets. On the surface, she also appears to be a hardworking and dutiful person and works hard to uphold her role as the junior member of the student council despite only being a first year. Like every other character that appears on the series Itsuki also has a two-faced personality in this case her other personality is far more sinister than her surface one. In this other personality of hers that contrasts greatly with her surface one Itsuki visibly looks down on her opponents and has a rather creepy way of humiliating her opponents by taking their nails as their punishment when they lose to her. Like Meari Itsuki after her defeat by Yumeko underwent a great change in her personality. Though still very proud of her being the heir to her family business her defeat to Yumeko not only eroded the self confidence that she had for herself but also in what the family had for her. \\n\\n\r\nThis made Itsuki rather humble and more diplomatic when she reappeared in the story as she could not afford to mess up anymore. However, despite her change to a humble schoolgirl Itsuki still wrestles with her temper which also introduces one of her prominent personality traits that until the latter part of the series was unrevealed. As a result of perhaps being the daughter of a rich family that controls a large business Itsuki is someone that hates being looked down upon and underestimated and instead prefers to walk down the path that she herself has chosen thus showing one of the more prominent traits of her personality which is that of her independence. Itsuki I felt was an interesting character that showed a great deal of development as the series went on. In her initial appearance while very loyal to her family I felt that she was also weighed down by the responsibility of representing them by doing well in the school which also had the effect of doubling the shock that she experienced when she was defeated by Yumeko. Her subsequent appearance in the later stages of the anime I felt were more natural as here it can be seen that she was determined to walk her own path on her own free will and not dictated by anyone else. I felt that her seiyuu Yuki Wakai did a great job of portraying the character of Itsuki here. \\n\\n\r\nYumemi \\n\\n\r\nYumemi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yuu Serizawa of Twin stars exorcist fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Yumeko\u2019s many opponents that she faces in her struggle against the student council. A second-year student and also a member of the student council where she has the position of being head of their PR division Yumemi is a positive, cheerful and upbeat person that uses her official persona of an idol to promote herself.  As an idol Yumemi is shown to be extremely popular within the academy where she has enough fans to actually form a relatively large fan club that supports her enthusiastically and passionately. Beneath the mask of hers however Yumemi is shown to have a rather different personality in which she seems to actually despise her fans and only think of them as stepping stones to further her career.  In her struggle with Yumeko it\u2019s also shown that Yumemi is a person that while appearing carefree and relaxed on the surface with regards to matches and gambling is actually someone that is determined to win at all costs. Interestingly during such games Yumemi has an obvious problem in hiding her anger when things turn against her. Unlike the great majority of characters that are featured in this series Yumemi is someone that actually has a career that she aspires to join which in this case is becoming a recognized star in the entertainment world something that actually surprised me. Because Yumemi was featured rather late in the series I felt that she wasn\u2019t given enough opportunity to actually change her personality as the other members of the council that Yumeko faced were given. Despite this I felt that Yuu Serizawa really did a great job of portraying the character of Yumemi. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nAnimation I felt was really well done especially the various gambling effects for each of the games. The slow mo. effect for them I felt was especially well done. The character designs for each of the characters I felt were well designed especially the members of the student council. In particular the effects that show when Yumeko enters her ecstasy mode as she gets serious in the games I felt was especially well designed and unique.  \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the series I felt was pretty strong with particular praise going to Saori Hayami who voiced the main character Yumeko and Minami Tanaka who voiced the character of Meari. Also deserving of praise, I felt is Miyuki Sawashiro who voiced the student council president Kirari Momobami, Yuki Wakai who voiced Itsuki and Yuu Serizawa who voiced the character of Yumemi. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the series I felt was pretty well done with the opening theme being quite catchy. The visuals for the opening theme though confusing at first, I felt also reflected the nature of the school that serves as the series main setting. The individual scene music I felt was also well done. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Kakegurui was an anime that I really enjoyed from the onset and remained interesting until the very end which itself is an accomplishment. The main strong points that make Kakegurui such a strong and interesting anime I felt was its interesting premise, excellent story, interesting characters, the introduction of simple but unique game types and its unique take on the types of personality that gamblers may develop though its two-faced nature. The look into the effects that people that lose in such games was also something that I thought was interesting. The premise of the story of having a gambling addict enter a school that teaches you how to not just gamble but also read and manipulate people I felt was unique and was helped greatly by both Yumeko\u2019s personality and motivation for choosing to attend the school. The school and the system that it makes use of to determine the status of its students and their position within the school I felt was interesting because unlike in normal schools where ranking was determined by grades here its determined by how much you have won in the games something that I felt was appropriate for the setting. The overall story for the series I felt was pretty interesting as Yumeko though a seemingly new and innocent transfer student will by her love of gambling and taking of risks be able to change the whole fabric and hierarchy of the society that the school has cultivated for so long and in doing so force the members of the student council fight her in games that they should have had the advantage in. Watching Yumeko demolish the council one by one as she determined their cheating methods and used it against them was really satisfying. Arguably one of the most interesting aspects of Kakegurui I felt was its interpretation of the two-faced nature that most gamblers exhibit after having gambled for some time. In the case of Kakegurui this was in the form of differing personalities where the personality that the characters wear on the surface is their mask while their true personality is what lies beneath. This contrast in personalities I felt was pretty interesting and served too give more depth for each of the characters with Itsuki and Yumemi being the best examples of this aspect. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Kakegurui had everything that I think a good anime should actually have namely an interesting premise, interesting story, well-designed characters and excellent voice acting and featured a number of unique aspects that make use of its unique setting pretty well. As a final score I would give Kakegurui a 10/10 a score that I think it easily deserves. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

I am incredibly picky about anime, I always have been and still will be. With that, here is my review. This anime is the first gambling one I have watched. I had no idea what to expect; I thought it was going to be a pure academy, gambling, social anime. I was blown away by what I watched. \r\nSTORY\r\nThe story is solid for what the anime is. Now, to me, it is more thanjust a gambling anime. It is about the addiction, and thrill, and the absolute sin of it all. How far will a person go, how crazy can a person be? Without giving spoilers, I love how Suzui develops at the end. I think there is more to Yumeko as well; then again maybe it is just art style; will have to wait and see what happens in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is lovely, smooth and sexy jazz with dark and light tones all blended into one great ost. The intro song and outro song are freaking amazing. \\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous, dark colors, with hints of vibrancy. The character designs are pretty good as well. The outlandish facial expressions are freaking wild, and sometimes super creepy, but that adds to the whole insane gambling charm. \\n\\n\r\nCLOSING\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime, and It made me feel all kinds of emotions. From creeped entirely out to sad, and even happy.  If you can get past the sexual gambling undertones, I highly recommend watching it. It is a unique form of art and entertainment.",

The anime main plotline was very simple, a girl who enjoys gambling and is constantly being challenged by the most respected gamblers in her high school.This anime is also very unique. It took the game genre to the next level, unlike all those other anime out there where the main character gets stuck in a game.\r\nOverall Story rating: 8/10\r\nArt\r\nThe art was amazing in this anime! You can see the facial expressions change in each line. Whenever a character was thirsty for more money or gambling, there eyes would shine and theirnose would crunch along with a sadistic smile. Hairstyles were on point and the backgrounds are usually quite nice and set for that scene perfectly.\\n\r\nOverall Art Rating: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was also VERY descriptive. From the characters panting to the music that appears in the right moments is one of the reasons why this anime is so exciting. The openings and endings were pretty decent as well.\\n\r\nOverall Sound Rating: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime is just amazing! It features a quite careless girl who seems like a totally innocent sweetheart but is actually very addictive to gambling and shows a rather sadistic personality on some occasions. She is feared by those she is beaten, yet she still is underestimated by those who haven't seen her gamble. Though she is a good gambler she only has one goal. To gamble. This is very strange to those around her as everyone else's goal is to be the best. Her character design is not the only good design in the anime. There is also another average boy who tends to look out for her and is always showing concern for her. The other side characters who are very respected but show fear towards her if they have ever been in a game with her.\\n\r\nOverall Character Rating: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis anime was very nice and casual. I didn't get too attached to it and I was pleased with the ending, though I do want a season 2. By far, this could be one of the most unique anime I have ever watched and if you are looking for something different. This is your anime.\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment rating: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was an amazing anime and I would give it a \\n\r\n7/10.",

            "content": "I've watched anime about games, card games like Cardfight Vanguard and the long running, Yu Gi-Oh! series, virtual games like .hack//, Sword Art Online, Overlord and Summer Wars but in this anime this differs the game genre because it is all about gambling. \r\nThe review rundown:\r\nStory: Kakegurui's story setting is set in Hyakkaou Private Academy, a private school where most of the students are children of the most powerful and richest people in the world. During the day, it is just similar to normal school educating people in most academic subjects however when the sun goes down, it becomes a gambling den where people areeducating with money and playing with highest stakes. When you win, you'll live like a king and queen of this school but if you lose, you'll have debt to deal with and become a house pet where the other students will treat you as animals and sometimes gets a beatdown from bullies. In this series, Ryota Suzui is the part of the problem where he recently lost to Mary Saotome. Everything changed, when a transfer student named Yumeko Jabami came into the school. Yumeko may look like a normal and beautiful girl but when she gambles she's like on fire enjoying the thrill of the gamble. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: Studio MAPPA, the studio that brings you Yuri on Ice!!, provides the animation of the series and the art shift between the character's expressions especially when they're going crazy or frightened when they lose are awesome as it can make you say \"YES YES YESSSS!!! I'LL MAKE THOSE GUYS SCREAM SO HARD WHEN THEY LOSE!!! WAHAHAHAHA!!!!\". The anime's animation is using film noir aesthetics since gambling is the central plot of the series that totally fits the gambling atmosphere every episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: The series' sound and music are great such as suspenseful sounds during the game which give the feeling of thrill of watching the series. The series opening music, \"Deal with the Devil\", is a mixture of jazz and pop music which totally suits the theme itself giving the feeling of playing gambling games in the casino.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: Their performance is super awesome and they express their emotions superbly especially when they're getting crazy playing the game. In the Japanese version, Yumeko's seiyuu, Saori Hayami, notable for voicing good-natured, prim and proper lady characters, is taking it into a different level where she becomes a crazy girl during gambling. The English voice actor for Yumeko, Erika Harlacher, just like Hayamin (Saori Hayami's fan nickame), who is also notable for voicing rich girls like Claudia Enfield of Asterisk War, prim and proper characters like Violet Evergarden and princess-y characters like Princess Asseylum of Aldnoah.Zero, is no joke because she delivers it very well whenever Yumeko is getting crazy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The series is very addictive and awesome which I'm getting excited to see the next season because it is very enjoyable to watch.\\n",

            "content": "While I don't believe gambling is a subject that is a completely new concept to put into anime, it definitely isn't an extremely common one. Compared to your standard tournament fighter anime, magical girl anime, \"cute girls doing cute things\" anime, or sports anime, the gambling genre has kind of been in the background. Some people have debated if Kakegurui is even primarily about gambling, but I'd say that if the gambling anime looked like a family tree, I feel like it would be somewhere on there. \r\nYou know how when movie trailers will edit a film to try and sell tickets? And when youbuy that ticket to see the movie, it turns out to be different from how the trailer showed it? That's kind of like Kakegurui. It'll keep advertising itself as a gambling anime. And while it does contain gambling, I'd say the show is more about observing how people use (or misuse) power, or what exactly addiction can do to make people make the decisions they choose to make.\\n\\n\r\nTake our protagonist, Yumeko Jabami. She becomes physically aroused by the thought of intense gambling, something that terrifies her opponents. Also take note of the School President, who views the school as her own personal fish tank. She introduced a caste system into this school revolved around gambling. Those aspects are what makes Kakegurui interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is a blast to watch. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but gosh dang I had fun watching it. It's entertaining to watch seemingly innocent looking characters make batshit insane faces and lose themselves into gambling, whether it be for money, social status, their aspirations, or their very own life. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it to people who want to easily sweep through 12 episodes of entertainment. But if you're looking for a hardcore gambling anime, this might be a pass for you. Personally, I thought it was fun.\\n\\n",

            "content": "As someone who\"s been playing poker since he was older enough to count but too small to hold all his cards, I should have asked a long time ago why there wasn't more anime about gambling. That was until I watched Studio MAPPA's \"Kakegurui\". A show that takes the psychology of gambling and uses it as the soul of one of the more dark and twisted shows I have seen in a very long time.\r\nTaking place in the prestigious (YES a high school) Hyakkaou Private Academy, the rather cliched school where the richer and more powerful you are, the higher your standing socially is, andthe student council rules with an iron hand, the twist of having the entire place revolve around gambling and the social skills it teaches you is added in. This creates a unique atmosphere where the high tensity moments of each game of chance echo what other shows might achieve by having the students fight with fists rather than wits. \"Violence is strictly prohibited,\" we are told by one student council member, who has a hand taser to brandish in case someone does raise a fist in anger, but then to add a real hellish angle to this whole system is what happens to those who are debt- they are reduced to \"house pets\". Their humanity is stripped, they are relegated to second class citizens, and have to go through extremely high stakes to attempt to wipe away their debt and restore themselves.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've set up the environment, we are then introduced to our protagonist- Yumeko Jabami. A bubbly, buxom, compulsive gambler whose motivations are not quite known but it is quickly established that she loves the thrill of living on the edge of each rich bet and has very little concern for the consequences. Her eyes glowing red in the heat of it. She quickly causes quite a stir in the halls of the school and gets the attention of the sinister student council. The student council is an odd collection of characters with many a hackneyed premise filling their ranks. They make a unique crew of villains for our leading lady to oppose, but lack enough depth to interest the viewer beyond wanting to see them suffer for their wickedness. \\n\\n\r\nThe meat of the show is in the showdowns provided with many different games of chance. I hadn't heard of many of these games before and they look like a lot of fun to play in real life. In the show however, they're treated as life or death duels where the loser will be relegated to the death of becoming a house pet- or perhaps even death itself. These tense moments are well choreographed the way other shows might do so with fighting or mech battles, but here it's the placing of chips, the draw of a card, the glance of a player, each scene so rich in color and lighting that it almost seems overdone for what amounts to a simple game of chance. Not that chance is what decides these battles, per se. As with most gambling institutions, cheating is rampant and it often comes down not to who plays the best, but who cheats the best. Like \"Ocean's 11\" or \"The Sting\" you're often wondering what the con is, the game behind the game, and each reveal provides a refreshing twist at the end of each tense episode.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed many things about this show, especially since it has one of the catchiest opening themes I've heard in a long time \"Deal With The Devil\" by Tia, a fun Jazz piece reminiscent of something from \"Cowboy Bebop\" or \"Baccano!\". The ending themes are fairly basic decent pieces, but none that stuck to memory. The voice acting itself shows a real credit to the Japanese cast, they really brought their A game to this series and it shows with each individual performance and the crazy dialogue that they had to deliver. The English cast does it's best to keep up and while they put in a good showing, it doesn't match up with their Japanese counterparts with the exception of Sarah Williams as the demented roulette enthusiast Midari, her performance and voice fit the character so well, she was probably the best of either cast.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what keeps this show from being good not great? It's one dimensional approach.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's strength is also it's weakness. In a world of so many twisted characters with enough problems to fill up a mental hospital, it's very hard to find any of them likeable. Even our protagonist is a little too out there to get behind and the guy we're supposed to identify with and feel sorry for, Ryouta, is such a panicky wimp that he's more annoying and pathetic than sympathetic. You add all those nuts to an atmosphere that throws on the tension and then doesn't allow a real moment of pause for contrast or levity or even for the viewer just to catch their breath and you have what is an uncomfortable experience. Even moments of odd fan service where some of the ladies are shown to be sexually aroused and some lesbian innuendo thrown in just make the characters seem even MORE off their rockers rather than attractive. \\n\\n\r\nI can't in good conscience give this show anymore than a solid 6.5/10, a show that is exciting and fun at times, but can be so repulsive as well. That's also a good description of how gambling is, too. So, I'll offer the same advice for watching this show as I do those who want to gamble: it's fun, but not for the faint of heart. Enjoy if you can. Cheers!",

The story is not written, nothing is defined : it is the games, the chance that decides the story.\r\nOn the artistic level, I have nothing to complain about, the opening for example is beautiful and perfectly fits the atmosphere. The artistic style reminds me a bit of \"Prison School\".\r\nThe sounds are great, the voices are well chosen and the intonations are very well controlled. The music chosen for the opening is just great, a little jazzy.\r\nThecharacters are good, they each have their reasons, their stories, their problems. They have a real personality, each character is interesting. (some more than others but it's normal)\\n\r\nThe atmosphere of this anime, the madness of gambles, the excitement, the stress, when one happens to become the characters, this work becomes a real pleasure, it knows to transmit a lot. Still, you have to be receptive.\\n\\n\r\nFR-Je ne sais pas si on peut vraiment parler d'histoire, car il n'y en a pas vraiment. C'est juste une suite de jeux, mais je trouve \u00e7a int\u00e9ressant pour cette raison. L'histoire n'est pas \u00e9crite, rien n'est d\u00e9fini : c'est les jeux, le hasard qui d\u00e9cide de l'histoire.\\n\r\nSur le plan artistique, je n'ai rien \u00e0 redire, l'opening par exemple est \u00e9ventrement belle et colle parfaitement \u00e0 l\u2019ambiance. Le style artistique me fait penser un peu \u00e0 celui de \"Prison School\".\\n\r\nLes sons sont super, les voix sont bien choisies et les intonations sont tr\u00e8s bien ma\u00eetrises. La musique choisie pour l'opening est juste g\u00e9nial, un peu jazz. \\n\r\nLes personnages sont bons, ils ont chacun leurs raisons, leurs histoires, leurs probl\u00e8mes. Ils ont une vrai personnalit\u00e9, chaque personnage est int\u00e9ressant. (certains plus que d'autres mais c'est normal)\\n\r\nL\u2019ambiance de cet anim\u00e9, la folie des paries, l\u2019excitation, le stresse, quand on arrive a se mettre dans la peau des personnages, cette oeuvre devient un v\u00e9ritable plaisir, elle sait transmettre beaucoup. Encore faut-il \u00eatre r\u00e9ceptif.",

From episode one, I was hooked and addicted to this anime, it grabbed me and dragged me along on its wild, derangedride and I was grinning like a little devil the entire time. It's definitely one of the most unique and smartly-written animes I've ever come across, reminding me both of Death Note and Sherlock Holmes in its approach to the unraveling of the characters and their hidden machinations as well as the way their moments of sheer malicious joy are beautifully illustrated along with a massive dose of free-wheel, unhinged, insane glee mixed in. Yes, it may have its flaws and it may not be for everyone, but I'm become addicted to this anime and, whatever flaws it may have, I do not care one single iota. This is an anime which I adore and was going on my list of all-time favourite animes from episode one and I've never once wavered in that decision.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that could make this anime better for me would be a season two! Seriously, this anime deserves it, and, with a manga that only seems to be ramping up, they've definitely got loads and loads of material for several seasons to come. Please, please, PLEASE! Give this one a second season, please! I need my fix!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I give this 10 roulette wheels out of 10, a full royal straight flush! So, SHALL WE GAMBLE?!",

To be honest.. I didn't know why I watched this anime.. it just came to be as I know, Kakegurui: Compulsive Gambler. I have not really seen anime that are centered around the concept of gambling so this is my first one. I was expecting this anime to be calm and assuring but it seems that it really offered what it was all about.. Risks.. This anime is all about risk.. even you might be risking somethingjust to watch this.. you might be risking your own personality and betting everything to change your mindset into full recklessness. Maybe what you thought playing high staked games with plenty of risks are too difficult to handle before watching this anime, this anime might take away that way of thinking for you. So.. did this anime change my way of thinking? Well.. Probably not because I am already a reckless person.. but what about for you? Are you willing to take the risk? Let's settle this with gambling! \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: Seems like it is not yet done and there might be a possible sequel based on the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Were you expecting fan service? Hahahaha.. indeed there is.. but wait till you see the best expressions in this anime..\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Great Soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: The main Heroine has a very nice unique personality... Her reckless nature and compulsive gambling disorder is very intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: It was very nice but not really that perfect.. A little improvement and it might be enjoyable and worthy of time.",

Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\u2726\r\nPremise of gambling with high risk stakes is rather heavy gambling addiction setting to have, which is quite interesting. It's essentially episodic \"battle shounen\" with each episode giving us different game and different enemy whilst slowly crawling towards the \"end game boss\". I did enjoy it whole the most part, but I felt it a bit dull how story was presented and the lackluster games with a bit disappointing endings. Whilst the \"big picture\" of the story is rather nice, it is still conveyed in arather bland way.\\n\\n\r\nBut nevertheless considering it's simply gambling/card games which I have no interest of, it was still made in a very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art&Sound\u2726\\n\r\nBoth art and OST are absolute bliss in this Anime. Character design, animations and music has such a rousing style to it. It simply sucked me in as a viewer and the approach of Animation was almost perfect. I do absolutely adore character design though. It's beautiful and absolutely hot.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is essentially \"stereotypical\" casino music, but did sound rather nice. Opening was catchy and artsy, whilst ending was absolutely hot.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\u2726\\n\r\nMany hot batsh*t crazy hot chicks. That is enough to know about characters. I loved it and I absolutely adore Jabami. And a little reserved male straight-man-slap-stick-act sidekick.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\u2726\\n\r\nWhat else to add. It's beautiful, edgy, colorful Anime about gambling with crazy hot chicks. Even if you have no interest in card games or in gambling in general, it is still very entertaining Anime. I enjoyed it a lot and will for sure check out sequels.\\n\\n\r\nBiggest weakness I find about this Anime is integrity of the story and some characters that just fade into non-existence. But that is simply an outcome of \"episodic\" type of an Anime.",

Gambling has been something not so common as a main topic in an anime, which might have made it confusing or a bad storytelling for some. \r\nThe story. As an adaptation of various luck-games, i feel like the anime did a pretty good job when representing them in a clever and fun way. But for most people outside Japan who never heard of a big part of the gambling styles, the extreme representation made it a lot more confusing.\r\nOutside the theme, there isn\u2019t much of a story or a background to anything. The gambling academy is there withthe rich and freaky children and that\u2019s it. No why or how. Regardless, if you watch the anime with only the experiences of the characters in your head you\u2019ll be able to enjoy it. Don\u2019t look too deep for a story or a big plot, not even romance. \u201cIt\u2019s all about gambling\u201d, remember.\\n\\n\r\nArt. For sure an outstanding one! The depth the extreme expressions of the characters and background added a lot more to the scenes, specially on the crazy gambling parts. Not just that, but the peculiar way they made it possible, running from the normal expressions you\u2019d expect even in an action/drama anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds. As well as the art, it was a complementary depth to it, very cleverly used in favour of the feelings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. It could have been a lot better in this aspect. As mentioned, no background for any of them. No why or how they are in the Academy. No why or how they are even friends. All the relationships between them seem forced and there\u2019s no real talks about anything but gambling.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall. Regardless the lack of a story i enjoyed the overly acted scenes and all the strategies in general.",

            "content": "Seems like Kakegurui is quite a polarizing show.  For me, at a glance, it is obvious that it enters the category of \"good anime\".  This is as opposed to the formulaic, predictable, money grabbing, low effort run of the mill shit that we've been getting the last decade.  Here we have a series which has a clear aim to rise above the typical moeblob garbage, at least in terms of production quality and originality.  \r\nAt the same time i can see why a lot of people wouldn't like it.  The viewers who prefer to have stories more grounded in realityand relatable will surely not be able to enjoy the bombastic, over the top stupidity of Kakegurui.  The premise is nonsense, the characters are weird and outlandish, the setting is completely out there.  You have to accept that this show is a lame-azing, fun trainwreck and allow yourself to simply enjoy it.  But you can't turn your brain off!  After all, games and gambling are the focus of this story, so it's wasteful not to try and play along inside your mind.\\n\\n\r\nSo Kakegurui is ridiculous, but it's ridiculous in all the right ways.  First of all, the variety of fan service is very fresh.  In this case it's not crappy accidental panty shots, it's girls getting aroused from gambling or other bizarre \"fetishes\".  No pure maidens here, just real self-aware sluts.  It's very different and much more effective.  You also get a lot of yuri bait out of nowhere, but the tone is depravity, no hand-holding crap, so i can dig it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe games themselves serve as a bit of intellectual stimulation, though they are not nearly as interesting as, for example, the ones in Liar Game.  The real satisfaction comes from tables turning, and the strong crushing the weak.  The exaggerated emotions, the despair, the sadistic satisfaction of the winners; it's very tantalizing.  Don't expect a story-writing masterpiece here, this rapidly becomes predictable.  Both the game's outcomes and the method.  You know how you can predict the plot twist, just because you know they HAVE to try to make everything a plot twist?  Characters just being consistently too-smart?  Yeah it's that kind of thing but whatever.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main contributor to the enjoyment of this anime is the very high production value.  The characters are meticulously drawn with a very high level of detail, down to individual tooth shapes, lip shapes and reflections, iris textures, etc.  Their facial expressions are vivid and complex, though almost higurashi levels of exaggerated sometimes.  Still, I'll take this any day over bland sameface A1 Pictures pieces of shit.  There are also moments of top quality animation, such as a character's lips properly mouthing a word rather than simply opening and closing.  The sound also leaves nothing to be desired, with a top tier cast of voice actors, and here also a high level of attention to detail.  You even have tooth grinding sounds when people get too frustrated!  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kakegurui is a very fun, exciting piece of work which just has to be watched for what it is.  Yeah, it's not Shakespeare, but that's not what i watch anime for, and if you do, you're going to be disappointed pretty often.  Watch this, and then watch Liar Game.",

            "content": "I was attracted to Kakegurui due to its clean and concise Art Style and the premise of the show itself. I really liked the character designs of all the characters bar yumeko's unessacarily large breasts which I just felt were gigantic for no apparent reason. While some of the devices used to showcase the malignity of gambling may seem like too much such as the facial expressions of the characters or the literal sexual ecstasy gambling makes them feel I believe it just really clearly shows us the madness of the world and the extent to which gambling has grabbed hold of their lives. \r\nIrated low on story as for awhile I felt I was just watching Yumeko enjoy herself gambling (because I was). Yumeko is a rather ok main character , in gambles it's her opponents who make the scenes interesting to watch, she has no drive to become the best or climb the social hierarchy she just enjoys the madness of risking it all. That's all there is to her, she's for lack of better terms just a crazy bitch. She never really faces any major character development. Her opponents on the other hand have interesting backstories explaining the way they are and their motivations for gambling. Even her friends grow throughout the series but Yumeko simply does not change one bit and the anime makes a point of it.  Another one of my smaller complaints is there is undeniable \"edgy\" feel to Kakegurui which at times stopped me from taking it seriously. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I still enjoyed watching kakegurui especially listening to the opening/closing tracks.",

            "content": "(Some Minor Spoilers Ahead)\r\nAn insane show that pits overly sadistic and messed up characters against each other in custom gambling games! Whats not to love?\r\nStory:\r\nSuzui, one of the main characters, is shown getting his ass handed to him in the game where he becomes the dog of one of the other main characters, Saotome. Shortly after, the third and most prominent MC of the show appears, Jabami Yumeko. Yumeko then proceeds to destroy everyone's will to live as she continually beats person after person in intense gambling matches.\r\nCharacters:\r\nAside from Suzui, you could pretty much pin down every other characters personality to being absolutely insane. Sadismand Masochism also play a large role as you can easily fit 99% of the characters in this show into one of those two categories. Other than that, their personalities stemmed from how they sated their weird gambling fetishes (Such as Sumeragi collecting humans nails, or Ikishima gambling to die).\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt Style:\\n\\n\r\nNot too unique but not too genericl should aptly state what the art style looks like. But the art accommodates for the ultra edge that was this show, and it left for some pretty vile but very intriguing facial expressions which only made the show more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI heavily enjoyed binging the whole series on an empty weekend, I think that this is one of those shows where you can only fully appreciate what the creators were trying to do if you watched it all at once.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was hilarious at it's over the top moments and it always had me wondering how Yumeko was going to get out of yet another insane situation.

            "content": "Kakegurui and God of Gamblers, what do they both have in common?????Gambling  were the risk are high and the Gamblers who takes it, pretty awesome isn't it, but the anime or the manga were basically so full of anachronism , that the setting and the characters role were just too unfitting. But hey, for them Japs anything in school uniform just looks better, so just like any anime, manga, light novel or game sim would never be complete without one, but then again for those who made a very long review of this anime only to gave it a 4, simply just don't haveto watch it if they think that this thing is garbage in the first place. In fact this in one anime where you can forget all that anachronism and just focus on the character and the game, so........\\n\\n\r\nStory, Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk so the plot setting was in a school except it was more like as one reviewer put it a \"Gambling Den\" , where all bets are in as soon as you enrolled  and every student at one way or the other would have to play and bet anything and everything, and the student councils were more like the Mafia who runs it and enforces penalties to the losers . Which is where  Yumeko Jabami comes in, cu'z here, she is the story plot and the student councils where the means to the end of this plot, which what makes this category good, since one would feel such delight of seeing the losers in their face when they face with Yumeko Jabami, SSSSAAAAAAA SHOULD I SAY MORE???????????\\n\\n\r\nArt, Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nwhen it come to fanservice , one can only see it in Mary when she cross her legs while sitting on Suzui in the opening theme and with Jabami in the closing theme. Ok so when the characters are in their poker faces and serious faces, one can simply just screw the fact that they were teenager and just focus on the facial expressions, and it was those facial expressions that gives this anime it's pizzazz, where one can almost feel what the characters felt when the outcome is near, be it for the losers or for Jambami herself.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't the opening nor the closing that gives this anime it's pizzazz, rather it was the tone and the kind of enunciation of the characters voices that gives such enjoyment of this anime , whether it's the voice of despair or the excitement of the outcome, one can really feel the monologue of the characters voices as they speak with such emotions .But what I like was Midari's scene in episode 4 where it goes like this \"SHIT!\" (Thud) Punching the toilet door, \"FUCKING BASTARDS!!!!\" (Thud, Thud Thud) banging the toilet door repeatedly, (Heee, Heeee, Heeee) Breathing deeply an sitting down on the toilet sit, (Heeeeee) breathing slowly while looking at her gun, \"Once.....Let's just do once\"placing the gun on her temple \"One in Six........a one and six chance\" saying over and over again (Click) pulling the trigger (HAAAAAAA, AHHHAAAAA, HAAAA) Breathing deeply and fast (Tick) pulled the trigger, no bullet, \"WHAAAAAAAA,HAAAAA, WHAAAAAA, EHEEEEE!!!!!!!\" Whaling loudly, \"THIS, THIS IT IT!!!!\"\"HERE RIGHT NOW, I'M ALIVE!!!!!!!\"  \"THIS SENSATION!\" (Lick) licking the gun's barrel (Sqik, Sqik, Sqik) playing her pussy, and enjoying it \"AMAZING!!!!\" (Sqik, Sqik,Sqik) still playing her pussy and moaning wildly and maybe inserting her gun into it after which she says \"Jabami Yumeko isn't it?\" then she went out of the toilet uttering the words \"I'll let you pay me back in full\", that is my favorite scene and the score was for that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Great 9.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so lets go over them characters:\\n\\n\r\nJambami Yumeko- The MC, the compulsive gamble, to call her a \"compulsive gamble\" is a wrong statement, and I did say \"wrong\" cu'z she isn't a compulsive gamble but a trill seeker who is in it for the trill, also she is a bit of a sadist cu'z she also enjoys  seeing how her opponents react when she see thru their cheats,  their defeat and their anxiety. Basically if you'll look at the very definition of Compulsive Gambling in the dictionary, she simply doesn't fit the bill, instead she fits the bill of someone who derives sexual pleasure from standing out, so much so that whether she wins, deals or loses she was able to turn the tables around with such orgasmic proportions  which is pretty impressive for original creator Kawamoto Homura to conceptualize.\\n\\n\r\nSuzui Ryota - Ok so he's the quintessential nice guy, in fact too nice that at the start of the anime or manga, we see him being Mary's bitch and one can only sympathizes with him for all the mistreatment she get's from her and her lackeys. It wasn't when Yumeko arrives that he's finally free and now has become her bitch, though he does get better treatment from her than with Mary. Now the thing about him was that he really did play the role well as Yumeko's bitch, as a her bitch he basically serves as her conscience where he from time to time would try his best to keep Yumeko out of any situation but often it proves to be useless, so basically all he can do is just be in her side since he's a pussy who can only be an obstacle against anybody to Yumeko and that's what how his cookie crumbles.\\n\\n\r\nMary Saotome- At first we would wanna see her get owned and get owned it did, big time, where we enjoyed seeing her being in Suzui's shoes, too bad he was just too nice to get back on her for all of the mistreatment, but one thing about her character, was the redemption, when we saw her getting out of being a pet and no longer taking shit from others, all thanks to Yumeko for partnering up with her. Though, she did become Yumeko's friend , she was more like a lackey than her friend, make that a lackey where one can't say if she is with her cu'z she want's to see Yumeko kick the class president's ass or just something who was probably waiting on the sides.... for something.\\n\\n\r\nSumeragi Itsuki- Her's was a different story from Mary, since after her defeat from Yumeko, she joins her posse cu'z she got kicked outta the student council . Now, she was obviously an opportunist, cu'z she knows she has a lot to gain from being with her instead of being Manyuda Knade's lackey, which she got when Manyuda got owned, seeing her being nervous to the point of wanting to pee, to the point of her contemplation and to the point of enjoying his defeat from Yumeko was somewhat her way of getting back at him for treating her like tool when she is no longer of used she get's thrown away. Frankly those final moment of  her climax really would dig in to us, as if we ourselves were in that moment.  \\n\\n\r\n Yuriko Nishinotouin - She maybe an antagonist, were we hoped that Yumeko would get to owned her, but as it turned out, she's a good antagonist cu'z she is keeping her lackeys from being pets at the cost of other students, now her, we can see her dilemma. Too bad, that's where Yumeko loses...or did she intentionally loses to save her and her lackeys, now I don't know, but it was good that the original creator didn't play safe with Yumeko's character.\\n\\n\r\nIgarashi Sayaka - As Momobami Kirika's lesbian bitch, she one to be hated, too bad we didn't get to see her master get owned , cu'z seeing her cry would have been very very good.\\n\\n\r\nIkishima Midari - Ohhhhhh, she one very dirty lusty bitch and a crazy one too, quite frankly, if this anime / manga has a hentai element she would fit right it. One thnig about her, was that she doesn't have to be naked to get our mojo jumping, just seeing her play her pussy and moaning would have been enough to give us a mojo high... let's see I wanna put her monologue scene from episode 4:\\n\\n\r\n\" SHIT SHIT!\" (Thud, thud) Punching the toilet door, \"FUCKING BASTARDS!!!!\" (Thud, Thud Thud) banging the toilet door repeatedly, (Heee, Heeee, Heeee) Breathing deeply an sitting down on the toilet sit, (Heeeeee) breathing slowly while looking at her gun, \"Once.....Let's just do once\"placing the gun on her temple \"One in Six........a one and six chance\" saying over and over again (Click) pulling the trigger (HAAAAAAA, AHHHAAAAA, HAAAA) Breathing deeply and fast (Tick) pulled the trigger, no bullet, \"WHAAAAAAAA,HAAAAA, WHAAAAAA, EHEEEEE!!!!!!!\" Whaling loudly, \"THIS, THIS IT IT!!!!\"\"HERE RIGHT NOW, I'M ALIVE!!!!!!!\"  \"THIS SENSATION!\" (Lick) licking the gun's barrel (Sqik, Sqik, Sqik) playing her pussy, and enjoying it \"AMAZING!!!!\" (Sqik, Sqik,Sqik) still playing her pussy and moaning wildly and maybe inserting her gun into it after which she says \"Jabami Yumeko isn't it?\" then she went out of the toilet uttering the words \"I'll let you pay me back in full.\"\\n\\n\r\nKiwatari Jun- What I like about him, was how he git owned by a Mary and Yumeko tandem where he get's demoted to a much lower pet category of that of  Tsubomi whom he treats like shit.\\n\\n\r\nYumemite Yumemi - She is a quintessential idol, whom I also hate, too bad she doesn't get to be buried in deeper shit when that voice recording was played. \\n\\n\r\nYomozuki Runa - The quintessential loli, but not just any  loli, rather she one bad loli who no one would mess around, really. grown up scare  shit of a loli? Shit, I'd wish Mary would have given her some spanking when she confronted the student council about her life plan.\\n\\n\r\nManyunda Kaede - Shit , he's has to be the main course, either way, I like that way that he got lure into betting his life, and now Sumeragi owns his life , too bad he's in s coma, when will he wake up, I'd say he's better off dead......btw, his face of shock was amazing, especially when he lost big time.......\\n\\n\r\nMomobami Kirari- Now her versus Yumeko, was a disappointment, cu'z it end in a draw, I would have love to see her walk out of school in shame, that is if she would have lost to Yumeko, about her twin sister Ririka, damn, we did't even get to see some action with her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have an anime like this , where the climaxes were intense, one would enjoy this to the max, so.....\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nYou can forget all that anachronism and all minor details, cu'z this anime is evil and cruel, but wtf it's outstanding........\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2???? HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you're a sucker for anime Openings then you'll at least love Kakegurui for that much as it has arguably one of the Best Openings in 2017. This anime although set in a Gambling World with it as it's Premise is certainly less about Gambling and more about The psychological aspects behind it. What sets this anime apart from the rest in my opinion is the wide variety of diverse/unique/and eccentric characters. As you'll come to find out almost every character in this anime is mentally unstable and Psychotic, not always in a bad way but rather an entertaining way. Each episode reveals new charactersfor the Main Character Jabami Yumeko to face off against in winner take all Gamble, with each Gamble having higher stakes and being more deadly than the last. For me that is what keeps this anime interesting, the ever changing Gambles as we root for our Psychotic MC to make her way to the Top of the Student Council. Unlike you're typical anime with School Settings this one offers a fresh new outlook on the genre shedding light into the more psychological aspects of a Gamble. \\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10- i love the unique predominately Red/Reddish color Palette which also offers warm yellows and Harsh Blues to set the mood depending on the situation/gamble.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8/10 Not all of the Characters are impressive however we get such a wide range of them and an inside look on what makes them tick so it never gets dull. Theres so many unique characters with various personalities that every episode feels Fresh.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 Unique in it's premise but a tad bid Generic in it's delivery as its essentially a Battle Royal of Gambling your way to the top of the School. Nothing Crazy about it but it is Different and for me \"Different\" was good although that may not be the case for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 The Art is Good it's not in my Top 10 or anything but does have a distinct Style that will burn itself into your memory in a good way. When you see the Characters Facial expressions you'll know what i mean :)\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:8/10 The Voice Acting in this played a big role in my enjoyment of this anime and to be honest i think it's criminally underrated in that aspect. Every Voice is distinctly different and discernible and the voice actors really give it their all in the Climax of the Gambling scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all i gave this anime a 9/10 for staying very true to the Manga Source Material for the most part as well as being an overall enjoyable ride. If you enjoy Psychotic Women and Psychological anime then i think you should definitely give this anime a shot and watch it for yourself.\\n",

            "content": "How do you make a story about gambling interesting? Make every character absolutely insane. \r\nThis is the story (comedy?) of Kakegurui.\r\nThe show started out with promise. The characters had a bit of a... uniqueness about them. The main heroine is completely crazy, as you'll find out in like episode 2, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself. It's fine to have an unhinged character to shake up the story a bit. \r\nHowever, at some point a writer needs to realize when they've gone too far. There's a point where the story just becomes way too unrealistic and overly dramatic. The problem with Kakegurui,is a typical problem you actually see in Shonen anime or whatnot. As the stories go on, battles need to get bigger and more dramatic. You go from fun, realistic battles, to battles where suddenly two characters have the powers of gods who just go at it and do all sorts of weird stuff. \\n\\n\r\nA similar situation comes up in this show. The bets become larger, and the insanity also becomes larger somehow. The writers feel a need to make the characters more and more insane as the series goes on, as if it's going to shock the viewer. And how do they convey a message of insanity? You have characters who touch they faces a lot. I'm pretty sure in every single episode someone's eyes have glowed up and their hands have molested their own faces. \\n\\n\r\nAs if that wasn't enough, you also have the protagonist (?) (he doesn't really do much the whole story) whose only purpose is to make comments on how crazy everything is. He's always freaking out about the heroine and how crazy her bets are, too, which is funny because the main heroine has superhuman luck so I don't see why he'd ever be concerned. \\n\\n\r\nOh, speaking of which, this show isn't really about strategy. Like, yeah, they act as if there's a strategy to it all, but really it comes down to the fact that a character was lucky enough to actually carry out that strategy in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nEverything is over-hyped in this show. At some point it kinda becomes funny. You got characters that masturbate over life or death situations, and characters that mutilate their own bodies for SEEMINGLY NO REASON (see episode 11). Also, people's hair changes color after bets now, apparently. I honestly have no idea what the writers are thinking. It's possible that, while trying to make their characters increasingly more unhinged, they have also become insane themselves. Prayers go out to them tonight, my friends.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, this series is becoming worse and worse as it goes on. Don't let the promise of the first half of the series fool you. It's managed to accomplish in 13 episodes what it usually takes shounens hundreds of episodes to do - become completely ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nAdditional elements:\\n\r\nArt: is good\\n\r\nSound: is okay (OP and ED are very fun)\\n\r\nCharacter: worst part of the series. There is absolutely no character development or even personality besides 'insane' or 'freaked out' throughout the entire series. \\n\r\nStory: bland and linear - absolutely unsurprising. \\n\r\nenjoyment: ehhhh fair, it really just took the biggest dive in the final couple episodes\\n\r\noverall rating: 5/10 and that's MERCIFUL imo",

Quite sad how most of the people who watched this show missed out on tense psychological battles and the degradation of mental states of characters during the games they played, because of focusing too much on the \"quality of the games\".\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe plot in Kakegurui kinda takes a backseat and is only used to justify the events happening. This reveals the poor pacing of the show, since the show clearly should have been a 2 cour. We sadly do not getto see neither the history of the academy, nor the backstory of Yumeko or the student council.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art stays pretty loyal to the manga. It has a mature vibe to it which fits well with the show. The \"ugly/orgasmic\" faces also serve as visual representation of, yet again, the character's mental state.\\n\\n\r\nWhat lowers the mark are the CG scenes, which sucked.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAmazing jazzy opening. Hayami Saori. Sawashiro Miyuki. Sugita Tomokazu. Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Kakegurui shines. Each little gamble introduces a new character, their motivation to gamble and the extent to which they will go achieve their goal. The variety of these \"reasons\" is what makes the show interesting. Some characters want to be treated as human beings, thus playing to achieve a higher status, some want to experience near death situations which makes them feel alive, some want to use the academy as a stepping stone to stardom or to a prestigious position of a politician, thus gambling in favor of their success.\\n\\n\r\nIf the plot takes a back seat, the character interactions is what drives the show. Using the Midari arc as an example, we get to see a game between a person who gambles for fun, Yumeko, and a person who is crazy enough to gouge her own eye out just to demonstrate her willpower and who would put the lives of other people on the line just for her personal pleasure, which results in one of the best episodes in the anime, the outcome of which I won't spoil. Other than the Midari arc, the paroxysm of these interactions is shown in the Manyuda arc. With many cringing out of discomfort during the \"nail biting\" scene, the said scene demonstrates the determination of one of the characters to advance to their goal, discarding, or \"betting away\" what's personally important to them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI started watching Kakegurui because I wanted to see people play poker in anime. In the end, I got a show that excels at being a psychological thriller. I didn't get what I expected, I got something much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nRambling aside, look at how much I wrote about the various characters without focusing even a single bit on the games of Kakegurui.\\n\\n\r\nIs the show about gambling? Yes it is. Is it *only* about gambling? No. Does it focus on the games used in said gambling? No.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're watching Kakegurui for the games, don't bother, you'll end up disappointed. However, if you want to watch \"crazy people do crazy things\" while risking their lives, go ahead, this show is for you.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, with the anime original ending, the conclusion to the show is a bit lackluster. Had the show been a 2 cour anime, which would fix the pacing, this would be one of my favourite shows of all time.",

            "content": "**Small spoilers ahead, but mostly for the fan service***\r\nI don't review stuff, but I feel like someone who has seen a lot of gambling anime should give my take on the show.\r\nSo, I've been a fan of gambling anime for a while now. I had seen it all, Kaiji, Akagi, One Outs, Legendary Gambler Tetsuya etc. So when I heard Kakegurui was going to be the new jaw dropping, nail biting gambling experience in anime form for us gambling fans I was pretty excited.\r\nMan, was I wrong.\r\nLet me get this straight from the start, Kakegurui isn't bad it's just...tainted. It's tainted with cringey fan service,it's tainted with weird sexual facial animations and people have orgasms over gambling that are, once again, fan service, it's tainted with dumb characters, a weird plot, fan service everywhere. It's one of those animes that normal people think of when they think of anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give a quick run down of the story, but it's basically about a girl who comes to this rich school that makes their students gamble and if they lose too much they become a \"housepet\" which is just like being a slave to the other students. You're treated like trash and in some cases have your entire lives written out for you down to the smallest detail so that you'd be able to pay back the school whatever you owe them if you can't currently. (Such as getting married, being a housewife and having three kids before you're even 30)\\n\\n\r\nIf you have good taste and have seen/read Kaiji or Akagi, then you're probably dismissing this as trash and, you're right to do so but I wouldn't say to completely disregard it. The good part of this anime is still that the gambling is quite interesting (at least to me), and while you know Yumeko is going to win you want to see how she's going to win, if she's going to cheat or if there's going to be a random turnabout that no one saw coming (in a similar way to Akagi), the music is surprisingly good as well (well, not the OP and ED those are awful), it's not Kaiji/Akagi tier (but who could beat Tanuchi?) but it's good in its own right and surprisingly Yumeko as a character is actually a bit interesting due to being unpredictable in ways. Sadly it all boils down to one thing as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\nCan you stomach all the fan service?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, maybe I'm implying that the show is like 5 minute of gambling and 15 minutes of fan service for the whole show, but it's really not. Instead you're getting fan service being thrown in for no real reason at random intervals. One episode had the main character pretend to be a cat, get down on all fours and start meowing after she became a housepet for the first time. Another episode had her and some random idol start singing on stage together for a minute and a half, and man the amount of times people sensually whisper in each others ears while blushing is too much.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just confusing and cringeworthy stuff. Imagine if in Kaiji, he started to dance whenever he won a gamble and pretend to play an air guitar, it's just weird and ruins the mood of the show. \\n\\n\r\nTo add onto this, the plot barely deals with anything like death or loss of body parts (well one episode had her betting her fingernails). If you lose, the worst thing that could happen to you is becoming a housepet and having your life written out for you, and it's not even that bad since in many cases you can just pay off the debt because, surprise surprise, you're the kids of rich people (although many of the debts are very very high and are too much for the parents, it's still POSSIBLE to pay off the debts). If you're the kind of person who wants there to be a big consequence behind the gambles instead of just gambling for fun, then you're not going to enjoy this even if you do find the gambles interesting. \\n\\n\r\nYumeko as a character is like a watered down Akagi, she's kinda unstoppable and is gambling for pleasure more than the feeling of total destruction and I will admit that I do enjoy her being unpredictable and them smiling in the face of the loser, but on the flip side she'll always so a weird sensual thing of facing the character head on with glowing red eyes and telling them to \"pay up\" whereas Akagi never gave a crap and would've left by now.  The side character whatever his name was is just some dude who I guess the viewer is meant to represent and does nothing but tell Yumeko \"No don't gamble :(((( \" if anything he should've been the main character. I'd rather see him go up against impossible gambles and cheat his way out of it a la Kaiji.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, pick one out that you feel represents you.\\n\\n\r\n1) Have you seen Kaiji, Akagi, One Outs, Tetsuya and read a whole array of gambling manga, are you here for the gambling?\\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot, you might enjoy it. The fan service is awful, but the gambles in of themselves are interesting. Well, if you don't already work out the cheating behind some of them.\\n\\n\r\n2) Have you seen the above, but want a show that's thrilling, nail biting, jaw droppingly intense?\\n\\n\r\nGive it a pass, sorry man but you're not going to like this. The gambles mean very little, and the fan service just worsens the whole experience.\\n\\n\r\n3) Have you see the above, and can stomach fan service?\\n\\n\r\nGive it a watch, if you enjoy fan service, this show is chocked full of it along with gambling.\\n\\n\r\n4) Have you not see the above, but want to watch some gambling?\\n\\n\r\nStop what you're doing, and watch Kaiji because that's the superior gambling anime, with One Outs trailing behind for people who don't know Mahjong. This show barely touches what makes gambling so great. \\n\\n\r\n5) Did you actually look at/watch Kaiji/Akagi and think \"Damn, this artstyle is ugly, and the story is boring, man this is awful\"?\\n\\n\r\nYeah, this is your anime right here. You'll enjoy this stuff 100%.\\n\\n\r\n6) If you've truly got nothing to watch, and like gambling?\\n\\n\r\nGive a few episodes a go, you've got nothing better to do if you've seen it all and just want to see something new, it might be your thing. \\n\\n\r\nNow of course, everyone has their own opinion on this stuff. Maybe I've missed the point of what has made this great, maybe I'm comparing it to a masterpiece and in comparison it sucks. Who knows, personally I don't think Kakegurui is bad, the art is nice, the music is good, the gambles are fun to watch (mostly) but it's just not as good as other gambling anime out there that you could spend your time watching. If you've got nothing else and think 12 episodes is worth your time, go for it, otherwise if this is your fist gambling anime or Kaiji is still on your \"Going to watch\" list, do yourself a favour and watch Kaiji instead.\\n",

The problem is, the writer seemed to take the sexual route with this just far too quick and early. Our main character seems to nearly orgasm several times just at the thought of gambling and risking her family fortune within just the short amount of time I gave it. It's really not worth your time. \r\nPretty much theonly plus I can give here is the music was quite spot on, sadly the visual sequence follows the same trend in attempting to over sexualize things. While we're listening to a great jazzy opening theme, we are treated with an upskirt, then a girl licking mc's bare toes, mc holding a knife to boring supporting boy in a very yandere fashion, and her breasts are over accentuated. There's little focus on the actual gambling, instead it focuses on \"HEY WE CAN USE BETTING AS A COVER UP FOR GETTING OUR ROCKS OFF!\". No kink shaming of course, but if you want to be a big time animation, just throwing random fetish after random fetish at the viewers isn't the best plan of attack. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want something that maybe you can get a boner to, go ahead and give it a shot, but otherwise steer clear of this paper thin excuse of a plot.",

They are separate in there own ways, but they are watchable. The live action version sets upfor a better sequel that'll most likely take a lot of time to develop, but if they go towards the direction that I think they should go, it's gonna be way better then the first one.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Anime TV version, the second season is the question of it being good or not.

The jazzy intro, the crazy facial expressions, I'm all in! Now my biggest compliant would have to be the uhm, protagonist of the story? I say that very loosely because well, he was blank and felt almost unnecessary? I understand that some storiesrequire the one dimensional character so that the viewer can put themselves into perspective, but really was he needed? The story almost felt like it had to pull itself back whenever Ryouta was around. Other than that I enjoyed Yumeko and how mysteriously lucky she was. I liked the variety of competitors and the reasons behind their gambles too. Definitely an interesting anime, but needs more background.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nThink Food Wars by way of No Game No Life or Kaiji and that should give you an idea of the kind of show Kakegurui is. But does it capitalize on the what\u2019s good about the show\u2019s that influenced it? Back to that in a second, let\u2019s talk about what the show does well first. The first episode starts off strong with gorgeous looking expressive and detailed character designs with thoughtful animation flourishes. Yuri on Ice\u2019s Saya Yamamoto animated the OP with sex appeal, style and is one of the best this season and much of that style translates into the showproper. The studio seems to understand the source material well, being very unsubtle about how insane and twisted this show is; preferring to highlight and accentuate this insanity as opposed to pretending it doesn\u2019t exist. There is a lot of sexuality bubbling beneath the surface, unflinchingly proud to have its fan service and unlike Food Wars the fan service is a bit more thematically warranted.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get back to some of those other similarities because it\u2019s hard to think of other shows like Kaiji and No Game No Life while watching this and I can\u2019t help but enjoy those shows more for a few simple reasons. First is the protagonist or in Kakegurui\u2019s case the \u201cprotagonist?\u201d. You see, these kinds of shows really benefit from an unexpected hero with new smart ideas that will revolutionize their world and help change the corrupted status quo. As high schools go, Hyakkaou Private Academy is a nightmare where actual professors both were allowed to and thought it was a good idea to make gambling the curriculum of the school. I mean there are still regular classes but that barely matters when your success is determined by how much money you make through being a corrupt lying cheating jackass. Yumeko seemed to discover about this school\u2019s gambling scene by accident so it\u2019s understood that other students wouldn\u2019t have come to this school because of the gambling which begs the question \u201cwhy would they stay after realizing how messed up everything is?\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nTeachers have no presence in the show and everything is just run by a student council, which is not uncommon (in fantasy high school anime) but they probably couldn\u2019t figure out a way to make any of this work while having teachers at this school and not have a logical reason why everyone couldn\u2019t be arrested. Students practically become slaves (\u201clivestock\u201d as they call it in the show) to the whims of the elite. If we ever saw what society outside this school would look like, I would expect to see desolation and despair on the same scale as Dangan Ronpa. Even if that were the next level twist everything else is far too normal for that argument to have any legs.\\n\\n\r\nCompare that to Tootsuki, an elite high school where cooking is everything and also integrated into school grades and school life in a way that makes sense. People are super strict about cooking in a way that\u2019s unfair but can be argued as \u201ctough love\u201d and part of the system\u2019s rigorous curriculum to make sure the best of the best can only remain in the school. A bit ridiculous but not distracting from the reality of the show\u2019s own situation. Or when Kill La Kill drove it\u2019s clear \u201cfascist school\u201d idea home, it\u2019s hyperbole reflected the tone, imagery, and story on every level, helped by it feeling far more fictional and otherworldly. Kakegurui is planted too far in reality to make that play as effectively.\\n\\n\r\nIn many a show about psychological warfare, there\u2019s this thing called the Xanatos Gambit that\u2019s used as a sort of tool to ensure that the main hero can never lose because they can\u2019t for the narrative of the story to work (plot armor so to speak). Light from Death Note uses it, Lelouch from Code Geass uses it, and Sora from No Game No Life uses it constantly. This Gambit so to speak ensures that the main character has secured a plan for victory every step of the way. Even if he/she loses he/she still wins because of something that has been planned for every foreseeable calculated probability. This takes some of the tension out of moments where it is all but ensured the audience knows the main character will succeed. All these characters find some exciting way to deceive the audience into how successful they will really be. In Light and Lelouch\u2019s case, it\u2019s never guaranteed that their plans have to go their way because they\u2019re not true heroes. There are chinks in the plot armor and not everything has to go their way to keep things interesting. Then there\u2019s Sora who always stakes his victory on absolutely everything so if he were to fail then the story would be over (at least in the anime I haven\u2019t read the light novels). Now it\u2019s no longer a matter of if they win but how.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Yumeko\u2019s concerned, the how and why is effective the first time but on repeating matches feels like the same clever trick over and over again just with a different coat of paint. It wasn\u2019t until the fifth episode that everything from the introduction of the villain to the formula of the match to the match\u2019s aftermath felt no longer felt predictable and the episode ended feeling like I saw something new. By the time cheating is common and all parties that are involved are assumed to be cheating the game of bluffs becomes more interesting. In addition to the normal rules, one must predict how their opponent may break them. Unfortunately, these tricks only work by blindsiding the viewer. The set ups for the bluffs happen off screen and you never get to feel involved. \\n\\n\r\nGoing back, remember when I was talking about the main character needing to revolutionize their world and help change the corrupted status quo was important to this kind of story? In the case of heroic characters, they are taught by reasonable down to earth people or knowing what it\u2019s like to be the best but still have respect for the little guy they are relatable and easy to root for despite their character flaws. These shows capitalize on the feeling of dragging scum of the earth characters down from their high horse and having the protagonist impart a crucial lesson about what makes them the better person and deserving of such victory. Yumeko has none of this. She is as sadistic as the rest of her opponents and shows absolutely zero sympathy towards the down trodden, failing to separate her from the evils she\u2019s up against. At first she\u2019s shown with this cute innocent fa\u00e7ade that crumbles as soon as it\u2019s revealed she\u2019s a hard core gambler. After her first and second match, it\u2019s clear as day that Yumeko is untethered to sanity. \\n\\n\r\nWhen she goes into her savage mode this is supposed to be satisfying to the audience. It is in a way that her opponent\u2019s own savagery was merely boastful and largely ineffective compared to her own. This is effective for a hot second but her wild demon-eyed craziness overstays this feeling and makes her out to be as demonic as her enemies. She makes her ambition clear from the start how she wants to rule over the school and reign supreme. She doesn\u2019t want to tear down the student council, she wants to replace it with the same thing but with her at the top. In a way, Yumeko gets to be slightly more modest in her deviant tendencies over the villains by not trotting upon the less powerful and sometimes even granting others liberation. Her way of doing so isn\u2019t so much by rescuing them from the evils they\u2019re bond to but rather convincing them to break away from their chains and embrace self-aggrandizement themselves. It borders on manipulation but in the end their life is better off at the expense of those less deserving so that is something. The gap between hero and villain is widened by virtue of comparing a lesser evil to a greater one but the line is often too blurred to tell the difference.\\n\\n\r\nAfter her third match and first loss her resolve remains unshaken despite the actual danger she\u2019s in seemingly absent of any emotional weakness. Although by reveling in the humiliation she manages to take away her victor\u2019s power over her which is only satisfying because of how simple and cartoonish I found that power-hold to be in the first place. This demonstrates the commitment to downplay perceived danger in order to create more grandiose stakes later down the line. Still this isn\u2019t the most relatable approach and I can\u2019t find it in myself to want to route for this kind of person. I\u2019m not sure if the show sees her as a hero like Kaiji or Sora or an anti-hero like Light and Lelouch. For some reason, whenever she\u2019s not gambling the show likes to treat her like the cute innocent girl she was from the beginning even though the audience clearly knows she\u2019s not. None of her emotions can ever be trusted as genuine, which is disconcerting for surrounding characters that continue to interact with her as if she might be normal. \\n\\n\r\nOne such character is Ryouta, a fellow classmate and clear audience surrogate. His surprise and utter disbelief at Yumeko\u2019s actions accurately summates the audience\u2019s initial reaction. Much like myself, he wants to be the voice of reason in her clearly unstable gambling-complex lifestyle. However, after each match (incidentally the point where Yumeko\u2019s personality gets reset at the beginning of each episode) he becomes friendly with her in a way that makes it seem like Yumeko\u2019s personality disorder didn\u2019t exist the day prior. I don\u2019t think Ryouta ever learned about sociopathic tendencies or schizophrenics. All this may very well change as I\u2019m sure manga readers would be aware. But as far as Yumeko\u2019s story arc so far, it goes nowhere fast. Ryouta is more likely to become a more independent individual in the future and should the story focus more on him and his growth as a competent member of the team the more interested I\u2019ll be.\\n\r\nAlso, after the first episode, the audience instantly knows the type of stake-raising competition anime this is going to be. Ryouta didn\u2019t get the memo and acts all surprised when Yumeko unsurprisingly resumes her role as local crazy gambling lady challenging her next victim, which if it wasn\u2019t obvious yet she destroys her because of course she does. Despite her opponent being on the student council, we\u2019re two episodes in and she\u2019s yet to be challenged. She loses the next match in the third episode because of dumb luck but not before realizing her opponents trick and utterly winning the psychological warfare portion of the match. The fact that she can win the \u201cgame\u201d but lose the match because of this luck factor doesn\u2019t instill much confidence. How will they continue to handle these losses while continuing to make the victories feel deserved; something Kaiji and No Game No Life has no problem doing because luck is either of little importance or a variable that can be magically manipulated. She takes her loss in stride because when you\u2019re the protagonist of this type of story what do you have to fear? I guess her and I are on the same wavelength in that regard, it would be worse if the show pretended she was actually in trouble. Also, did I mention she\u2019s a sociopath?\\n\\n\r\nSomething that appears copiously in Kakegurui is what I\u2019d prescribe as \u201cugly face\u201d because \u201cahegao\u201d just isn\u2019t descriptive enough. This is where an unlikeable character\u2019s face is drawn contorted and warped with a curled upper lip, twisted nose, and overly wrinkled eyes. All in order to really draw home how much pleasure they gain in their domineering behavior. This is used constantly in the show to great effect often highlighting their sexual deviance but I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m a fan of the effect and it\u2019s used a bit too often. For this to work, a character acts and is drawn in a way that is cute and pleasant, but then it is revealed to merely be a fa\u00e7ade by the animators/illustrators showing the character\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d face as perverse and twisted and how extreme the gap serves to accentuate the depth of said fa\u00e7ade. This is merely a groan-able offense, as I said earlier I think this attitude fits the style and tone of the show\u2026 BUT, when every character in the school has merely the same fa\u00e7ade this visual stunt feels exhausting and with each overuse, the effect is more ineffective than the last.\\n\\n\r\nI want to note that while I write about these issues, the length that I discuss them isn\u2019t equivalent to the amount trouble they cause. They\u2019re more or less bumps in the road to an otherwise good show, I just have a lot to say about it. Using gambling as an outlet to explore sexuality is concerning but also darkly humorous. I find the show's commitment to its insanity somewhat admirable even if I wish it went a bit further in its efforts or didn\u2019t use it in substitute for better character writing. However, these characters are far from having no appeal. Each villain\u2019s quirk is a tragic vice that flirts with power fantasies: control, fear, humiliation, adrenaline all ways to domineer themselves over their subjects and fuel their senses of sick superiority. The concept of self-destruction to gain self-gratification goes on in full force, which is both a great allusion to gambling as it is lust.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I don\u2019t feel like the show will take much of my nuisances into account and alter course towards something I\u2019d be a bit happier with. However, there are still enough enjoyable moments to keep me attached. Studio Mappa\u2019s animation style has a lot of visual hooks as well as interesting shot composition and editing. The excellent jazzy OP, rich in detail and meaning, made me want to come back to the show once a week despite my gripes but may just have been the shows strongest aspect anyway. \\n",

            "content": "Story 4: The story, as it is presented in the anime, is a pretty standard set up for the \"villain of the week\" formula, but sadly nothing more than that. The plot structure of Kakegurui seems similiar in nature to some battle anime, specifically Kill La Kill, but unlike Kill La Kill which used this structure as a means of highlighting certain narrative elements and in turn enhance the world building presented to us, Kakegurui uses this structure as a crutch, as to allow shallow world building, lackluster characters, and pacing that doesnt give you a moment to to stop and take in exactly whatis going on. The plot at best can be called uninspired, but at worst can easily be seen as a lazy and clearly thoughtless endeavor that the writers never took into concern. However, this structure does mean that moments that are egregiously poor ass quickly, and in turn keeps the attention of the viewer, which is the only real pro I can find.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6: On the other side however, we have the art, which is quite good. The girls while attractive feel much more adult like in appearance, which makes the scenes in which they....uhm....\"get their gamble freak on\", for lack of a better team,  all the more believable and all the more extreme visually speaking. It is consistently pleasing to the eye...except when it tries to raise the tension. You know what I dont like when Im invested in a moment, shaky cam, you know what they use alot in here...shaky cam, and it doesnt work at all, and instead makes a scene that could be intense feel comedic. Then there is the strange phonemina in the later episodes where plaid patterns on clothes move independent of the  character, as if the artist put a green screen over the clothes and just didnt properly crop the it or something, its quite jarring. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5: I hate to say it, but beyond the surprisingly excellent Op, which just over sells this anime to an incredible degree, the audio in this show is pretty poor. Sure the voice acting is solid, and the vocal range of the characters is excellent, but otherwise, there is nothing remarkable in this series' audio. The music is drab, the idol part is audio cancer, and I swear they use the same voice actor like 6 times in this show for different characters, once you notice it it becomes hard to not be pulled out by it. Nothing really remarkable in terms of music, and plenty of nitpicks to choose from is how id best summarize my feelings about the sound design.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6: The characters when viewed in a void could have been some of the best psychos in anime, but...when viewed in a group or with some context are flat and shallow. Take midari for instance, a character that I quite liked at first, shown at first to be a reflection of Yumeko, instead of rather sweet, she's aggressive, instead of being more dominant, she is submissive, but she is seeking the thrill of the gamble, though not to feel alive, but to truly experience a satisfying death, in otherwords the perfect foil for our protagonist and a character that we could see more development for...but it turns out no...she's just a masochist, and that is all, no growth, no intrigue, no follow through. ANd this happens constantly,  the series gives us tons of interesting characters with great chances for growth, but continuously squandered these chances for shock value and the continuous expression of our protagonists superiority over everyone else, which really gets old. By the end of the 4th game its pretty clear that she's a mary sue, but with a kink.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6: Kakeguri is fun and entertaining when viewed as nothing more than a 'villain of the week' action series with a focus on the schadenfreude element. Watching these horrible people get taken down is excellent fun, and gives an excellent sense of catharsis, but...well, it isnt much more than that. The moment you try to analyze this as something more, like analyzing it as a cautionary tale of the dangers of gambling, or as a tale of justice, or the difference between 'true gambling' and a 'gambling house', it all comes apart. This series is filled with idiosyncrasies that just kills any kind of deeper meaning it has. Regardless, it is still fun, in the same way watching a shitty asshole getting their dues is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5: if you enjoy watching terrible people getting whats coming to them, spliced with a surprising amount of sex appeal from teenagers that look...really adult like...to an almost worrying degree, than this is the perfect show for you. This show has tons of shock, awe, and catharsis.  This series is alright for a quick afternoon binge,with its flashy sets, swift pacing, and array of colorful, if flat, characters. The action may be well...uninteresting, the plot a bit dull, the stakes non-existent, and the plot predictable to a pretty tiring degree, but it is still something that IM sure you'd enjoy if you have a strong need for catharsis. However, if you'd like something with a bit more depth, or something with better direction, or better characters, action, plotting, animation, and if you just want to watch something that is better in every way you dont need to look far. Personally, Id suggest trying Prison School or Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor. Both have the cathardic elements, dark humor and raw extreme nature that Kakegurui mimics, but with a lot more meaning, depth, and over all enjoyment.",

            "content": "Kakegurui is one of the better examples of how an anime can surpass the manga. After reading the original series, I was skeptical of starting the anime, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. \r\nKakegurui is what I like to refer to as an \"edgelord\" anime. Its premise is ridiculous, but also so self-indulgent that it's absurdly fun to imagine all sorts of gratuitous self-inserts... \r\nYumeko Jabami is the new transfer student in a prestigious high school that is governed by how good you are at gambling. Everything, from your social standing to members of the student council, is decided by your abilityto outpace your opponent in a game of luck. As expected, Yumeko, through sheer talent and insanity, is able to climb up the school's ladder quickly while dragging along her hapless classmate, Ryota Suzui, who witnesses all of her impressive feats. (Oh hell yes, sign me up for this stupid garbage right now.)\\n\\n\r\nThe 'gambling battles' in the anime are hit-and-miss. The twists to how Yumeko outsmarts her opponent range from mildly clever to just plain stupid. Sadly, they fail to be as satisfying as needed in an edgelord anime like Kakegurui. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime is surprisingly enjoyable to watch. It strategically replaces one of the most confusing and nonsensical arcs against the student council secretary with another battle, which is far more entertaining and understandable. It doubles-down on its strongest quality, making every battle as excessively dramatised as possible with its animation style. The soundtrack is also surprisingly strong with often fast-paced and suspenseful tracks for the battles. \\n\\n\r\nKakegurui shows that it's not always necessary to have the smartest plot nor the most original twists for a series to be enjoyable. Watch it for what it is. \\n",

            "content": "Try to imagine Food Wars' but a very bare-bones plot and cooking is switched with gambling and that's Kakegurui. Oh but don't forget to add psychopathy to 90% of its characters. \r\nStory (2/10):\r\nNearly all of Kakegurui's entire runtime is devoted to gambling battles, so the story is barely sufficient setup. While it works for the first 2 times, it gets repetitive after that. Yumiko, the MC, doesn't have a motive to her gambling, she just does it for the fun of it. That's where I have a problem. See, the battles are done fairly well. Despite knowing before the game even starts that Yumiko willsomehow win, they were able to make the battles interesting by having all/most of the gambles they make on fake games, or otherwise ones that aren't usually bet on (ex: Memory). But when these battles have no end goal ahead, and you already know that Yumiko will, in fact, win due to poor writing, all of the battles lose their purpose. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): \\n\r\nThe art here is nothing to write home about except for the OP. The OP was very well drawn/animated and even at ep 12, I was still captivated by it. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nAs you would expect for a show with \"suspense\" and \"surprise twists\" and high stakes, characters often are surprised, triumphant, excited (read as: sexual excited), in despair, etc. This was (luckily) done very well. Not only that, but the OP was very catchy (in a good way) and I even added it to my playlist of anime music. Very well done in this department!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, most of the cast is comprised of psychopaths. This made the battles more interesting in some cases because Yumiko's opponents were hard to read, but in one or 2 cases it made it much easier. I won't say which to avoid spoilers. But even for the ones where it added mystery, you cant just make someone psychopath and call it good writing, especially with how often its done in Kakegurui.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\r\nDespite its many flaws, when I watched it, I was in need of a discount Food Wars and Kakegurui served that purpose. If that's what you want, try Kakegurui out. If not, well, its still a decent show, just don't expect the world from it. The OP was a shining star, and I highly suggest watching it on YouTube if you don't pick up the whole show.",

            "content": "Very interesting anime. (Minor spoilers)\r\nObviously, the first episode completely shocked me by the vast difference of disgusting features on a once average anime girl's face. Each episode left me astounded by the unique variety of hand motions, animations, and different expressions the girls would make.\r\nI'm sure the artists were trying to make a statement; as to say that gambling, or any form of addiction, can lead to insanity. The person would perhaps hide it behind a kind and warm smile, until you lose the match and their once soft expression changes to an evil grin.\r\nHowever, after the first two episodes, it became obvious to methat Yumeko was the main character, yes.. but she would also never lose. If she lost, then the TV show wouldn't have put 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I didn't quite understand was how the police didn't find out about this. I mean, the amount of money they put in to one game could range from 30,000 yen to at least 300 million yen. Perhaps even more, depending on how much a player bet.\\n\\n\r\nThe story/plot was very unique. I have actually never watched a gambling anime, and probably will never see one like this. Kakegurui sets the mood for the symptoms of addiction and what it can mentally do to your mind. The fact that someone can OWN another just by winning a gambling match is incredible, yet horrible.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing and so interesting. I like to have a bit of spook in anime, especially when you least expect it. And where would you least expect it? In a high school-themed anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good as well. The English dub and Japanese dub had much of a difference, and there were lots of languages to choose as dub. The music was okay in my opinion. There weren't exactly songs building up for things, since there would always be some kind of sound in the background. I did love parts where the orchestra would go crazy when Yumeko was about to say something insane.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were not very interesting besides Yumeko. Nothing was exactly special about Ryouta. He was basically supposed to be the nervous guy who thought Yumeko was crazy half of the time. It was kinda cool to see him actually do something in the end (I'm not saying what cause spoilers). Midari was pretty interesting to me. She wasn't like anyone else in Kakegurui; she showed signs of suicidal thoughts and rambled on about things. Pretty much everyone else in Kakegurui didn't show any sign of growth or maturity, and most of them just seemed like the same person, striving for that same goal of power. There wasn't any kind of actions that one of the characters would do and I would think, \"Oh yeah, that's so them to do somethin' like that.\" There weren't enough episodes even for character growth and development, and so far, the only intriguing characters I can think of are Yumeko and Midari.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this anime was great. My heart would quicken whenever Yumeko was stuck in a tight spot during a match, and I would actually be relieved that she won, even if I kind of expected the outcome. The different matches would leave me intensely focused on the details of how a game worked so that I would know what's going on for the next five minutes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend Kakegurui to people who like thrillers/horrors. Even though there is not that much gore, the language and disturbing scenes could really scare certain people. Though, I'm sure a person above 15 would be completely fine and love the TV show, depending on their taste in television. \\n",

But I did feel the ending was a bit frustrating and would've preferred to have a more fleshed out conclusion. I think they could've wrapped up the story within a season, with a couple more episodes. Personally, I don't see the point of a second season, but that's Netflix for you. I do think they could've explored more dimensions to each of the characters outside of gambling rather than quick summaries with flashbacks. But, overall I must say that anime did a great job of having a slick andintoxicating aesthetic that matches the gambling theme.",

            "content": "I honestly went into this anime expecting to hate it. I began watching it whilst doing work, but I soon found myself inexplicably drawn in- the characters are fairly two dimensional, Suzui who exists to narrate the show and be Jabami's foil is forgettable- and most of the cast are pretty, for lack of better word, meh. The sound design was alright, the music was alright, the art was alright; but somehow it came together to create something very fun!\r\nI was initially put off by the amount of close up shots to crazed expressions shown within the first 5 minutes of the show, and sawit as a bit of a not-very-well-done homage to Death Note. The first episode is a lot, but the further I went in the less I thought \"this is dumb\" and just enjoyed myself. It really did seem like Kill La Kill, but done in a less horrifically sexist fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a huge cast of girls, but they really don't serve as a harem or romantic interest for the males in the show! Everyone's shown on pretty equal footing, and Suzui's ends up serving as a self insert for those watching- but not in a way that it disrupts the show. He could not exist and the story and character arcs would be exactly the same. Of course there's a bunch of female characters in sexy poses and so on, but it's shown less as \"isn't this hot?\" and more, \"these people are nuts, right?\".\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it's a good anime to watch to pass the time, but it's not particularly deep or enigmatic. It's a fun show that know's what it is, and y'know what? That's really what we need sometimes.",

            "content": "I give this show a 7.5 rating overall. The art/animation and sound were both absolutely incredible and added to the show immensely. If it weren't for those two things, the show could've received a lower rating for sure. The art/animation and sound is what kept me drawn to the show, as it was so dark and disturbing in just the right way and with just the right amount. \r\nBoth the disturbing and pleasured expressions shown through the art was absolutely perfect for this type of show. They wanted the audience see exactly what the characters felt while gambling in an intense and dramatic way. Thisshow aimed to show you just why some people gamble: For the risk, fear, pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nFor the story itself, I had to give that a bit of a lower score because of my feelings about the finale. For a show that is meant to have this sort of repitition throughout the episodes, I think they did a good job handling that. The episodes all contained a sort of gambling with a new character, but it never felt entirely repetitive. As the show progressed, character development occurred and that's always my main focus in a show. Bad characters = bad story. You cannot have a good story with poor characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat leads me to my next factor: The characters. I thought the characters were surprisingly well rounded for a show with such a variety of characters. I honestly did not expect that after watching the first two or three episodes. HOWEVER, I had to give this a lower score because one of the MAIN characters--Ryouta--was not well rounded at all. He had barely any personality and barely any character development throughout the show. You had pretty much no reason to like or care about him whatsoever. He was boring. \\n\\n\r\nTherefore, overall I think this anime is worth the watch if you're up for something a bit dark and unsettling. Do not watch this anime if you want something cute and innocent. I can't say this was incredible because there were some aspects of the show that could've been improved to make me more addicted to the show. I think a huge part of that is Ryouta's character.",

            "content": "So I was really torn on what score to give this anime. On the one hand it has an appealing opening and ending theme, a few episodes that cover mature themes, attractive female characters with a fair amount of fan service, and a unique premise (a high school with a penchant for gambling). \r\nOn the other hand it has underdeveloped characters that only serve to provide exposition, a \"gamble of the week\" episodic format that results in no conclusion to the story, and really leaves me wanting something a little deeper. \r\nI would call this an \"edgy\" anime. The characters facial expressions are constantly exaggeratedto levels that I haven't seen since I watched Higurashi (or When They Cry in English). It seems so off putting at first but once it happens for the seven or eighth time you really just start to think its amusing. This show also loves to give the main character Yumeko glowing red eyes when anything intense or dramatic starts to happen. It really reminds me of Death Note when Light's eyes would constantly turn red. I mean hell, the student council president's eyes are constantly blue as well so you could say she is the L to her Light. Its stylish but ultimately unnecessary, in fact, at one point since Yumeko's backstory is never explained I thought she was some sort of demon or something but who knows.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say I thought this anime was enjoyable. I am a sucker for stylized shows with fan service and interesting music, I would even dare say I found some of the gambling matches entertaining due to the characters reactions. That is why I am giving it a 7 but really if they had fleshed out the characters more in say a 26 or even longer episode version of this show I feel like I would have loved it a lot more. It definitely has wasted potential although I have heard that the manga is better and that a second season of the anime is still possible.",

It's intro has our main Jabami going trough a buffet with a fork and knife and all the meals on the table are the opponents in the show. as if she actually means to devour them. great visualization and a very addictive song.\r\nJabami herself is a very interesting character. while underneath her gentle and polite exterior hidesa near psychotic and highly intelligent gambling addict. ultimately she means well. winning or losing isn't her concern, She's she loves the feeling of \"risk\" that comes with gambling and respects people who throw away their logic and sensibility for that feeling of risk. wether she wins or loses she'll look upon anyone who can give her a satisfying experience as a friend. \\n\r\nSadly I don't have much to say about the rest of the characters or villains. most of em are very run of the mill or one trick pony's.\\n\\n\r\nthen again the music and visualization in the show is phenomenal, the bright glowing eyes, the shadows, the overly superior smacktalk, the ugly and distorted gamble faces the characters make when they're losing it, On that note! I'm also very surprised that Kakegurui is brave enough to depict it's female characters with the \"ugly\" gamble faces. also Orgambles...many many... Orgambles. \\n\\n\r\nI'd say the only thing where it falls flat is keeping the tension high. the first...8 or so episodes really build up the ever increasing stakes of the gambles in question but then it reached a point of stagnation where they couldn't go any further. because once gambles revolve about life or death you can't really go any further. and anything after that feels underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\njust as an example; you can't follow up a game of Russian roulette, with a regular poker game in which a loss means getting expelled from school. You could almost call this the \"power-ceiling\" for gambling, and unless you can figure out creative way's to make the \"lesser stakes\" really mean something for your story things start to become boring really fast.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why I still hold Akagi and Kaiji in higher regard as the more superior gambling-anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nFor a good while until Made in Abyss gained much deserved popularity, Kakegurui was the most popular anime of the summer period and honestly out of all the summer anime's I've seen, it was just alright which was a little disappointing to me.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story mainly concentrates on Yumeko Jabami, who came to Hyakkaou Private Academy looking to see it can fill her gambling addiction and slowly over time, her reputation begins to grow.\r\nNow the story felt very similar to how Death Parade did things, both have the characters playing games, but are different every episode or so, except Kakegurui decided to makea bunch of these matches last a couple of episodes and it got a little tiring waiting for the outcome of these matches at a certain point.\\n\r\nHowever the show did a good job of making the matches suspenseful and coming up with ways of Yumeko defeating her opponents.\\n\r\nA big problem however is that the show mainly focuses on these gambling matches and hardly anything else, so the pacing felt off to me because most of the episodes were either, building up to the match or actually having the match so if you're here looking for character development then you've come to the wrong place since only one character gets any development whatsoever.\\n\r\nWhats even worse, is that the show was building up to this big climax with Yumeko taking on the student council president, but that final battle felt very unsatisfying and pretty much opens it way for a season 2, which after watching this I'm not looking forward to really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere was really only 2 or 3 characters that were really worthy of taking note of in this series and even then only one character was actually great, all the rest are pretty damn forgettable.\\n\r\nYumeko Jabami is the female MC and boy oh boy was she the star of the show, on the outside she may look like a pretty girl who act's all sweet and innocent, but really on the inside she is a manipulative, sadistic and addictive girl who just gambles for the thrill of it. She was a really interesting character and probably one of the best female characters I've seen this year (well the bucket list is pretty big though) mainly because of her personality, but she is really the only character who has something going for her in this show.\\n\r\nRyouta Suzui is the male MC and ends up being saved from a bad situation thanks to Yumeko, honestly though he is a pretty useless character since most of the time he whines about how risky the situation is and that's pretty much it, oh apart from this one time where he helps in the final match, but this is really the extent his character is taken.\\n\r\nMeari Saotome is the girl that was causing Ryouta trouble until Yumeko came along, honestly I didn't care for the girl at all, she was just the usual Tsundere trying to make things go her way and that was it, I literally gave no sh*t's for her.\\n\r\nYes there is a bunch more characters like the people Yumeko goes up against, but the only thing about them which stands out, is their insanity and that's it nothing else is remotely memorable about them.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis was pretty much the best part of the whole show, because the detailing on the characters faces was brilliant and hilarious at the same time, I'm serious every character made such a ridiculous face that they would be in you're nightmare's for all eternity or until you forget about the anime which is most likely to happen.\\n\r\nI want to say the setup's for the matches looked pretty good, but even they looked bland, well apart from the magical Idol singer stage thing that happened at some point.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op and ed were pretty damn poor for an anime like this, I was expecting something good and didn't enjoy either of them, hell I skipped the op every episode after episode 1 because I just couldn't get into it.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack however did save the show a little, it fitted very well with making the matches suspenseful and had me going till the very end of the matches.\\n\\n\r\nExtra's:\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing this show did absolutely brilliantly, it is the psychological aspect because each character you see who isn't Ryouta are fu*king insane for either power, money or just pure addiction and the best examples have to go to Yumeko and especially Midari who was so set on killing herself until Yumeko became her orgasm material, so yeah this show is full of messed up individuals.\\n\r\nAs someone who doesn't gamble whatsoever, I still thought the games involved were still interesting and were at least different every time so there was a nice amount of variety for the games involved in the show.\\n\r\nI don't know why the mystery genre is there, other than the outcome of the match there is much for this genre being there to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a alright anime, but disappointed me in certain areas. It made me feel like this was trying to be the next Death Parade, but failed in most aspects, it had the intense feeling the characters have during the matches, however it fails to recreate everything else.\\n\r\nI'm honestly surprised less popular anime's like Aho-Girl, Koi to Uso, Restaurant to another world and even Centaur Worries managed to entertain me more.\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for a very enjoyable show this isn't exactly the right place to be looking, unless you're a hardcore gambler.",

            "content": "The thrilling mystery sports-esque world of Kakegurui is utterly captivating. This shows basis is the raw adrenaline that occurs in the human body when getting the odds stacked up against them and having only \"luck\" to be your savior. To what extent does \"luck\" actually play in these sort of gambling games, this show questions that and fate itself while also delivering an absolutely thrilling argument for sadism. \r\nThe plot of the show itself is fairly simple and standard in terms of sports anime, although gambling isn't a \"sport\" it definitely takes many elements from this genre. New girl comes to school and needs towin her way to the top. Practically every episode ends up having a twist as it always seems that the MC will lose her gamble but most of the time, she knew something all along. The show doesn't completely abuse this trope because the MC will actually lose to some people so it's still relatively unpredictable. The art of this show is pretty great. There are some CG scenes of fast-paced cards moving or something similar that are great for building a sense of wonderment around gambling. Most of the girls have an utterly disgusting face they'll throw in which have much detail and are amazing. Nothing spectacular, everything is just pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP is amazingly catchy with a jazzy feel. The general sound direction is just decent, nothing really stands out in my mind and everything just felt in place. The ED is was also just decent. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty wild. It's an inane concept, a school based around gambling and using your parents millions of dollars to gain or lose social status within the school hierarchy, so all the characters have to be just as wild as this plot line. Then the true MC is your self-insert bland boy so while you get a taste of every other characters extremely distinct flavors, you get to settle yourself with the ever so grounded bland MC, which is actually pretty refreshing here. My overall enjoyment of the show is greatly enhanced by these extreme characters because it gets the viewer into a certain sense of disbelief that needs to be there for such an insane story. This isn't about superpowers or anything fantasy related, it's just gambling. How can you make gambling interesting? You make the people around it even MORE interesting. \\n\\n\r\nI give this show a +1 on a personal level because of how much I enjoyed the ride. It made me realize I have a little sadist in me and truly exploits the adrenaline rush you get in not knowing what the future holds for you, whether you're going to win or lose, almost felt like the show had luck built in it as you watch it through the first time. It did a great job making the viewer feel like we were gambling with the MC the whole time and the stakes were higher than ever before.",

            "content": "#SpoilerFree!#\r\nKakegurui is a gambling-based anime that tries to bring in a taste of the School genre but it failed to do so. I'm not hating on the anime but towards the end of it, it left me to realize that it wasn't very focused on the School genre and would've done equally good without using School (genre)\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story is obviously unique to the Game genre but it wasn't very clear what Jabami was trying to do. Sure she had a gambling addiction and wanted to be the very best but if she defeated the President, what was left for her? Who would she gamblewith? Can she even gamble with anyone else? Who knows (I want 2nd season)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nMAPPA really did it this time! They focused and concentrated so much on the character expressions and body features and managed to show insanity in some characters. It was really amazing! Last time I saw that type of animation was in Prison School\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nC'mon man, the opening and ending were really f**king good! I still listen to the ending on loop sometimes :P\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nWhile every key feature was great and all, the characters felt a bit off and weird. As I mentioned, Jabami Yumeko is a gambling addict but she was waaaaaaaaay into the gambling than expected! Meari, on the other hand, wasn't but showed off sometimes and Suzui was really kind. Overall, I'm happy there was a huge diversity and gap between each characters' personalities\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI loved the gambling scenes the most because of the awesome artwork, background music and expression of the characters coming to together, making a huge dose of dopamine but not big enough for a 10 though :/\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI wouldn't say this is the best mind-bending/game anime I've ever watched but it surely was good. The twist was really surprising and the cliffhanger was slightly frustrating \\n\\n\r\nNOTE: I was very dumb and vague on this review. I'll improve it asap\\n\\n\r\nNOTE 2: I'm a procrastinating bastard \\n",

            "content": "Kakegurui is a show that definitely follows a \"style over substance\" rule when it comes to storytelling. The show has some interesting themes and ideas that are largely overshadowed by some excellent visuals and intense battle scenes.\r\nThe show is set in a school for rich students, all the sons and daughters of society's elite. The performance of these students is not based on their academic ability, but their ability to gamble - demonstrating their skills in manipulation and risk-taking, the qualities necessary to succeed in the upper echelons of society. Money is power in the world of Kakegurui, the high-rollers sit at the top ofschool's food chain while frequent losers are treated like third-class citizens. Money isn't the only thing that can be put on the line though as Jabami Yumeko, our protagonist, will demonstrate.\\n\\n\r\nYumeko is a compulsive gambler, the fact that she comes from a wealthy family and has a seemingly endless amount of money at her disposal is largely irrelevant. Yumeko gambles solely for the thrill of it, often willingly putting herself into contests that she knows will be rigged against her. Our protagonist doesn't care as long as she gets the adrenaline rush that only comes from putting everything on the line.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the interesting plot setting is underutilised in Kakegurui. The class system that exists at the school and the politicking of the student council is rarely at the forefront of the show. Instead, we focus on Yumeko going from one gaming showdown to the next in order to get her next fix. Yumeko's hapless sidekick, Suzui Ryouta, would possibly make for a more interesting protagonist as a student who's barely staying afloat in a shark tank of a school.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Yumeko is still a fairly interesting character. Her opponents quickly realise that conventional logic goes out of the window when gambling against her, making her a dangerous foe. The contests always feel like they have real stakes and the viewer is often left in the dark as to Yumeko's plans and intentions. Is she bluffing? Is she intentionally trying to lose games? Is she just throwing caution to the wind? You're never completely sure until the chips are down and people are forced to show their hands. It makes for intense and dramatic viewing, even without the intrigue beyond the various card games.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Kakegurui really shines is in the art and animation of the show, which is simply gorgeous. A great deal of focus is put into the faces of characters, who more often than not have psychotic grins on their faces. Characters are often drawn with large mouths, giving them the look of a predatory animal as they try to maneuver their way to victory. The art really does a fantastic job of conveying the emotion of the characters, from the ecstasy of victory to the agony of defeat. \\n\\n\r\nThis is backed by some excellent sound, with Hayami Saori delivering an excellent voice acting performance as the enthusiastic and sensual Yumeko. The opening theme music captures the mood of the show perfectly, with erratic and upbeat jazz conveying the unpredictable world of gambling. There are lots of little flourishes with the sound design that also enhance the experience, such as the uncomfortable sound of grinding teeth to add more tension a high-stakes wager.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui's wider cast of characters are an entertaining bunch of oddballs. Suzui Ryouta and Saotome Meari make good foils for Yumeko, but the antagonists of Kakegurui are definitely the more interesting characters. The standout is the masochistic Ikishima Midari, who is definitely the character who has the most in common with Yumeko. Then there's the cunning council president, Momobami Kirari, who exudes an aura of menace and authority whenever she's on screen.There are many more antagonists, each with their own unique design and characteristics. None of the characters in Kakegurui are especially deep, but they are still entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, I enjoyed Kakegurui despite its flaws. The show is carried by some brilliant animation, great sound design and a fun cast of characters. The story felt a bit rushed and the ending leaves plenty of doors open for a second season, so I'm hoping that these will be addressed if and when a follow-up is released.",

            "content": "So this show is pretty bad and heres why. So first of all, the main focus of this series is the gambling. Seeing the rules of the gamble, how the opponent cheats, and how Jabami sees through it, all the while, seeing how all the characters react to the gamble as it progresses over time. Okay, so in a gambling anime, the emphasis is usually on how big of a pickle the main character is in and how he gets out of it, with the way having to be plausible. The first problem with this show is that the way Jabari figures how to getpass the cheaters is either through a way not presented to the viewer or due to her amazing senses or some random plot armor to keep the story going. But thats fine, that just means the story has to emphasize on the characters and how they react to the gamble. However, this also fails. All the characters are usually in 1 of 3 states: normal, scared, and ahegeo. The normal state is usually when the action is the lowest and they act the most normal.  This is where most of the differences are apparent. then theres scared which is when the opponent is losing( Jabari never goes into this state), and ahegeo where the character is very aggressive, sometimes sexually turned on, dominate, and usually has an either intimidating face or ahegeo face. This is the extent of emotions capable of the characters in this story. And to add insult to injury, none of the characters are interesting, you can sum up most of each character with one sentence. Theirs also a male protagonist who has almost no purpose and it feels forced in just because shows like this typically have a male lead even though the show would have not lost anything if he was removed. The only reason to really see this show is to see the op which is very nice. But thats it, an op. There are no other reasons to really watch this show besides if you actually just enjoy it.",

            "content": "Kakegurui tried very hard to be another Kaiji.  But, it failed miserably, because it also tried to be another Shokugeki No Souma.  And by trying to mix these two incompatible anime together, it failed to live up to either one of them, and became a disjointed and poorly executed letdown.   One moment you're watching Jabami playing an insane version of Russian Roulette in a dingy basement with a complete psychopath, the next moment, she's singing pop songs on stage as an idol contestant.  The anime completely lacked congruence and kept vacillating between mature and childish.   \r\nThe biggest problemwith the anime is that it wanted to be so much like Kaiji, but placed the story in a school, which is the worst possible setting.  Kaiji is one of the all time great animes because Kaiji was dealing with the Mafia and real life or death stakes.  Kakegurui couldn't realistically achieve those stakes in a school with a bunch of children.  So, it had them gambling with ridiculous sums of money that parents would never even make available to their children no matter how rich they were. No parent is going to let their kid gamble with billions of yen.  When they tried to up the ante to \"Betting your life\" it was the ridiculous notion that the Student Council could direct your entire life from start to finish at their whim.  It was just silly.  As silly as the idea that the financial and political leaders of Japan would let their children sit around school gambling all day with their money, and not ever actually attend a single class to learn anything.   \\n\\n\r\nThe second major flaw with this anime was the characters.  Jabami was the only likeable one.  Every single character was completely warped and sociopathic (including Jabami) with the exception of Suzui, who was so weak as a character, you might as well classify him as Jabami's personal eunuch.   It was very difficult to get behind the cast, because all of them were pretty much disreputable psychos, none of which were actually good gamblers.  And even though Jubami was a likeable character and interesting, she had no depth to her.  She was pretty much just a very perceptive girl with a crippling gambling addiction.  They spent literally no more than 7-8 lines of dialog explaining anything about her past before arriving to the school.  That's not an exaggeration.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd the worst part of it all, is that the ending was completely inconclusive, but I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it for those who decide to waste their time with this, anyway.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can really walk away from saying positive about this anime is that the art and soundtrack was outstanding.  The facial expressions on the characters were great, especially when they felt they had someone cornered.  The intro and outro for the episodes were also fantastic.  The soundtrack was very good.  But, good animation and a soundtrack can't save a poorly constructed anime.  At the end of the day this was nothing more than a B-rated \"Shokugeki No Kaiji\".  \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen Kaiji, I would highly recommend you skip this anime and go watch that instead.  It is truly one of the best anime ever made, and this one is wholly forgettable.  I will probably not even remember anything about it by this time next year.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 4 \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 4",

The backgrounds were really well drawn.\r\nAs a fan of jazz, I really liked background music because the saxophone is epic. The Opening was... meh at best. I feel like it didn't have a steady rhythm. The visuals for the Opening were astounding. Very smooth.\r\nKakegurui's story didn't feel like a gambling anime story. Sure it had gambling elements but it mainly focused on the Jojo style drama (Oh. My. Goood!) and while it tries to hype you up for the climax, the delivery was just solid and boring.\r\nBut hey, that'sjust my stupid opinion.",

If you like gambling and like Death parade ( which I am one of those fans ) then you will absolutely love Kakegurui. \r\n The plot is ok with a transfer student kicking peoples asses in a gambling match in a school so yeah it's kind of good. The detail that I really love with this anime is the art style which shows many reactions with the characters of what does nasty or pitiful faces look like not to mention whenthey gamble is outstanding. The theme song and themes you hear in the background are quite good to listen to some's a bit jazzy others are just interesting to listen to so I wouldn't quite be into the music if I were you. All the characters you see are outstanding since none of them are dull or boring they all have weird fetishes. (besides Kaede he has no fetish) They are all pretty amazing characters that have their own evil personality. I mostly enjoyed this anime since of all the suspense you can put on this anime is spectacular to watch and really adapts to the manga as well ( go read the manga too if you would like )\\n\\n\r\nI really recommend that you should watch Kakegurui since it is really is a good adaptation with the manga. Don't believe me then I suggest you go to Akidearest's channel on YouTube since she made an entire video on Kakegurui.",

            "content": "*Kinda Sorta Spoilers (But they aint really important)*\r\nAs someone who is perpetually facinated by the concept of gambling, i was excited when i read the premise of this show. So you can imagine my disappointment when i am given the biggest wet blanket of a show i've seen in a while.\r\nThe premise, an academy where people gamble against each other after hours, has potential. Unfortunatley, this premise is completley wasted on this show. The story follows a girl named Yumeko as she attempts to gamble her way through the ranks, defeating \"skilled\" gamblerafter \"skilled\" gambler, and that brings us to my first, of many, complaints of this show. The first time we see our main character gamble is against someone who appears to have high standing in the system, they play a game of rock, paper, scissors but the options are all on a random selection of cards that are drawn by the rest of the class. At first, it seems that this \"gambler\" has the upper hand... but then it all gets ruined by discovering that she's a cheater as, as it turns out, all (okay, most) of the high level students/gamblers are cheaters. This transformes this anime from the high-tension gambling show i so wanted it to be into a strange, boring, mystery show in which the main character must discover how the other \"gambler\" is cheating.\\n\r\nThe characters are somewhat interesting, while being shallow and boring. Every single character only seems to have one thought, one trait and nothing else. Wants to gamble, is a coward, gambling turns her on, and so on.\\n\r\nAs for the art/animation, its alright. The villan characters look so revolting during a match that i wanted nothing more than to punch them right in the nose, and thats a good thing btw. There is little in the way of CG in this show, apart from some glowing eyes and some turning of cards, so it remains at an acceptable level for me as i dislike when shows use the CG too much. All in all, the animation does its job, but nothing more.\\n\r\nComing to the sound, the opening is absolutley fantastic. I love the song and the bizzare animation is fun to watch. As for music used in the episodes, most of it is completley unnoticable or forgettable and , imo, fails to do its job.\\n\r\nTowards the later half of the show, the games that the creators come up with for the characters to play become more and more dumb and bizzare. Imagine how dismayed you will feel when what you hoped would be a gritty, intense gambling show devolves into two girls dressed as idols prancing about on stage for another dumb game (although i love idol shows, but i wanted this to be different).\\n\r\nOverall, this show is a solid \"meh,\" watch it if you feel like giving it a try, but i can't reccomend it to anybody.\\n\r\n4/10\\n",

            "content": "Gambling for the sake of gambling. Gambling for going deeper into madness. Gambling for the thrill of losing everything with one wrong move. This is what Kakegurui which literally translates to Compulsive Gamble is all about. In a way it is a love letter to gambling and the madness that entails it.\r\nKakegurui starts out with the main protagonist, Jabami Yumeko, enrolling in Hyakkaou Private Academy. The academy\u2019s most centralized of traditions is gambling as it helps their students who come from rich and influential families learn how to negotiate and read people better. Jabami Yumeko looks like an ordinary beautiful girl but all that changeswhen gambling is involved. She suddenly becomes a sociopath that easily gets off from the thrill of gambling and becomes so enraptured in it that she can easily swallow those around her to take the bet with her. She can easily read all the possible tricks through deduction and all in a calm manner but she is by no means perfect as she can also lose even by luck.\\n\\n\r\nIn the academy, the student council reigns supreme and imposes a tax law for the gambles. If the participants are unable to pay the tax then they become \u201clivestock\u201d which is basically the lowest of the lows in the academy\u2019s social hierarchy. Since the students come from very well-off families, the amount of money being gambled start off at really high amounts and the debts can even go into the billions range. It doesn\u2019t stop at just money as even more can be placed on the betting table.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Yumeko-san read her enemies and beat them is as fun as it is erotic since nearly everyone in the academy is nuts in one way or another but Yumeko takes the cake 40 levels higher than the limits. The anime is much more depraved and entertaining than Kaiji which is a gambling anime from a decade ago. It would be fun if the two ever meet in some crossover though most likely that will never happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite questionable especially the viewpoint main character Suzui, Ryouta, as he is quite the opposite of Yumeko-san and is the only truly sane person in the whole anime. The relationships between them are also quite odd and does not make much sense except for one of them who is just using Yumeko-san for their own ends.\\n\\n\r\nGambling has never looked so animated before and I mean that in both a figurative and literal sense. The animation quality is so high that it easily trumps those action oriented anime to shame. This has been the most impressively animated non-action anime I have ever seen that is not done by the legendary KyoAni, so kudos to MAPPA. The level of art was also as equally impressive as the characters would show off their gambling faces which showed so much emotion and detail that it was downright disturbing. Even the iris had so much detail to it that I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how much did the producers pay for this level of detail, though with Square Enix being one of them I wouldn\u2019t really be surprised how they managed to achieve this quality. This animation style was the closest I have ever seen to be a match to hentai animation as I felt like I was literally watching hentai in many scenes. The level of eroticism in this anime is so prevalent that some characters got so wet and drooled so much, they were an open book. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have seen an ahegao (intense amount of sexual pleasure that is translated in facial expressions) in this anime, the frequency made this the number one anime of all time (to my knowledge) to have so many ahegao.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was also quite exceptional as they were very distinct and matched the mood so well especially at the height of a gamble. The opening was one of the most, if not the most, animated opening sequences I have ever seen. It didn\u2019t take me long to guess what theme they were going for with the animation which is \u201cdevour.\u201d Gambling can easily devour anyone, so the opening fits quite well with it. The ending was also fun to watch since it shows Yumeko-san\u2019s descent (or ascent) into madness in a very erotic catwalk. The voice acting was also very well done as the characters felt so alive whenever they talked and especially when they showed their gambling faces. The most exceptional case was Hayami Saori\u2019s voice of Yumeko as it was one of her most memorable performances ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are ever in the mood to watch a thrill, some gambling, or girls getting wet and show ahegaos in a non-hentai (or even hentai) way, then go ahead and descend into the madness that is Kakegurui.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

One day Jabami Yumeko transfers into this prestigious academy. A girl with a serious gambling problem and the roller coaster goes from there. \r\nI honestly thought Yumeko was going to be op throughout this series, but her development and the relationship with those around her was sheer brilliance. The story never bored me throughout the entire series.\r\nArt and Animation: Well studio Mappa hit a grand-slam with Kakegurui. Good lord this animation was basically flawless.I can describe the Art and Animation with one word; Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Acting: Again flawless the Opening and Ending were two of the best in 2017 and the BGM was freaking fantastic. I will buy the soundtrack when it gets released and I never buy soundtracks, but this one is worth it. The Voice acting though...oh my good Saori Hayami and Miyuki Sawashiro gave me chills throughout this entire series. They took a step out of their comfort zone and went with more Yandere-ish characters and they nailed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Again back to the acting which played a huge role in this anime. The characters were a joy to watch. Can't really discuss more due to spoilers but Yumeko and Suzui have more of a Holmes and Watson relationship then anything else which is something I enjoyed. There's no need to bring romance into this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. They captured the passion and feeling for gambling perfectly. Someone who had a problem with gambling can relate to everything these characters are feeling. They nailed it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would highly recommend watching this anime. It's honestly fun at points but really it's pretty serious most of the time. I was on the edge of my seat for most episodes because I had no idea what was going to happen. 99% of the time it was unpredictable.",

            "content": "If you like to gamble, I tell you I\u2019m your man, you win some, lose some, it\u2019s all the same to me.\r\nStory:\r\nFirst off, this anime is utterly ridiculous. A school where everything including your future is constantly gambled upon with no adult authority figures and a student council that is absolute in power? Gimme a break. For people to accept such an unrealistic setting, you will have to be entertaining and well-written, otherwise your house of cards will come crumbling down. Or you can, like, just play up the ecchi and hope nobody notices. The games used in this show are pretty creative to behonest, but I had a really hard time following the rules. If you come up with a completely new game and want your characters to exploit it to their benefit, you need to give your audience more time. If I barely understand what they are doing, how am I supposed to realize that they are doing something extraordinary? On the occasions I did indeed understand what was going on, the games were very entertaining and the thought process of the participants was well done. But then it was already over, puff. That was quite unsatisfying for me, I would have loved to see more of the matches I liked. Kakegurui also has a problem with its structure. You can\u2019t have the final battle be not even half as long as most matches against her lackeys, no matter what kind of game you picked for that duel. The ending is anime exclusive from what I know, but they managed to leave it half-open, so that a return is possible should a second season be decided upon. I feel like a broken record, because I keep repeating this a lot recently, but this show could have been better with a better pacing.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nKakegurui is all about the faces, let\u2019s be honest, that is what people will remember about this show. And they are fantastic indeed. The contrast between the actually pretty sexy and gorgeous ladies and the horror that is what I call \u201cserious close-up\u201d is hilarious and works wonders. I\u2019m very sure that a remarkable number of viewers discovered a whole new kind of arousal. They were somewhat creative with the character design, as much as the limitation to the school uniform allows for this. Everybody had a memorable look, except maybe our male lead, but we get to that boy later. So yeah, in terms of animation and style, Kakegurui is quite impressive. There is one scene where we see two girls singing and dancing that was rotoscope if I\u2019m not mistaken. That is something I do not enjoy, but I understand that it\u2019s a matter of taste and not quality, so for the sake of this section, I will not take this into account.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI love openings with a big band feeling, I loved it when Cowboy Bebop and Baccano did it and I enjoy Kakegurui\u2019s opening as well. I also acknowledge the creativity put into the ending song, even though it\u2019s not so much to my liking. In terms of anime openings and endings, I\u2019m a huge advocate for trying different styles of music, it doesn\u2019t always have to be J-Pop. So, as you can guess, the idol part in this show did nothing for me, that was easily my least favorite arc. The voice acting was superb, all the characters had\u2026er, well, character. I have the impression, that female seiyuus really enjoy voicing loud, angry or deep-voiced characters, must be great to not do a squeaky high-pitch for once. Saori Hayami has made her way onto my watchlist, I still can\u2019t believe that all the roles she\u2019s been doing are the same person.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe girls, Yumeko most of all, are very entertaining to watch in their silliness. They are either addictive gamblers or megalomaniacs or some variation between these. Yumeko reminded me a lot of the early chapters of Yu-Gi-Oh, when the pharaoh was still a murderous lunatic. But instead of killing her opponents, she just has multiple orgasms while gambling. I\u2019m not complaining. Her predator-like sexual aggression while gambling is in stark contrast to how she behaves outside of these games, where she seems to be a nice, cheerful girl. Most of the others are not AS twisted as her, but they are definitely a couple of two-faced bitches. The only one who has lost even more marbles than Yumeko was Midari. I was shocked to find out that there is a real life fetish like hers, called autoassassinophilia. In total, these girls are fucked up, but they are hilarious and interesting and that is worth a lot.\\n\r\nWhich brings me to\u2026wait a sec, I have to look up the name\u2026Ryouta, that\u2019s what it was. The poster child for every forgettable, bland, beta cuck male main character you know. I have no idea what his point in this anime was, except maybe as sex slave for Yumeko after getting all hot and bothered by her latest gamble. At least that\u2019s what I think happened when the camera was off. That guy is so meaningless that you cannot help but come up with an outrageous theory like thisyourself. He served absolutely no purpose. I think they tried to make him important in the final episode by giving in to the gamble fetish, but it did not work for me at all.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nKakegurui was certainly a fun watch, but I don\u2019t think it has much of a rewatch factor. This is one of those anime that you can easily pick up if you don\u2019t really know what you wanna see and just want something easily digestible and mildly entertaining. It was able to smooth over its weaker parts with its other qualities, so it never went into a territory that required me to shake my head. If you want to watch a gambling anime, I don\u2019t think this is exactly what you are looking for. There are some mind games, yes, but they aren\u2019t the focus and the matches are way too short anyway. I\u2019d say Kakegurui didn\u2019t really do anything wrong, but it didn\u2019t provide much either.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.2/10",

The games themselves were innovative and fun to learn with each episode. The titillating characters are colorful and have interesting back stories, which is impressive considering the length of the series and how longer more fleshed out anime often fail to do this. The art style is crisp and each character has their own look. The close-ups of facial features were my favorite parts of this series because it captures the absurdity ofcertain situations. This was a great watch and I would definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "One of my favorite aspects of anime is its ability to take a totally unbelievable premise and present it in a completely serious way that would never fly in another medium. This is exactly what you get with Kakegurui.\r\nWhy do teachers allow students to form an organized gambling ring in the school? How was a student council, which promotes a blatant system of oppression, even elected in the first place? Are parents really ok with allowing their children to bet millions of dollars on an after-school game of poker?\r\nAnd, perhaps the most important question of all, who cares? \r\nSure, there are a lot of elephantsin the room, but these elephants are damn cool. With Kakegurui you're getting an original, thrilling anime, so who's to blame you if you simply close you're eyes and enjoy the ride. (Don't actually close your eyes. If you do, you won't be able to see your computer screen).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's strongest and weakest point has to be its characters. As one might expect from a school full of gamblers, every character is a psychopath on some level, and Kakegurui does a great job of juxtaposing these various personalities. What's more, (almost) none of the characters are expendable, with even the minor characters serving as foils which offer the viewer striking comparisons. The one exception to this would be Kakegurui's protagonist who, in keeping with the time-honored tradition of Japanese animated culture, is virtually nonexistent. In an anime as wild as Kakegurui, this is almost forgivable. The protagonist  offers a more normal lens through which the demented behavior of the rest of the characters, and I found myself craving his commentary about one-third of the time just to have some normalcy. The other two-thirds of the time I either wished he would get lost and make room for the more interesting characters, or else forgot he existed entirely.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough we view the show and the self-destructive actions of its many insane characters through the eyes of a sane (and boring) protagonist, Kakegurui never feels like a public service announcement, courtesy of the Japanese, against the horrors of gambling. The show's characters tend to suffer in relation to their lack of internal stability and, generally speaking, each character's greed or arrogance eventually leads to their downfall. This isn't always the case, however, as some of the more mentally sane, goal-driven characters take massive losses as a result of their tenancy to play it safe. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the show's repetitive premise, it never got boring. It was incredibly entertaining to watch the characters weasel their way in and out of trouble by making the tables turn dramatically one way or the other, and the fact that the bets were often won by cheating only added to the fun. The games in which the characters participated were a joy to watch - always with some type of original spin but never too complicated to be understood.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the ending was completely anticlimactic (probably something to do with trying to cap off a 13 episode show while staying faithful to the original source material) but, considering the sheer brilliance of the anime's jazzy opening, I'm willing to give back some partial credit. All things considered, Kakegurui was a joy to watch as long as you're willing to put up with some occasional issues.   7/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gambling is easy.\u00a0 Put your life savings on the table, play a game of your choice, and come out either richer or much poorer than you were when you came in.\u00a0 That's all good and all, but you want more, something to satisfy the gambling craving that you've grown accustomed to.\u00a0 So put on your big anime tiddies, brush back your long black hair, slap a metal ring on your left thumb, and prepare to ahegao, it's Kakegurui.\r\nStory: Hyakkaou Private Academy is a...peculiar academy.\u00a0 In order to prepare its students for the important positions that they'll succeed from their parents, the school after hours turnsinto a place for exchanging money and bets through cards, chips, and dice as students gamble away parts of themselves where, if they end up poor enough, are deemed as a 'house pet' by the school, mistreated and bullied for their lack of status.\u00a0 It's here where a new student by the name of Jabami Yumeko enters the fray of this dog eat dog world of gambling, showing the school and its student council that they let a fox in the henhouse.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing its original source material, Kakegurui follows the story of Yumeko (and Suzui too, I guess) as she gambles her way through various characters from small fry among the student body, to larger prey in the student council as she bets everything she has going up to the top.\u00a0 Each few episodes is dedicated to a specific gambling battle with different opponents, games, and stakes tied to each of them with Yumeko ending up making a name for herself in the academy.\u00a0 There's...just one problem with this.\u00a0 It's not satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Kakegurui is the fact that practically any and all stakes put down by any of the gamble's participants are...negligible.\u00a0 With each progressive gamble, the show stacks up more and more money, higher and higher stakes to the point of even risking the characters' own lives only to have nothing happen in the end.\u00a0 If you plan to make such ridiculous sums, someone's gotta pay the price.\u00a0 Yet at the end of the day, it never seems like the show wants to put anyone down, making the gamble pointless because no one pays anything.\u00a0 Sure there're some things noted aftereffects, but there're so minor that it doesn't really matter.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the show manages to cover up these problems (sorta) by having an exorbitant amount of style and energy with its storytelling and pacing.\u00a0 A majority of the show's screentime is focused on its gambles and the thought process between each gamble's combatants, making the overall viewing experience rather immersive due to how involved the show gets with its core battles and gambles that it advertises.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kakegurui is a flawed yet exciting piece of media that puts style over substance.\u00a0 Indeed the show lacks a lot of storytelling quality due to the false sense of risk with the result of each gamble, making that up only through its efforts to try and make the actual event as exciting and orgasmic that it can possibly be.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Exudes excitement and thrill\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Very few actual 'gambles'\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The enigmatic vixen of the series, Jabami Yumeko comes in as the wrench thrown into the plans of the academy's student council.\u00a0 Living purely for the thrill and excitement of gambling, Yumeko is an addicted freak with her biggest (and potentially only) trait to her character being how much she's willing to take a risk and the pleasure she takes from doing it.\u00a0 While yes Yumeko is an entertaining and unique character, her addictive trait begs the question of really what her motives really are.\u00a0 Acknowledging her as an enigma is interesting, but there's nothing else to her aside from wanting to bet her money or herself for poker pleasure.\u00a0 What's more is that the show questions her motives through the usage of other characters, only to get no payoff at the end of the day because \"no one gets her\" so it kinda makes me wonder why the show even bothers trying to hint at a deeper more secretive part to her character when nothing really happens.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Suzui Ryota, the beta male of the series and the customary 'explanation' character for those unable to fully comprehend what's going on at the current moment of time.\u00a0 Either that or there always needs to be a narrator character.\u00a0 Throughout the series, we see Ryota following behind Yumeko's tail after a first encounter of the terrifying yet alluring nature of this strange girl, attempting to be the show's voice of reason and as mentioned before, narrator character to add an explanation to those that need it.\u00a0 Quite honestly, there's very little else to tell about Ryota.\u00a0 His role is surprisingly minimal for being the show's main male protagonist, and any connections/motivations he may have always tie back to Yumeko, so in a sense, he's just an extension of her character.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as other cast members go, we have Saotome Mary, a girl who surprisingly enough, is affected by the backlash of debt and loss in a fairly big way (in terms of where in the story it happens), and the members of the student council where Yumeko challenges each one of them, increasing with position as the series goes on.\u00a0 Members of the student council really don't have that much going for them.\u00a0 Sure they hold the highest amount of power in the school, but each of their individual motives for having Yumeko fight them are quite shoddy and are sort of a one and done deal with each 'defeated' member being forgotten so we can move onto the next.\u00a0 There's not much investment for them, and the resulting end for the finale is such a cocktease that I'm not even sure why MAPPA went for the anime-original ending where again, nothing really matters in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Relatively interesting main protagonist\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Very little time investment for each 'opponent'\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Male protagonist is just kinda...there\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by MAPPA, Kakegurui is no doubt a show that lives up to its original source material.\u00a0 Replicating the original manga's style, the show exudes a fluid style capable of distorting the appearance of characters, turning them demonic with scarily detailed faces, to its more casual style with everything looking more like a 'normal anime'.\u00a0 Its charm really shows in the art as the closeups and dramatization add to the overall hype of how the show builds up to the climax of each gamble.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the show has a few quality issues.\u00a0 Particularly with the last few episodes, MAPPA seemed to have dropped the ball with quality checking the 'normal anime' sections, as many times the art doesn't really have the quality or polish that its first few episodes had.\u00a0 There's also a surprising lack of imagery from the anime, which honestly would've fit the show greatly due to its affinity with seeing gambling more than just a game.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Style matches up with the original in spades\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Later episodes show quality problems\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound...doesn't really need words.\u00a0 Its opening \"Deal with the Devil\" is very reflective of the show's obsessive and even sexual nature as the stylistic opening showers us with imagery hinting at what's to come combined with an energetic and sassy jazz theme with its artist 'Tia' providing alluring vocals to compliment the song's wild nature.\u00a0 Definitely a memorable piece.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the show's ED, \"LAYon-theLINE\" by D-selections is a more celebratory piece with more expressive vocals relative to the show's OP by losing sexual appeal in exchange for the kind of pure bliss and euphoria achieved with winning a big gamble.\u00a0 Personally, I don't think it's as good as its partner OP, but it's still something worth a listen to.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also worth noting Hayami Saori's performance as Jabami Yumeko.\u00a0 Her voice provided a perfect balance of the two faces of the main protagonist capable of going from sweet and innocent to obsessive and crazy at the drop of a dime.\u00a0 The flawless transition made Yumeko even more enjoyable to watch and was honestly a really good performance worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Memorable soundtrack\\n\r\n+ Hayami Saori did a great job\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Kakegurui was...an interesting edition to my list.\u00a0 If you ask me, the show screams 'fun' more than anything else.\u00a0 With all of the cheating asspulls and the no stakes yet still exciting gambles wildly happening on the screen, the show was certainly an immersive watch.\u00a0 For a while.\u00a0 The problem was the fact that the show felt too comfortable in its formula and the expectant result of a progressively scaling show like this really didn't excite me.\u00a0 Sure Yumeko was getting wet, biting her nails at the prospect of seeing herself win it all or lose it all, but quite honestly, I just sat there like a dead fish in later episodes unable to feel the pleasure that she was having because of the show's repetitive nature.\u00a0 To me, it was fine, but nowhere near anything worth the kind of praise it's been getting.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nDespite my personal criticisms, the show was still fun to watch.\u00a0 Its early episodes had me enraptured in its formula, but too much of a good thing ended up spoiling the joy that I had with the series early on.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of specifics, the last two arcs and especially the last episode were really, REALLY weak.\u00a0 There was absolutely no payoff for either of those.\u00a0 Nothing substantial actually happened and I felt rather aggravated knowing that I spent my time watching something that didn't even matter in the end.\u00a0 That's not something you do to your audience.\u00a0 Don't do that.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes...and no.\u00a0 Kakegurui is certainly worth a watch because it has the whole 'thrill' aspect to it with its main protagonist going through the school making her spine tingle (among other things) with cards and chips, but it should not be taken as anything other than light entertainment.\u00a0 With the main problem of 'nothing matters at the end of the day', the only reason to even watch this is to have fun and watch something that prides itself in style over substance.\u00a0 Cause if you plan on watching it and think about it too much...you're gonna have a bad time.",

            "content": "I've always had a fondness for gambling anime and manga. When done right it is a great to not only show off some fun games and battle of wits, but also to study the characters partaking in the gamble. There's few other situations which offer the same thrill as seeing a protagonist manage to outsmart their opponent to turn a losing game completely around. The problem with gambling, however, is that it is reliant on luck in real life. Luck doesn't translate well into storytelling short of throwing actual dice to decide the outcome of the story there's no way to make it feel authenticand so when making a gambling anime you have to think of games that have exploits so that characters can tip the scales in their favour making it so that a win won't feel like it was pulled from where the sun doesn't shine.\\n\r\nSo does Kakegurui manage create any meaningful suspense or build good character profiles?\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you look at the score I gave to the anime the answer should be obvious. Review over. Everybody pack up and go home. Nothing to see here anymore.Seriously though, the anime fails completely and utterly in almost everything it tries to do.\\n\r\nStarting off we have the games. Now some might argue that the games are not Kakegurui's central focus, but with a title that translates to 'Compulsive Gambler' and with every single episode being about one game or another that argument loses a bit of weight. Even if they're not the central focus I still expect them to be interesting, creative and challenging. The viewer should be able to play along with the games trying to figure out how to outmanuever the opponent together with the protagonist. And here I feel is the first of many faults that Kakegurui has: we don't get to peer into our main character Jabami's thoughts. Allowing us to hear her thoughts would be an effective way of letting us relate to her more and it would actively engage us in the game being played rather than some worthless side banter about how gambling is its own reward.\\n\r\nThe games are also not all that interesting. They're mostly spins on games everyone already knows, but they're somehow made less interesting. They're generally constructed in a way which, at least on the surface, tries to eliminate cheating in any way. This makes the games reliant on chance, which as I said above, doesn't exist in a story. Jabami's wins and losses all fell scripted and not at all earned. And even when cheating does occur Jabami's massive brain figures it out and counters it way before we every find out about it.\\n\\n\r\nI've mentioned a few issues with our main character so far so I think it would be fair to discuss her next. As a side note, I think she's the only character worth talking extensively about because sidekicks Suzui and Mary are a wimpy self-insert character there only because the audience needs a proxy and a rather boring and empty enemy-turned-ally respectively and the antagonists and side characters being one-note baddies with one or two defining characteristics which sometimes just boil down an outlandish costume. \\n\r\nSo, Jabami is your average high school aged girl with problems such as having infinite money or being instantly popular wherever she goes. She also has a burning passion for gambling and will not hesitate mentioning this fact every chance she gets. She's also quite unstable.\\n\r\nI hope you can see some problems in the description I gave. If you didn't, then let me help you a bit.\\n\r\nFor one, she's a protagonist in a gambling anime who doesn't care about money because she has some undefined amount of money hidden somewhere. This creates two problems, one is the fact that no matter how high the stakes in a gamble are raised Jabami doesn't feel the slightest amount of concern for her survival. After all, if I had infinite money I wouldn't mind spending a billion yen on poker either. The second problem is a result of the first, to compensate for the large amount of money Jabami supposedly posses the writers escalate the stakes to incredible proportions right out of the gate, millions upon millions of yen get tossed around like it's nothing. This is a problem because very few people can relate to characters which posses that much money, nevermind Jabami Yumeko, you can't even relate to side-characters or antagonists because they're just too wealthy.\\n\r\nYou'll hear me talk about relatability here a lot because for a show that is supposedly about characters some of these characters are about as relatable as Superman and the Joker. They either move around 'superhuman' sums of money or they're off their rocker. And Yumeko is both. Not only does she have money that rivals Bill Gates himself, but she also doesn't seem to posses anything close to common sense. Her one defining characteristic, and frankly her only characteristic, is that she likes to gamble... a lot. We get constant reminders about how she loves the thrill of a gamble more than anything else and she will do anything to protect the luck element in a gamble. Oh would you look at that? Now our main character outright refuses to cheat in any gamble so that she can leave everything up to chance. I don't think I need to mention for a third time my complaint with this.\\n\r\nAnd to compound all of this and to really destroy any chance we still had to be able to resonate with Yumeko at least a little she is also an amazing genius. Now if you can relate to geniuses then that's great, but for us normal folk it's a little bit hard unless we either get to see how the genius thinks, which we don't, or if  we see genuine human emotion, which again we don't because Yumeko only has two emotions: calm and super pumped for a gamble. Neither of which are explained deeply so we may understand her. All we get is Yumeko being a super genius and we just have to accept the fact that she can memorise one hundred litte marks on the backs of some cards in about five minutes. Up until when that game came up, the hundred card one, I was genuinely still trying to play along and try to like the anime, but it self-destructed itself at that point. That was in around episode two so you can see why I would dislike the anime, having to put up with ten more episodes of the same trite writing.\\n\\n\r\nDid I say enough about Yumeko? Probably not. I might keep remembering things I disliked about her and could've written here well into next week, but I'll just move on to bigger and not-better things. Namely the setting. Kakegurui is set in a high school where gambling is allowed and encouraged. Those who win big get to take Scrooge McDuck style money baths while the losers get branded as pets. It's a pretty simple setup that fails right from the start.\\n\r\nFirstly, why a high school? Setting your story in a high school is generally a good way to absolutely destroy any suspense that the characters are going to be fine. You can't have the students playing actual russian roullette and losing in the school because then the government is going to come and arrest everybody in charge and close the high school. Because of the setting you know the characters are going to be fine no matter what. It's like watching Rambo, but instead of real weapons they use paintball guns. Sure they may sting, like losing a few million yen stings, but at the end of the day they're not going to die and in Kakegurui they don't have any lasting consequences either since they're still minors with parents to back them up.\\n\r\nThe writers work around this by creating 'life plans' which dictate a person's life if they lose too much money. But really, how sorry can you feel for someone whose life plan mentions marrying a high ranking official? They may not love who they marry, but it's certainly a fate better than starving to death.\\n\r\nSecondly, why in the world is it a high school? Yes it's to mention it twice. Not only does it destroy any suspense or thrill it also destroys my suspension of disbelief. In no world would I believe that such a high school is allowed to continue existing. Especially when we are not shown any adults running the place. I doubt anyone in any world would think letting a teenager student council president run a school would be a good idea. Where do they get all of their money? Their parents? How come their parents can spare millions upon millions of yen for worthless high school gambles? How did the government approve a school where seemingly nothing is being taught, but instead it's the worst den of gambling known to man? People are allowed to bet way more in this school than anywhere else. When things like one's life are routinely put on the line in a place like this you'd think people would come investigate.\\n\r\nAnd all of this could've been solved if they either made the setting something other than a high school, or made the gambling inside be high school be secret and not endoresed by everyone and the main selling point of the school. The way it is now I have to strain myself to believe anything that happens in the show. That is in addition to straining myself to watch the show in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nI'm tired of talking about things I dislike about the show, I really am. I wanted to like the show so much when it came out and it ended up one of the single biggest disappointments I've experienced in all of my anime watching. But there are a few bright spots I can mention.\\n\r\nFirst comes the absolutely great opening. The music and animation are radically different from the usual J-Rock/Pop and character show-off you get most of the time and I like it. Though it does slightly misrepresent the show, while the opening does have a general theme of sexuality, specifically female sexuality, which is presented more subtly and in a serious tone through the actions of the characters in the opening rather than panty shots (though we get those too), the anime is content with brazenly shoving some orgasm faces and lewd actions in your face and calling it a day. No time for subtlety in the actual anime. Same for the ending which literally shoves breasts in your face the moment it starts. So I would honestly say that the opening is the best part about Kakegurui so if you're thinking of watching the show just Google that and be done with it.\\n\r\nThe animation also has a nice crisp quality to it most of the time, it's a TV anime so there are hiccups and cuts here and there, but for the most part it looks really nicely. The biggest problem with the animation is the occasional and awkward use of CG. It's far from the worst I've ever seen, but it's glaringly obvious and it's for the most part used in unneccessary places like a hand flipping a card over. Though I suppose I might overlook it since spotting the shody CG was one of the more fun bits of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all I really have the energy to talk about now. I don't particularly fancy writing overly negative reviews, but decided to do one for this show regardless because I needed to say my piece. As I mentioned above Kakegurui was a massive disappointment from start to finish and if you do plan on watching it my suggestion is don't. If you want gambling anime there's better alternatives out here, anime which do everything Kakegurui wanted to do but a million times better. I can personally vouch for Kaiji Ultimate Survivor, but I hear both Akagi and Legendary Gambler Tetsuya are good too. Though I guess none of those have cute girls doing the gambling so sadly Kakegurui is the best option you have for that.\\n\r\nI don't know how to end this review. I usually try ending on a positive note, but that didn't pan out this time. So bye, I guess.",

            "content": "\"If you win, it's heaven; if you lose, it's hell.\" - Jabami Yumeko\r\nKakegurui, or \"Compulsive Gambler\", puts the gambling theme into the school setting which is probably the most common anime genre out there. \r\nViewers will first notice how the art style featured overly exaggerated facial expressions, if you had watched Death Parade before, you may notice some similarities here. While some may find this hilarious, some may be disgusted by this and be turned away. \r\nNevertheless, the overarching plot is pretty intriguing. In Hyakkaou Private Academy, the only rule is gambling. The most successful ones will climb to the top of the school, rulingover those that are less successful than them. Lose too much, you will incur a debt too huge, and you have no choice but to pay with your life, similar to a lifestock, a cattle, where you lose all freedom and choice of your life, letting others dictate every second and moment of your life until your time has come. As far-fetched as it may seem, it actually drew some parallel lines with the real world, as this is exactly how the world works. Power and success will always rule over those less successful than them. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that high stakes are involved most of the time, the games featured in the show are mostly fictional and self-made by the author himself, which are, sadly, mostly unfair. While the creativity has to be applauded in some way or another, it is rather apparent that the games are made so that drama comes first, rules come second. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the plot, while having an interesting premise, its full potential was never unleashed. We mostly follow our heroine, Yumeko  Jabami in her monster-of-the-week format, taking down enemies one by one, just to make her way to challenge the student council president. \\n\\n\r\nThe up side, however, is that Yumeko is a pretty decent main character. For most part, we are not shown of her thoughts. Throughout the show, she remains pretty enigmatic, that it is pretty hard to guess what's she actually scheming or thinking. Sometimes she may be seen to be acting recklessly and brashly, sometimes she may seem to be superbly intelligent. At times she may be assisting the weak, but there are times she would be seen as abusing the weak to her advantage as well. While watching the show, trying to guess her intentions alone makes it quite an thrilling ride. \\n\\n\r\nThe only character as mysterious as Yumeko would probably the student council president, and her twin which has yet to deliver a line throughout the show. Yumeko and president mostly share the same addiction of risk taking and gambling, but anything beyond that, remains unclear despite finishing the show. Well, we are not quite done with the plot yet. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, although heavily featured, does not strike to be as interesting as the aforementioned duo. While we are given sufficient background info on them, enough to know who they are. Ultimately they are only there to serve as stepping stones for Yumeko to reach her goal. \\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, it's nothing special, except for the exaggerated facial expressions. There's not much action going on so don't expect anything too flashy. The idol performance segment which is purely hand-drawn might be one of the highlights. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED, however, are a different matter. I am going to be honest with the fact that it's the OP that led me to watch this. The song is catchy, but the animation involved is sublime, the colors are vivid and you don't get to see any of those cliched OP segments, instead you will see many little subtle hints telling us how all 12 episodes are going to play like, hence it is very difficult to skip it. The ED, while less animation is involved (mostly we only see Yumeko walking forward), it tells us about her eccentric behavior - while seemingly innocent and naive at the outside, she also has a maniacal side inside her. The ED put these two contrasts pretty well in the two halves of the song. \\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, you will be treated with probably some of the best seiyuu performances in the anime industry. Saori Hayami and Miyuki Sawashiro, who voiced Yumeko and Kirari the student council president respectively, are as if having the time of their lives, going all out and have a myriad of tones and expressions in their voices, and they delivered it to absolute perfection. If anything, Kakegurui at least deserves some seiyuu performance award. The soundtrack is pretty fitting as well, doing well to lift up the tension and suspense of every gamble. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this show will vary from person to person. The show have some cringy moments (orgasmic moans, anyone?) which will easily turn one away. But if the huge-risk-at-stake thing is your thing, where your heartbeat accelerates, your breath intensifies, your body trembles at the sight of a high stake gamble, then Kakegurui will be the show for you. \\n\\n\r\n+ Interesting premise, drawing parallels with the real life\\n\r\n+ Can get pretty intense (it's gambling, duh!)\\n\r\n+ Interesting female lead, try guessing her intentions!\\n\r\n+ Superb vocal performance\\n\r\n- Has some cringy moments (orgasmic moans)\\n\r\n- Exaggerated facial expressions may turn people away\\n\r\n- Wasted plot potential, and cliffhanger ending.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes it's not whether you win or lose...it's the thrill of the game.\r\nKakegurui follows the titular character of Jabami Yumeko voiced by Saori Hayami who very much believes in this philosophy while shaking the core and society structure of Hyakkaou Private Academy a prestigious school of the rich and powerful where gambling is everything.\r\nTo be honest as much as Kakegurui is set up as a psychological gambling anime, it's more focused on it's psychological elements than it's gambling aspects to it. The psychological elements lies in Yumeko herself playing around with many of her rivals in different games, whether it is to recruit and bringpeople to her side, lose and still win psychologically as well as Yumeko herself being a major hindrance Hyakkaou Private Academy's student council.\\n\\n\r\nThe gambling aspect, well people will continuously say that it's a foregone conclusion that Yumeko will win every match she comes across and to that LA will say....did you even watch the anime?, Yumeko be it through rivals cheating, tying and even herself letting herself lose, well yeah Yumeko DOES LOSE but that is not what LA is getting at as for these kinds of animes, LA does have a simple rule of \"it's not the destination but the journey\", if the journey of Yumeko's results of winning or losing was entertaining then it did it's job and it did in LA's eyes at least and that is helped by it's crazy batshit aesthetics especially when it comes to the narmy looking facial expressions in the anime and sometimes genuinely unpredictable results. In the cases of Yumeko losing, she may have lost the gambling battle, but she won the psychological war. \\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of Yumeko, Yumeko herself is quite the interesting character especially for a character to have such a belief and crazy batshit nature of wanting the thrill of the gamble to the point of her betting her life COUNTLESS times. Yumeko has a small backstory and even then it's vague to say the least but even then her mysterious yet batshit nature does make her interesting if out of curiosity or just her love of the gamble. LA does see Yumeko's existence in Hyakkaou Private Academy to be something of a chaotic nature in comparison to the student council, as she shakes confidence to the \"house pets\" and the \"poor\" in the form of some of her rivals and her allies of Mary Saotome voiced by Minami Tanaka and Ryouta Suzui voiced by Tatsuya Tokutake. Mary is something of a friendly rival and had Ryouta as a house pet before losing her status to Yumeko. Ryouta on the other hand is something of an audience surrogate as he's the most \"normal\" of any of the cast members in Kakegurui. People also say that he doesn't have much leverage in the anime, however LA begs to differ and he takes risks in many of Yumeko's gambles thus he has some bearing to the plot if not because of his choices being Yumeko's ultimatum the majority of the time. However Yumeko even trusting someone like Ryouta does bring up Yumeko as a symbol for the unlucky or poor thus able to shake the core of the student council and them trying to bring down or even make Yumeko's life a living hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by MAPPA is eccentric to say the least from overly exaggerated facial expressions LA told before, character designs are decent though it's mainly because of the nearly the entire cast are in red school uniforms, exceptions being Midari, Runa and Yumemi. Although LA saw some CGI work mostly on the games presented but nonetheless from the crazily exotic facial expressions, decent backgrounding and character designs and ok CGI work, MAPPA did pretty well on the animation department.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, well LA needs to address this being Saori Hayami in Fukumenkei Noise as in LA did not like her voicing the main character of Nino, Saori Hayami's role here?...rejuvenated and got her acclaim back for LA for her role as Yumeko just........damn, why?, because Saori Hayami voicing Yumeko is one of her pinnacle playing against the type roles, her voicing as character who is a large ham, batshit crazy fanservicey girl in comparison to some of her more nice ojou-like girl archetype roles she's done. Yes, Saori Hayami was LA's favourite voice actor in this anime without a doubt. Aside from that, Mary's voice actor Minami Tanaka, Midari Ikishima's voice actor Mariysa Ise, Itsuki Sumeragi's voice actor Yuki Wakai and the student council president's voice actor Miyuki Sawashiro are highlights in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWell as much as LA is praising this anime, but Kakegurui does have some faults, such as the predictability factor but like LA said LA already defended this flaw especially concerning Yumeko, several of Yumeko's rivals are stock evil though this includes some of the student council members as well though at least they get a bit of HOW they got into the student council, characters including from the main cast are bareboned in terms of development especially from the majority of the Student Council, Ryouta and especially Yumeko due to her mysterious nature and her static beliefs of gambling and finally the ending which was an anime original, was anticlimactic to say the least but LA says that although this was an anime original ending the message of \"fate\" was pretty solid but nonetheless the open-endedness of this ending just kinda stopped the plot right in it's tracks.\\n\\n\r\nKakegurui is....quite a unique anime, for as it's not much of a gambling anime as a psychological anime aimed at both wanting the pleasure of the thrill of the gamble and breaking of societal structure all manifested by Yumeko Jabami. Does LA love this anime like Yumeko love gambling?...\"love\" is a strong word due to 2 other animes succeeding LA's favourite animes for Summer 2017, batshit crazy as all hell and was thrilling to watch but it was entertaining nonetheless. Kakegurui isn't the best anime of the year let alone for Summer 2017, but like LA said at the start of this review \"Sometimes it's not whether you win or lose...it's the thrill of the game.\" and even though Kakegurui won and lost in some elements but the thrill of the game was still a great-yet-batshit-crazy ride, not the best ride of an anime but a damn great yet crazy one.",

This isn't what I would recommend to anyone looking for a deep thought-provoking show. However, if you enjoy psychology, like a main character who is always in control of the story and are fine with many of the characters besides the MC being either predictable or annoying, then it's not a bad watch. It's entertaining and it does have some interesting elementslike the pet concept (though I feel they could've done more with that and many other plot points). If nothing else it could be a fun watch for the right person just not necessarily good as far as a plot goes.",

            "content": "I'd like to begin this review by saying that I watched all 12 episodes straight, which honestly very rarely happens anymore. I'll be keeping this review as spoiler free as possible.\r\nStory-6: the story is alright, or i suppose i should stay that there really is not much of a story here, this show is simply about the thrill of gambling primarily, and the plot basically involves the mc challenging the student council.\r\nart=10: At first i was a little bothered by the art, however i feel after finishing the entire show that while there were parts i didn't like and do like, it did an amazingjob at conveying the emotions the characters were feeling. Even if I personally did not like the art where they were making their \"meaner\" faces, I think that it was still very well done and appropriate. Their faces of ecstasy actually f**king got me hot and bothered honestly. Very well done. \\n\\n\r\nSound-8: I thought the sound was pretty well done, there were a few times where i thought the sound that was used was kind of not needed at all which was why i deducted a point.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters-9: The characters are really why i like this show. You see why alot of characters are the way they are, you see why many people are desperate, and you can especially see in some characters how much they love what they are doing, and this kind of thing makes the show shine so much more in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10: I enjoyed this show enough that i watched all 12 episodes back to back. Honestly it may be because of how overly dramatic and exciting everything was, I don't really know, but I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and really really enjoyed this show and that is enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10 while adding my scores up may be different, the simple fact of the matter is that I felt amazing while watching this show, and felt very sad when it ended because I am once again stuck in a void not knowing what to watch. I'd just like to thank anyone involved in the creation of this show. Thank yous!",

            "content": "Kakegurui is a really bizarre anime. It kind of gives off a Kill La Kill vibe in that the school is run with an iron fist by the student council and the main character has to battle, or in this case gamble, student council members to get to the president. It also tries to be over the top like Kill La Kill but unfortunately Kakegurui lacks the fun characters or true zaniness that made Kill La Kill so great. All the characters (minus Suzui) fit on a scale of horribleness and insanity. The villains are truly detestable and that makes their downfall in gambling matchesin many ways cathartic. However, villains personalities also change without much, or in some cases really any, character development when they join Kakegurui's posse. All and all Kakegurui is really bizarre and somewhat cathartic, but lacks a good enough story to backup its weirdness. That being said I still plan on watching the second season since I believe that the first season might be serving mostly as exposition to allow for better character development in the next season.",

I been always a sucker for mind games and this setting of the school having one hierarchy based on gambling really caught my attention. That's what pretty much kept me on my couch watching it.\r\nAs for the characters, I don't mind them being kinda kooky; In fact those exaggerated expressions gave the anime some great ridiculousness, but the fanservice wasn't really necessary; in fact, like most of the times, it's awfully cringy. \r\nThe characters were ok? I mean I didn't get to love any butat least some of them had some growth and \"decent\" amount of depth. I'm only mad at how the most hollow-looking characters were nobody else than Yumeko Jabami, the protagonist, and Kirari Momobami, the antagonist. I would have enjoyed to see more of their stories and some development/relation of that with their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER.\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint is with how it all ended. That last game wasn't enjoyable to watch at all; it was really hollow compared to the other ones. Also, with the stakes of losing, it didn't made the tie really enjoyable to begin with since pretty much nothing important ended up changing. And there were soooo many questions they left me with...\\n\r\nWhy the heck they were slightly leaving us to believe that Jabami and Momobami had any relationship since the start of the anime if they just never end up touching such subject? Why the heck would Momobami randomly disband the student council? did anything happened to that pet system?\\n\\n\r\nEven though I thought the ending was rushy and dumb, I still slightly enjoyed watching it to the very end.\\n",

The dub had some oddities, definite liberties taken but I didn't notice anything too extreme.\r\nThey try way to hard to make everyone, especially the girls, batshit insane. There's nothing wrong with insane characters, I like insane characters personally, but when everyone has the same brand of insanity it gets dull. There's also a lack of justification for the insanity. The crazy giddy angle was overdone and loses its edge as a result, like a pastry that's way too rich.\r\nThe setting isn'tfleshed out, but neither are the characters or anything else for that matter. The consequences of losing lack weight as debts are ignored and numbers lose meaning as they get bigger. From the beginning it becomes clear that the moment the protagonist gets involved there will be no consequences, which kills the suspense and emotional investment in a show about gambling. In the end, the show falls short of its goals, it's not terrible, its just kind of bad.",

Every time when the schizophrenic Yumeko transformed from her innocent student self to a demonic gambler with red snake-iris, Saori's voice just chilled the hell out of me. It is a transformation of Yumeko, but if we consider all the other cute kawaii roles Saori has voiced so far, that was as much as a transformation of Saori herself. Everytime when she whispered at anybody, she was talking to the character on the one side as well as addressing to me on the other side of the camera. No wonder I searched for her name at every credit just to confirm \"it was she\"  in the episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is a bit of heavy taste. I'm afraid the show is not for all ages. Cutting off the younger viewership is a hard choice because it impacts the quote. But the plot made it up by delivering the thrill and pumping the adrenalin that a gamble brings. Twists in plots made the watch even more gut wrenching. I did get a feeling that the show ends a bit abruptly and deserves something much more dramatic to conclude. \\n\\n\r\nYes, gambling is illegal in most countries, but I believe that life makes out of many many small gambles, whenever we invest, get the job A instead of B, confess to the person we fall for. In this sense, the show is a dramatic depiction of what happens in everybody's everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a pity there is not too much chance for Saori to sing in this show. She did have a short song duo at the end of one episode. But this is no Tari Tari.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the plot is decent, not a 10 but thoroughly enjoyable. And Hayami Saori saves the day again!",

            "content": "This is an updated review I wrote after finally finishing Kakegurui.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nArt: 5/10\r\nSound: 6/10\r\nCharacter: 2/10\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\r\nOverall: 3/10\r\nOverview:\r\nThis is a bad borderline hentai anime. There's no nudity, but ... it resembles hentai anime visually, and there are very heavy sexual overtones to everything. Basically, most characters are deranged, and at least some of them feel clearly sexual level thrill from gambling. Honestly, with the whole \"loser becomes a pet\" thing, I'm surprised they didn't go for the hentai title, because it is heavily implied. The main \"thing\" of this anime is trying to disgust and shock the viewer with insane (in bad sense of the word)characters who overreact to everything. Also expect a lot of deformed \"ugly shots\", tons of sweat, people with tongue out, and on occasion liters of drool too. Add to that a spineless idiot male (it is unclear whether he is supposed to be a protagonist or just one of the primary characters), and everything goes down the drain fast. Honestly, I'm surprised that square enix funded this.\\n\\n\r\nIn greater detail:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a chain of exaggerated events, which is fairly unbelievable when you stop to think about it. It has resemblance to shounen anime in structure in a sense that one character does a thing, the other character starts freaking out about it and we hear their inner monologue, then the other character does something even more crazy, then there may or may not be a \"reveal\" for some sort of crazy cheating technique, then we have several \"ugly shots\" where someone is making crazy faces while telling something.... basically, it is incredibly boring, and not pleasant. For some sort of \"social commentary\" on \"ugliness of gabbling, human nature or whatever\", they should've tried something bigger. For a battle of the minds, they should've tried more complex games. I deeply enjoyed, for example, battle of wits in \"No Game No Life\", but there's NOTHING like that in this anime. So, a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nIn the later half of the anime story gets worse, in the sense that anime becomes more drawn out, and starts strettching battles, I mean gambling games as far as it can. At one point there are several consequential episodes that happen at the same place and even on the same spot - they're drawn out because of \"internal monologues\", of various character, people freaking out in their inner monologue, etc. Amusingly enough, as the story gets overall significantly worse in the later half, it also creates small number of actually decent moments - 2 or 3 of them total. Those are the moments when kakegurui snaps out of its desire to show endless stream of ugly deformed drooling faces or blushing/sexual expressions of the main heroine, and actually shows something decent. There is a very small number of those episodes, they're short (seconds long each), and are instantly over. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nArt is surprisingly good, when it doesn't try to turn every character into some sort of drooling deformed monstrosity. Characters use more or less adult proportions, with no chibis, or \"small teenagers\", so if they weren't trying to make everything look disgusting, it would work actually fairly well. Interestingly, backgrounds are fairly dull. Because most of the anime is spent showing somebody's face, the backgrounds barely have any noticeable details in them. You can have people sitting in the room where there's nothing visible behind them, or switch around some sort of dull concrete surroundings... and stuff like that. Backgrounds aren't POORLy drawn, just surprisingly bland, especially for the \"corrupt school of super rich\" kind of settings.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10:\\n\r\nInteresting opening /ending themes, but that's about it. The music is decent, but because most of the time someone is freaking out or acting crazy, there's not much time to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10:\\n\r\nAbysmal. Nobody is believable. Quite a lot of characters are in jekyll and hyde mode, and constantly flip out between their somewhat normal mask, and the part where they act crazy. The main heroine is the most annoying of all of them, changing between 2 or 3 \"masks\" of hers - \"crazy gambler\", \"disgustingly naive girl\" and \"ice queen\". Male lead is spineless coward, at least he is not bespectacled, so perhaps this is a progress. There are no believable interactions in the series between any two characters. The overall atmosphere is \"eat or be eaten\", so everybody goes full villain mode towards pretty much everybody else at the first opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nAn extremely annoying thing about characters is that they to quickly switch from being enemies to acting like some sort of buddies, which is completely unbelievable, since there was not enough character development to support that kind of behavior. It looks odd, out of place and not believable at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10:\\n\r\nThought I'd like it, but nope. The whole \"let's act like a drooling lunatic\" thing started getting on my nerves, and eventually some of the characters got on my nerves too. Maybe original material was better, I don't know, but as things stand now, you'll have better story material and character development in a hentai anime compared to this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10:\\n\r\nNot recommended. Feel free to check the first episode, maybe you'll find something you enjoy, but I think there are better anime out of there. I would recommend \"No Game No Life\" for those who want actually smart games and more likable characters. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe it just doesn't match my taste, of course, but at the moment I tend to think it just isn't any good and best avoided.\\n",

(something that most new viewers aren't comfortable with). Pros: This show is unique and different from all the typical harem or shonen anime. It takes a typical school genre and turns it into a completely different direction. I also love the fact about how each character has a unique reaction togambling. Yes, it may seem like they are all having orgasms but if you look closely they are all fighting for something. Either fame, money, or the desire to cush others each character has a different reaction. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, now for the bad parts about the show. The way that the show paces itself is a little weird. Since the first few episodes, they are already foreshowing the main opponent of the school. It got me excited but towards the end, it felt a little rushed. All this hype I had left me disappointed when the show ended and it confused me a little because I didn't know if I wanted a second season. The grand finale wasn't all that grand. Maybe they were trying to get you to want an another season but I just don't know. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this show still deserves a watch and I highly encourage you to check it out.",

            "content": "I'm anything but a gambler, and so I begin this anime with the thought that perhaps I'd be able to gain some takeaways on the world of gambling and perhaps even learn a few strategies or two. Kakegurui unfortunately did not fufil any of my aims. That aside, it was a pretty solid show with a crazy and outright ballistic girl as the show's protagonist, which to me, was the best part of the series because her actions defied all normalcy and it was thrilling seeing how she would respond to the different challenges thrown at her (or rather she happily throws at herself). \r\nHowever,aside from one or two episodes, I found myself slowly getting really bored from the things that were being presented. Every episode felt like it was following a formula and the games played, although all superficially different and unique, all felt the same and repetitive in some sense. And my oh my is there A LOT of cheating. Is this how gambling works? Because literally how someone won was by cheating or discovering how someone cheated or outsmarting someone's cheat by another cheat. And yes it was somewhat intellectual, but I had really wished they used more justified and proper ways to truly demonstrate the gambling prowess of the cast, rather then have them resort to such means. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was really really spectacular at the start, and was what caught my attention with its unique art style that gave off a tinge of malice, which I thought was pretty darn cool. But the later episodes lacked the same quality as the first few. Or perhaps it's just me xD",

            "content": "Was anyone really surprised that the most hyped show of the Summer 2017 season would end up horrible? Even from its trailers, one could see how much the creators gambled (pun intended) on the show\u2019s simple premise and gonzo style to carry it into superstar status. Despite their efforts, however, \u201cYu-Gi-Oh, but with Psychopaths\u201d turned out to be nothing more than a flash in the pan.\r\n\tKakegurui takes place in what could possibly be described as the most unnecessarily forced high-school setting since Angel Beats. Despite everyone walking around in school uniforms, there don\u2019t seem to be any classes for the students to take. The onlything that the students ever do on this campus is play card games and treat everyone else like crap. In fact, the only purpose of this school seems to be a mechanism for questionable competition and networking amongst the children of the Elite. While I can see how being an asshole could be an appropriate if cynical attribute, the show fails to explain how playing children\u2019s card games makes you a good businessman. That said, failing to explain key elements is a pervasive theme of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that is reminiscent of high-school in this anime is the existence of cliques. In fact, there exist three distinct cliques: The Normies: which is where all of the asshole students thrive, The Student Council: where all of the psychopathic assholes preside over the Normies, and the Pets: where all of the potentially likeable students are pushed into so that they can be abused by the Normies. Where you are placed on this miserable totem pole depends entirely on how good you are at cheating at gambling and how much of your daddy\u2019s money you have to bet.\\n\\n\r\nWith setting established, our protagonist Jabami, Yumeko enters the scene with whatever fragments of plot this show actually has. The story of Kakegurui, from what I can gather, is that Yumeko really wants to play a card game against the Student Council President and can only do so by slowly beating her underlings. Why does Yumeko want to beat the Student Council President? I wouldn\u2019t know, because the show never bothers to properly establish a reason for anything Yumeko does. \\n\\n\r\nEven though their horrible backstories can be summarized as \u201cMy dad is a rich asshole who will disown me\u201d, at least the other characters have reasons for why they are putting up with this God-awful school. Yumeko doesn\u2019t seem to have awful parents breathing down her neck, as their existence is never even mentioned. Yumeko doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly interested in money, as she casually bets insane amounts of it for no adequately explained reason. Yumeko doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in status, seeing as how she willingly and joyfully adopts the status of \u201cHouse Pet\u201d for the inexplicably convenient reason of being able to challenge the members of The Student Council. And no, \u201cEnjoying gambling for the risk of it\u201d isn\u2019t a good enough character motivation.\\n\\n\r\nThe show casually brings up the subplot of Yumeko\u2019s hospitalized sister in Episode 6, but that is never given any context, never given any explanation, and never brought up again for the entirety of the season. The entire plot of Kakegurui plays out like a lazy tournament arc of a bad Shounen Action series. It is essentially a series of card-based \u201cfights\u201d (because the show is too lazy to come up with more than a few alternate ways to gamble) conveniently ordered in terms of difficulty, with the \u201cBig Bad\u201d saved for the very end. It\u2019s lazy, it\u2019s boring, and it all comes to a close with the most over-simplistic, anti-climactic card game of the series and a massive cop-out ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems of the story are further mired by its protagonist Jabami Yumeko. Yumeko\u2019s biggest flaw is that she isn\u2019t actually a character, but a lazy plot device meant to drive the story forward by any means necessary. You see, Yumeko is blessed with the magical ability to read ahead in the script, thus beating all of her opponents by making humongous leaps in logic. Yumeko has no internal monologue to explain her rationale or communicate her feelings about anything that is going on around her. Instead, Yumeko communicates entirely through blushing, giggling, and creaming her panties at the very thought of gambling. Then, when she wins, she throws out a bullshit reason for why she won and the formula repeats in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of tension doesn\u2019t exist in this \u201cPsychological\u201d Gambling anime, because there is never a reason to believe that Yumeko will lose. Not only is she devilishly good at pulling victories out of her enormous ass and chest, but she also has a particularly sturdy set of plot-armor. Yumeko only loses twice in this show. The first time she loses, it ends up paying off exceptionally because it pushes her into \u201cPet\u201d status and gives her the ability to challenge the Student Council. The second time she loses, she is given the random privilege of betting someone else\u2019s money in order to continue playing. This move was so unprecedented that even her opponent nearly soiled himself in awe of her plot armor. Furthermore, Yumeko is never even punished as a \u201cPet\u201d like everyone else in this show, being saved immediately the one time any trouble arises.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Yumeko\u2019s often sadistic nature and back-handed, insulting speech makes it very difficult to root for her. Throughout the show\u2019s 12 episode span, I very often found myself feeling sorry for her opponents despite the fact that they were all massive psychopaths and sociopaths. Somehow, Yumeko almost always managed to make herself look worse by comparison, simply because of the disgusting way in which she chooses to behave. This is especially true towards the end of the series when Yumeko strong-arms a \u201cfriend\u201d into betting her life on a game just because it makes her panties wet. I feel that even villain protagonists should have some defining goal/feature that tries to justify their crude methods (i.e. Light Yagami). The only character that is really more unlikeable than her is Ikishima, Midari, a girl characterized by her disgustingly sexual fascination with killing herself. Easily the cringiest anime character of Summer 2017.\\n\\n\r\nWith an ineffective lead like Yumeko at the helm, the viewer has no choice but to look to the supporting cast for any actual depth. Unfortunately, this move only leaves us with  Suzui, Ryouta and Saotome, Meari. Initially, Suzui was my early consideration for the only likeable character in this show, due entirely to the fact that he seems to be the only sane one. This changed quickly when it became painfully obvious that Suzui\u2019s only role was to be the token love interest that desperately clings to Yumeko like a lost puppy, because she saved him in Episode 1. This persists despite the many times throughout the show her behavior weirds him the fuck out.\\n\\n\r\nMeari is the one truly good character that the show has due to her being the only one blessed with an ounce of depth. Though initially a psychotic bitch like everyone else at this school, Maeri has a change of heart once she is relegated to \u201cPet\u201d status by Yumeko and threatened with being sold off to a pedophilic Senator. This experience opens up her eyes to the disgusting behaviors of her peers and the way The Student Council perpetrates these behaviors. Unfortunately, the show never capitalizes on this after the one time she teams up with Yumeko. Instead, it relegates Maeri into the background, where she has the dubious honor of commentating on Yumeko\u2019s matches against the Council members. Even Yu-Gi-Oh\u2019s Joey Wheeler was allowed to be useful, so hopefully Season 2 of Kakegurui is competent enough to highlight its only interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nThough largely incompetent, Kakegurui manages to, at least, occasionally entertain based simply on the merits of its unnervingly strange presentation. Everything from its bizarre choices for OP and ED to its dedication to physically manifesting the ugliness of its characters\u2019 souls with garbage-tier facial expressions makes for a production that is difficult to turn away from. Even at its most painfully boring and mind-numbingly unbelievable, the nice art and visuals will be enough of a draw for most people to like the show.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I found that the faces were woefully overused and often times placed in scenes that had either too little tension for their existence to have merit, or just enough tension that their jokey presence immediately took me out of the scene. Rarely do they ever make a scene better, opting instead to high-jack said scene with mostly negative results.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a pretty mixed bag. Since the show is mostly people talking and playing card games, you would think that there would be little room for any major, noticeable errors. This is not the case. There are a few, minor gaffs like in Episode 2 where the animators forget to animate Yumeko\u2019s hair as she walks out of a classroom, making it look like she has a long, stiff, black cape from a really old, free-to-play MMO. \\n\\n\r\nThe really noticeable lack of appropriate budget use came in Episode 9, where Yumeko battles against the school\u2019s resident Jpop Idol. The creators clearly shifted a large amount of their budget to the dance routine at the end, because the beginning is not only filled with awkward arm flailing from Yumemi\u2019s fans, but Yumemi\u2019s actual dance was a still image being moved around with music playing in the background. Last time I checked, this wasn\u2019t 1997\u2019s Berserk. It\u2019s never enough to fully make or break the show, but considering MAPPA\u2019s other works, it could have been done better.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, for all of the hate I have spewed over Yumeko, her voice actress Hayami, Saori deserves massive praise for being the only one capable of making the character tolerable. She was able to perfectly capture every distinct tone on Yumeko\u2019s near schizophrenic scale of emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kakegurui was an incredibly disappointing show. It spends so much time building up its fragmented plot and woefully, bland characters for some monumental, climactic twist that it forgets to actually deliver. Instead, it places all of its chips on the garishness of its often unpleasant faces and overly-sexualized art, thus never delivering anything of actual substance. If all you want is an anime about cute girl making scary faces, you\u2019re better off watching Mirai Nikki or Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. Even if the announced Second Season holds all of the twists, depth, and character development for the series, Season One remains as an exceptionally weak introduction.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 4",

            "content": "Kakegurui is not a gambling anime, despite how hard it's trying to be one. Having an interesting idea for a setting and a plot, it fails massively by making every gambling part extremely anti-climatic.\r\nAn idea of a school for rich kids where they gamble is a good one. However Kakegurui doesn't execute this idea well. The gambles are extremely boring when you catch the drift of it and you're always left licking your wounds. The threat is never real, no matter how hard they play it out to seem to be. When they bet on their lives the outcome is always > no one dies.This makes it really boring to watch after you catch how it works.\\n\r\nKind of spoilers for the manga, but a good example is the finger cutting gamble where in the end, no ones finger gets cut and no ones fingers ever were in danger of being cut. Same with how the anime arc ends.\\n\r\nRepeating the same trope of \"Yumeko wins but the loser doesn't actually suffer\" debunks the whole point of \"gambling with your life in the line\". A much better example of executing this idea is a series called Kaiji.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's something praise-worthy about Kakegurui it's the art, even with the unnecessary sexualization. The \"roughening\" of the style in parts where the characters breakdown or break character are a nice detail and it fits the atmosphere well.\\n\r\nHowever the characters are decent at best, Yumeko not being the best one there is.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's like a roller coaster that starts off looking high and wild but leaves you feeling bored of the repetivity and anti-climaxes.

            "content": "I first heard of Kakegurui after watching Mother's Basement's scathing review of the anime   and thinking to myself \"well it can't possibly be THAT bad, it looks quite good at least, maybe I should check it out!\". 12 episodes later and although I don't necessarily feel that I had wasted my time, I do feel as though I could have organised my to-watch list a little better. \r\nKakegurui takes place in a prestigious academy for the elites of society, where all they do is gamble their wealth and dignity away. The student council is all-powerful and imposes a slave system to students thatowe extremely high debts. Main protagonist (and best girl) Jabami Yumeko transfers in, and she is as insane as she is beautiful (Barney Stinson's Crazy-Hot graph comes to mind instantly). Yumeko is a gambling addict, a perfect fit for this academy, willing to take insane risks all for the sake of a good gamble, and she soon finds herself surrounded by friends and enemies alike.\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn't obvious enough, Kakegurui IS all about Yumeko. She participates in every gamble, she's the center of attention for the student council members, she steals the spotlight in every scene. While I don't mind having a story revolve around one character, it's no excuse for everyone else in the story to be given poor treatment. Mary is your standard foreign tsundere character, Sumeragi is ambitious but not much else, everyone in the student council feels like a bunch of Pokemon Gym Leaders given how they're just there to give Yumeko someone big to play with. These characters do get some level of backstory, but it usually comes too late or just too generic to make a lasting impact (notable exceptions being Ikishima and Yumemite). The biggest sinner for me is Ryouta, who does absolutely nothing throughout the course of the series and is created JUST to play second fiddle to, you guessed it, Yumeko.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and visuals for this show however, are surprisingly well done. The jazzy intro coupled with the well animated dancing sequences and not-so-subtle foreshadowing of future events are splendid, whereas the ending theme; while powerful and funky, didn't really need THAT MUCH fan service. The gambles throughout the series are all creative twists on common games like Rock, Paper, Scissors and Poker. The only problem I have with the games is that everyone cheats in one way or another, as if they have way too much to lose, so we never get to see anyone match Yumeko's raging gambling boner (for lack of a better word). \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a gambling story, where the characters are more properly established, and where there is genuine risk and high stakes involved, I cannot recommend Kakegurui. Please go watch Kaiji instead (which is what I will be watching next for comparison). While I don't completely hate the show; there were some great highlight moments throughout the show (and Yumeko's ahegao face is the best thing ever) I felt as though my time could have been spent watching something else.",

            "content": "Reviewers Point of view: I did not read the manga. And I know pretty much NOTHING about gambling other than black jack and the house always wins. Possible Spoilers\r\nPlot: So I went into this anime with high expectations due to the hype it got from the manga. This hype and optimistic outlook I had into the anime slowly decreased when I came back to earth; this anime is just about a compulsive gambler. I felt like there was no conflict in the plot. Jabami gambled, Jabami's opponents mostly cheated, Jabami saw through the deceptions and bets it all on the best strategy. She wins, ties,or leaves satisfied; rinse and repeat. She never improved, she never slacked off. The one time she actually lost and was put in debt wasn't even a struggle or satisfying because the anime mentioned that she won enough money to pay the debt and simply didn't want to.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline: This storyline, in my opinion, has a hit-or-miss opportunity (some may love it, others may hate it). For the longest, Jabami had no goal and was just going about her school days. Her gambling skills remained constant and thus limited. The only thing that engaged me was trying to figure out what strategy she would take and that was only when I understood the game's rules. 1/3 of the games played relied on the viewer to be familiar with the rules prior the episode (Ex. poker), and if you weren't, you were left utterly confused until the end. Then once we see some inkling of a conflict or goal forming (gambling the entire student council), they missed 2 out of the 9 members (one being quite vocal) and jumped to the \"final boss\". Then, once we reached the final gamble against the president, the game wasn't rigged (no strategy, sly ability etc. needed) making it anti-climatic and the most important part of the gamble wasn't even done by Jabami. I watched each Sunday, but couldn't predict whether I'd like the episode that week or not. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was very detailed. The anime managed to precisely show the viewers the intensity of the situation and the feelings of the players. The, almost sexual, high the players would experience during suspense, the sweat dripping down the stressed opponents face, the almost inhumane appearance of the callous cheaters and Mike abusers, the setting that focused solely on the gamble; all was expressed in great detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like a soundtrack that is not distracting and can match the situation; I'd like it even better if the songs were memorable and able to blend in with the situation at the same time. The anime soundtrack did just that and the opening and ending songs had this jazzy, flashy, seductive feel in them, which fit the mood of the anime to me. However, I don't know if a dub will come out, but the sub actors were really hard to listen to. Some voices were trying so hard to be queaky and cute or raspy and tough that it was cringe-worthy (*cough* Ikishima and Yomozuki *cough*). Not the worst, but it was uncomfortable when the 2 most vocal council members had annoying voices.\\n\\n\r\nMain Characters: Jabami had no depth to her. There was no reason given as to how she became a compulsive gambler. She was so good at gambling, but it was never revealed why. A lot of the side characters were given a backstory, but Jabami's was left a mystery. When she's not gambling, she kinda acts like any person would around strangers; polite, bland, and fake. She clearly holds her friends dear to her, but her friends weren't really friends. For a good half of the anime, I was still not convinced that Suzui wasn't just hanging around Jabami for \"other reasons\" ( ;D ). Mary hated her, had to team up with her once, and kinda hung out with her for the latter half because her friends were b****es. Sumeragi only joined her band of misfits because she wanted Jabami to become the new class president and give her a council seat back. I feel like the only reason Jabami really considered them as friends was because some gave her gambling money and others made the games interesting. It's kind of hard to like a character that had no development. She came into the anime as a gambling addict with no friends and came out a gambling addict with questionable friends.\\n\\n\r\nStudent Council: Although a school full of rich gamblers is rather uncommon (at least I think it is XD) there are still certain things I expect to remain realistic simply because it's a school setting; they weren't. A callous, tyrannical, student council; okay. A caste system treating those in debt like slaves who have to do ANYTHING the other students say; a stretch, but I'll accept that. A child can bring a loaded gun to school and use it for gambling; NO!! A student can poke another student's eye out; NO!!! The students have their entire lives mapped out until the debt is paid; even if they owe money, NO!!! Some of the student council members were so unbelievable and unrealistic EVEN FOR AN ANIME LIKE KAKEGURUI. There was this big, scary reputation built around the council president being even worse than her council underlings, but she was just another Jabami with power and a strong opinion not about gambling.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The games I actually understood the rules to were fun to watch. The addition of cheating created a challenge for the bland Jabami and had me trying to guess how she would get out of the mess and win the pot. But, this anime was hit-or-miss for me; some episodes I loved, some I hated, and the last one left me utterly disappointed. Maybe my standards were too high.",

Not to save some one, not for money, not to destroy some one and not to prove herself, weare just seeing a few gambling games for no reason to be honest here.\\n\\n\r\nArt 4/10\\n\r\nGod i do really hate the facial expressions, the mouth and there teeth are so annoying to watch. that tiny mouth becomes almost bigger then there whole face, and looks like a bad drawing, there eyes are pretty weird also imo.\\n\r\nReally didn't enjoy watching this kind of art. The starting songs art with all the food and stuff had 0 things to do with the actual anime also.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good, but before or during a gamble they could have done some nice songs/special effects. neither did i feel that the starting songs was that good at all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nThey tried to explain the small past/ what lives are they supposed to live for most characters, but it is explained in almost 5-10 seconds of time that doesn't really give the feeling about us to care about them to much.\\n\r\nHowever i do like the MC she just loves gambling and doesn't back out of a fight.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nAll these factors that make the anime not like-able, and yet I seemed myself enjoying the anime. Is it just because I love gambling anime or is there more to it? Many things ticked me off as i explained in the previous categories and all by all i enjoyed the gambling aspect here, it is just a watch were you can turn of your mind and enjoy the gambling while shutting off all the rest like story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nDefinitely give it a watch if you do not expect much from anime and just want something relaxing to watch, but do not expect some Awesomeness where you can dig yourself complete into the anime and feel you are playing in it urself. that just not happens here.",

However, there is one huge problem (at least, for me). That would be the \"MC\" Suzui Ryouta. From the very beginning he's been the cliche MC who wants to protect the girl since he thinks she's so weak. After being rescued by Yumeko, he STILL wants to protect her despite the fact that she is a gambling addict and won't listen to his pleas. This is seriously irritating. He's seen Yumeko completely ruin people through gambling yet he thinks that SHE is the onewho needs to be protected. Yes, he has helped her sometimes but that doesn't change this fact. And after her friend group grows, he, yet again, wants to protect her from gambling when she is clearly obsessed with it and is the one who usually instigates it or accepts a match. Besides this, the anime was great, with the exception of the lackluster ending. The story was great but they could have made the MC more likable and could have improved the ending (unless there is going to be a second season).",

It shines through its mysterious student council's characters. This element of surprise offers enough tension and momentum for the show to keep itself interesting for its watchers: we want to come back for more every week onlybecause we're curious about a certain character and we hope its encounter will come out to be a real deal. \\n\r\nBut then Kakegurui suffers of some sort of modern syndrone: it's predictable in its unpredictability. It takes only a couple of episodes to figure out that the protagonist, Jabami Yumeko, is so badass that she's going to reach the top, and from then on it's only about \"hmm, let's see in which unpredictable way she's going to figure the puzzles out so she can emerge victorious from her encounters\". \\n\r\nHowever, a strong suit is represented by the variety of games, even if this element becomes lackluster in the final part of the show when we're pretty much done with card games and maybe we've enjoyed more something more different, like the mini swords game in episode 3. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the entire experience of the show encapsulates its spirit quite well: it's a gamble. You know it can go wrong, but you watch it anyway for the thrill of it. And even if the final taste is a bit more sower than expected, the show was fair and square from the start with you. So a solid risky 7 should do the trick.",

            "content": "Story: 9\r\nThe story as a whole may not be much - simply Yumeko gambling with others for the fun of it - but each gamble brings with it a new way of gambling. Some are original, while others change up the rules of traditional gambling games to make it more extreme. Despite the overall outcome of the gambles being easy to predict, down to the last one, it is the process of gambling that makes this anime very intense and you will want to come back for more. The pacing is done pretty well too - each gamble doesn't take an absurdly long amount oftime and neither do the gambles conclude too quickly that you can't feel the tension build up within yourself. The premise is a little hard to swallow though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nKakegurui has a whole lot of ugly faces, but they fit in so well with the ridiculous gambles and the elitism prevalent in the school. The character design of the student council members is pretty well done and fits with their main method of gambling. The design of the school itself is quite nice as well and fits with the prestigious nature of the school.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThis is gonna be a little subjective. The OP song is jazzy and it is quite enjoyable. Personally though, I'm not a fan of the ED song. I also don't really notice the BGM much, so while it may be fitting with the anime, it's nothing particularly special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nOver the course of the anime, Meari and Ryouta grow a lot. Meari becomes a better person after experiencing the extremes of the school's elitist system. Meanwhile Ryouta stops becomes less of a coward and risk-adverse in a system with the foundation built on the concept of high risk, high reward, yet at the same time give us a realistic and rational point of view among the many lunatics in the anime. The backstories of other characters are also touched upon, which helps to flesh them out and show us the high stakes that these other characters are also facing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThe tension and novelty of each gamble made me hang on the edge of my seat and the conclusion of each gamble leaves me wanting to find out more about the eccentricities of the other characters in the school. I also love the mindgames the characters play with each other, adding a level of complexity to each insane gamble and making it even more thrilling to watch. This anime does weave sexual tension into a part of its plot which I found weird and a little unnecessary, but for those of you who love the foodgasms of Shougeki no Soma, this anime is definitely worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "To my surprise, this anime was far better than I expected. This being really my first anime in terms of the story being fixated around gambling. This is my 3rd review using my MAL account. 1st TV anime. So, here goes.\r\nStory: With 12 EP's and an ongoing manga. It kind of hurts you with opinion wise on what to score it. I truly think Mappa is so good of a studio at capturing viewers with the intensity of psychological genre. Heck, even mystery, sci-fi. Yumeko a mystery girl at first glance to me walks into Hyakkaou academy blind of what really is going on. Usuallyfor me, I'd immediately scramble. But like Yumeko I enjoy what I'm unable to predict. Risk, challenging maneuvers inspires for sure. Anyway, this anime is a real gambling treat. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork was lovely. I seen glances of the manga and the glowing eyes when Yumeko feels the risk. It's crazy how Mappa times it out all accordingly. The cringing of the teeth, the blood, everything. The character detail art was nice too. My personal favorite being Mary. I have a thing for blonds. Whoops....8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Like I said in the Art section. Mappa times it all out accordingly. I feel the cringing of a characters teeth presents viewers a feel of their own frustration like your actually standing before them. At least, for me it was.\\n\r\nYumeko, Mary, Midari included have the tendency to yell when things feel hyped. Their voices echo perfectly when I'm listening in with my Bose headphones. I have no complaints. The music is tremendously well done as well. It comes into play right when it matters. Gambling....8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMAL calls this section character. But for me, it's everyone. Here's my thoughts on them.\\n\\n\r\nYumeko: As I said before. When I first glanced at her, she was a real mystery. I think any girl or character would be when you don't know too well yet. I heard about Yumeko's exploits before the summer season started. That she was crazy, she lives for the feels, risks. I guess that's what really drove me to watch this show. You know what, Yumeko is crazy insane just like folks said. Was I surprised? Yes and no. I had the feeling she'd be crazy. But not that insane as she was. Yumeko provided the feels, the blood chilling moments at every turn when she gambled. \\n\\n\r\nMary/Meari: Unlike Yumeko. When I first laid my eyes on her, I thought she was stuck up. But she really just has a prideful she's trying to cover for. Mostly personal too by the looks of it. Mary was my favorite character in this anime. Not to mention her crazy way of thinking almost aligned with Yumeko. Those two made a great gambling team, by the way. Watch the anime and you'll see what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nKirari: The student Pres truly was a mystery. To me, she felt bored, wanted some fun. She got her wish when Yumeko came into play and it went on from there. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters including a specific one revealed in EP 12 makes me think this anime needs a S2 badly. But manga readers won't complain. It's a must read for me. 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime really was my first for a gambling kind of thing. I really can't recollect if I've ever seen something so good as Kakegurui that just makes gambling feel worth it even though it's not. Scary thing, being in debt. Sure expressed that deeply in this anime too. Whelp. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think overall it's about an 8/10 to me. I feel more could go on with this anime. We could see more intense matches. May an answer with the ending in EP 12. I guess that's we are encouraged to read the LN/manga of content afterwards. Right?\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review of Kakegurui\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

And after watching the first couple episodes, it was fantastic. Had a lot of tension, characters were extremely interesting, sometimes a bit much with the \"I enjoy the risk so much that I orgasm\" thing. The art looked different, but still was breathtaking. Same with the music and voice acting. TL;DR: It's fantastic. Extremely surprised, that it's this good.\r\nWhy the 'low' score?\r\nThe ending:\r\nHow could it be so underwhelming, what even happened? What? What, what? A tie?Really? A fucking tie. So nothing happened, literally nothing. And of course they're gonna be like all happy go lucky in the end. Fuck you, who wrote that. I always had this feeling that it would be this way, but not to this extent. Every episode had so much tension and added so much hype until the finale, and then we get this. Cool.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWatch until the 11th episode, then read the manga. Fuck you.",

Ultimately it didn't quite live up to them but the show was still very enjoyable regardless.\r\nThe story was entertaining to watch as we followed our main character, Yumeko Jabami and the various gambling games she got herself involved in.  A critique I have for how the story was presented is that I thought the psychological elements weren't taken advantage of to the fullest and this caused the story to lack a certain level of depth.\r\nThe art and art direction were very good although howthe faces were animated may irk some people. The very jazz influenced soundtrack seems to fit the atmosphere of Hyakkaou Private Academy well and makes you feel like you're in a casino. Kakegurui had a nice range in the personalities of the characters with some being quirky to eccentric to sometimes just plain insane.\\n\r\nKakegurui is a show I highly recommend to at least try. You should know for sure if it's for you within the first couple episodes.",

            "content": "I'm glad to see the ratings are starting to take a nosedive. I dropped it after the first episode, so I didn't think a review was necessary. Recently a friend of mine told me to re-watch the first and give it the 3 ep test and now I really wanna write \r\nKakegurui takes place at a high school for the rich that values gambling skills over traditional academics. Yumeko is a rebel without a cause who breaks all the rules; main protagonist who came to play some games. There's a sidekick, but he's kind of just there to make Yumeko look cooler. Each week there'sa new challenge, but it's all kiddie games in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is both a dream and a nightmare. I'm sure a bunch of kids would love to swap their classes for gambling, but those kids have no idea what they're talking about. Why teach people stupid sh*t like English, math, economics, philosophy, etc. when it's a lot more productive to bet millions of yen on Rock paper scissors.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen a lot of praise for this series and I can't understand why.\\n\r\nI've read most of the reviews and it reminded me why nobody takes MAL seriously.\\n\r\nI've seen a lot of 10s and I would say this is between 0-1.\\n\r\nThere's probably people who think the first 3 eps were quality, but you're wrong.\\n\r\nWhy you may ask? Well here we go\\n\\n\r\nSo the first problem is the school itself. Having kids gamble could've actually worked in a school setting. You'd be surprised what some people can do with a higher education and a gambling addiction; most extreme example I can think of was using math used for space travel to predict football games.\\n\r\n(If you're interested in the link PM me)\\n\r\nThe life of a gambler is something worth exploring \\n\r\nBut they don't really do anything with this premise.\\n\r\nThey actually f*ck the gambling up too, but i'll get to that later\\n\\n\r\n1st scene:\\n\r\nFor those of you unaware, a fullhouse in 5 card poker is almost unbeatable. Usually a pair will take the pot, which is why it's not played very often.\\n\r\nHaving a FH get beat by a RF, is something that'll happen 1 in a lifetime if you're unlucky, but you'd be a braindead moron to not go all in with that hand \\n\r\nNARRATOR: we value gambling luck here\\n\r\nthis set the tone perfectly, because gambling in this world is all about luck.\\n\\n\r\nIn 3 episodes I have no idea what the point of these games are.\\n\r\nThey're betting what appears to be a lot of money, but there's no context as to how much Yumeko is playing with. \\n\r\nI think it's kinda important to have dramatic stakes is your gambling anime.\\n\r\nI also think that there should be consequences for losing, but episode 3 treats debt as one huge joke.\\n\r\nSo with no clue what's at stake, the victories don't feel satisfying and even when Yumeko loses, the plot will dig her out of it.\\n\\n\r\nI get some people have a lot of tolerance to bad writing, but in 3 episodes they've killed all possible dramatic tension for the future. The games they're playing are pure luck based, so they're not even finding creative solutions to win....it just happens. Additionally, the antagonists of each episode are made to be cheaters for seemingly no other reason than being written by a hack. It'd be fair to assume the game set up has been rigged, so overcoming these odds gives successes more meaningful. By making them a cheater, the antagonist is no longer a serious threat, and beating weak villains isn't as interesting. Multiple cheating antagonists make the world incredibly hard to take seriously.\\n\r\nIf skills are valued so highly, why is cheating so acceptable?\\n\r\nIf real world gambling establishments take cheating seriously, there's no reason to break it's world.\\n\r\nEven by kids standards, this is bad     \\n\\n\r\nI guess people like the main character because she so cwazzzy?\\n\r\nShe reminds me a lot of Jared Leto's Joker \\n\r\nedgelord is the best trait \\n\r\nShe's been praised as this great character, but crazy and compulsive gambling aren't character traits.\\n\r\nAll she does is save the day risk free \\n\\n\r\nThere's a long list of stuff that'd would make this go on forever, but my biggest issue is that.\\n\r\nThis is a complete waste of time.\\n\r\nIf you're a kid and enjoy this, well there are better things out there I promise you.\\n\r\nBut who else was this made for? \\n\r\nThis is some of the worst writing I've ever seen \\n\r\nthe world is neither believable or consistent with its own rules\\n\r\nthe characters are as realistic as a bugs bunny cartoon \\n\r\nmakes no attempt to convey anything remotely realistic \\n\r\nNo subtlety or nuance \\n\r\nNo core/central themes, ideas, or anything meaningful to say \\n\r\nCreatively bankrupt \\n\r\nWorst piece of sh*t",

            "content": "Kakegurui is like playing a round of Russian Roulette with no bullets in the chamber. Sure it might seem a thrilling idea, but in reality it lacks any bite or consequence. \r\nThe story is pretty basing and boring. Local gambling girl takes on various opponents in different games. The actual games played come quick and fast and there's barely any time to get into the games, so they're all pretty simple and predictable games. The biggest sin this 'gambling' anime commits is there are practically no consequences from any of the gambles going on, with the protagonist casually throwing away money or consequences never beingpicked up on or ignored. Even the big ending gamble just results in a draw, so it might as well have not happened. There's no insight into the protagonist's thoughts so it's basically a game of waiting for her to call out the cheating going on whilst never being affected by the events around her. All its attempts to escalate the stakes fall flat and it comes off as pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe art? Pretty decent. Some moments definitely shine above others and the facial expressions can be so hilariously distracting when the rest of the show tries to come across as pretty highschool girls. There's nothing particularly standout about it but there's nothing too bad about it either, it's rather hard to talk about honestly. The only thing hugely interesting are the facial expressions and they come across as over the top and hilarious more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual sound design of the show is pretty good. The soundtrack is nice and catchy and it's very fitting for a gambling anime with some jazzy pieces and tense numbers. The ED in particular is a personal favourite. Unless you want to watch some honest to goodness shlock, i'd recommend listening to the soundtrack on its own, it's much better than the show. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much character to be had here. The protagonist has two settings. Nice, demure high school girl and crazy broad who orgasms over gambling. Most of the cast just generally get pretty insane over gambling to the point of hilarity with a triage of generic melancholy backstories of great expectations to over saturate them to the point of meaninglessness. Most of them tend to go through 'development' over just one speech from the protagonist and the villains are all pretty one note and boring, again with just two settings, casual and gambling crazy.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, I had an utter blast watching Kakegarui. I can see why it has a positive score honestly because it's honestly kind of hilarious to sit through, see all the ridiculous cheating methods and stupid facial expressions the characters pull. I wouldn't recommend watching this unless you want to see some fun shlock, don't expect quality out of this show. \\n\\n\r\nKakegarui is an gambing anime in the trappings of the word and little else. It's fun if you don't take it seriously, but if you want a good gambling anime, go watch Kaiji.",

It was supposed to be high stakes but I don't really feel that. It still is by all means a good anime, if you have like 5 hours to blow and want to watch something this would be a good show. You won't have your socks blown off but it will satisfy your needs. The charceters are all a little bit odd in their own way which provides some intruige to theshow and some variety. But they aren't fleshed out enough for me to care at this point in time. I am watching this very close to the second season release date so I will have to wait until then to understand more about the show. But overall its a good to decent show.",

No, not just once, but EVERY... - I REPEAT: EVERY EPISODE.\r\nGambling anime are about cheating and finding novel and interesting ways to solve problems, however, \r\nThe techniques and strategies that the gamblers use in Kakegurui lack imagination and just feel STALE. Bending the edge of a card to mark it -Seriously? This is ancient knowledge everyone is aware of. There are numerous others but they are just too simple, stuff like signalling during teamplay when communication is not allowed. Ugh. Kaiji does it better. The tension, the atmosphere, the psychological horror of it... it's all \"404 Not Found\" in Kakegurui.\\n\\n\r\nI was utterly bored at the main character for lacking any form of humanity. She just likes to gamble and there's nothing more to her. I don't know her, her feelings (besides the obsession with gambling), and her motivations. Boring! Couldn't care less about her or any of the other characters. The sexual undertone that describes the character's affection to gambling doesn't do it for me either. Utterly boring.\\n\\n\r\nIf this is your first gambling anime and you decided \"gambling anime aren't for me\", then go watch Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor which does gambling RIGHT. Instead of gambling for fun like they do in Kakegurui, Kaiji gambles to actually survive because he's just in a bad position in life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nWhat a waste of time. Should've dropped it but was always hoping for a change of pace/style. Art was alright though.\\n\\n",
