            "content": "Okay, first of all, this is one of my first reviews so bare with me and don't hesitate to message me about what i should improve about, anyways lets get started shall we?\r\nStory- When people look at Myself; Yourself's cover, they usually get the automatic reaction that its a typical harem anime with predictable outcomes, which is not true. Of course, if you totally dislike school life - romance animes then you shouldn't bother wasting your time watching a genre you do not like. Back on topic, the story basically revolves around friendship more then relationship between opposite sex, and let memake this clear again... THIS IS NOT A HAREM!\\n\\n\r\nArt- I seriously liked the artwork in Myself; Yourself, not because the girl's were fairly pretty designed but the background and the male character as well. I thought Sana's red eyes blended into his characteristic and other things that happen (Not gonna say it, if you wanna know.. you gotta watch it =] ).\\n\\n\r\nSound- Basically, I loved the OP of the series and the video for it seemed like they were meant for each other so no problem there. The ED wasn't really my style of anime music but the OP makes up for it(to me). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The one thing that Myself; Yourself had that didn't really appeal to me, were some of the characters. Don't get me wrong, some of the characters i really liked. Hinako is defiantly a candidate for the most annoying character. Mainly because of the way she acts and the way she bothers Sana and Syuusuke all the time. Sorry if i offended anyone who likes her character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I personally love the genre school-life romance so therefore this a series i really enjoyed. Again this series will differ between people, you may love it or you may hate it, it all depends on what type of anime you like to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall i really enjoyed this series and as i said before, I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys this type of school-life romance anime.",

            "content": "Myself; Yourself is a Slice of Life, Romance, Comedy, Drama about a boy (Sana) who had to leave his home town and his friends, with his parents. Then 5 years later he returns to see that quite a bit has changed.\r\nAs this short anime series begins it is obvious that there&rsquo;s nothing unique about it and that it is just the usual \"visual novel\" &ndash; to &ndash; \"anime\" adaptations that are released every season. The story begins normally enough by introducing the surroundings and the characters with their little quirks. There are also the typical Rom/Com clich&eacute;d moments that happen quite a lot (girl tripsover and lands on guy) however these jokes are executed well enough that it feels refreshing. Apart from the one or two serious moments in every episode there is no real drama in this series, until about halfway into the series. The good thing is that it doesn&rsquo;t just unload a bunch of drama because a lot of it was just confirmation to previous speculations you may have had whilst watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime have the typical personalities that most anime fans are used to seeing. However there is one girl (Aoi) who has a really odd and quirky personality that is really fun to watch but her voice can be both cute and annoying. Even with these pretty normal characters, they all are somewhat mysterious, which will give you the urge to watch the next episode, to find out what occurred in the past.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is really good with the best of it being in the detailed environments, which make good use of the light and shadows. The characters themselves also look good but there&rsquo;s nothing special about their designs and they also lack fluid animation. The music is also good, most of the time, but there are times when it feels out of place, just like the OP and ED theme.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Myself; Yourself has proven to be something great to watch, for most Romance anime fans. It has all the basic elements to make a great story and some interesting characters to match. The one thing I can say is that behind all surprises and unexpected developments, this anime series lacks originality to make it stand out. Other than that it is a great show to watch.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I've had a lot of first impressions when I see an anime. Most of them end up being what I've had predicted while a few changes my perspective.\r\nMyself; Yorself is an example of an illusion. Seeing pictures of anime high school friends in one picture always seem to look like a typical comedy, romance, shoujo or a harem anime. That was what I thought.\r\nStory: 9\r\nTo be honest, I was part of the majority who thought \"Myself; Yourself\" was a harem anime. I've seen Myself; Yourself a number of times in different sites but the only reaction I usually get was \"oh another stupid harem anime.give me a break\". It took me about a year for me to take the initiative to watch this anime only because one of my favorite Seiyuus, Ami Koshimizu, voice acted the main character. I rarely rate a Romantic-Drama \"9\" because I rarely see one that can execute well. You can say this anime, has more of a dramatic based genre rather than romance because of the friendship link between the characters. Every episode gives you a glimpse of the story of these characters and true enough the story does get more interesting as you go further. It made me want more and more. Soon enough, I was able to finish this anime in just 2 days (It could have been 1 day if I slept at 3 AM). Yes, the story was that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI can't deny that the art/animation I see nowadays does progress and becomes much more beautiful than the animes that were made in the late 2000s. But seeing the animes made during that year (Code Geass, School Days, ef-a tale of memories), I'm sure that the art was on par with every anime back then.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI really don't like the Opening \"Song\" although I love how the Opening \"Animation\" went (there's a difference). Although, the Ending song is much different. I actually liked the Ending song just because it reminded me of Steins; Gate (same singer) and it felt catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nCharacter development, sure flourished the whole anime series. The characters were explained very well. You can see that their lives were acted on each of the person's lives. Some secrets were revealed during the anime and it did surprise me. I can't say I don't hate a character but then seeing how these characters went by during the anime made me understand how different people can be behind the naked eye.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nKnowing that I watched this 13-episode Anime within just 2 days clearly explains how I had a great time watching this anime. I don't think it's the enjoyment that led me to watch the anime in 2 days. I guess it was because I was curious to know what would be next. The anime was such a thrilling anime to watch that I was seeking for more answers from the upcoming episodes. I could have enjoyed this anime much more if only there was a different ending. To be frank, the ending was kind of laid back for me. For me, there was no spark at the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nSeeing how an anime can create romance in such a serious dramatic anime won me over. This anime is one of those \"don't judge a book by its cover\" because if you do then you will surely miss out something worth watching.",

            "content": "\u201cHuman life is at stake, so you should at least improve your cooking first...\u201d- Hidaka Sana \r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath now. If you peek while I'm changing, I'm going to kill you, got it?\u201d\r\n \u2013 Hinako Mochida\r\nMyself;Yourself is primarily a drama genre anime with little-to-medium romance.\r\nThe Story: 7/10\r\n------------------\r\nThe anime starts with our male protagonist, Sana who has come back to his hometown of Sakuranomori, after leaving it 5 years before for the sake of his parents\u2019 business plans. He is surprised to see that most things have not changed, until he meets Yatsushiro Nanaka, one of his best childhood friends when he wasyounger. The story here is rather simple. With new ideas introduced, they do not change much to the story. Basically all they do is reinforce the story to try and make it a little more interesting. Sometimes it is even used to reset character development in the story. The pacing of Myself;Yourself is solid. Did it feel quick? No. Did it feel slow? Sometimes, maybe. Some episodes can be considered to be \u2018side quests\u2019, if you will, and have no particular meaning to the main story. Despite this anime being a drama, it is rather comedic once things loosen up, notably at the beginning of the anime. The drama can be a little predictable, but the producers will always throw something at you to keep you on the edge wanting more. Romance is not as much as a major genre as drama, but it was well fleshed out- though it definitely is not as solid as some other series you can find. The ending is satisfying, though some may be disappointed that certain elements were not taken further at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 9/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nThe art probably has to be one of the best for an anime that aired in 2007. Its scenery and characters are very well done, and they fit the personality very well. One dispute is with the size of Aoi\u2019s breasts. She may be in high school, but hell. They\u2019re bigger than her head. The art style is very fitting for the overall story because it incorporates a lot of \u2018emotion shading\u2019. When the characters are happy, the art is as if it\u2019s happy itself. When the characters are sad/depressed, it\u2019s almost as if the art is feeling that way as well. Character movement was smooth, albeit a little \u2018blocky\u2019 during some sections and background movement was just as good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 7/10\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nThe OP and EDs in Myself;Yourself aren\u2019t distinctly memorable. After watching the anime, you probably won\u2019t even think anything of it.  OSTs were very appropriate for the mood during a scene and blended in very well. Sometimes it worked so well you can\u2019t even tell when it came in. Voice acting here wasn\u2019t exactly the best, Aoi\u2019s voice seemed to be the most annoying one out of all them because of her constantly high-pitching everything she says. Though it might not have been as good as other anime made this year, the voice acting was bearable. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 8/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nNot many character problems here, but one annoying thing here is how the writers would reset the relationship between characters whenever there was some \u2018turning point\u2019 drama in the story. Each of the cast is likable, even Aoi who is the one who brings most of the comedy to the anime. Nanaka appears to be the most mature in the story, and the main heroine. Her past is where most of the main drama comes out of. Sana is the main protagonist and the story mostly revolves around him and his ability to make decisions. Then you have the boy/girl twin, there\u2019s quite a bit of comedy in the two- but that comedy is mostly because of disagreement between the two. Hinako comes in the end of the first \u00bc of the anime, and she seems to actually be the most funniest- but can definitely be serious at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nPersonally, my enjoyment of Myself;Yourself was very good. The cliff hangers at the end of each episode kept me wanting more. I probably won\u2019t watch this again, since this can be considered a type of \u2018one time only\u2019 anime. You probably won\u2019t get much satisfaction watching this again. Myself;Yourself is the first romance/drama genre anime I have watched, a genre that I didn\u2019t really like when I started watching anime. Seeing this changed it for me, and now I really enjoy the romance/drama category of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nOverall I think that Myself ; Yourself really is a great series. If you're going to start watching a teen, romance and drama anime this is definitely a good place to start.\\n",

            "content": "Sadness, depression, times of complete darkness. Most of us have experienced at least one of these in our lives. The solution is finding ways to cope with it, or change it for the better.\r\nMyself;Yourself. I've been planning on watching this for a while now, little did I expect to find such an intriguing anime worthy of being watched in a single day! Despite the few flaws in the show, this is what most dramas should be like. Romance, fights, a look into people's pasts, and a twist ending all make up an excellent drama.\r\nTo start off the review, let's go into the story. Sana iscoming back to his hometown for the first time in years. Things have changed, but at the same time, things haven't. He comes to this town with memories of his past, some in which he's trying to piece together to make it whole again, but one thing he does remember were the good times he spent with his friends as children. He then reunites with all of them in High School, happy, eh? At least most of the time. Throughout the story, there's comedy, hints of romance, scandal, and twists that'll make you either flip out or let your mouth hang in awe as to what just happened. This is why I like watching animes like these, they spice up the story with things people never expect to happen, and in the case of Myself;Yourself, most of the twists never end up being happy.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to reviewing the artwork in an anime, I never really know what to say, it's either a big blank or a simple \"It was good\", I am never able to create a long paragraph about it, but Myself;Yourself has flawless art. The scenery was beautiful, the characters were portrayed in kind of a way that suits their personalities, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nSound isn't one of my strongsuits either, but I can say for the most part that Myself;Yourself had excellent voice acting! Surprisingly though, the oldest character in the group (Aoi, a 3rd year in High School) sounded like a chipmunk with too much helium in it's lungs and apparently seemed to get high very often. In other words, her voice made you want to laugh out loud every time she spoke. For the most part it was funny, but at points it was just plain strange.\\n\\n\r\nOh good, a strongsuit of mine. Characters. I liked them all, or at least most of them. The main character, Sana, seemed to be cool and collected most of the time, but somehow acted like a normal teenager at the same time (says the giant stack of playboy magazines sitting in a box out of reach from girls). Then there's Nanaka, mature and stern most of the time. Aoi, the drugged chipmunk, seemed to be hyperactive all the time, even in the most depressing of times. The twins, you can totally tell they're siblings, they bring the rough comedy to the anime with constant insults and fights breaking out between the two of them. Out of all the characters in the show, I think the only one that I despised almost as much as Sugou from Sword Art Online was the teacher that was always sucking up to the principal and being a douche-bag. Minor role, but he angered me.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show having some good comedy and romance to it, along with some good stories, the show was... in a word... depressing for a portion of it. Most of the depression happens to be things that would end up spoiling the show for you, so I won't get into those, but I enjoyed the show a lot. I haven't seen many dramas (or at least I don't think I have), so watching this gave me a pretty good idea about what I should be looking for in dramas. Watch it, you'll enjoy it for the most part, just have a box of tissues, just in case.",

            "content": "Myself;Yourself is a romantic comedy about a boy name Sana and his childhood friend Nanaka. \r\nStory: The story is quite typical; a boy comes back to his hometown after 5 years, to see everything has changed. Although most of the story is predictable, there are some good twists to the plot that will leave you shocked most of the time. The story also goes through a small number of flashbacks to reveal more of the characters. The story loses marks for some of the unnecessary fillers. Although the series is 13 episodes, the producer has made a good job to wrap everything up. \r\nArt: Theart in Myself;Yourself is pretty good, however since it is aired this year, the art is not outstanding compared to others. However it still provides the viewer a pleasant animation to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is great, the OP and ED is just filled with happiness and joy. Also Nanaka's violin playing is beautiful as well. The music works well with the anime, providing tension in awkward moments and bringing joy into happy times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each character has a unique personality, through the cute Aoi, to the mysterious Nanaka. The character develops fairly fluent through the 13 episodes. Nanaka and Sana's past leaves the viewer in mysteries, which is great because it really makes the audience guess/predict what had happen during the 5 years. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Yeah, I enjoyed it. Although it is a short anime, I really liked seeing each character develop slowly in the anime. Combined with beautifully drawn art, and nicely composed music, Myself;Yourself did a great job entertaining me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Myself;Yourself may not be the best anime out there, but it is really something you should pick up and watch. And no, it is NOT like school days. So don't expect anything gruesome. ^^\\n\\n\\n",

It opened strong and gave me high hopes for a good series, but it soon became apparent that it was going to go down fast.\r\n   The story was my biggest disappointment. It really felt like a series based on a visual novel, there was a lot of story, but nothing to really hold it together. The pacing of the series felt sluggish, a lot of the conflicts could have been resolved faster. It felt as though half of the series was dedicated to Hinako, the little girl, even though she had nothing to dowith the main plot of the series. Another thing that i found troublesome was how melodramatic the story became. By the end I couldn't bother to take anything seriously anymore.\\n\\n\r\n    The characters, while mostly falling into cliches, did have some interesting points, the twins especially. Everyone fit in, and felt believable, despite their obvious repetitions, but Aoi's voice really got on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\n    The art and animation was bad. Not as bad as something like Ramune, but really lacking in polish. There's not really much more I can say about it, other than it was kind of blah.\\n\\n\r\n    The music and sound was fairly decent. Despite the stories faults, the music would fit in with what was going on, but it never really moved me, or made me want to just listen to it.\\n\\n\r\n   I guess by now you could guess that I didn't really enjoy this series.

            "content": "Contrary to your average series, Myself;Yourself is unlike any other game to anime adaptations. First of all, the visual novel for the series wasn't released when the TV series had been approved, thus making impossible to compare it to a previous work.\r\nI don't know what kind of visual novel M;Y will be, but if it's anything like the TV series, then it must be a great one. Sure, the settings and motifs are not unique, but, seriously, what is unique nowadays? The way the plot is developed is outstanding, save the number of episodes (I personally think 16 would have been perfect), as things mayseem a tad rush in the final episode, and some side-stories weren't exactly resolved (while are hints that indicate they are, it'd been great to see them actually happen, and also, a story for Aoi-chan would've been great too).\\n\r\nAs far as the animation goes, Doga Kobo made a great job on this series, which is a very good thing in these times when anime budgets are not exactly high, and dropouts in quality ocurr more often; but you won't see any inconsistencies in the animation in Myself;Yourself, every episode has the same amount of quality as the one before!\\n\r\nThe music on this series, both OP/ED themes and OST, are excellent, even though the OP has that genki-genki happy-happy feeling that doesn't fit well with the plot, it fits the whole series very well, as it reminisces the happy moments that were present.\\n\r\nThe characters, well, may seem like typical, but trust me, they're NOT typical, and their personal issues flow episode by episode, making you eager to know what's next and to find out their past experiences. Each and everyone of them have their own importance, and you'll manage to like them all.\\n\r\nOverall, I think Myself;Yourself deserves a 9 out of 10 for being a nice surprise and sticking with a great quality from its beggining to its closure, and I'd recommend it to any anime fan who appreciates a nice romance drama series.",

            "content": "Myself; Yourself is the story of Sana and his four childhood friends, whom he gets separated with after having to move away. He comes back after about five years, finding some of his friends remaining the same, and others very much different. Though it might come across as a stereotypical harem, at a closer look much more is unfolded in the story. It&rsquo;s a romance, but often steers towards friendship as well. \r\nIt&rsquo;s not a bad watch, but I certainly can&rsquo;t say I loved it. The plot was a little hard to grasp on what it really was. Through the first half of the seriesbefore it started going anywhere it was more like a weak thread of events. Some episodes were dramatic and interesting, but not all of the emotion seemed very real. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was okay, but I really disliked the main character, Sana. That&rsquo;s not very good when you&rsquo;re watching a series: you don&rsquo;t even like the protagonist. I suppose those type of leads I never really like, he just annoys me. Nanaka, too, the main girl, was a little irritating. She acted depressed and moody, and it doesn&rsquo;t come clear until late into the show as to what her problem is. Mostly it just seemed like she was on her time of the month throughout the show, considering her emotions, which were all over the place. However, I did like some of the other characters, like the twins, Shuusuke and Shuri. They were very sweet towards one another&hellip; I was wishing they weren&rsquo;t even brother and sister as I watched episode ten, but I won&rsquo;t tell you what went on: you have to see for yourself! Generally the majority of characters seem stereotypical, except for Aoi, her character was pretty unique. She was very amusing. There is also Asami, a classmate of our characters&rsquo;, who appears normal and helpful. However, it is not all what it seems with her, and I much changed my opinion of Asami later on. That was very surprising, and added a twist to the story. Lastly there&rsquo;s Hinako, a young girl desperate to be referred to as mature, who gets infatuated with Shuusuke after he helps her out against some bullies.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was fairly nice, and I liked the way the faces and characters were generally drawn. However, inconsistency often was portrayed in the animation movements, and it lacked fluidity. Some of the poses or stances they were put in, too, were awkward. The colors however, were pretty, and though it was definitely not outstanding it was all in all pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was really nice, and I liked the opening and ending themes, enough to get both the mp3s, they're both very good and fit the anime nicely. Background music was standard, nothing that stands out, anyway. As for seiyuu, everyone did a fairly good job, with the right amount of feeling put into their voice. Sana&rsquo;s voice fit him, as did the others. Aoi&rsquo;s voice might be the most annoying, but I actually liked it, even though it&rsquo;d be a bit hard to listen to, ahaha.. ha.\\n\\n\r\nMyself; Yourself is nothing of great value, but it&rsquo;s a nice show to watch. I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly heartily recommend it, but try it out and see what you think. Obviously there&rsquo;s mixed reviews, if you check out the reviews written prior to mine (and that&rsquo;s a lot!).",

            "content": "Friendship. Jealousy. Deception. Myself ; Yourself proves that you can present good elements for a drama and still be a failure. The show is misleading as it introduces characters facing solid dilemma but depends on dissatisfying deus ex machina to solve their problems or leave events incomplete altogether. The characters are weak and majorly lack development. It wastes screentime on irrelevant characters and scenes, causing it to rush and throw in last-minute sob stories. Basically, Myself ; Yourself is just another VN gone wrong.\r\nMyself ; Yourself had interesting themes suitable for slice-of-life. It replaced clich\u00e9 results one would likely expect from romance drama with unpredictableoutcomes. This is when Myself ; Yourself looks to be promising until it decides to do the worst thing imaginable. An episode ends intensely, causing you to look forward to a continuation in the next episode. Disappointingly, you have to wait another 2-3 episodes of either fillers or an additional situation they could\u2019ve introduced a lot sooner. Additionally, there are these constant annoying clich\u00e9 accidents where a girl \u201caccidentally\u201d trips, resulting in an awkward situation with a guy. Just when you think it couldn\u2019t possibly get any worse, Myself ; Yourself decides to leave certain characters in a distressful situation and ends the show with no knowledge of what happened whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe weak characters are a major problem. Some emotions are heartfelt, but characters sometimes did not react appropriately to a situation. For example, a character simply says they\u2019re sad without expressing it at all. A prime example of Myself ; Yourself\u2019s habit of skipping events is the introduction of a demanding little girl named Hinako, who can do the show a big favor if she was nonexistent. Myself ; Yourself decides to give Hinako her own two episodes and screen time to intrude on the friends' lives that could\u2019ve been used to develop them instead. The show reveals some characters' past, inner emotions, or close relationships with each other, but others receive no exposure. Relationships are left incomplete, since Myself ; Yourself abruptly ends or distracts the viewer away from them with a different scene. You're left in the dark and never hear from those characters again. Once the show decides to pay attention to a character, it introduces a very important factor about characters at the very last moment with a quick self-narration that gives you no time to sympathize with them. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was a major turn-off. It looks like an older type animation from the '90s instead of 2000s. Bland colors make the show even more disinteresting. When a character bleeds black blood, it is hard to take that scene seriously. The background designs were good but not too detailed. With a simple big-eyed character designs comes identical characters that makes the show hard to follow. The different hairstyles made it tolerable, but it caused complications when one character decides to change it or let their hair down. There were still scenes and times when characters talked without their mouths moving. I thought it was simply their thoughts until the other character responded. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both good but misleading. Truthfully, the lyrics relate to the show\u2019s motive in terms of the characters looking forward to a better tomorrow. On the other hand, the OP presented the friends as a band when only two of the five have any musical talent. The ED only featured three girls, replacing one of the MC with a supporting character. It is likely to expect some close connection with those three girls, but there\u2019s nothing important about their relationship. Too bad this does not have an English dub version, because Aoi has an annoying, squeaky voice in Japanese. The other seiyuu were okay. They fit the characters\u2019 personalities, but there were times when their voices didn\u2019t match their emotions. The sound effects were natural, especially with the bird chirps in outdoor settings.\\n\\n\r\nMyself ; Yourself had opportunities to be promising, but it is sheer disappointment, especially with its \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d ending. You learn nearly nothing about the characters or how a dramatic situation magically resolves itself. Relationships are unfinished or unseen, and it leaves not a single hint for the imagination. If Myself ; Yourself completed itself, I would ignore the dull colors, Hinako\u2019s existence, and Aoi's ear-bleeding voice, and suggest any romance drama fan to give this a try. In actuality, Myself ; Yourself can be bypassed with no regrets.",

This isn't a dating anime despite Sana being surrounded by girls because he never took the initiative or had interest in any of them other than Nanaka. Aside from that Myself;Yourself revolves around the importance of friendships and why they should be valued. \r\nStory: The moment I saw the first episode I knew this would be a great anime. Story wise I liked it every aspect of it, but I do feel like Sana's background regarding his past was presented too late. Still every character made the story very good. The twinswith their hilarious comedy, Aoi and her child like voice, Hinako and her pretend to be mature self. Every character added their own qualities and characteristics to make the story strong.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to say here except for the amazing background and character designs. I'm not a fan of red eyes, but Sana's red eyes fit his personality and show his past that he keeps for himself. Aoi on the other hand grew a lot up there, short hair, and still kept that child like voice. Aoi's characteristics sure suit her voice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: My least disliked character was Hoshino not because of what she did, but because of her actions with Sana I didn't really like. The characters I hated the most was that lazy employee always next to the principal because he never stated adequate reasons when a student was in trouble, he always took the principals' side because it was convenient. The other character I hated was Sana's father because of his actions he took. I will never forgive him for that. Nanaka is one of my favorite characters despite being reserved she is a sweet, caring, and also pretty. One thing I will never forget is that pout face she showed.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Myself;Yourself? Absolutely. Why? 3 reasons, story had my full attention, always wanted to know what the next episode was about, and Nanaka captivated my heart. I hope there's a second season or at least an OVA episode where Sana and the others reunite because the ending was a bit rushed. We can imply what happened, but as viewers we want to see what happens after, not imply what happens.Still I haven't had a good cry since the first anime I watched last year, and Myself;Yourself executed that perfectly, enough to make me cry again. 10/10",

            "content": "Eh... I expected worse.\r\nThis show is not generic. It may seem like one, but you can tell that when you watch it that they're really trying to do something else with the whole high school romance thing. It is however very forgettable.\r\nLet me just address the art first. I see a lot of people in the reviews praising how well the backgrounds are and how well the characters are animated. In my personal opinion, the backgrounds were fairly good, but nothing special. I barely paid attention to it. The characters are not animated in any special way. It's just typical anime animation. I did notfind anything special in the show's art. It was good I bet, but none of it had any lasting effect on me for me to be able to even remember an example right now (and I just finished the show a few minutes ago). And this is coming from someone who regulars Sakugabooru. I usually pay a lot of attention to these. (Or maybe it's because that I visit Sakugabooru often since I might've been overexposed to so much stellar animation).\\n\\n\r\nI also saw some people praising the voice acting. I don't typically pay attention to voice acting and I don't really know what qualifies as good voice acting or not, so I won't say anything about it here. However, I just want to say that the senpai of the group whose name I forgot because she really was only a side character has the most annoying voice ever. It's like someone fused a frog and a cat and told the resulting monstrosity to sound cute. And being the first character to be introduced after the protagonist, Sana, I suddenly got massive premonitions of how bad this show might be when she first started speaking. (Fortunately, those premonitions weren't met in entirety.) I got used to her voice eventually, but I wouldn't call that good voice-acting in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's discuss the story. It's a very simple storyline to be frank. Bad things happen after a period of good things and they keep happening until they stop happening and everyone's changed because of it. It's not a bad storyline. This actually applies to every story out there. It's probably not a story if this doesn't apply to it. However, what makes this show different from superior stories is that this show's story lacks both nuance and anything worth remembering. At this point of writing (which, as said earlier, is only a few minutes after finishing the show), I can't really remember anything more than what I just said earlier. Bad things just happened to the characters. Now there's nothing bad about having a simple story as long as it's memorable. However, this story is not memorable. None of anything that happens in the story has anything intelligent or meaningful to say. As examples, two of the characters which I will not name due to potential spoilers (even if I believe that you'll just forget them anyway as soon as you finish the show, I'll still abide by my code of honor) have terrible family lives. It does not discuss at all anything deep about this at all or attempt to examine closely why things happen this way. One could say that this show is trying to tell us that parents are people too, except the parents are never depicted as actual people. The parents are all very two-dimensional characters who only appear to give the main characters something to react to. They're all just mean because if they weren't, there would be no story for the characters to experience. What I'm trying to say is that the story is unmemorable. It exists only to serve the characters. This makes sense though. This is a character-driven show, not story-driven. It doesn't require an amazing plotline to justify itself. It just needs one that provides the most amount of rounding for its characters. What it wants to make memorable is its characters, not its narrative. So, how are the characters?\\n\\n\r\nWell, they were likable but not really anything beyond that. They all follow a logical path of actions and thinking, but nothing else. They're characters can all be analyzable, but only down a level or too. None of them really fit right into stereotypes (except maybe Sana, our typical slightly dull-minded protagonist), but none of them were particularly realistic either. They all experience a good amount of character development, but it was a very step-by-step type of character development (this happens so she becomes this, then this happens so he becomes this). As an example, let's bring up Nanaka's character arc (no spoilers, I promise). Nanaka starts off as closed-off and distant. Angry, but a shy kind of angry. This is explained by her backstory that was pretty bad (as I said, no spoilers). She was angry at Sana for not being there for him even if she knows he couldn't. That's a pretty typical sentiment and not very illogical even if it seems so. Then, she starts opening up to Sana after several events where they got to talk alone. She however opens up in a very clear-cut way in, I'd say, a set of levels. Event 1, she gets closer to Sana but still somewhat distant. Event 2, she gets closer to Sana and now showing visible joy. Event 3, she's angry at Sana because of the classic anime misunderstanding. Event 4, she reveals feelings and is now really close to Sana. It's a very logically simple character development. It's character development, but not the most realistic. Nanaka is still a likable character, but not the most nuanced one. And this applies to all the main characters in the series. All of them are interesting to watch, but not interesting to analyze.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll use this penultimate paragraph just to note some other gripes I had with the show I didn't get to say. The plot twist in Nanaka's backstory barely matters at all. It could've been taken out and the show would still be the same. (Doing so might actually improve the show because it would add a bit more conflict). Her entire backstory itself felt lacking in buildup. Sana's backstory was the opposite. Sana's had lots of buildup over the entire series, however it ended up being very underwhelming, told over a minute, had no importance, and did nothing to change our perception of his character. The eleven year-old kid who was important in the first half completely loses all relevance in the second half. This would be fine if she didn't lose relevance so abruptly (even if they ended her relevance with something that managed to surprise even me at the end of episode six, that doesn't stop how quickly she lost her relevance). In the end, she could've even have been taken out of the entire show. Her existence adds nothing to the other main characters, their developments, and the overall plot. She may have rounded out some of Sana's character but that's it. It's also said that Shu is in love with someone, but we never get to see this be important (of course, he may have just said that as an excuse to the eleven year-old). Asami's entire character arc is also completely out of the blue and very random. It just started as \"I'm kind of important and may become very relevant soon\", then to \"I'm actually not what you think I am\" with no buildup whatsoever, and then to \"I'm not relevant anymore\". The twins' arc were okay, but it ended up feeling like it abruptly ended. It feels like there were some loose ends they didn't tie up. I'd say their arc was the strongest part of this series, but it still felt kind of lacking.\\n\\n\r\nNow that's all I have to say about this show. If I wrote this review any later, I probably would've forgotten many more things. If I forgot to mention any aspect of the show, it's because it's forgettable. The fact that all the characters were just forgotten after their arcs were done stuck with me though. I mean, it's just like this show.\\n\\n\r\nMy score is 5/10. Very forgettable.",

Then, when you finally decide to bite the bullet and pay for a Holiday for two to Australia, she doesn't show up the plane. The anime is utterly brilliant for the majority of the season, but completely falls flat on the final two episodes where audiences expect the most.\r\nM:Y is a high school romance/drama/comedy, with a tinge of mystery. The main character (Sana) leaves his group of best buddied on a five year hike, a returns to find that the girlhe cared about the most has turned into a complete emo. Thus, Sana must unravel the heck has happened, lest he end up like stabbed to death in a fit of jealous rage like Makoto in School Days.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of M:Y lies with its side characters. Sana's best mate and his twin sister, an adorable and crazy bookworm, and a 10 year girl who wants to prove she's an adult, and all characters noteworthy for how much they make you laugh. \\n\\n\r\nThe, unfortunately also becomes the show's major weakness, since the anime falters completely once these side characters are removed for the grand finale.

            "content": "\u201cSo you see\u2026.I AM the murderer.\u201d \r\n-\tAzumanga Daioh\r\nThis is a strange little anime. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with strange; Osaka is strange and weird and wonderful. The people of Myself Yourself are strange and creepy and painful. \r\nOn the day that Sana is to move away from his friends, we are given snapshots of each of them as they were once upon a time. Cheerful and soft-hearted Aoi bakes a cake, and smudges the icing with her tears. Shuri knits a mitten, a single one, offering it to Sana in the midst of an affectionate altercation with her twin brother, Shuu. Shuu gives Sana ahand-made fishing lure, and later runs after the train that Sana rides out of town, yelling a farewell message that is drowned out by the sound of the moving train. Nanaka ties up her hair with her favorite hair-tie (because it was given to her by Sana), and plays a simple violin piece, stopping in the middle with a plea that they wait patiently until she can complete it. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Sana returns, he is a high schooler; though he remains mild-mannered on the surface, he has issues that made it impossible to remain at his previous school. His friends have changed, too, and the story is told by flipping each of them over in turn, revealing their creepy or painful underbellies. No one is exempt, not even Asami or the senile grandmother that everyone visits at the senior center. \\n\\n\r\nCall it the Agatha Christie syndrome. But ever since the judge in And Then There Were None turned things upside down on fateful stormy Indian Island, writers have tried to capture that legendary element of psychological suspense by this flipping hat-trick. Oh, you think you know Asami? Flip! Nanaka of the stern visage, complete with a black crow cawing and shedding black feathers over her head? Flip! \\n\\n\r\nThe payoff should be a thrilling and fascinated shiver at the strangeness of it all. When Sana opens the mailbox and finds those letters within, filled with silent screams for help (knowing the reason why Nanaka is an orphan), I did shiver. But the biggest flip of all is the ending, where everyone is gathered together for a moment of feel-good closure. That was\u2026fascinating. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThree obligatory remarks:\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the animation is excellent. Even when the story becomes insufferably oppressive, little Sana and Nanaka are drawn to charming effect. The red mailbox on a road just outside of town, next to green fields and dark woods; the golden sunset over the sea as the twins visit their mother\u2019s grave; the city streets that are both familiar and foreign; the cool nightscapes with the light-house flickering at the convergence of sky, mountain and sea \u2013 they are a pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, the music. Serious dialogues are accompanied by solo guitar, with single violin added during Nanaka\u2019s monologues, there\u2019s a cello with a heart-beat percussion accompaniment during the fire scene, and an awesome trumpet theme for the Animenger episode. It\u2019s well done. \\n\\n\r\nThird, the voice characterizations. What was the problem with this anime again? Right, the story. The seiyuu were excellent, too. Fujimura sensei playfully voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi steals every scene. \\n\\n\r\nGrade: C\\n",

            "content": "When someone dares to show his face in his hometown after five long years of absence, it is okay to slap the guy as hard as you can in the face. And with that, the intensity of the story is set.\r\nMyself ; Yourself follows our hero Hidaka Sana who is a teenage boy with no extraordinary skills. He actually wears fashionable clothes, has one of the sweetest male voices on the planet and is caring for all of his friends. But that\u2019s it, he\u2019s just a guy in a T-shirt who pretty much is your average student sitting in the same classroom as you are,but you never really know him that well.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime begins, we see a group of young children having tea together and celebrating an event. Or rather, trying to soften up the wounds that are about to be opened. Sana will be leaving town because of his parents and has to leave everything behind that he has grown up with, including the bonds that he has with his best friends. After this quite cheerful piece of animation, we jump five years ahead and see the same Sana returning to the same town he left. This time, he is completely alone, with no parents, with no one by his side to accompany his journey. After going through the dramatic trip of nostalgia (or just walking through the hometown), he finds a couple of pretty interesting facts after his return. We get to know that, in a way, all of his old friends will be common things he will encounter on his path that is called \u2018\u2019daily life\u2019\u2019. Some of them will be in his class and even live nearby his newly acquired house. All\u2019s well, end\u2019s well, we shall say. But if it wasn\u2019t for a very teensy-tiny little problem raised by this group of friends, this anime would be at its end in one episode.\\n\\n\r\nWe get to see a hand that victimizes Sana\u2019s face by slapping it in what may be the most intense slapping sequence in anime history. What the animators probably realized by this point (and most likely you too, reading this review) is what we have seen until now is one of the most clich\u00e9d beginnings any storyline possibly can start of with. For this anime to stand out, the animators have got to try something completely new, or do something truly amazing. The animators started to think big. They realized that this kind of story has been done over and over again. Nobody is willing to watch the same story covered with some kind of fake chocolate cake over it to attract viewers, only to realize later that the chocolate cake was tasty for the first five minutes and the rest was actually something else that\u2019s brown. No, what this studio has done is raising the bar for clich\u00e9 storylines altogether.\\n\\n\r\nWe see that the hand is the beautiful girl Yatsushiro Nanaka\u2019s hand. Of all the childhood friends Sana had (he had four of them), Nanaka is the most special one to him. Even when they were little kids and they had no idea what the word \u2018\u2019romance\u2019\u2019 even meant, Sana just took Nanaka\u2019s hand without thinking and always protected her of all peril and threats the world threw at them. But now, Nanaka just looks gloomy and has distanced herself from almost all social contacts, including the other childhood friends and the returning Sana. She doesn\u2019t even return the greeting when Sana says \u2018\u2019Good morning!\u2019\u2019 with a handsome smile. The reason why she slapped Sana in the face? He could not recognize the beauty that Nanaka has become after all those years. He even introduced himself to her assuming she was someone he didn\u2019t know. A slap for Sana, joy for us.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design. The word of choice if you had to describe the graphics Myself ; Yourself has to offer. It\u2019s safe to say that this anime has one of the best character designers working in the industry. Every one of the characters looks so natural and clean but different enough to tell that each character has some depth in it. If you can do that as an artist, you have done your job well. Moreover, the artists responsible for the environments and backgrounds deserve applause. Never was the desire so big to be able to watch this anime in High Definition and lose yourself in that incredible world the artists created.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, we were talking about how the studio of Myself ; Yourself managed to set the bar for these kinds of clich\u00e9d storylines. We have quality character designs. We have top-notch background creators. And we have compelling characters that hold story and depth in them. Ingredients for a nice skin for this anime are available but what really makes or breaks an anime is the body. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s there. The body is there and it\u2019s amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThis body can be broken down to two segments. First we have the scenario. The story of Myself ; Yourself is written in a classical way of storyline development in drama/romance stories. The first half of the series is to set the tone of the series. To explain all the things that are important, to let you meet all the characters and to get familiar with the world of the story. The second half is the traditional \u2018\u2019problems\u2019\u2019 half, or hell-half, if you will. Everything that has been explained to you will be important here. The characters will face problems and difficulties and it\u2019s up to them to solve it. You follow those characters and get involved with the dramatic story, not being able to stop until you watch the last episode. This is the route Myself ; Yourself has taken in terms of storytelling which isn\u2019t bad but nothing groundbreaking either.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is groundbreaking however, or rather wave breaking, is the music. Anime music is underrated nowadays and there is this belief that music doesn\u2019t add as much to the enjoyment as people believe. The story of Myself ; Yourself which backs you up, tears you apart, lets you cry waterfalls and shows a light of hope breaks this belief. Never has music been this much of an impact as in this series. Especially the heartbreaking scenes have been able to shed tears to people who claim to have a heart of stone. It would be a lie that the music wasn\u2019t a part of this. \\n\\n\r\nFlaws haven\u2019t been spared in this anime though. The animators forgot that in the episodes with a lot of heart shredding scenes, they let the opening just play the way it was. The opening, which on a side note is a very good song and well animated, is a cheerful one with the message of hope. It collides with the sadness displayed in the anime and takes you away of that sympathy, of that \u2018\u2019I can feel this character\u2019s pain\u2019\u2019 vibe.\\n\r\nAnother flaw that\u2019s quite larger is the differences between serious scenes and normal scenes. The serious scenes are well executed, with perfectly timed music and above average animation. Clearly directed by a professional director.\\n\r\nNormal scenes however are slow, dull, don\u2019t have much energy and are not animated well enough. It\u2019s easy to see that they did this to not go over budget and to maintain the relaxed flow Myself ; Yourself has in the beginning. Generally, this would not disturb you given the fact that you get used to it throughout a series. But the borders between serious and normal scenes are so clear in this series; it does make you wonder why the animators did not choose for a more consistent approach of animating.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, Myself ; Yourself manages to distinguish itself from all other anime with similar storylines and have its own face. It is a tale about returning to one\u2019s long lost comfortable zone, only to realize that this comfort zone turned into a field of problems one must solve. Hidaka Sana encounters these problems, realizing that he cannot just return and assume that he can just sit there and live his life. He has people caring about him, needing for help and they\u2019re desperately trying to solve their own problems. Sana understands this and is willing to reach a hand to every friend, even if it hurts himself. Physically or in his heart. \\n",

            "content": "Seriously, I wasn't expecting anything from this show, I went in and dove deep with very low expectations. To my surprise, this show ended up VERY entertaining. \r\nDo NOT be fooled by the anime opening. They do not play music, nor are they super happy all the time. This shit gets epic, so don't misjudge it.\r\nThis isn't a harem, or a slice of life, nor is a romantic comedy: This is drama: The type of drama where you will see girls cry. Heck, even the guys. What surprised me was the fact that I thought it was many of the above categories, but OH BOYwas I wrong. It took a dramatic change after the first five generic episodes. I was struck with awe as I watched this generic show slowly become a show that I strongly wanted for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main character will feel dull, but after awhile his character begins to develop and it starts to all make sense. At first, I thought I wasn't going to like him because he's kinda dumb, but you know what? He has some development later on, so I wouldn't brand him generic anymore. He's not a great protagonist though, but he does the job.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't JUST focus on the main guy character: Some of his friends have intense stories, and the outcomes were great in all cases. \\n\r\nThere is even a pedo episode of a 10 year old girl staying over the protagonist's house. I mean, come on, you watch anime, you should be used to this anyways, whether you like it or not.\\n\\n\r\nThis show kept me laughing. No, not because the humor was funny, but because the events that took place in various spots comes out of no where, out of the blue, and makes me say \"WHHHAAT???\" Most of the events were unexpected. They were not predictable, and that's what kept me watching. I laughed many times and even talked to my tv screen because I was totally not expecting something. The situations in this show gets serious, and it's awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gives hints of creepiness and eerie auras from certain characters. At some points of the show, I thought at any moment, one character would snap out of the blue. What was funny about this was that I felt like the creators of this show didn't even do it on purpose, but I definitely could feel it. I feel like if the creator wanted to, he could make this a horror title, or another version of School Days.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't great. They have those cookie cutter eyes and very generic anime features. Nothing special about it, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was so good. Seriously, their tracks made me shed a man tear or two. It made me laugh at how epicly timed they were. I loved the scenes when the music completely sweeps the moment. I would say they are almost on par with Toradora's music.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't a masterpiece. It isn't revolutionary like Clannad or Toradora, but hell; this shit was entertaining. I think this was mostly why I rated it so high. If it makes me talk to my television screen, then it's doing something right. The plot twist and the foreshadowing was done right. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if you are looking for a new anime (you already watched most anime and ran out, such as Clannad, Toradora, Angel beats, Anohana, Little Busters, etc.)  that's super entertaining in the story and drama-inducing scenarios, then this show is what you are looking for!\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this was marathon'd for reviewing. I don't usually review shows that I watched once weekly: It has to be done in ONE go, and fresh in my mind. \\n\r\nI give this show a 8.5 yandere grandmas out of 10, but since animelist doesn't do .5's, then I'm going ahead and just giving it a 9/10 to get it more attention.\\n\\n\r\nCheck out my other reviews If you enjoyed reading my IMOs.",

            "content": "Since the producers of Myself;Yourself know that the established reception of the source game will carry their product for the season, no real care is taken into the other factors that make up a well-composed anime. Even Kyoto Animation sunk money into animation and revamped scores with their Key adaptations, though bringing those up as superior works of art is a bad sign right off the bat. Regardless, if the producers of the show don\u2019t care how they handle their own show, how do they expect us to receive it?\r\nThe main drive of the anime centers around a protagonist teenage boy who returns to achildhood town and faces difficulties accepting certain changes, particularly the distancing of an old friend now love interest. Said protagonist is written to take the place of the playable character from the visual novel, creating an immediate dull focal point in the narrative that can\u2019t even be saved by a last minute attempt at a tragic past. Those in the supporting cast who aren\u2019t cheap tools to pad the show out with pointless and trite sidestories are given mediocre arcs that only deliver so much emotional content. The script\u2019s tendency to flip flop between tame stories of nostalgia and lazy portrayals of familial abuse and sibling love does not help these remaining arcs. The resulting narrative is a jumble of short stories that demonstrate weak breadth and recycled drama.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that quick disappointment, the weakest link in Myself;Yourself is Dogakobo\u2019s animation. Devoid of any sort of passion, this is easily one of the company\u2019s blandest animation jobs, and that\u2019s a heavy statement considering their repertoire. The considerable lack of care in the art begs the question of why we\u2019re even wasting our time watching it. Anime with great stories and cheap animation usually showcase a certain passion to tell said story through artistry that shines through in the final piece. M;Y doesn\u2019t come with that, instead skimping everywhere it can with flat character designs, vapid expression, choppy movement, and facile atmosphere. In anime especially, art design is just as important in showing the emotion in a show\u2019s writing. So, when an entire art department renders the script as cheap as it possibly can, huge opportunities for engaging the audience are lost. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Myself;Yourself is relatively easy to take in for a casual viewer. The emotional barebones of the preexisting story, while banal and poorly handled in places, are told straightforwardly enough to be effective at times. Although the boring protagonists going through their share of romance cliches, the growth between them is paced reasonably and remains the subject of focus in the surrounding narrative noise, even concluding decently. But the simple truth is that nostalgia based narratives in other original anime hit home way harder than a weak adaptation of a weak visual novel ever could, and that\u2019s exactly the case here.\\n\\n\r\nMyself;Yourself:\\n\r\n3/10",

            "content": "Yeah, another great romance anime. Wohhoo!: Oh crap their missing the romance seen again\r\nStory:9/10\r\nMyself Yourself has one of the best stories i have ever seen in an anime and i was impressed at how it caught my attention through out the episodes. They had a hard boiled plot that added an theme of mystery and child hood trauma. I would always feel for each character anytime they would go through a problem and that was one of the key things that got me hooked to this anime. I did read some reviews that pointed this anime out as one of average but i highly disagree.This anime portrays a unique style of Show don't tell and it would constantly cause me to ask questions. The simple fact that I asked questions at proves that it was not average. An average anime would be predictable and easily compared. What i disliked about the story however were some of the themes. The drama was done perfectly but when it came to romance it was lacking in a few areas. I will discuss the characters part in it later but the overall view of romance in the anime was a bit dull and boring. There were times were you could see the connection but i never really saw any development of the romance theme. Another thing that hinted this out was the kiss scene which was not there. A key factor of development in an anime is the kiss and if you don't have a kiss then you kind of just shat in the face of romance anime lovers. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nArt in this anime was done fabulously. I won't go as far as to say that the art made me want to cry, but it does have some great views at times. Their were scenes that would be beautiful and i loved it but it was nothing i haven't seen before.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/8 Subbed\\n\r\nThe sound track in this anime was done alright to the point that it added to the atmosphere of the anime but it still lacked in a few areas. The sound track wasn't anything superb but the voice actors did a great job in portraying feelings to each character. I also would give Ami, the voice actor of Nanaka an award because she did a great job in portraying pain to her character. Trust me, these kinds of people make the subbed better than the dubbed anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe character development was done great in this anime. They developed on the main characters in a way that it actually made sense, unlike some anime that try to drop back stories and expect points for character development{Lamune}. Although they had great development, their were still some areas that were lacking again. Earlier I mentioned that the romance in this anime was done poorly and the characters were a big problem here. Two main love connection in this anime were invisible to my eye until they did an impact scene. I saw how their friendship grew but i didn't really sew any love between any characters. This hurt the anime a bit because at the end the show the how the characters ended up together but we didn't really get romance so it came off a bit forced. another thing I found disturbing was the lack of development with the character of Aoi. She was listed as a main but we never really got to know how important she was in the group. She was just there to be there that also made the understanding of the characters to be difficult. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i loved this anime and it is certainly a must watch for drama anime lovers. Although I wouldn't really call this anime romance i would recommend it to romance anime lovers as well. \\n",

            "content": "This is my very first review, so bare with me. :)\r\nWhen I saw the cover of Myself; Yourself, I thought it looked like it would be a very cute anime with a lot of romance and good artwork. But it ended up being a lot more than that. It dealt with a lot of life issues, and although some of them seemed a little far-fetched, the way the characters interacted and helped eachother through the trials was very uplifting. But I do think it was a little too dramatic at times, like a japanese soap-opera.\r\nStory: The first couple episodes had a cute story but Ifelt as though there wasn't much substance to the story. Sure, it made me laugh a lot but there just wasn't much in the area of a real plot. Towards the end I even felt, &quot;How are they going to possibly end this anime with a good ending?&quot; But the last episode really tied the entire series together very nicely. There were a couple cute twists and the relationships between all of the characters was very well thought-out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As I said, the cover is what attracted me to this anime from the start. I really loved all of the artwork and the way the characters were drawn. (except I hated how all the blood appears... black?) The backgrounds and settings are drawn beautifully and the colors are wonderful, especially the sakura trees and the sunrises.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP was very cute but it did start to get annoying by the end. I personally loved the ED and it's one of the few ending themes that I actually listened to after every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main characters were all designed very nicely and drawn nicely. Personally, the big boobs... is just so unrealistic but I know they do that a lot in these shows. I hate to say it, but most of the voices of the girl characters were very annoying. Especially Aoi. But the way the characters interacted throughout the series was incredible!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have to say that I did laugh a lot while watching this anime, and at one point I actually almost began to cry. There were some very cute scenes, romantic scenes, and depressing scenes. This anime has the ability to cause all of your emotions to react in the same episode, which I thought was one of the things that made it so terrific!\\n\\n\r\nI personally really do recommend this anime to everyone! :)",

            "content": "Okay, first of all, this is one of my first reviews so bare with me and don't hesitate to message me about what i should improve about, anyways lets get started shall we?\r\nStory- When people look at Myself; Yourself's cover, they usually get the automatic reaction that its a typical harem anime with predictable outcomes, which is not true. Of course, if you totally dislike school life - romance animes then you shouldn't bother wasting your time watching a genre you do not like. Back on topic, the story basically revolves around friendship more then relationship between opposite sex, and let memake this clear again... THIS IS NOT A HAREM!\\n\\n\r\nArt- I seriously liked the artwork in Myself; Yourself, not because the girl's were fairly pretty designed but the background and the male character as well. I thought Sana's red eyes blended into his characteristic and other things that happen (Not gonna say it, if you wanna know.. you gotta watch it =] ).\\n\\n\r\nSound- Basically, I loved the OP of the series and the video for it seemed like they were meant for each other so no problem there. The ED wasn't really my style of anime music but the OP makes up for it(to me). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The one thing that Myself; Yourself had that didn't really appeal to me, were some of the characters. Don't get me wrong, some of the characters i really liked. Hinako is defiantly a candidate for the most annoying character. Mainly because of the way she acts and the way she bothers Sana and Syuusuke all the time. Sorry if i offended anyone who likes her character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I personally love the genre school-life romance so therefore this a series i really enjoyed. Again this series will differ between people, you may love it or you may hate it, it all depends on what type of anime you like to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall i really enjoyed this series and as i said before, I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys this type of school-life romance anime.",

            "content": "Myself; Yourself is a Slice of Life, Romance, Comedy, Drama about a boy (Sana) who had to leave his home town and his friends, with his parents. Then 5 years later he returns to see that quite a bit has changed.\r\nAs this short anime series begins it is obvious that there&rsquo;s nothing unique about it and that it is just the usual \"visual novel\" &ndash; to &ndash; \"anime\" adaptations that are released every season. The story begins normally enough by introducing the surroundings and the characters with their little quirks. There are also the typical Rom/Com clich&eacute;d moments that happen quite a lot (girl tripsover and lands on guy) however these jokes are executed well enough that it feels refreshing. Apart from the one or two serious moments in every episode there is no real drama in this series, until about halfway into the series. The good thing is that it doesn&rsquo;t just unload a bunch of drama because a lot of it was just confirmation to previous speculations you may have had whilst watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime have the typical personalities that most anime fans are used to seeing. However there is one girl (Aoi) who has a really odd and quirky personality that is really fun to watch but her voice can be both cute and annoying. Even with these pretty normal characters, they all are somewhat mysterious, which will give you the urge to watch the next episode, to find out what occurred in the past.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is really good with the best of it being in the detailed environments, which make good use of the light and shadows. The characters themselves also look good but there&rsquo;s nothing special about their designs and they also lack fluid animation. The music is also good, most of the time, but there are times when it feels out of place, just like the OP and ED theme.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Myself; Yourself has proven to be something great to watch, for most Romance anime fans. It has all the basic elements to make a great story and some interesting characters to match. The one thing I can say is that behind all surprises and unexpected developments, this anime series lacks originality to make it stand out. Other than that it is a great show to watch.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I've had a lot of first impressions when I see an anime. Most of them end up being what I've had predicted while a few changes my perspective.\r\nMyself; Yorself is an example of an illusion. Seeing pictures of anime high school friends in one picture always seem to look like a typical comedy, romance, shoujo or a harem anime. That was what I thought.\r\nStory: 9\r\nTo be honest, I was part of the majority who thought \"Myself; Yourself\" was a harem anime. I've seen Myself; Yourself a number of times in different sites but the only reaction I usually get was \"oh another stupid harem anime.give me a break\". It took me about a year for me to take the initiative to watch this anime only because one of my favorite Seiyuus, Ami Koshimizu, voice acted the main character. I rarely rate a Romantic-Drama \"9\" because I rarely see one that can execute well. You can say this anime, has more of a dramatic based genre rather than romance because of the friendship link between the characters. Every episode gives you a glimpse of the story of these characters and true enough the story does get more interesting as you go further. It made me want more and more. Soon enough, I was able to finish this anime in just 2 days (It could have been 1 day if I slept at 3 AM). Yes, the story was that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI can't deny that the art/animation I see nowadays does progress and becomes much more beautiful than the animes that were made in the late 2000s. But seeing the animes made during that year (Code Geass, School Days, ef-a tale of memories), I'm sure that the art was on par with every anime back then.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI really don't like the Opening \"Song\" although I love how the Opening \"Animation\" went (there's a difference). Although, the Ending song is much different. I actually liked the Ending song just because it reminded me of Steins; Gate (same singer) and it felt catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nCharacter development, sure flourished the whole anime series. The characters were explained very well. You can see that their lives were acted on each of the person's lives. Some secrets were revealed during the anime and it did surprise me. I can't say I don't hate a character but then seeing how these characters went by during the anime made me understand how different people can be behind the naked eye.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nKnowing that I watched this 13-episode Anime within just 2 days clearly explains how I had a great time watching this anime. I don't think it's the enjoyment that led me to watch the anime in 2 days. I guess it was because I was curious to know what would be next. The anime was such a thrilling anime to watch that I was seeking for more answers from the upcoming episodes. I could have enjoyed this anime much more if only there was a different ending. To be frank, the ending was kind of laid back for me. For me, there was no spark at the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nSeeing how an anime can create romance in such a serious dramatic anime won me over. This anime is one of those \"don't judge a book by its cover\" because if you do then you will surely miss out something worth watching.",

If you peek while I'm changing, I'm going to kill you, got it?\u201d\r\n \u2013 Hinako Mochida\r\nMyself;Yourself is primarily a drama genre anime with little-to-medium romance.\r\nThe Story: 7/10\r\n------------------\r\nThe anime starts with our male protagonist, Sana who has come back to his hometown of Sakuranomori, after leaving it 5 years before for the sake of his parents\u2019 business plans. He is surprised to see that most things have not changed, until he meets Yatsushiro Nanaka, one of his best childhood friends when he wasyounger. The story here is rather simple. With new ideas introduced, they do not change much to the story. Basically all they do is reinforce the story to try and make it a little more interesting. Sometimes it is even used to reset character development in the story. The pacing of Myself;Yourself is solid. Did it feel quick? No. Did it feel slow? Sometimes, maybe. Some episodes can be considered to be \u2018side quests\u2019, if you will, and have no particular meaning to the main story. Despite this anime being a drama, it is rather comedic once things loosen up, notably at the beginning of the anime. The drama can be a little predictable, but the producers will always throw something at you to keep you on the edge wanting more. Romance is not as much as a major genre as drama, but it was well fleshed out- though it definitely is not as solid as some other series you can find. The ending is satisfying, though some may be disappointed that certain elements were not taken further at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 9/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nThe art probably has to be one of the best for an anime that aired in 2007. Its scenery and characters are very well done, and they fit the personality very well. One dispute is with the size of Aoi\u2019s breasts. She may be in high school, but hell. They\u2019re bigger than her head. The art style is very fitting for the overall story because it incorporates a lot of \u2018emotion shading\u2019. When the characters are happy, the art is as if it\u2019s happy itself. When the characters are sad/depressed, it\u2019s almost as if the art is feeling that way as well. Character movement was smooth, albeit a little \u2018blocky\u2019 during some sections and background movement was just as good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 7/10\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nThe OP and EDs in Myself;Yourself aren\u2019t distinctly memorable. After watching the anime, you probably won\u2019t even think anything of it.  OSTs were very appropriate for the mood during a scene and blended in very well. Sometimes it worked so well you can\u2019t even tell when it came in. Voice acting here wasn\u2019t exactly the best, Aoi\u2019s voice seemed to be the most annoying one out of all them because of her constantly high-pitching everything she says. Though it might not have been as good as other anime made this year, the voice acting was bearable. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 8/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nNot many character problems here, but one annoying thing here is how the writers would reset the relationship between characters whenever there was some \u2018turning point\u2019 drama in the story. Each of the cast is likable, even Aoi who is the one who brings most of the comedy to the anime. Nanaka appears to be the most mature in the story, and the main heroine. Her past is where most of the main drama comes out of. Sana is the main protagonist and the story mostly revolves around him and his ability to make decisions. Then you have the boy/girl twin, there\u2019s quite a bit of comedy in the two- but that comedy is mostly because of disagreement between the two. Hinako comes in the end of the first \u00bc of the anime, and she seems to actually be the most funniest- but can definitely be serious at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nPersonally, my enjoyment of Myself;Yourself was very good. The cliff hangers at the end of each episode kept me wanting more. I probably won\u2019t watch this again, since this can be considered a type of \u2018one time only\u2019 anime. You probably won\u2019t get much satisfaction watching this again. Myself;Yourself is the first romance/drama genre anime I have watched, a genre that I didn\u2019t really like when I started watching anime. Seeing this changed it for me, and now I really enjoy the romance/drama category of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nOverall I think that Myself ; Yourself really is a great series. If you're going to start watching a teen, romance and drama anime this is definitely a good place to start.\\n",

The solution is finding ways to cope with it, or change it for the better.\r\nMyself;Yourself. I've been planning on watching this for a while now, little did I expect to find such an intriguing anime worthy of being watched in a single day! Despite the few flaws in the show, this is what most dramas should be like. Romance, fights, a look into people's pasts, and a twist ending all make up an excellent drama.\r\nTo start off the review, let's go into the story. Sana iscoming back to his hometown for the first time in years. Things have changed, but at the same time, things haven't. He comes to this town with memories of his past, some in which he's trying to piece together to make it whole again, but one thing he does remember were the good times he spent with his friends as children. He then reunites with all of them in High School, happy, eh? At least most of the time. Throughout the story, there's comedy, hints of romance, scandal, and twists that'll make you either flip out or let your mouth hang in awe as to what just happened. This is why I like watching animes like these, they spice up the story with things people never expect to happen, and in the case of Myself;Yourself, most of the twists never end up being happy.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to reviewing the artwork in an anime, I never really know what to say, it's either a big blank or a simple \"It was good\", I am never able to create a long paragraph about it, but Myself;Yourself has flawless art. The scenery was beautiful, the characters were portrayed in kind of a way that suits their personalities, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nSound isn't one of my strongsuits either, but I can say for the most part that Myself;Yourself had excellent voice acting! Surprisingly though, the oldest character in the group (Aoi, a 3rd year in High School) sounded like a chipmunk with too much helium in it's lungs and apparently seemed to get high very often. In other words, her voice made you want to laugh out loud every time she spoke. For the most part it was funny, but at points it was just plain strange.\\n\\n\r\nOh good, a strongsuit of mine. Characters. I liked them all, or at least most of them. The main character, Sana, seemed to be cool and collected most of the time, but somehow acted like a normal teenager at the same time (says the giant stack of playboy magazines sitting in a box out of reach from girls). Then there's Nanaka, mature and stern most of the time. Aoi, the drugged chipmunk, seemed to be hyperactive all the time, even in the most depressing of times. The twins, you can totally tell they're siblings, they bring the rough comedy to the anime with constant insults and fights breaking out between the two of them. Out of all the characters in the show, I think the only one that I despised almost as much as Sugou from Sword Art Online was the teacher that was always sucking up to the principal and being a douche-bag. Minor role, but he angered me.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show having some good comedy and romance to it, along with some good stories, the show was... in a word... depressing for a portion of it. Most of the depression happens to be things that would end up spoiling the show for you, so I won't get into those, but I enjoyed the show a lot. I haven't seen many dramas (or at least I don't think I have), so watching this gave me a pretty good idea about what I should be looking for in dramas. Watch it, you'll enjoy it for the most part, just have a box of tissues, just in case.",

            "content": "Myself;Yourself is a romantic comedy about a boy name Sana and his childhood friend Nanaka. \r\nStory: The story is quite typical; a boy comes back to his hometown after 5 years, to see everything has changed. Although most of the story is predictable, there are some good twists to the plot that will leave you shocked most of the time. The story also goes through a small number of flashbacks to reveal more of the characters. The story loses marks for some of the unnecessary fillers. Although the series is 13 episodes, the producer has made a good job to wrap everything up. \r\nArt: Theart in Myself;Yourself is pretty good, however since it is aired this year, the art is not outstanding compared to others. However it still provides the viewer a pleasant animation to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is great, the OP and ED is just filled with happiness and joy. Also Nanaka's violin playing is beautiful as well. The music works well with the anime, providing tension in awkward moments and bringing joy into happy times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each character has a unique personality, through the cute Aoi, to the mysterious Nanaka. The character develops fairly fluent through the 13 episodes. Nanaka and Sana's past leaves the viewer in mysteries, which is great because it really makes the audience guess/predict what had happen during the 5 years. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Yeah, I enjoyed it. Although it is a short anime, I really liked seeing each character develop slowly in the anime. Combined with beautifully drawn art, and nicely composed music, Myself;Yourself did a great job entertaining me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Myself;Yourself may not be the best anime out there, but it is really something you should pick up and watch. And no, it is NOT like school days. So don't expect anything gruesome. ^^\\n\\n\\n",

It opened strong and gave me high hopes for a good series, but it soon became apparent that it was going to go down fast.\r\n   The story was my biggest disappointment. It really felt like a series based on a visual novel, there was a lot of story, but nothing to really hold it together. The pacing of the series felt sluggish, a lot of the conflicts could have been resolved faster. It felt as though half of the series was dedicated to Hinako, the little girl, even though she had nothing to dowith the main plot of the series. Another thing that i found troublesome was how melodramatic the story became. By the end I couldn't bother to take anything seriously anymore.\\n\\n\r\n    The characters, while mostly falling into cliches, did have some interesting points, the twins especially. Everyone fit in, and felt believable, despite their obvious repetitions, but Aoi's voice really got on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\n    The art and animation was bad. Not as bad as something like Ramune, but really lacking in polish. There's not really much more I can say about it, other than it was kind of blah.\\n\\n\r\n    The music and sound was fairly decent. Despite the stories faults, the music would fit in with what was going on, but it never really moved me, or made me want to just listen to it.\\n\\n\r\n   I guess by now you could guess that I didn't really enjoy this series. While it started strong, it quickly fell, and never recovered.",

            "content": "Contrary to your average series, Myself;Yourself is unlike any other game to anime adaptations. First of all, the visual novel for the series wasn't released when the TV series had been approved, thus making impossible to compare it to a previous work.\r\nI don't know what kind of visual novel M;Y will be, but if it's anything like the TV series, then it must be a great one. Sure, the settings and motifs are not unique, but, seriously, what is unique nowadays? The way the plot is developed is outstanding, save the number of episodes (I personally think 16 would have been perfect), as things mayseem a tad rush in the final episode, and some side-stories weren't exactly resolved (while are hints that indicate they are, it'd been great to see them actually happen, and also, a story for Aoi-chan would've been great too).\\n\r\nAs far as the animation goes, Doga Kobo made a great job on this series, which is a very good thing in these times when anime budgets are not exactly high, and dropouts in quality ocurr more often; but you won't see any inconsistencies in the animation in Myself;Yourself, every episode has the same amount of quality as the one before!\\n\r\nThe music on this series, both OP/ED themes and OST, are excellent, even though the OP has that genki-genki happy-happy feeling that doesn't fit well with the plot, it fits the whole series very well, as it reminisces the happy moments that were present.\\n\r\nThe characters, well, may seem like typical, but trust me, they're NOT typical, and their personal issues flow episode by episode, making you eager to know what's next and to find out their past experiences. Each and everyone of them have their own importance, and you'll manage to like them all.\\n\r\nOverall, I think Myself;Yourself deserves a 9 out of 10 for being a nice surprise and sticking with a great quality from its beggining to its closure, and I'd recommend it to any anime fan who appreciates a nice romance drama series.",

            "content": "Myself; Yourself is the story of Sana and his four childhood friends, whom he gets separated with after having to move away. He comes back after about five years, finding some of his friends remaining the same, and others very much different. Though it might come across as a stereotypical harem, at a closer look much more is unfolded in the story. It&rsquo;s a romance, but often steers towards friendship as well. \r\nIt&rsquo;s not a bad watch, but I certainly can&rsquo;t say I loved it. The plot was a little hard to grasp on what it really was. Through the first half of the seriesbefore it started going anywhere it was more like a weak thread of events. Some episodes were dramatic and interesting, but not all of the emotion seemed very real. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was okay, but I really disliked the main character, Sana. That&rsquo;s not very good when you&rsquo;re watching a series: you don&rsquo;t even like the protagonist. I suppose those type of leads I never really like, he just annoys me. Nanaka, too, the main girl, was a little irritating. She acted depressed and moody, and it doesn&rsquo;t come clear until late into the show as to what her problem is. Mostly it just seemed like she was on her time of the month throughout the show, considering her emotions, which were all over the place. However, I did like some of the other characters, like the twins, Shuusuke and Shuri. They were very sweet towards one another&hellip; I was wishing they weren&rsquo;t even brother and sister as I watched episode ten, but I won&rsquo;t tell you what went on: you have to see for yourself! Generally the majority of characters seem stereotypical, except for Aoi, her character was pretty unique. She was very amusing. There is also Asami, a classmate of our characters&rsquo;, who appears normal and helpful. However, it is not all what it seems with her, and I much changed my opinion of Asami later on. That was very surprising, and added a twist to the story. Lastly there&rsquo;s Hinako, a young girl desperate to be referred to as mature, who gets infatuated with Shuusuke after he helps her out against some bullies.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was fairly nice, and I liked the way the faces and characters were generally drawn. However, inconsistency often was portrayed in the animation movements, and it lacked fluidity. Some of the poses or stances they were put in, too, were awkward. The colors however, were pretty, and though it was definitely not outstanding it was all in all pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was really nice, and I liked the opening and ending themes, enough to get both the mp3s, they're both very good and fit the anime nicely. Background music was standard, nothing that stands out, anyway. As for seiyuu, everyone did a fairly good job, with the right amount of feeling put into their voice. Sana&rsquo;s voice fit him, as did the others. Aoi&rsquo;s voice might be the most annoying, but I actually liked it, even though it&rsquo;d be a bit hard to listen to, ahaha.. ha.\\n\\n\r\nMyself; Yourself is nothing of great value, but it&rsquo;s a nice show to watch. I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly heartily recommend it, but try it out and see what you think. Obviously there&rsquo;s mixed reviews, if you check out the reviews written prior to mine (and that&rsquo;s a lot!).",

            "content": "Friendship. Jealousy. Deception. Myself ; Yourself proves that you can present good elements for a drama and still be a failure. The show is misleading as it introduces characters facing solid dilemma but depends on dissatisfying deus ex machina to solve their problems or leave events incomplete altogether. The characters are weak and majorly lack development. It wastes screentime on irrelevant characters and scenes, causing it to rush and throw in last-minute sob stories. Basically, Myself ; Yourself is just another VN gone wrong.\r\nMyself ; Yourself had interesting themes suitable for slice-of-life. It replaced clich\u00e9 results one would likely expect from romance drama with unpredictableoutcomes. This is when Myself ; Yourself looks to be promising until it decides to do the worst thing imaginable. An episode ends intensely, causing you to look forward to a continuation in the next episode. Disappointingly, you have to wait another 2-3 episodes of either fillers or an additional situation they could\u2019ve introduced a lot sooner. Additionally, there are these constant annoying clich\u00e9 accidents where a girl \u201caccidentally\u201d trips, resulting in an awkward situation with a guy. Just when you think it couldn\u2019t possibly get any worse, Myself ; Yourself decides to leave certain characters in a distressful situation and ends the show with no knowledge of what happened whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe weak characters are a major problem. Some emotions are heartfelt, but characters sometimes did not react appropriately to a situation. For example, a character simply says they\u2019re sad without expressing it at all. A prime example of Myself ; Yourself\u2019s habit of skipping events is the introduction of a demanding little girl named Hinako, who can do the show a big favor if she was nonexistent. Myself ; Yourself decides to give Hinako her own two episodes and screen time to intrude on the friends' lives that could\u2019ve been used to develop them instead. The show reveals some characters' past, inner emotions, or close relationships with each other, but others receive no exposure. Relationships are left incomplete, since Myself ; Yourself abruptly ends or distracts the viewer away from them with a different scene. You're left in the dark and never hear from those characters again. Once the show decides to pay attention to a character, it introduces a very important factor about characters at the very last moment with a quick self-narration that gives you no time to sympathize with them. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was a major turn-off. It looks like an older type animation from the '90s instead of 2000s. Bland colors make the show even more disinteresting. When a character bleeds black blood, it is hard to take that scene seriously. The background designs were good but not too detailed. With a simple big-eyed character designs comes identical characters that makes the show hard to follow. The different hairstyles made it tolerable, but it caused complications when one character decides to change it or let their hair down. There were still scenes and times when characters talked without their mouths moving. I thought it was simply their thoughts until the other character responded. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both good but misleading. Truthfully, the lyrics relate to the show\u2019s motive in terms of the characters looking forward to a better tomorrow. On the other hand, the OP presented the friends as a band when only two of the five have any musical talent. The ED only featured three girls, replacing one of the MC with a supporting character. It is likely to expect some close connection with those three girls, but there\u2019s nothing important about their relationship. Too bad this does not have an English dub version, because Aoi has an annoying, squeaky voice in Japanese. The other seiyuu were okay. They fit the characters\u2019 personalities, but there were times when their voices didn\u2019t match their emotions. The sound effects were natural, especially with the bird chirps in outdoor settings.\\n\\n\r\nMyself ; Yourself had opportunities to be promising, but it is sheer disappointment, especially with its \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d ending. You learn nearly nothing about the characters or how a dramatic situation magically resolves itself. Relationships are unfinished or unseen, and it leaves not a single hint for the imagination. If Myself ; Yourself completed itself, I would ignore the dull colors, Hinako\u2019s existence, and Aoi's ear-bleeding voice, and suggest any romance drama fan to give this a try. In actuality, Myself ; Yourself can be bypassed with no regrets.",

This isn't a dating anime despite Sana being surrounded by girls because he never took the initiative or had interest in any of them other than Nanaka. Aside from that Myself;Yourself revolves around the importance of friendships and why they should be valued. \r\nStory: The moment I saw the first episode I knew this would be a great anime. Story wise I liked it every aspect of it, but I do feel like Sana's background regarding his past was presented too late. Still every character made the story very good. The twinswith their hilarious comedy, Aoi and her child like voice, Hinako and her pretend to be mature self. Every character added their own qualities and characteristics to make the story strong.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to say here except for the amazing background and character designs. I'm not a fan of red eyes, but Sana's red eyes fit his personality and show his past that he keeps for himself. Aoi on the other hand grew a lot up there, short hair, and still kept that child like voice. Aoi's characteristics sure suit her voice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: My least disliked character was Hoshino not because of what she did, but because of her actions with Sana I didn't really like. The characters I hated the most was that lazy employee always next to the principal because he never stated adequate reasons when a student was in trouble, he always took the principals' side because it was convenient. The other character I hated was Sana's father because of his actions he took. I will never forgive him for that. Nanaka is one of my favorite characters despite being reserved she is a sweet, caring, and also pretty. One thing I will never forget is that pout face she showed.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Myself;Yourself? Absolutely. Why? 3 reasons, story had my full attention, always wanted to know what the next episode was about, and Nanaka captivated my heart. I hope there's a second season or at least an OVA episode where Sana and the others reunite because the ending was a bit rushed. We can imply what happened, but as viewers we want to see what happens after, not imply what happens.Still I haven't had a good cry since the first anime I watched last year, and Myself;Yourself executed that perfectly, enough to make me cry again. 10/10",

            "content": "Eh... I expected worse.\r\nThis show is not generic. It may seem like one, but you can tell that when you watch it that they're really trying to do something else with the whole high school romance thing. It is however very forgettable.\r\nLet me just address the art first. I see a lot of people in the reviews praising how well the backgrounds are and how well the characters are animated. In my personal opinion, the backgrounds were fairly good, but nothing special. I barely paid attention to it. The characters are not animated in any special way. It's just typical anime animation. I did notfind anything special in the show's art. It was good I bet, but none of it had any lasting effect on me for me to be able to even remember an example right now (and I just finished the show a few minutes ago). And this is coming from someone who regulars Sakugabooru. I usually pay a lot of attention to these. (Or maybe it's because that I visit Sakugabooru often since I might've been overexposed to so much stellar animation).\\n\\n\r\nI also saw some people praising the voice acting. I don't typically pay attention to voice acting and I don't really know what qualifies as good voice acting or not, so I won't say anything about it here. However, I just want to say that the senpai of the group whose name I forgot because she really was only a side character has the most annoying voice ever. It's like someone fused a frog and a cat and told the resulting monstrosity to sound cute. And being the first character to be introduced after the protagonist, Sana, I suddenly got massive premonitions of how bad this show might be when she first started speaking. (Fortunately, those premonitions weren't met in entirety.) I got used to her voice eventually, but I wouldn't call that good voice-acting in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's discuss the story. It's a very simple storyline to be frank. Bad things happen after a period of good things and they keep happening until they stop happening and everyone's changed because of it. It's not a bad storyline. This actually applies to every story out there. It's probably not a story if this doesn't apply to it. However, what makes this show different from superior stories is that this show's story lacks both nuance and anything worth remembering. At this point of writing (which, as said earlier, is only a few minutes after finishing the show), I can't really remember anything more than what I just said earlier. Bad things just happened to the characters. Now there's nothing bad about having a simple story as long as it's memorable. However, this story is not memorable. None of anything that happens in the story has anything intelligent or meaningful to say. As examples, two of the characters which I will not name due to potential spoilers (even if I believe that you'll just forget them anyway as soon as you finish the show, I'll still abide by my code of honor) have terrible family lives. It does not discuss at all anything deep about this at all or attempt to examine closely why things happen this way. One could say that this show is trying to tell us that parents are people too, except the parents are never depicted as actual people. The parents are all very two-dimensional characters who only appear to give the main characters something to react to. They're all just mean because if they weren't, there would be no story for the characters to experience. What I'm trying to say is that the story is unmemorable. It exists only to serve the characters. This makes sense though. This is a character-driven show, not story-driven. It doesn't require an amazing plotline to justify itself. It just needs one that provides the most amount of rounding for its characters. What it wants to make memorable is its characters, not its narrative. So, how are the characters?\\n\\n\r\nWell, they were likable but not really anything beyond that. They all follow a logical path of actions and thinking, but nothing else. They're characters can all be analyzable, but only down a level or too. None of them really fit right into stereotypes (except maybe Sana, our typical slightly dull-minded protagonist), but none of them were particularly realistic either. They all experience a good amount of character development, but it was a very step-by-step type of character development (this happens so she becomes this, then this happens so he becomes this). As an example, let's bring up Nanaka's character arc (no spoilers, I promise). Nanaka starts off as closed-off and distant. Angry, but a shy kind of angry. This is explained by her backstory that was pretty bad (as I said, no spoilers). She was angry at Sana for not being there for him even if she knows he couldn't. That's a pretty typical sentiment and not very illogical even if it seems so. Then, she starts opening up to Sana after several events where they got to talk alone. She however opens up in a very clear-cut way in, I'd say, a set of levels. Event 1, she gets closer to Sana but still somewhat distant. Event 2, she gets closer to Sana and now showing visible joy. Event 3, she's angry at Sana because of the classic anime misunderstanding. Event 4, she reveals feelings and is now really close to Sana. It's a very logically simple character development. It's character development, but not the most realistic. Nanaka is still a likable character, but not the most nuanced one. And this applies to all the main characters in the series. All of them are interesting to watch, but not interesting to analyze.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll use this penultimate paragraph just to note some other gripes I had with the show I didn't get to say. The plot twist in Nanaka's backstory barely matters at all. It could've been taken out and the show would still be the same. (Doing so might actually improve the show because it would add a bit more conflict). Her entire backstory itself felt lacking in buildup. Sana's backstory was the opposite. Sana's had lots of buildup over the entire series, however it ended up being very underwhelming, told over a minute, had no importance, and did nothing to change our perception of his character. The eleven year-old kid who was important in the first half completely loses all relevance in the second half. This would be fine if she didn't lose relevance so abruptly (even if they ended her relevance with something that managed to surprise even me at the end of episode six, that doesn't stop how quickly she lost her relevance). In the end, she could've even have been taken out of the entire show. Her existence adds nothing to the other main characters, their developments, and the overall plot. She may have rounded out some of Sana's character but that's it. It's also said that Shu is in love with someone, but we never get to see this be important (of course, he may have just said that as an excuse to the eleven year-old). Asami's entire character arc is also completely out of the blue and very random. It just started as \"I'm kind of important and may become very relevant soon\", then to \"I'm actually not what you think I am\" with no buildup whatsoever, and then to \"I'm not relevant anymore\". The twins' arc were okay, but it ended up feeling like it abruptly ended. It feels like there were some loose ends they didn't tie up. I'd say their arc was the strongest part of this series, but it still felt kind of lacking.\\n\\n\r\nNow that's all I have to say about this show. If I wrote this review any later, I probably would've forgotten many more things. If I forgot to mention any aspect of the show, it's because it's forgettable. The fact that all the characters were just forgotten after their arcs were done stuck with me though. I mean, it's just like this show.\\n\\n\r\nMy score is 5/10. Very forgettable.",

            "content": "\u201cSo you see\u2026.I AM the murderer.\u201d \r\n-\tAzumanga Daioh\r\nThis is a strange little anime. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with strange; Osaka is strange and weird and wonderful. The people of Myself Yourself are strange and creepy and painful. \r\nOn the day that Sana is to move away from his friends, we are given snapshots of each of them as they were once upon a time. Cheerful and soft-hearted Aoi bakes a cake, and smudges the icing with her tears. Shuri knits a mitten, a single one, offering it to Sana in the midst of an affectionate altercation with her twin brother, Shuu. Shuu gives Sana ahand-made fishing lure, and later runs after the train that Sana rides out of town, yelling a farewell message that is drowned out by the sound of the moving train. Nanaka ties up her hair with her favorite hair-tie (because it was given to her by Sana), and plays a simple violin piece, stopping in the middle with a plea that they wait patiently until she can complete it. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Sana returns, he is a high schooler; though he remains mild-mannered on the surface, he has issues that made it impossible to remain at his previous school. His friends have changed, too, and the story is told by flipping each of them over in turn, revealing their creepy or painful underbellies. No one is exempt, not even Asami or the senile grandmother that everyone visits at the senior center. \\n\\n\r\nCall it the Agatha Christie syndrome. But ever since the judge in And Then There Were None turned things upside down on fateful stormy Indian Island, writers have tried to capture that legendary element of psychological suspense by this flipping hat-trick. Oh, you think you know Asami? Flip! Nanaka of the stern visage, complete with a black crow cawing and shedding black feathers over her head? Flip! \\n\\n\r\nThe payoff should be a thrilling and fascinated shiver at the strangeness of it all. When Sana opens the mailbox and finds those letters within, filled with silent screams for help (knowing the reason why Nanaka is an orphan), I did shiver. But the biggest flip of all is the ending, where everyone is gathered together for a moment of feel-good closure. That was\u2026fascinating. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThree obligatory remarks:\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the animation is excellent. Even when the story becomes insufferably oppressive, little Sana and Nanaka are drawn to charming effect. The red mailbox on a road just outside of town, next to green fields and dark woods; the golden sunset over the sea as the twins visit their mother\u2019s grave; the city streets that are both familiar and foreign; the cool nightscapes with the light-house flickering at the convergence of sky, mountain and sea \u2013 they are a pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, the music. Serious dialogues are accompanied by solo guitar, with single violin added during Nanaka\u2019s monologues, there\u2019s a cello with a heart-beat percussion accompaniment during the fire scene, and an awesome trumpet theme for the Animenger episode. It\u2019s well done. \\n\\n\r\nThird, the voice characterizations. What was the problem with this anime again? Right, the story. The seiyuu were excellent, too. Fujimura sensei playfully voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi steals every scene. \\n\\n\r\nGrade: C\\n",

            "content": "When someone dares to show his face in his hometown after five long years of absence, it is okay to slap the guy as hard as you can in the face. And with that, the intensity of the story is set.\r\nMyself ; Yourself follows our hero Hidaka Sana who is a teenage boy with no extraordinary skills. He actually wears fashionable clothes, has one of the sweetest male voices on the planet and is caring for all of his friends. But that\u2019s it, he\u2019s just a guy in a T-shirt who pretty much is your average student sitting in the same classroom as you are,but you never really know him that well.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime begins, we see a group of young children having tea together and celebrating an event. Or rather, trying to soften up the wounds that are about to be opened. Sana will be leaving town because of his parents and has to leave everything behind that he has grown up with, including the bonds that he has with his best friends. After this quite cheerful piece of animation, we jump five years ahead and see the same Sana returning to the same town he left. This time, he is completely alone, with no parents, with no one by his side to accompany his journey. After going through the dramatic trip of nostalgia (or just walking through the hometown), he finds a couple of pretty interesting facts after his return. We get to know that, in a way, all of his old friends will be common things he will encounter on his path that is called \u2018\u2019daily life\u2019\u2019. Some of them will be in his class and even live nearby his newly acquired house. All\u2019s well, end\u2019s well, we shall say. But if it wasn\u2019t for a very teensy-tiny little problem raised by this group of friends, this anime would be at its end in one episode.\\n\\n\r\nWe get to see a hand that victimizes Sana\u2019s face by slapping it in what may be the most intense slapping sequence in anime history. What the animators probably realized by this point (and most likely you too, reading this review) is what we have seen until now is one of the most clich\u00e9d beginnings any storyline possibly can start of with. For this anime to stand out, the animators have got to try something completely new, or do something truly amazing. The animators started to think big. They realized that this kind of story has been done over and over again. Nobody is willing to watch the same story covered with some kind of fake chocolate cake over it to attract viewers, only to realize later that the chocolate cake was tasty for the first five minutes and the rest was actually something else that\u2019s brown. No, what this studio has done is raising the bar for clich\u00e9 storylines altogether.\\n\\n\r\nWe see that the hand is the beautiful girl Yatsushiro Nanaka\u2019s hand. Of all the childhood friends Sana had (he had four of them), Nanaka is the most special one to him. Even when they were little kids and they had no idea what the word \u2018\u2019romance\u2019\u2019 even meant, Sana just took Nanaka\u2019s hand without thinking and always protected her of all peril and threats the world threw at them. But now, Nanaka just looks gloomy and has distanced herself from almost all social contacts, including the other childhood friends and the returning Sana. She doesn\u2019t even return the greeting when Sana says \u2018\u2019Good morning!\u2019\u2019 with a handsome smile. The reason why she slapped Sana in the face? He could not recognize the beauty that Nanaka has become after all those years. He even introduced himself to her assuming she was someone he didn\u2019t know. A slap for Sana, joy for us.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design. The word of choice if you had to describe the graphics Myself ; Yourself has to offer. It\u2019s safe to say that this anime has one of the best character designers working in the industry. Every one of the characters looks so natural and clean but different enough to tell that each character has some depth in it. If you can do that as an artist, you have done your job well. Moreover, the artists responsible for the environments and backgrounds deserve applause. Never was the desire so big to be able to watch this anime in High Definition and lose yourself in that incredible world the artists created.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, we were talking about how the studio of Myself ; Yourself managed to set the bar for these kinds of clich\u00e9d storylines. We have quality character designs. We have top-notch background creators. And we have compelling characters that hold story and depth in them. Ingredients for a nice skin for this anime are available but what really makes or breaks an anime is the body. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s there. The body is there and it\u2019s amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThis body can be broken down to two segments. First we have the scenario. The story of Myself ; Yourself is written in a classical way of storyline development in drama/romance stories. The first half of the series is to set the tone of the series. To explain all the things that are important, to let you meet all the characters and to get familiar with the world of the story. The second half is the traditional \u2018\u2019problems\u2019\u2019 half, or hell-half, if you will. Everything that has been explained to you will be important here. The characters will face problems and difficulties and it\u2019s up to them to solve it. You follow those characters and get involved with the dramatic story, not being able to stop until you watch the last episode. This is the route Myself ; Yourself has taken in terms of storytelling which isn\u2019t bad but nothing groundbreaking either.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is groundbreaking however, or rather wave breaking, is the music. Anime music is underrated nowadays and there is this belief that music doesn\u2019t add as much to the enjoyment as people believe. The story of Myself ; Yourself which backs you up, tears you apart, lets you cry waterfalls and shows a light of hope breaks this belief. Never has music been this much of an impact as in this series. Especially the heartbreaking scenes have been able to shed tears to people who claim to have a heart of stone. It would be a lie that the music wasn\u2019t a part of this. \\n\\n\r\nFlaws haven\u2019t been spared in this anime though. The animators forgot that in the episodes with a lot of heart shredding scenes, they let the opening just play the way it was. The opening, which on a side note is a very good song and well animated, is a cheerful one with the message of hope. It collides with the sadness displayed in the anime and takes you away of that sympathy, of that \u2018\u2019I can feel this character\u2019s pain\u2019\u2019 vibe.\\n\r\nAnother flaw that\u2019s quite larger is the differences between serious scenes and normal scenes. The serious scenes are well executed, with perfectly timed music and above average animation. Clearly directed by a professional director.\\n\r\nNormal scenes however are slow, dull, don\u2019t have much energy and are not animated well enough. It\u2019s easy to see that they did this to not go over budget and to maintain the relaxed flow Myself ; Yourself has in the beginning. Generally, this would not disturb you given the fact that you get used to it throughout a series. But the borders between serious and normal scenes are so clear in this series; it does make you wonder why the animators did not choose for a more consistent approach of animating.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, Myself ; Yourself manages to distinguish itself from all other anime with similar storylines and have its own face. It is a tale about returning to one\u2019s long lost comfortable zone, only to realize that this comfort zone turned into a field of problems one must solve. Hidaka Sana encounters these problems, realizing that he cannot just return and assume that he can just sit there and live his life. He has people caring about him, needing for help and they\u2019re desperately trying to solve their own problems. Sana understands this and is willing to reach a hand to every friend, even if it hurts himself. Physically or in his heart. \\n",

            "content": "Seriously, I wasn't expecting anything from this show, I went in and dove deep with very low expectations. To my surprise, this show ended up VERY entertaining. \r\nDo NOT be fooled by the anime opening. They do not play music, nor are they super happy all the time. This shit gets epic, so don't misjudge it.\r\nThis isn't a harem, or a slice of life, nor is a romantic comedy: This is drama: The type of drama where you will see girls cry. Heck, even the guys. What surprised me was the fact that I thought it was many of the above categories, but OH BOYwas I wrong. It took a dramatic change after the first five generic episodes. I was struck with awe as I watched this generic show slowly become a show that I strongly wanted for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main character will feel dull, but after awhile his character begins to develop and it starts to all make sense. At first, I thought I wasn't going to like him because he's kinda dumb, but you know what? He has some development later on, so I wouldn't brand him generic anymore. He's not a great protagonist though, but he does the job.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't JUST focus on the main guy character: Some of his friends have intense stories, and the outcomes were great in all cases. \\n\r\nThere is even a pedo episode of a 10 year old girl staying over the protagonist's house. I mean, come on, you watch anime, you should be used to this anyways, whether you like it or not.\\n\\n\r\nThis show kept me laughing. No, not because the humor was funny, but because the events that took place in various spots comes out of no where, out of the blue, and makes me say \"WHHHAAT???\" Most of the events were unexpected. They were not predictable, and that's what kept me watching. I laughed many times and even talked to my tv screen because I was totally not expecting something. The situations in this show gets serious, and it's awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gives hints of creepiness and eerie auras from certain characters. At some points of the show, I thought at any moment, one character would snap out of the blue. What was funny about this was that I felt like the creators of this show didn't even do it on purpose, but I definitely could feel it. I feel like if the creator wanted to, he could make this a horror title, or another version of School Days.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't great. They have those cookie cutter eyes and very generic anime features. Nothing special about it, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was so good. Seriously, their tracks made me shed a man tear or two. It made me laugh at how epicly timed they were. I loved the scenes when the music completely sweeps the moment. I would say they are almost on par with Toradora's music.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't a masterpiece. It isn't revolutionary like Clannad or Toradora, but hell; this shit was entertaining. I think this was mostly why I rated it so high. If it makes me talk to my television screen, then it's doing something right. The plot twist and the foreshadowing was done right. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if you are looking for a new anime (you already watched most anime and ran out, such as Clannad, Toradora, Angel beats, Anohana, Little Busters, etc.)  that's super entertaining in the story and drama-inducing scenarios, then this show is what you are looking for!\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this was marathon'd for reviewing. I don't usually review shows that I watched once weekly: It has to be done in ONE go, and fresh in my mind. \\n\r\nI give this show a 8.5 yandere grandmas out of 10, but since animelist doesn't do .5's, then I'm going ahead and just giving it a 9/10 to get it more attention.\\n\\n\r\nCheck out my other reviews If you enjoyed reading my IMOs.",

            "content": "Since the producers of Myself;Yourself know that the established reception of the source game will carry their product for the season, no real care is taken into the other factors that make up a well-composed anime. Even Kyoto Animation sunk money into animation and revamped scores with their Key adaptations, though bringing those up as superior works of art is a bad sign right off the bat. Regardless, if the producers of the show don\u2019t care how they handle their own show, how do they expect us to receive it?\r\nThe main drive of the anime centers around a protagonist teenage boy who returns to achildhood town and faces difficulties accepting certain changes, particularly the distancing of an old friend now love interest. Said protagonist is written to take the place of the playable character from the visual novel, creating an immediate dull focal point in the narrative that can\u2019t even be saved by a last minute attempt at a tragic past. Those in the supporting cast who aren\u2019t cheap tools to pad the show out with pointless and trite sidestories are given mediocre arcs that only deliver so much emotional content. The script\u2019s tendency to flip flop between tame stories of nostalgia and lazy portrayals of familial abuse and sibling love does not help these remaining arcs. The resulting narrative is a jumble of short stories that demonstrate weak breadth and recycled drama.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that quick disappointment, the weakest link in Myself;Yourself is Dogakobo\u2019s animation. Devoid of any sort of passion, this is easily one of the company\u2019s blandest animation jobs, and that\u2019s a heavy statement considering their repertoire. The considerable lack of care in the art begs the question of why we\u2019re even wasting our time watching it. Anime with great stories and cheap animation usually showcase a certain passion to tell said story through artistry that shines through in the final piece. M;Y doesn\u2019t come with that, instead skimping everywhere it can with flat character designs, vapid expression, choppy movement, and facile atmosphere. In anime especially, art design is just as important in showing the emotion in a show\u2019s writing. So, when an entire art department renders the script as cheap as it possibly can, huge opportunities for engaging the audience are lost. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Myself;Yourself is relatively easy to take in for a casual viewer. The emotional barebones of the preexisting story, while banal and poorly handled in places, are told straightforwardly enough to be effective at times. Although the boring protagonists going through their share of romance cliches, the growth between them is paced reasonably and remains the subject of focus in the surrounding narrative noise, even concluding decently. But the simple truth is that nostalgia based narratives in other original anime hit home way harder than a weak adaptation of a weak visual novel ever could, and that\u2019s exactly the case here.\\n\\n\r\nMyself;Yourself:\\n\r\n3/10",

            "content": "Yeah, another great romance anime. Wohhoo!: Oh crap their missing the romance seen again\r\nStory:9/10\r\nMyself Yourself has one of the best stories i have ever seen in an anime and i was impressed at how it caught my attention through out the episodes. They had a hard boiled plot that added an theme of mystery and child hood trauma. I would always feel for each character anytime they would go through a problem and that was one of the key things that got me hooked to this anime. I did read some reviews that pointed this anime out as one of average but i highly disagree.This anime portrays a unique style of Show don't tell and it would constantly cause me to ask questions. The simple fact that I asked questions at proves that it was not average. An average anime would be predictable and easily compared. What i disliked about the story however were some of the themes. The drama was done perfectly but when it came to romance it was lacking in a few areas. I will discuss the characters part in it later but the overall view of romance in the anime was a bit dull and boring. There were times were you could see the connection but i never really saw any development of the romance theme. Another thing that hinted this out was the kiss scene which was not there. A key factor of development in an anime is the kiss and if you don't have a kiss then you kind of just shat in the face of romance anime lovers. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nArt in this anime was done fabulously. I won't go as far as to say that the art made me want to cry, but it does have some great views at times. Their were scenes that would be beautiful and i loved it but it was nothing i haven't seen before.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/8 Subbed\\n\r\nThe sound track in this anime was done alright to the point that it added to the atmosphere of the anime but it still lacked in a few areas. The sound track wasn't anything superb but the voice actors did a great job in portraying feelings to each character. I also would give Ami, the voice actor of Nanaka an award because she did a great job in portraying pain to her character. Trust me, these kinds of people make the subbed better than the dubbed anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe character development was done great in this anime. They developed on the main characters in a way that it actually made sense, unlike some anime that try to drop back stories and expect points for character development{Lamune}. Although they had great development, their were still some areas that were lacking again. Earlier I mentioned that the romance in this anime was done poorly and the characters were a big problem here. Two main love connection in this anime were invisible to my eye until they did an impact scene. I saw how their friendship grew but i didn't really sew any love between any characters. This hurt the anime a bit because at the end the show the how the characters ended up together but we didn't really get romance so it came off a bit forced. another thing I found disturbing was the lack of development with the character of Aoi. She was listed as a main but we never really got to know how important she was in the group. She was just there to be there that also made the understanding of the characters to be difficult. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i loved this anime and it is certainly a must watch for drama anime lovers. Although I wouldn't really call this anime romance i would recommend it to romance anime lovers as well. \\n",

            "content": "This is my very first review, so bare with me. :)\r\nWhen I saw the cover of Myself; Yourself, I thought it looked like it would be a very cute anime with a lot of romance and good artwork. But it ended up being a lot more than that. It dealt with a lot of life issues, and although some of them seemed a little far-fetched, the way the characters interacted and helped eachother through the trials was very uplifting. But I do think it was a little too dramatic at times, like a japanese soap-opera.\r\nStory: The first couple episodes had a cute story but Ifelt as though there wasn't much substance to the story. Sure, it made me laugh a lot but there just wasn't much in the area of a real plot. Towards the end I even felt, &quot;How are they going to possibly end this anime with a good ending?&quot; But the last episode really tied the entire series together very nicely. There were a couple cute twists and the relationships between all of the characters was very well thought-out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As I said, the cover is what attracted me to this anime from the start. I really loved all of the artwork and the way the characters were drawn. (except I hated how all the blood appears... black?) The backgrounds and settings are drawn beautifully and the colors are wonderful, especially the sakura trees and the sunrises.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP was very cute but it did start to get annoying by the end. I personally loved the ED and it's one of the few ending themes that I actually listened to after every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main characters were all designed very nicely and drawn nicely. Personally, the big boobs... is just so unrealistic but I know they do that a lot in these shows. I hate to say it, but most of the voices of the girl characters were very annoying. Especially Aoi. But the way the characters interacted throughout the series was incredible!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have to say that I did laugh a lot while watching this anime, and at one point I actually almost began to cry. There were some very cute scenes, romantic scenes, and depressing scenes. This anime has the ability to cause all of your emotions to react in the same episode, which I thought was one of the things that made it so terrific!\\n\\n\r\nI personally really do recommend this anime to everyone! :)",

            "content": "This anime is my all time favorite romance anime at this time and probably will still be my favorite for a long time. The overall package that Myself; Yourself has to offer is what makes this anime great. After watching the series through TWICE, I'm ready to evaluate it thoroughly.\r\nStory.\r\n*slight spoilers about the plot*\r\nMyself; Yourself starts off with a boy named Sana who decides to return to his home town from when he a young child in middle school. The story is heartwarming and sweet yet as the series progresses it turns very serious. I like this story because unlike other romance/harem animes, there aren'ttons of girls in love with the same guy who is indifferent about all of them. Instead, the story focuses mainly on friendship and family problems. I think this anime portrays what it feels like to have a real high school group of friends and at the same time it mixes it up well with family problems, trust issues, and more. The story is original and I think that makes it very unique. Also, there are a lot of little hints and foreshadowing. The way the story spins a web that eventually connects all the characters and their lives together is unparalleled. \\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\\n\r\nI never have a lot to say about the art in reviews for anime but for some reason this anime has an amazing feel about it. The character designs are great. The scenery is beautiful, especially at dawn. The colors they use really bring out certain things you wouldn't really notice and after watching this anime in 720p all I gotta say is it pays to watch this anime in HD. Beautiful. However, I've seen prettier art in anime. I really enjoyed Clannad's art style for example. While this anime's animation isn't perfect, it is top tier and I'll give it a 9. (9.5 If I could).\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nAhh.. here we go. Easily the second best part of the anime. The opening and ending themes are pretty catchy Japanese pop songs. I even have them on my iPod I liked them so much. But the opening/ending themes really aren't the true magic here. The music made the sad scenes much more intense. At the same time the music made a cheerful, happy scene with all the friends together just that much more enjoyable. It cut out at the right times, and came back in noticeably. The second time watching through, I payed heavy attention to the music/sound effects and it deserves a 10 if not more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters have a certain charismatic nature to them. I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed every single character's personality and voice acting for that matter (Aoi-chan can get annoying though!). The characters are also very believable which I think is very important to a slice of life anime. I already mentioned they were well drawn too. Since characters are intertwined emotionally and got separated while young then reunited later in life, character development plays a HUGE role in making the anime great. Definitely a 10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n10. You'll enjoy it if you like romance anime's with drama. All that needs to be said.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\\n\r\n10. This anime did everything it needed to do right. A few things could have been changed for the better but either way it's a great watch and still my second favorite anime after seeing over 100+ series\\n",

Not to mention almost every side characters were annoying af (principal,vice principal, the twins parents, etc) and they lack any common sense, which made the drama feels very unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nI strongly advise you to STAY AWAY FROM THIS ANIME, you'll thank me later.",

The story gets 'dark' but the two things which are dark, are not really dark and they are only there for the impact on the story. What I mean is they did not feel like part of the story. If you have seen the anime there is one 'dark' moment when something bad happens to a character, she was stabbed, but it is there for a plot twist none of us expected with no goddamn signs or clues. Also what happens tothe person who stabbed her, we do not know. And the last two episodes are just so forced and rushed. I really goddamn wanted to take a knife and plunge deep into my heart. I watched this anime for the sole reason of its 'darkness' as I just searched up on youtube \"never a good place to find anime\" dark romance anime and I found this. Warning  you if you wanted this anime solely for its darkness, it has none. And they start to exxagarate plot  lines so much. The first half had a decently made story. Fun characters, ok drama and my waifu, Aoi-chan. If u wanna be my friend, pls request because I am pretty interested in other people's opinion. And yes, I am too lazy or too unwilling to write about the good part because I feel it is nothing special, just  like every harem anime but without the harem.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread of the same subject)\r\nDrama, romance, and semicolons. The three combine to provide us with an anime that has the interesting title of \"Myself;Yourself\". Sadly, many of the elements that made up the show either fell flat or were executed poorly.\r\nSTORY\r\nMyself;Yourself centers around Sana, a boy who leaves for another town and after five years returns to the same town he grew up in, hanging out with his old friends once again, except Nanaka has become very anti-social and ill-mannered for some mysterious reason.\r\nMuch of the drama consisted of each character having quite personal problems, each too avarying degree of difficulty. One of the biggest problems with the show was the way in which it presented the drama in itself. For almost every \"arc\", the drama was usually quickly explained and solved within one or two episodes. Meaning, the drama itself is never really present for the viewer. Besides the ending, much of what occurred during the show did not have good \"flow\". In this case, \"flow\" mainly deals with the way the show handled the transitioning between everyone's problems.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the way it ended leaves many unanswered questions for the viewer. I wish they would have addressed some of the minor nuances with the characters, but I guess they just did not have the time.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the drama, I actually would not place this show in the romance category. The romance was almost non-existent, with only small hints presented at various moments to at least let the audience know how the characters were feeling toward one another. Besides the occasional blushing and consoling, I never felt as if there were romantic sparks being flown around as in other romance shows.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWithout being too harsh, I would say the show looks appropriate for the time it was released. The designs of the characters were average at best. Much of the way everything looked reminded heavily of Fate/Stay Night from the year prior. The best animation for the whole show was actually found in the OP, where the cast is dancing/playing instruments, and was actually nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the characters, the whole show has this dull appearance to it, making it somewhat unpleasing to look at. This was perhaps done to add to the dramatic atmosphere for what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nI also noticed that at some points, the show would employ the same scenes, and there were a few too many awkward close-ups for my liking. But besides these points, everything was pretty mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the characters are also nothing to phone home about. Sana is kind and gentle; Nanaka is brooding and defensive; Shuri is energetic and fun; Shu is protective and nice; Aoi is happy and friendly. Besides their overall personality, they never really see much growth out of the characters. And when the show provides them with a chance to let them grow, it, like I stated in the story section, moves on to the next plot point without ever really giving satisfactory character development.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to point out that Aoi probably has one of the most annoying voices for a character that I ever had to hear in a show. I'm not saying that the voice actress did a terrible job, but Aoi's voice was very much not to my liking and made it so that every time she was on screen, I really just wanted her off.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to be fair, I would give the most character growth to Sana. However, much of what he learns to go through is left unexplained until much later in the show. It would have been nice if the characters were able to be given more time to go through their troubles and us seeing what happens afterwards, but because the show refused to do this, it makes it extremely hard to feel bad or care about any of them at any point.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was okay at best; same for the ED. However, the soundtrack for the actual show was pretty bad. For almost every scene, the music track for that particular moment would almost always cut off at weird times. Plus, the music itself never really seemed to be gripping or harrowing for the dramatic moments it was trying to present.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice-acting, the whole cast did an average job. Besides Aoi, they were all pretty forgettable performances.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI like drama and I love romance. Since the drama was done so poorly and the romance elements were not present, I didn't have too much enjoyment from the show.\\n\\n\r\nI think if you are going in to this show with the mindset that the show will be average at best, then I think that person would be fine with what was presented. However, if you are expecting heavy drama and actual romantic relationships to develop, then you would be just as disappointed as I am now.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, drama poorly executed, no romance, rushed ending\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, fitting for the time, nothing over-the-top\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, typical cast of characters, no growth or development\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, OP and ED win no awards, and the soundtrack is quickly forgotten\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, there were some touching parts but for the most part the show was just there for me to finish\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "\u2018Myself; Yourself\u2019 is a slice of life romantic drama that centres around a group of friends. Hidaka Sana had moved to Tokyo as a kid, leaving behind his pals and the hometown where he grew up. Five years later, he chooses to return to his hometown. Upon his arrival he notices that the places and things he was familiar with have changed but not to the extent he expected them to, and he feels nostalgic. He is soon united with his childhood buddies\u2014the enthusiastic albeit clumsy Aoi-chan, the quarrelling Wakatsuki twins and Yatsushiro Nanaka from whom he expected anything but a slap on the face!Hidaka is disheartened when he realizes that Nanaka is no more the cheerful girl she used to be as a kid. She has turned distant, cold and gloomy. \\n\\n\r\n M;Y is one of those anime that I picked on an absolute whim and then felt glad that I did. For a short series with thirteen episodes, it was a fairly entertaining watch, and if not the best, it is certainly a good romantic drama with a speck of comedy and fan-service that stays within its limit. \\n\\n\r\nAfter stealing a glance at M;Y, many would think it is a typical harem with an average high school student for a male protagonist orbited by infatuated girls. If you\u2019re one of them with the harem radar up, uproot that radar NOW! It offers a story of friendship, perseverance, dilemma and relationships, and it gives away all that quite realistically on the screen which is what makes M;Y something more than just an average romantic drama. Though the main plot is nothing unique or revolutionary, the sub-plots and the interactions between the characters are a plus point of this anime. The initial episodes are all about taking trips to the riverside, partying, eating, fooling around and making new friends, and all that are quite fun to watch. As the story progresses, gradually the anime begins to develop on the dramatic side though occasional humour still prevails here and there. \\n\r\nThe ending lacked depth though. I expected so much to happen in the end but nothing happened. It was kind of abrupt and rushed, and hence not satisfactory overall. A sudden transition to the adulthood of the characters was probably not a good idea in the first place I guess but still, they pulled it off somehow. I can elaborate more but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be giving away spoilers so let\u2019s bring this to a close, ne? \\n\\n\r\nAs of the characters, they are quite amusing. Each one has an interesting personality. I fell in love with all of them, especially the Wakatsuki twins\u2014 Suusuke and Shuri. It was really fun seeing this brother-sister duo. However, the character that I liked the least was Hoshino Asami. For some reason, I didn\u2019t like her from the very beginning, and I could not relate to her like I did to the other characters. Aoi-chan was one character that I looked forward to because of her amalgamated nature of enthusiasm and clumsiness. After I was done with the anime, I realized that every character had their own story but Aoi-chan had none so I wish she had one too. \\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing much to say about the art and the animation except that they are done quite well. \\n\r\nThe OST is good. The OP \u2018Tears Infection\u2019 by Kaori and the ED \u2018Kimi to Yozora to Sakamichi to\u2019 by Itou Kanako are catchy, and so are the background tracks. I fell in love with Nanaka\u2019s theme the moment it played for the first time. \\n\\n\r\nSo, will I recommend \u2018Myself; Yourself\u2019? Yes, I will. If you\u2019re a fan of the romance genre, this anime is for you. This somewhat underrated series deserves to be discovered and watched! \\n",

            "content": "Okay before you read this review,fanboys/girls, if you actually enjoyed this anime steer clear from this review because i found this anime to be quite horrid.\r\nAs i went to see the reviews for this anime I've seen too many high rated reviews so this is just my side of things and how i perceived/enjoyed this anime.\r\nStory: 2\r\nThe story is something not really new (after have seeing Kanon before i mean its really similar on how everything is set up, childhood spent in this \"said\" city and comes back after some time and blah blah blah), but the way everything was set up was just notsmart in my opinion. There are these fillers in this anime that make me wanna punch someone in the face due to the \"dullness\" of them (later explained in Sound+Character), and the fact that its only 13 episodes and they are adding fillers while there are still so many questions left unanswered and aren't clear why the hell are they even in this anime?!? \\n\\n\r\nAlso the story how everything goes, it just didn't seem to flow good. The story seemed to be random and sporadic, having these random events of drama, that didn't get set-up/built-up properly, resulting in an overall bad storyline. It felt very random because nothing seemed to be foreshadowed and there is a huge severity of lack of background information on these characters. The past 5 years what in the fuck happened? You'd think they try to better explain things, but instead they give you this other event of drama, which did not transition well, without explaining that well either. \\n\\n\r\nHaving only 13 episodes, and while trying to fit everything that was in the LNs, everything was rushhhheeedddd. As i said before all the arcs in this anime weren't set up properly with each arc about 2-4 episodes long, and within this time period they try to achieve this large amount of drama and sympathy for each character you barely know shit about and their extreme circumstances. Honestly it could've been WAY better. In the end of each arc i was just sitting there thinking to myself;yourself \"what...why...srs?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story had amazing potential, but with the fillers and just these seemingly random events (supposed to be flowed some fucking way), it just collapsed on myself;yourself i mean itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nOnly positive point in this anime in my opinion. Its very pretty and standard. Animation was fluid and what you'd expect from an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 1\\n\r\nThere was nothing wrong with the OP or the EN for this anime but holy fucking hell the fucking voice acting was so bad! I watched the subbed version and i swear to God each anime character's voice acting sounded like they were half-dead, bored, and DULL. Which is really bad considering the point where this anime is supposed to be really serious so i was expecting some emotion in the cast's voices, BUT NOPE just mono-tonic which led to the supposed drama undramatic. They try to achieve comedy in this anime but failed horribly each time, because it was just so mono-toned to me. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime didn't suit the haphazard circumstances. The background music often came up suddenly in these \"suspenseful\" and \"sad\" scenes, which werent suspenseful or sad to me because of the bad build-up and portrayal of these events. Which made the background music just seem out of place and just BAD.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\n*sigh* i dont even know where to begin. There are your archetyped characters, like you look at them and you know what to expect from them. I usually like these archetype characters (as a fan of some harems), but i felt they weren't portrayed as they should have.\\n\\n\r\nNO BACKGROUND INFORMATION LIKE PLZ. I felt i needed some background info to have feel these emotions of sympathy and sadness for these \"dramatic\" events. The lack of build-up and info on these characters resulted in the overall badness of this anime. Its like throwing a spoon in your lap and someone forcing you to feel sad for it... its just wtf.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of character development contributed to the rushed story and just seemingly random circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nUGHHH, like whyy. I was just waiting for this anime to be over every episode. I had to force myself;yourself to friggen finish this shit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1.5\\n\r\nJust \"/slit wrists\" and kill me now. Could've been A LOT better if it were a 26 ep anime but it wasnt. I would not recommend this anime to anyone, but if you can deal with random events with forceful drama you will like this anime...",

            "content": "Myself Yourself is a slice of life, drama, and romance anime. The first episode caught my attention because the cute little story of their childhood was touching. As I went on with the first 5 episodes, it seemed like a very typical slice of life anime that certain types of people might enjoy. But for me, it was very boring at times and the pace was too slow. The one thing that kept me going was the desire to learn more about their pasts.\r\nThe second half of the anime series was over-dramatized, which made me realize that they put in a few useless characters whenreally the story should have been focused more on the main characters since it is a slice of life and the airtime is short. The ending was unsatisfying because it was like they were spilling out all the information at the very end.\\n\\n\r\nI think the greatest flaw in this anime was the characterization. It was horrible. Nanaka was very hard to figure out. She was quiet, girly, innocent, violent, all at once. It was very hard to follow her actions during the first few episodes, and we don't find out why until around the second last episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was appealing I will admit. Thats probably another aspect that lead me to actually finish the series. Music - the OP+ED are pretty good.. bgm is ok.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy drama anime and don't mind watching half the episodes without the actual drama, then you MIGHT like Myself Yourself. If you are looking for a nice romance anime, I do not recommend watching this. The character development is really off and it ruins enjoyment.",

            "content": "I first really started paying attention to Myself:Yourself when I heard that Takumi Nakazawa, the scenario writer for the infinity series and Mutsumi Sasaki (original character designs ie memories off, futakoi) were part of this.  Ami Koshimizu playing the lead female role cemented this on my watch list.  It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that Myself:Yourself has 2 male leads, unlike most visual novels.  Yes, two male protagonist, not one male lead and token/comedic male friend, but 2 complete male lead.  This enables the show to follow multiple stories at once, ala Kimikiss anime version.  However, I would soon learn thatMyself;Yourself would not reach the same levels as Kimikiss.\\n\\n\r\nMyself:Youself (M:Y) started off quite peacefully, setting up various conflicts and questions.  It builds up quite well and provides many subtle clue that the astute viewer may find.  This makes for a good amount of speculation and discussion.  In addition, we find out the character relationships and follow Sana as he recreates new relationships.  From the way the last sentence sounds, let me just say M:Y is not a harem.  Only one or 2 girls, at best, are in love with Sana and the same can be said with Syusuke (the other male lead).  M;Y can be seen more as an ensemble similar to Boys Be.. or Kimikiss.  However, the series really starts to lose it focus after a few episodes.  There are several threads that pop up and disappear and jumping from one thread to another.  To put it bluntly, it became a mess&hellip;\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation/art it started off pretty well, but that soon goes down hill.  Several episodes in there were some proportion problems and later in the series some scenes made Syusuke&rsquo;s face look really messed up.  In general, there was quite a bit of consistency problems.  It seemed as if they blew they budget on the first few episodes and the OP.  However, it was quite an amazing OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is one of my favorites and the ending did grow on me.  However, for the ost, it seemed as if it was too in your face for several key scenes.  This resulted in overdoing those dramatic moments.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite all this criticism I still watched weekly and asked my roommate &ldquo;why are we still watching this?&rdquo;  I guess M;Y is are one of those titles that are pretty good and fun to watch in the moment but breakdown under scrutiny.  There were some memorable moments, like how we learn what Syusuke really said to Sana when he first moved.  In the end though it seems as M;Y is one really big commercial for the game.  Oddly enough the game was released a few days before the anime ended.  In that respects it really succeeded as I really want to play the game now.    \\n",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a harem anime. \r\nIt's reality, cloaked beneath the faces of smiling teens. If you're a person who's easily drawn into a story then you will find yourself hurting as you're taken through the story of Myself;Yourself. You're introduced to a cast of what seems like typical anime characters only to find out that these \"typical anime characters\" are very much alive. They represent a side of anime we rarely see but know exists.\r\nStory\r\nThe story had some flaws which were carried out by who characters suffered from \"unreasonable thought process\" syndrome. You know it's the sortof thing that makes you think \"no sensible human being would think like that\". Given the seriousness of the story, one would believe that these interactions would have been dispensed with, but they are present nonetheless. They don't detract from the story though and this is only a minor issue.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was solid. I don't give this a higher score because it's not my preferred art style, but I will not complain as I did enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nIn general, I don't like anime music. Most of it is a bit too high pitched and unnecessarily cutesy. Myself ; Yourself wasn't any different. I didn't sit through any of the openings or endings either. However, I will give props to the voice actors. With the exception of Aoi(whose voice was unnaturally child-like), they were all amazing. The violin music was also pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThis is what interested me the most. The characters. There is so much depth to just about all of them. You'll be amazed at who these people really are and what they're going through. There is just so much life to them and I felt the pain of each one as their secrets were slowly wrenched from their control.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nAll of this together makes for a great anime. However, one must understand that this is not a \"feel-good\" anime. Don't watch it if you're expecting to feel warm and fuzzy at the end.",

Only when I had watched everything else on my hard drive I resorted back to the Myself; Yourself...  What a difference one episode makes!  On the 5th episode the story totally turns around.  I downloaded and watched the rest of the series in less that 24 hours!  I'm glad I went back.  What started out dry and boring ended up being an awesome story.  I'm generallynot a &quot;slice of life&quot; type of anime watcher but this one was worth the time.  Give it a go!  It's a great &quot;one timer&quot; and you won't be disappointed.",

The first half of the series had me quite bored to be completely honest because it was a pretty  typical romance with very typical characters. The show goes from a 6 to a 9 for me about halfway through the series and the story becomes almost captivating. Watching the final episode I could barely breath through one particular set of scenes. \r\nWhat I am saying is, if you want a light romance anime with some darker subplots that is pretty short, itsa very good series to fulfill that. \\n\\n\r\nPlease note I only rated the story an 8 because the first half didn't have much driving force to it.",

            "content": "Well basically Myself; Yourself is about a boy name Sana who returns to his hometown after 5 years. At first everything seems the same, but then he notices that in the 5 years absence a lot of things has changed.\r\nStory: Many at first would see that this anime is probably like the many generic harem type of scenarios, but after watching it you find out that it is actually kind of different. Sana goes back to his hometown and meets all of his childhood friends. He learns that everyone has their own problems, and that even though all of them did not want to change,things do change over time. There is not a complex plot, so if you don't like the romance-school type of scenarios, I would not recommend you to watch. There are times where things are funny and sad as in most animes. Well this series isn't a really serious anime, so the episodes are really carefree and drift by at a nice pace, not too slow or not too fast. However, there are some episodes that just makes you want to watch the next to find out what happened in the past. So that keeps it quite interesting. Well I did felt that the last few episodes might have been a rush, because things just starts to go faster, but the way the things build up to it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well the scenes are quite beautiful, and the characters look pretty nice. There isn't any of those ecchi scenes, even though some might consider this is a harem, but I just think it is more toward romance than harem. Though there are those \"accidents\" scenes like falling on top of a girl kind of scenario. But overall the artwork was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is pretty good. The opening theme was nice, and the closing theme was pretty good. Also the characters sounds pretty good and fit their personality. Though Aoi's voice can be both cute and annoying sometime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The  characters are not really that unique, but it is well done in the sense that they were all childhood friends. I really thought at the beginning of the series that; since they are all childhood friends, like most of them well develop feelings for the main character and turn into another of those harem type of anime, but I was glad to find out that was not the case. The character development between each characters is pretty well balance, going around to exam each members of the group of friends. Finding out each other's problem and trying to solve it was kind of nice in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was a pretty interesting anime in my opinion. Some parts was kind of weird, but overall it was pretty good. Most of the plot is pretty realistic, though some were probably really exaggerated, but I can imagine a group of friends getting together again after a long time not seeing each other and doing some of the things they did. What I really liked the most about this series is how they portrayed the idea that: no matter how much we don't want to change or see others change, it inevitably happens as time pass, and we cannot change that but try to accept it and live or find an alternative. The anime is pretty short and sweet, so I suggest you give it a go and hopefully enjoy it too.",

            "content": "When I was looking for a short anime Myself ; Yourself came up immediatly as my first choice. I don't regret it, it was entertaining and well done, this drama/romance/school series even surpased my expectatives by far.\r\nThe story is almost completely based on memories and how they can change a person's personality. A 6-7 year old boy once lived happily in a city when he had lots of friends. For some reason he has to leave town w and goes to another city, leaving his friends behind. 10 years later he comes back to the city he once happily lived and encounters his friends. Someof them remain the same, some of them have drastically changed. The, now adolescent, guy tries to figure the reason behind these drastic changes, specifically Nanaka's (one of his friends and the girl he likes) personality have changed for the worst. He tries to find out why, but on the way he realizes that he himself have changed the most.\\n\\n\r\nAlthought the story seems all happy and lively it won't be always like that. These memories unfold sad and chaotic events that will begin to unfold on the second half of the anime. Also the last couple of episodes feel a bit rushed, this is because almost all the important story development is left to the last episodes. The anime would have been beter as a 24-26 episode series, but still the story is good, not spectacular, just plain good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters look pretty nice. The art focuses on everything, from females to males. The locations and spaces in which the plot interactuates are really good to watch at. You can see erey single thing pretty well detailed and feel that a considerable amount of effort was putted forth to deliver a good material. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitley the strongest aspect the anime has to offer, ther music is jut remarkable. From the Opening, through the in-scene BMGs and on to the Ending the anime manages to create a unbelivable listening experience. Also note that the DVD version includes an special music video clip, featuring the Opening song, \"Tear Infection\" by Kaoru. This bonus material has a lot of extras and is really a must watch if you liked the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMemories and personalities, this are the defining atributes for most of the characters. Some characters like Aoi are defined by atributes (large breasts) but she's almost the only one. Mostly the characters are well drawn and animated but are not that beautiful so the personality aspect bacomes crucial. The personality is very realated to the memories that each characters is keeping, so these are the main things to look at when watching this anime and focusing on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI really had a good time watching this anime. The episodes were light and easy to diggest. I felt a bit of a rush at the end when trying to conclude the series, but even so Myself ; Yourself is great fun + great content which is definitely worth the time.",

            "content": "This anime touched me so deeply due to some unfortunate occurrences in my past, and brought back a lot of emotions for me. This anime joins the few that have touched me enough to bawl for what seems like hours. With that aside, let the review commence!\r\nStory: The story revolves around a boy named Hidaka Sana, who moves away to Tokyo, leaving his friends. However, he returns after 5 years. When he returns, the feel of his old village still remains much the same, and his friends too, except of one. What sets this anime apart is the twists that occur in it, which arequite somber, and heavy on the heart. However, the anime still manages to stay very heartwarming and cheerful with it's comedy and ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style has a very \"been there, done that\" feeling. It's not bad in any regards, and fits the anime's funny and heartwarming, yet serious tone. It does not stand out too much, but still has an appealing look. The best way to describe the art style would be \"if it's not broke, don't fix it!\"\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for this anime is amazing, and fits the anime perfectly! There isn't much else I can say but amazing, from the opening theme, Tears Infection, to the violin played by Hoshino.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are kind of hard for me to describe, besides the fact that they all play an important role in story progression and development. None of the characters would be the same if a single one of them was missing from the equation. It's this perfect harmony/disharmony that makes the characters stand out as one of the finer qualities of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Obviously, I rather enjoyed this anime, for both personal reasons and just as an anime enthusiast. The anime was very cleansing for me, and pulled at my heart. Overall an amazing anime for me, and a must watch in my eyes. However, not everyone's taste is the same, and there is no such thing as a completely unbiased review. But for anyone who has ever been in a dark place in life due to some unfortunate turn of events, this is a must watch.",

Personally, I think that the story does not develop at all, it's just based around the main character, sure it's the main character, but it just went ON and ON about the fact that he left his town and came out. \r\nAlso, the relationship between Piano Girl and the MC was boring, how she became a total tsundere, and it was something i'd seen before. I'm not allowed to write spoilers, so I can't really go into much depth about how this is ranked at the bottom of my lists of anime, but if you like boring, slow-paced animes,with a boring relationship development, then this ____ is for you!",

            "content": "If your going through the romance genre looking for fast paced romances with lots of kissing and horndogs, then you might be a little disappointed with myself; yourself. Atleast, at the beginning that is. I don't mean anything like, \"Once it gets rolling, it get's rolling.\" This is no school days. The characters don't turn from \"I'm fine with just watching her\" to, \"I've got to have sex\" throughout the series. However, I do love School days, and I also love Myself; Yourself. For most of you romance lovers; whether it's softcore romance with no kissing at all, or even hentai, this anime will notdisappoint.\\n\\n\r\nStory:9- I went into Myself; Yourself and by about the 5th episode, I honestly stopped watching it. As far as I could see, it was a stereotypical high school romance anime, and it didn't even have any sex!... However, I can honestly say now that I'm dissapointed that I didn't stick with it. I recently picked it up again and finished it in the same day. That's how interesting it gets, and it's all because of the character developement, which I'll explain later.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10- I'm very aware of the art in animes. There are very few cases in animes where I don't like art and like the anime. The only reason I decided to continue this anime was because the art was just incredible. I mean, the characters are perfect, and I didn't see any repetitive shots. But what stood out the most in Myself; Yourself was the background art. And what even stood out in that was the sky shots. If you've already watched it, go back and review, and you'll see what I mean. ;)\\n\\n\r\nSound:8- As you might have noticed, or not, depending on whether you've watched this anime or not, there is no opening or ending song. I really feel like they could have done more and gave it a lot more emotion using a sad song in the ending. I remember I felt like I was going to cry at the end of a few episodes, and then all of a sudden they start explaining the next episode. It's like masturbating and then having your grandma walk in. Total turn-off, right?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10- As I was talking about earlier, the story probably would have fallen to an 8, had it not been for the amazing character development. Just to elaborate on how amazing the characters where, if they were seperated into 5 different animes, all 5 of my favorite anime characters would be from Myself; Yourself. But, unfortunately, they're not, so I can't choose. All the characters make you feel like you can sympathize with them, whether you're anything like them or not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9- I really enjoyed Myself; Yourself. Although it wasn't a twist ending, I left with the same feeling I got in my heart after watching Death Note and Code Geass. It would have definitely became a 10 had the episodes 2-5 not been so stereotypical. The ending was almost legendary. \\n\\n\r\nOvarall:9- I think a lot of people will really enjoy this anime, since it has a lot of variety and aspect for admiration. Whether your a romance lover, a drama/psychological lover, or even both or more, give Myself; Yourself a try.\\n",

            "content": "Alright, image you have this prized animal. You take care of this animal constantly. Now imagine that for some reason these kids keep tennis balls at your prized anime every day. Now imagine that a giant airplane fell directly out of the sky and, onto your animal, but inside that plane is carring fireworks so as it crashes, they all go off and its a pretty display of colors and awesomeness. I feel like thats exactly what Myself; Yourself did to my feelings with its hints and its conclusions. Myself; Yourself is quite the amazing anime, using a lot of different ways to draw, hold,and entertain its audince with suspence, mystery, and a shade of romance.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I need to start with the lowest score first on this one. The sound was nothing close to what the rest of the anime was. I could NOT stand some of the voice acting; Voice actors are suppose to draw out the emotions of the characters in their situations and utilize their emotions to make a perfect symphony of character voices that stand out above all else, but I feel only the main character was able to (SOMETIMES) pull that off. To top it off, I feel some of the voices for the characters didn't even belong to them sometimes and couldn't properly tell the voices apart. The intro song was pretty alright but I feel the video they used for it saved it a lot but also was a double edged sword since it didn't exactly match with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know this was a 2007 anime and most animes that came out at that time had this issue but I couldn't get behind the body perportions on the characters. Weither it be the eyes, the hair, the bust, the waist, andything, I just couldn't get behind it as none of them ever seemed to be properly perportioned to the character. Normally when the art stands out to me, its because it has a beautiful color pallete; Myself ; Yourself did not, and I'm very happy for that as the bright and bleek colors made the anime feel more realistic than it would've with an intenst arrary of sparkly colors. Every background character also had a lot of work done on them so it went even farther into a realist setting.\\n\\n\r\nWhen beginning Myself; Yourself, theres an immedite happy, romancy vibe between all the characters that feels all tingly, and that continues for quite awhile. Each character had their background detailed and thought-out, allowing each character to hit home with its viewer. Normally you get lots of over complicated -dereing with the main characters, but I think Myself; Yourself did very well workign its way around those arcetypes very smoothly, as it slowly removed the -dere from their personailies and slipped in some psyhco and trauma to influence the way each character lived and intereacted with eachother. \\n\\n\r\nNow heres where it gets good, the plot was actually plot! No fanservice plot! Directly from the start of the anime it had a very well laid out path for the MC to follow and possibly have a great ending. Slowly and slowly, little details creep into small parts of the anime in weird places and start to redirect the way the anime looks and feels, changing it into a haywire plot where almost anything can happen. I feel the director did very well in planning this and had a lot in mind for each character.\\n\\n\r\nI throughly enjoyed the way this anime played out because it sadisfyed my need for a romance, put that mystery in there to figure out, and kinda left me with some trauma over the character's trauma! The plot was very unique and held a very captivating ideal for the characters to interact with the plot. After all the conclusions were over, I think I applud the ending most because I don't think ending an anime like Myself;Yourself wouldn've been clean in anyway if the director didn't change the direction it was going, but at the same time, changing it was a big risk as the final conclusion was rather harsh and quite dark. Overall, This anime was something else. Something that I think I would  most defiently watch again with a friend or even just for another dark feels trip. I wouldn't nessicarly reccomend it for beginners but I think most people could enjoy this anime just as much as I did. Most defiently deserved a 9/10 with a highly reccomended watch!",

I highly recommend this to anyone whose looking for a good series to watch in a whole day!       ----- SPOILERS AHEAD -----\r\nStory 10/10: The story at the beginning is generic and I thought it was your typical romance story where childhood friends become lovers and boy was I wrong! What turned into a thriller in a matter of a few episodes was spectacular.. You have a crazy old woman whose on a killingspree, a girl who was scarred by a fire she had no control over, a guy who is scared of knives (I was like wtf through the entire thing until the end..) and so much more that is just down right amazing... It was a well thought story line that even shocked me to seeing how dark some of this went to but I still loved every minute of it..\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: The art is nice and is most of what attracted me towards these types of anime series.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: It all sounded fine, I'm not to bothered with how it sounds unless there is pop rock music in the middle of a depressing moment.. (there wasn't)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: I didn't expect to see them go so deep into some of these characters pasted like from abuse, in a fire, attempted suicide, incest and it shocked me for the better. I thought it was going to be your average romance story but I was wrong.. Each character was perfect down to the last piece (god i hate that male teacher) and I though some of the characters could of been changed I still thought they went the right way with them!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I watched the whole thing in one that's how I was so hooked on it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'd highly recommend this to anyone whose looking for a romance story with a twist that you wasn't expecting. Really enjoyed it and I hope you do.",

            "content": "Through the first half of the show, it stayed \"meh\" at best.  I was in the mood for a show kind of like this, so I was alright with watching it, but it was a 4/10 at best, and it stayed a subpar harem anime.  \r\nAround where the first half ended, it became almost as much of a mess as Charlotte was.  They'd introduce characters suddenly and then reveal a huge plot point about them, often making things feel really rushed and sudden.\r\nThere were also issues with characters.  One of the characters was extremely annoying (Aoi).  There was a characterwho's side of the story felt like it was given a great significance in the anime, but it really didn't add anything to what was going on.    There was another character who is the only thing that made the latter end of the first half bearable, but she ended up practically disappearing altogether, despite the anime leaving large questions unanswered about her.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did this show get a 7/10 with all these issues?  The last 3 episodes were phenomenal.  The show starts to pick up around episode 7, but as I mentioned earlier, there are great parts in there, but it's also a huge mess at first.  Despite the first half of the show being incredibly boring, there are so many ways the ending ties together various things that happened.  The end is done incredibly.\\n\\n\r\nAt the moment, episode 11 is probably one of my favorite anime episodes ever.  It is incredibly emotional, and it feels so fitting with everything that has happened.  That alone is a worthwhile reason to watch.\\n\\n\r\nDo I Recommend It?\\n\r\nIf you're able to sit through 6 episodes of the most generic romance triangle ever, I would totally recommend it.  The last 3 episodes were amazing, and they really brought the show together.  While that does not justify the first half of the show being bland, I'm very happy I persevered and got to experience end.",

            "content": "Just to let you know this isn't my first review ;D\r\nI was looking for a great anime to end my summer with and was having no luck, in fear that I would finish it with an anime that bored me I started skipping them, I was having no luck at all and then I ran across this lovely story that I had put off on a long plan to watch list.\r\nEverything in this anime was done right, at first it starts out as a simple story of a boy retuning home to find that things have changed, we can see there will be drama inthe mix but unlike most anime's we can't really make a good prediction on what will happen next. One thing I love about the order of events in the story is they don't fall victim to the drama happening to one character at a time and as soon as their problems are resolved new drama for other characters magically pop up (I'm talking to you Clannad). We are introduced little by little to every character's problems and they all have a point where they climax and are the main focus but in the mean time other characters are facing their own difficulties. The story was really good, it's not an overused concept as far as I'm concerned and it does a great job of keeping you hooked without using cheap drama or fanservice (because a lot of guys don't care if you put a woman's panties in the story or not), it uses slice of life events but then gives you crucial points to the story gradually so you don't get overwhelmed by information. Most of the drama used in the story was well thought out and not used to death, it was even given it's own little twists due to the story. Finally the anime was given something many of us long for from most anime's, a clear ending with an epilogue which I like to call an epiclogue because it makes the story that much more awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very standard, it was given a few highly detailed scene's along with the regualar animation. The character designs were very nice and well thought out, something that deserves to be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was good, the opening is poppy and nice but I always love it when they have a character that plays the voilin, then you know there'll be time set aside for a lovely solo.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all good, Sana will be an idoit sometimes, especially in the beginning, he may have been a little too typical for a main character but I still felt there was something different. Nanaka starts out as a tsundere but doesn't follow many of the stereotypes for one and unlike many her love towards Sana is already something that's developed instead of something she's fighting against and taking her confusion out on him. We have twins which you don't see too often as friends of the main character, Suusuke is Sana's best friends and is a pretty typical best friend but he has his strong points where he knows how to stand up when he's trying to protect his sister, Shuri was a fairly interesting character, she puts up a strong and happy facade even though she's really going through a lot and always considers others. Aoi is off the walls crazy and is really put in as a source of comedy where she flips out when she catches Sana in situations that aren't what they look like, she also completes the group as the 5th friend.  Asami was as really interesting character that I haven't seen before, she acts kind but in reality is someone who schemes and plots against others, behold the reverse tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is one of my favorites and is definetely something you should watch if you don't know what to go for next. It does everything right and always keeps it interesting. It's also very easy to watch, you don't feel emotionally spent after 3 episodes like you will some anime's. Do yourself a favor and don't put it off like I did for so long.",

            "content": "I haven't wrote a review before so this review is going to be brief and opinion-based (if you don't like it, suck it!). Also there might be SPOILERS.\r\nFirst of all, I thought the art was pretty good, I've seen many animes before and the style of the anime works well and compliments the story.\r\nOverall, the sound was good. Only complaint (without being nit-picking) is the voice for Aoi-chan. She's a caring and one-year older than the main character, but has a voice of a hyper-active five-year-old. However, her voice does provide some comfort in intense situations.\r\nMoving on to characters, other than Aoi-chan who seems littleout of place sometimes, everyone else is well developed. Each character's past and their present self make sense. And their reaction to every situation seems right. Because the characters are so well developed it makes the watcher actually care what happens to the characters, when something sad happens the viewer (or a least me) want to enter the anime and provide relief to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important part of all animes, the story. I thought that the speed of the anime was little unexpected. The first few episodes are quite steady and it seems that all of the problems are getting solved and it will be a happily-ever after story. However after passing the half point, it seems that problems are just jumping onto every character until they finally break, running away or committing suicide. (SPOILER) I was heart-broken when problems kept stacking up on Shuu and Shuri, because at the beginning of the anime, it seems that they are unbreakable and they will get through anything,  and after they run away from home, the story is extremely depressing until the end. During the depressing phase, the anime does provide you with some relief, but it just seems that it only does that only to raise hopes of the viewer only to later crush till there's nothing left. Of course at the last episode most of the big problems are solved and the characters live happily-ever-after. Yet, I was not satisfied, nearly the end of the last episode the anime skips to ten years later where there's a open-air concert (or something like that) and give a hint that Shuu and Shuri return. I was really hoping that they will meet their friends, but they didn't. I wasn't so happy about this because it didn't really seem like a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, Myself; Yourself is a great anime and everyone should check it out. Even though there are some flaws, they are so minor that it shouldn't affect the anime too much. \\n\\n\r\nI realize that this isn't the best review and I thank you for baring with me. Also, if you did bare with it and read it through top to bottom, I feel sorry for you.",

I can relate to it even tho I never had any childhood friends and any problems like all the characters have.\r\nLets start with the storyline!\r\nSo, the storyline was great! It started out very cheerful and all then, when it almost come to an end, it became dramatic! Tho, the first few episode didn't really have the \"plot\". At that time, I thought it was just another cute story. After awhile, it became very sad and scary at times! And thats when the story gets interesting! All of the characters had \"problems\" except for Aoi. Iliterally cry on episode 10/11. (You'll have to watch to find out)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt was cute and the character design was great! :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters were cute! Especially Aoi! The twins was my favourite, they are very sweet and their personality is just! AWW! :D \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy this Anime alot! Its like your cry is my cry and your smile is my smile.. ngaha that didn't really make sense! Anyways, I recommend this to those who loves Sad story with an happy ending! ^^",

            "content": "Unexpected is the first thing I thought upon stumbling upon Myself;Yourself. I learned eventually that it's based upon a Visual Novel, though that became obvious as most VNs tend to have similar structure (a main character, 4 or 5 heroines and a boy side character). Now when I say unexpected I mean I was truly thinking it was just another harem series, love triangle drama, or worse a complete waste of time.\r\nFortunately, it's not. It's actually pretty good. The main character, Sana, is not really terrible or dull like most MCs, though he is not that interesting either. The story is made incredibly interesting bythe interactions of the side characters. Nanaka is the main heroine but is traumatized by a certain event from her childhood, the twins are constantly suffering because of the relationship of their step-mother and their father, and even some dramatic and deeply emotional moments concerning certain characters I would loathe to spoil.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this drama is perfectly disguised as your typical slice of life high school story. And that is a good thing. You will be surprised by the first few episodes that these characters have much to tell you. I awkwardly liked Hinako the most, since she became an inmediate favorite: her \"I am an adult\" behavior is amazingly cute, and she goes through a simple yet very sweet arc. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe my favorite thing was how effective the music was, not only the opening and ending themes but several sound tracks still play in my head as I write this. I also enjoyed how the story handled some very complicated real world problems involving trauma, depression, and family abuse. Maybe the mish-mash of everything might feel bloated at times, but I feel everything was touched upon with the right amount of time. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my few complaints is how the story unfolds. But believe me, they come as personal preferences and not diminish the quality of the story, which I think is very solid and overal very good. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a simple drama anime with cute girls and some mature topics mixed in, I really recommend this. Unfortunately, there is nothing beyond this anime, which sucks because an OVA would have been great...",

            "content": "Myself ; Yourself, a Drama, Romance and School genre Anime. A boy named Sana returns to his home town after 5 years later due to his parent's business plans. It is quiet similar to other animes, a person comes back to their town and explores their missing memory's from what has happened before.\r\nStory - 8\r\nI have to say, the Story is not great, but it is also not bad. Nothing unique or special will happen in it that will affect your emotions towards it. The first few episodes explains a few basic things of what has happened, so you just flow with the story. Butthe end is really where the twist is.\\n\r\nI am quite surprised that all this was produced into 13 episodes, the ending was not rushed so it is good. But i don't think the anime had brought out the full potential of the story, many other things could still be used or put into it. So the anime is partly lacking. But i think the anime could have been produced up to around 24 episodes if it was more perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very basic so it does very well suit this anime. The background is not very detailed though, but i guess that its because this anime was made back in 2007. Even though the art is not highly detailed, it should still be able to entertain you. I do like the way how they designed the characters though, nothing is bad about them, none of those silly oversized features such as the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI personally found the OP cute, i enjoyed it all the way close to the end. But then it does get sort of annoying afterwards towards the end. The ED song was quite good, pretty much a slideshow of pictures, but very good chosen pictures for the mood of the song from the anime.\\n\r\nThe music during the anime were also lacking some moods of the scenes, so some music didn't really suit the mood. But most of the time, the music blended into the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed how the characters behaved in this anime because it's pretty much every high school friend you ever had, such as, a talkative comedic friend, a shy friend, etc. So it really does remind you of your high school days. Not much is lacking from the Characters, they contribute well to the anime. Their rolls are used very well to explain and do things.\\n\r\nBut.. i have to admit.. in the anime, Aoi Oribe has one of the most irritating voices i have ever heard in my whole entire life. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime pretty much all the way to the end. Nothing was rushed to complete the ending, so i am happy how they organised the story into 13 episodes. It may be slow paced to some viewers, but everything starts to unfold smoothly towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nThis Anime is not bad for a romance anime, also not as good too. But it is enjoyable to everyone. Easy and basic layout so its easy to understand from start to finish. I honestly think that the story could have some more improvements though.\\n\r\nBut besides all that, this anime is enjoyable if you are looking for something with romance in it.",

            "content": "Sooo this is my first review on MAL, and my first anime review in general. I'm use to reviewing tech and music so this could either go really well or really, really bad.\r\nAnyway, let me preface this by saying that I am still relatively new to anime. I watched Death Note about 5 years ago and that was it, it was only until December last year, when I started watching Bakemonogatari that I bought a Crunchyroll subscription, and since I've been watching different shows everyday. However, this is the first romance series I've watched.\r\nStory; The thing this show does very well is how long itcan draw out it's story. For the first half of the show, very little happens episode to episode but it gives you JUST enough to want to watch the next episode. The second half is a little more fast-paced and it contrasts really well with the first. Even though there is a main story, the side stories draw just as much attention, and all contribute really well to the main plot, however you can tell side-plots from main-plot as clear as day. The story progresses from a straight up romance series to something quite dark and dramatic near the end. It doesn't feel like an extremely natural progression in how each revelation plays but nowhere near bad enough to put you off watching. I gave this section an 8/10, because while the story was realistic and well paced, it lacked a little bit of shine to make it feel truly natural.\\n\\n\r\nArt; The art direction is quite different in this show, compared to the other series I have watched, however it works well alongside the story. One thing the animators did spectacularly in this show was the environment, some of the settings in this show are absolutely sublime, real eye-candy, and the same could be said for some of the characters. Nanaka especially, her array of emotions throughout this series are executed astoundingly beside her art, the first time she smiles, you smile. When she cries near the middle of the series it broke my heart, and her broodiness is actually done pretty well too (especially when it's very easy to make a broody character extremely annoying). Sana, on the other hand, has to be one of the most bland characters (art-wise), I've seen, which is a shame because I do like his character. Obviously having a blandly animated protagonist is quite damaging, hence the 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for a good opening theme tune, both inside and outside of anime. The opening theme for this series is brilliant, it's an electro-rock/pop song and the opening animation matches the song fantastically, it's catchy as hell, it makes you wanna tap along, and with all the characters playing along on stage it really does set the stage for each episode.\\n\r\nThe credit song however isn't as memorable, not bad, just a little boring. The music throughout the show blends in to the scene, and sometimes I'd not even notice there was music playing because it blended so well. However there was one particular piece in this show that kept getting repeated, again, and again, and again. I know this is standard for a lot of shows but they really overdid it with this piece, and a lot of the times it felt unnecessary.\\n\r\nCharacter wise, the voice acting is pretty good. Not spectacular, but executed well-enough. Once again, Nanaka stands out here above the rest, while on the other hand Aoi's voice grates on you for the most part, however, you do kind of get used to it, and it does shine every so often. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: For me, this should be the one that matters most in a show like this, and they don't disappoint. At first, the characters seem kind of bland and one-dimensional, but quickly develop some very complex and very well fleshed-out backgrounds. This is where my earlier point about the show being slightly slow-paced comes into play, things happen awfully slowly at times in this show but when there is a revelation, it really lends itself to the characters, and helps you sympathise with them. Sana, for the most part wanted to make me pull my hair out with how much of an idiot he is. The twins however are two of the most interesting characters in the show and bounce off of each other really well, their conclusion in the story is tragic but sweet. Nanaka as well, while the slowest developing character in the show, explodes at points. Aoi doesn't really develop throughout the show at all, however she is an excellent addition to the story regardless because she feels like a glue between the group. Asami turns out to be more interesting than you first think, and although her revelation is quick, she is an interesting character throughout the whole show, starting as something of an enigma. 9/10 because I fell in love with Nanaka, and could easily see myself as a part of their friends circle.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show doesn't grab you. It doesn't demand your interest. It reels you in slowly until the end, and throws you back into the sea every so often just to make you wanna come back for more. I'm watching ERASED right now too and as an example, that show literally holds you at the collar demanding to be watched. I really enjoyed Myself ; Yourself, but a couple of bits feel like blatant filler, I wouldn't worry though because the killer parts make up for it.\\n\r\nWhere this show shines is how you can enjoy it naturally, I didn't feel compelled to keep my eyes on the screen the whole time but it's easy to know what's going on in a scene (sometimes even before it happens). 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As my first romance anime I probably couldn't have picked a more ideal show, because if it was perfect I'd hold every other show up to it, but it isn't perfect. It has flaws and they're quite obvious, but it's a tight story with some excellent characters and development. I'll definitely give this show another spin sometime.\\n\\n\r\n8/10.",

            "content": "WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!\r\nWhen I started watching this, judging from the picture at anime newsnetwork, seeing all the girls, while reading the main protagonist is a boy, I expected a harem anime. It was already obvious from the start that Sana and Nanaka were gonna get together. However, in the beginning, it looked a bit like Aoi-chan was in love with Sana too when she was blushing in front of him and such. So the when Sana met Hoshino-san and Nanaka got all jealouse and stuff, it fellt like the starts of just another love triangle. But after a few episodes, I became happilysuprised.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time, 12-13 episode-animes don't really capture me. They're just too short to really get to feel with the characters, but this one did a pretty good job in that. First, it was a nice, enjoyable anime, nothing more though. Things like Nanaka being depressed for unknown reasons, Hinako having a crush on Shuusuke, Shuri bullying the guys and Aoi-chan being way to hyperactive and screaming \"Tanoushii this\" and \"Tanoushii that\" with her sqeaky voice got a little annoying after a while, and I started wondering if this was going anywhere. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Nanaka's past came out, things got a little more interesting, although the scene of Nanaka crying in Sana's arms and Sana saying stuff like \"We'll always be together from now on.\" still felt a little cheesy to me. As for me, the series really started blooming when the Shuu/Shuri-arc started. From that point on, the several plot-twists and character development really surprised me. For example Hoshino-san's story justified a lot of those things that annoyed me earlier on, because they all made sense all of a sudden, plus, because they made it look like a love triangle at first, the truth was an even bigger shock.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the character I felt most connected with was Shuri, and I felt a strange desire to have a twin brother like Shuusuke. I kinda missed them during the last two episodes. Nevertheless, the ending did satisfy me a little. =]",

            "content": "For a span of 13 episodes, a show containing both school life and drama often results in melodrama due to the lack of time it takes to properly build a good characters. Unfortunately, myself ; yourself exemplifies this formula. It also doesn't help that our lead male, Sana Hidaka, doesn't really have a knack for grasping a given situation. Top that off with our easily angered lead female, Nanaka Yatsushiro, and we have a perfect ice cream sundae shit storm.\r\nNoting that myself ; yourself only has 13 episodes to play with, how it spent its episodes were rather unproductive by introducing too many sub-plots irrelevantto the main story. While these sub-plots give minor characters a fair amount of screentime and a bit of personality and development, it all becomes irrelevant when the story decides to simple leave said characters behind. If that wasn't bad enough, it\u0081fs merely the tip of the iceberg. The minor plot themselves were forcefully introduced by events which seemed to drawn from slips of paper that were randomly pulled from a box of suggestions. One of the ideas pulled from the box was this: Five minutes of screentime are given to minor character Suusuke Wakatsuki walking home from school and saving an elementary school girl from being picked on by a group of other teenage boys. For the next three episodes, let\u0081's put aside the main plot to tell a love story about how an elementary school girl had fallen head over heels for a boy twice her age. Myself ; yourself continues to do this for the next six episodes or so.\\n\\n\r\nConsequently this creates a mess of unnecessary melodrama which started from nothing and ending abruptly. Of course, no melodrama would be complete without the genetic love triangle. Except myself ; yourself's love triangle threw in a twist by having one of our characters telling us \u0081\"oh I wasn't involved in that love triangle lol\"\u0081. It gets points for the unexpected twist but loses points for misleading the audience and wasting time developing something it didn't need too. Oh wait, the entire show was like that.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters and development, as previously mentioned, our lead character, Sana, isn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer. Unfortunately, this does not change as the show progresses. Then again, can we blame him? After all, he barely had any screentime to develop his character. Throughout the show, we're fed bits of his traumatic past and his bits of our lead female, Nanaka's past. When the two come together for a \"resolve\", we see a five minute exchange of dialogue which ends abruptly (this show has a tendency to do that) to jump 10 years into the future.\\n\\n\r\nAs disappointing as myself ; yourself was, the twists does somewhat drive the story. Since not all events of the story was laid out perfectly, the story threw a bit of a mystery genre in there to keep viewers watching. It's just a shame that the outcomes of said events were far less exciting as the mystery leads one to think due to poor pace and inadequate development.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed watching this series, and that's what it boiled down to. It's been a while since I watched an anime I so thoroughly enjoyed. It's hard to say what exactly made this anime so good, it has some cliches and some generic characters, but it's not the lazy harem anime you might expect from the cover or the basic premise of a high school boy surrounded by various female friends. \r\nAs much as I liked it, it's uneven. The story of Hinako, a 10 and then 11 year old girl who attaches herself to the group, seemed like filler, it was not glaringlybad but it didn't really develop the core characters, and it was a bit offputting that it involved our protagonist trying to hook up a 10-year-old girl with a friend his own age.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is also apparently known for its incest content. It definitely is a subplot, but there's nothing explicit, it's implied (albeit heavily). This is no Koi Kaze, it's not all about incest... unless it's a huge issue for you I don't think you'll have a problem with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that said, I loved this series. It's nothing that hasn't been done before, it's just a good drama anime about a circle of high school friends who come of age somewhat painfully. The main characters are just done very well, with good character development and strong storytelling as it concerns the core narrative. It's a series with many great scenes, and that's where its strength is, rather than having a breakthrough style or a completely new story. When the characters have a lighthearted BBQ by the river early in the series, it's just a perfectly executed scene, it does everything it needs to extremely well. A scene or two like that in most episodes, and it made for something very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI can see how people wouldn't like this, and it's definitely got some blemishes, but in terms of personal enjoyment I'd put this one right up there with \"Clannad: After Story\" although I confess that objectively, it's at least a notch under that level.",

            "content": "So this is my first review, so bear with me. I wrote this because I was really wrong about this series. Thank God that I stuck with it because it's something really good.\r\nOK, so Myself;Yourself is an adaptation of the visual novel of the same name. What we know about VN adaptations are they're generally crappy, with some notable exceptions (*ehem* Clannad). Though this title is not as great as Clannad it is still pretty good on its own.\r\nWhat I liked about this show is that it surprised me a whole lot.\r\nI really thought that it was just some crappy adaptation. The first few episodesreally gave me that impression. All those jokes that just wasn't funny, the overflowing cliches that was presented and Aoi-chan's voice. *shudders* Seriously, listening to her was like fingernails on blackboards, F-ing annoying.\\n\\n\r\nBut by episode 8, all of those concerns went to take a backseat to the story that unraveled. The first few episodes did give us some glimpse into the plot but it wasn't really all that clear but then...\\n\\n\r\nBOOM! The story kicked into high gear. From the conflict between Sana and Nanaka to Sana discovering the letters, that, for me, was the true start of the story. It had so much impact that it made up for the mediocrity of the episodes that preceded it. I actually felt my spine tingle and my body tremble when Nanaka cried in Sana's arms. I was moved and hooked.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode after that just gave us plot twist (homicidal granny) after plot twist (lesbian Asami) after plot twist (Watanuki incest) after plot twist (father arson) after plot twist (suicidal Nanaka and Sana). It was heart-wrenching. It made me sympathize with the characters and feel the pain they were going through. It was because of this that I think of this anime very highly.\\n\\n\r\nThough, this anime isn't perfect. The voice acting was poor, the animation was so-so and the pacing is bad. It would have been better if they cut the first seven episodes into a 2-3 episode span and used the other 10 episodes to expound on the conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was just okay. I felt that it fell flat in the end. They could have done better than cutting to ten years after and trying to vaguely tie up the plot holes but I think it was fitting with respect to the series. Personally, I wished that there was a kiss between Nanaka and Sana.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Myself;Yourself to people who like a good romance/drama anime. I am sure you'll appreciate it. Although some patience is needed, but if you can bear waiting this series will reward you.",

It's not unpredictable, or anything of that nature, but everything was were it needed to be. The characters were great and you feel a heavy attachment to most of them, and they complement the story well. The feelings in this one are on par with Ano Hana, andyou get the same sad yethappy feeling from it. Fair warning though like the original Clanned the story has a slow start.

            "content": "The first thing you notice when you begin watching Myself;Yourself is that of the art style. The long faced style of the characters, simple designs and non-distinguished clothing can be a rather large turn off to the viewer. Likewise the passable animation quality can be annoying to a viewer that wants everything to be a work of art. From simply animating more than just the characters hands clapping, or lip sync the show lacks a lot of what one could find beautiful. This is most aptly shown by the opening of the show, which utilizes a concert scene. Similar scenes in other shows use accurateand elegant animation to the music which often astounds the audience. Yet in Myself;Yourself you merely get the energy of the characters movement portrayed, not the actual instruments played. Which as it sounds doesn't make the show hard to watch, it merely does not draw you in as strongly as it could otherwise do.\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in the show is pretty forgettable. None of the musical tracks carry any mood badly though, they are just merely there and don't give lasting impressions to the viewer. Despite having small musical sub themes which could lead to disappointment to a viewer that wanted any music the characters themselves play as being truly moving. In a similar fashion the sound assets and voice acting isn't out of place as a whole, but neither is it anything amazing. Overall the production values of animation and sound are completely passable, but nothing amazing, or good.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, production values aside, the actual characters in this show are quite solidly portrayed. That is, the majority of the main cast act like people, their quirks are understandable and lifelike which makes connecting to these characters, despite the visual lack of typical distinctions, easy. This isn't necessarily true for all the characters in the show, but being as it's a 13 episode series this is to be expected. In fact the brief time they give to some of the lesser characters I would argue is time that would have been better put towards  portraying the plot specific characters as this would have strengthened their already well crafted characters and allow the audience a deeper connection to the characters that matter. The characters carry this show, with themes and relationships which are so easy to do wrong either by putting too much or too little emphasis on them, are done wonderfully. Truly drawing the audience in to the main experiences the show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the show is nothing special. That is, there is nothing that happens that is really that surprising outside of maybe a couple of twists. Yet I cannot call this a bad thing as the narrative and characters make sense. They don't tend to do stupid things that a person would not do. The struggles and triumphs shown in the series are fairly realistic and understandable if bordering on fairy tale-like at times. Nothing happens in the show that one wouldn't expect to be possible in real life, no super natural phenomena just people being people. The comedic sides of the show are pretty typical, with gags that one has seen a thousand times before. Yet they centre around one particular supporting character and don't take away from the rich immersion of the actual plot and feeling of the show. The overall tones of the show vary from light-hearted to dark dramatic. This isn't used to it's full potential but it is used well enough that the viewer cares about what happens. This isn't a show that repulses you when you watch some of the gags, but neither is it a show that will make you laugh out loud often. Nor will it send you into crying for hours on end, but it will dabble in both \\n\r\nnot dedicating itself to central emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThus I would have to conclude that Myself;Yourself is a solid drama. Very little in the show is actually done bad, yet very little in the show actually stands out as being amazing outside of it's mature usage of themes and characterization. Whilst it takes about episode three for the show really to get rolling and a lot more feels like it could have been better, in either more time spent on some characters, some plot lines explored in more detail, or even using less obvious foreshadowing to give a more surprising plotline. For a 13 episode romantic comedy drama the show is worth watching if you enjoy that style of show.",

The deep, emotional scenes between Sana and Nanaka especially add depth to the anime, as a whole. This was the highlight of the series for me.\r\nUnfortunately, the series did feel hurried in the latter part of theanime which, for me, ruined a lot of the tension that had been built up throughout the previous episodes. I also felt that the back story of Sana was not as well laid out as the rest of the characters which made him feel a bit flimsy in comparison with some of the more minor characters.\\n\r\nStill, I did enjoy the anime and have no qualms with adding it to my completed list.

            "content": "In recent times, it's a challenge to find an anime that doesn't use recycled themes over and over again. To me, accidentally stumbling upon Myself;Yourself while randomly browsing crunchyroll is like finding a hidden gem amidst mainstream anime. While Myself;Yourself starts out as if it's your typical run-of-the-mill slice of life school romance anime with hints of harem... if you stick to it for a while... it isn't.\r\nStory\r\nStarting off with the return of the MC to his hometown, the beginning episodes felt as if it's a normal slice-of-life school anime with probable harem and love triangle. But as the series progresses, it starts to developas something that's not quite the norm. The drama, conflict left a strong impact which finally strikes at the end point of episode 11.   The pacing felt right, except perhaps for the last arc of the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nNo complaints for the art, not too bad but not too good either. The voice acting was generally great, but perhaps Aoi's voice is a bit too high-pitched and hence, annoying. Causing me to feel somewhat annoyed when she speaks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are all unique. While at first glance each character seemingly fit into a certain stereotype, as the series progresses, their inner self and problems are brought out into the open. Revealing things we didn't expect when first starting the show. The protagonist threw me off, I expected him to be a normal, dense, and harem material high-school boy, but throughout the series, it is hinted that he is more than that. What didn't sit well with me was perhaps the purpose of having Aoi as a character there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nExpecting this to be a run-of-the-mill romance school slice of life anime, when the fireworks started, it kinda threw me off. But, after coping with this, it is very enjoyable. One scene in particular (in episode 11), left a very lasting impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIt's a great watch, especially for those who are bored of the generic anime these days.\\n",

It was very deep, it constantly had me interested in finding out what happens next. The deepness could probably be compared to Clannad, except if this went on longer, maybe it would be even better.\r\nArt had a similar feeling to anime like Clannad but also reminded me of School Days. So, really it's nothing special but there are definitely times when major attention to detail is obvious, and those times are when the art really shines for Myself; Yourself.\r\nSound: Again, it was fine, but nothing great.Music was okay. Nothing bad about the voice acting either. Oh, I'll say this though. Aoi's voice is so adorable!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned before, the story was really deep... And this series focuses a lot on the relationships between characters. So it's probably the storytelling of the characters' relationships with each other that makes this as good as it is.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I really enjoyed this series. It's a shame it was only 13 episodes, I think a bit more could have been done with it. In fact, an \"Afterstory\" would be perfect for a show like this.",

            "content": "Yet again im going to stray a bit from my usual style of reviews.\r\nMyself; Yourself is an interesting title. I've heard/read from a bunch of different sources and eventually added it to my watch list. This show earns the heart drop award. Meaning it's great at just dropping the ball straight on you. Before watching this show I did play through the game. Small comparisons might be used.\r\nNow let's get into the real meat of this review\r\n[Story] 6/10 - Now im sure the synopsis can do this part for me. But the story kinda jumps a lot. Making the real tone of the show dropquiet significantly. Once you get to around episode 7 or 8 the story starts to get a lot better. From that point on the story is pretty good, nothing I haven't heard of or seen before but it was nice to see a story keep my attention this well.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 8/10 - As this is a bit of an oldie the art style is a bit dated, but it's not ugly. Not in the slightest. It's nice to look at, the animation is overall pretty decent. There are a couple of clippy frames that just seem off, especially when there is more than one character on screen. But they are minor and really don't distract from the show. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 8/10 - The only thing bad about the show's sound is the OP and the ED. They just don't fit the show. Really can't say why as this is a spoiler free review but you will come to see the same if you end up picking this up. An amazing commendation is how they use music to make a scene better. There are plenty of scenes that use some serious visual story telling without music, and they hit hard. Especially in the later half of the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 7/10 - I feel as if the creators did a decent job with character development. It was spread around quite well. Though 1 or 2 characters who are portrayed as supporting roles but are actually main characters. Said characters needed a couple scenes to flesh out their character. If you want a better understanding of the characters, go play the PS2 Game. That does an amazing job at character development.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 10/10 - As usual I seem to find yet another guilty pleasure. This anime made me sad, real sad. And I loved it. Sometimes you just need that punch in the gut. Keeping ones attention is really key and I feel like this did a very good job at that.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score] 7/10 - Poor story and character really drag this down. Those are it's flaws, simple and swift. If you want a sad story pick this up. Do I recommend this? Yeah. It was a good experience. \\n\\n\r\nIf it's your birthday today, Happy Birthday!\\n\r\nAll of ya have a nice rest of your day!",

But Aoi's voice is a curse, I got on my nerves, good thing she wasn't around too much lol\\n\\n\r\nThe art was okay, it's from 2007 so it can only look so good ( although Gurren Lagann begs to differ lol)\\n\\n\r\nThe music was good, I liked the OP, ED, and the OST fits in nicely with the story.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Myself; Yourself. the music was good, the story was touching, and the characters felt relatable.

I have watched animes of many generes, and quite a sufficient amount on each genre, to say that this particular \"slice of life\" anime is good for its genre. \r\n     The situation of some of the people within the series are ones that we can relate to, such as the main characters issue of having to move away a lot due to family/work issues and being bullied. However, there are other less socially-acceptable topics ranging from incest to suicidal attempts/thoughts.The power of \"love\", from what I feel that the anime is telling me, is what keeps two individuals on the path of suicide from comitting the act. The fact that music is also one of the ways they express their emotions/love is really interesting, since the main violin melody is very packed with emotions. Overall this anime is worth your time since it's definitely not going to bore you, and there are enough conflicts to keep you entertained and also things that are relatable to the average person out there.",

            "content": "Ugh, lots of mixed feelings about this one.\r\nStory: Nothing really happens until after half the series. At least for me, nothing really hooked me in until then. It's very slow-paced. The beginning felt boring. It was mostly the characters hanging out and going to school with mini foreshadowings. The plot twists are either predictable or make you go \"No way!\". It's pretty much hit or miss. Surprising as they can be, they can be hard to sit through. I did not really like the end because I felt it could have been spread out a bit more instead of tying up the loose ends ina rushed way within the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Pretty good, clean and consistent. Probably the best thing of this series and a huge reason people wanted to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: A couple of the bgm songs were okay, felt like getting the ost after finishing the series. Opening and ending songs were definitely keepers. They were pretty rocking songs. As for the voice actors they were fine. There was a pretty good lineup of recognizable ones. I only have a problem with Aoi's voice... it is so high and annoying. Seriously, every time she's on screen, I brace myself. I don't have anything against the voice actor but... ah, you'll know what I mean if you decide to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here's a main problem with this series. I can't really say if they were brilliantly written or just kind of lame.\\n\\n\r\nSana - He's not really the main that goes around trying to fix everything, he'd like to but the other characters keep to themselves most of the time. I don't have much of a problem with him except on two occasions. Especially at the end, it made me respect him less because his problem is shown to us in a rushed way. A bit much to handle all at once. We know he has a problem but we don't know what it is until the last episode... My other problem with him is the way he reacts to certain things. One is regarding Asami but it's a spoiler so we'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nNanaka - I could understand what's up with her in episode 1 but she has a lot of mood swings and it gets a little annoying as she doesn't really get her facts straight first so she's either angry at times or very content. Plus, they don't really establish what's up with her until much later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAoi - Annoying, go away.\\n\\n\r\nAsami - I thought you were cool...\\n\\n\r\nShuri and Shuusuke - I really wish they weren't brother and sister, they were written pretty well and it was nice seeing how they take care of each other. Their story was pretty gripping.\\n\\n\r\nHinako - I liked her more than some of the other characters but she just wasn't important enough. I know she's younger and all but she really had no influence on the plot. She just took up two episodes and made them all about her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I don't know what kept me watching, maybe because of the little hints that something would eventually happen or the high expectations I had so I stuck with it. It started to pick up after halfway but the end was so rushed. Can't say I hated it or it was as bad as other things I've seen. This could've been pretty good, it just wasn't carried out properly. I also wish there was more romance between the two main characters. You know something'll happen for these two but no hand holding and no kiss...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is slow but if you can sit through the first 8 episodes you'll do fine or ask someone who did watch it and skip the Hinako episodes to save you time as you won't be missing anything. The drama is kind of worth it but to be honest, this Anime is definitely not for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hope this helped.",

The story revolves around a boy who returns to his childhood hometown, and his renewed relationships with his old friends.\r\nHave you ever heard a deadpan joke before?  A statement that you took seriously, was given fairly seriously, but there are hints that it's a joke somewhere?  In Myself; Yourself, what seems like cliche is actually subtle parody.  That's not to say that it doesn't conform to genre.  It's just that when \"big breasted moe girl\" appears, that's exactly what she is.  It's a little over the top.  Other instances inthe anime are when Sana falls on Hinako.  The first time you see that, you think it's corny cliche.  The third time, you should understand it's parody.  This is also made very clear when \"anime blue\" and company appear.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a mature anime.  It's not rife with fanservice or bad language or lewdness.  But it touches on trust and betrayal and jealousy.  On love and pain.  On dealing with hard times.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot in Myself; Yourself isn't always in front of you.  It's in the periphery.  Your understanding of events and conversations that happened earlier in the story will change as more is revealed later.  An example of this is Syusuke's answers to the questions Sana brings him from Hinako.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that, when it is done, benefits from some post-viewing pondering.  As you begin to walk back the cat, these elements of peripheral plot and parody show themselves more clearly.  This show also has a high rewatch potential (especially given it's length).\\n\\n\r\nMyself; Yourself is worth watching (maybe even twice!).",

Flash forward 5 years and Sana has moved back to his hometown of Sakuranomori where he lives in a boarding house that is owned by one of his friends, Aoi. Sana soon finds out about his friends over the last 5 years and eventually gets slapped by a girl named Nanaka. This drives the story throughout the whole series as Sana triesto figure out the missing pieces of his past and his friend's past.\\n\\n\r\nNow the series is okay for what it's worth. But the reason why I gave it all 7's is because there are points where the predictable sets in and points where things just don't sit right and can be down right, disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT!!!\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, Sana gets rather friendly with a girl named Hoshino, who helps her with student council meetings, but the weird part comes from the fact that Hoshino was in love with a friend of his, Shuri, who is a girl. Coming from nowhere kind of threw me for a loop. Which was sort of weird as well as intriguing since you don't really see it that much.\\n\\n\r\nAnother weird staple is that eventually, the twins, Shuu and Shuri run away together after their father tries to seperate them after the sister disrespects their stepmother. But that's not all, someone drew a love umbrella on a chalk board at school (it turned out to be Hoshino), that resembled the twin's incest love which wasn't there. This lead them to run away together, almost enforcing that incest and when the time jump occurs later on, they are seen walking in holding hands together. Hmmm. Seems sort of ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nOne more flaw in this series is that you can see the problems Sana suffered before it is revealed in the end. Sana tried to commit suicide after some bullying lead him to slit his wrist. Ever since then, he wore a watch to cover it and was frightened whenever he sees blood. And later on, Nanaka seems to want to do the same thing after her unfortunate events and reveals his dark secret to her. But that part was all too recognizable around at least 5 episodes prior to that whole scene. C'mon, some mystery would be nice once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the final preverbial nail in the coffin comes from the interconnections that occur between every character in the series. Not only do all of the students know each other, but the new teacher knew Sana from her childhood. This is all too boring to me. It was like &quot;Oh yay, she knew him 10 years ago. Why is this episode even here?&quot; It could have been removed and still kept it's continuity fresh in the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnough with the flaws now. This was still something good to watch intermittently. The characters are still pretty solid with some good background. The concepts for each character's background is pretty original with some fairly good plot twists that made me jump for a little bit. I'd only recommend it for those of you who are just wanting something to watch if you're kind of bored and would want a general decent anime for those rainy Sundays.",

            "content": "Myself ; Yourself is another romance/ drama/ comedy anime, but different (also a lot better) than most other shows of this variety:\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is the stereotypical \"boy returns to home town and meets old childhood friends\" scenario, but what makes this show really good is that it's entertaining and fun to watch, even without huge cliff hangers. In a lot of other drama animes the protagonists often do stupid things or are in situations where they should talk but don't, which makes those types of show extremely unnerving - this doesn't happen too often during this show and occurs less and less as the showprogresses.\\n\r\nThere is a perfect balance between romance and actual story telling during this show, though I wouldn't expect too much romance. There are quite a lot of dramatic twists in the story too, which, combined with the flashbacks, reveal more about each character, making their motives and feelings more understandable.\\n\r\nStill, the story looses some points for having quite a number of fillers, which are absolutely unnecessary in a 13 episode series. I would also argue that the first 5 episodes could have been fit into 2 and the last episodes were far too short.\\n\r\nBut the biggest plus to this anime is its end, although a lot of people may disagree. I really hate it when drama anime end with one big bang, and that's it. It leaves you with a very unsatisfying feeling. This show though builds up to the climax very slowly and arrives at it about 4 minutes before the show ends, leaving enough time for the story to slowly end. The climax isn't even the actual relationship, as it often tends to be in romance anime. It's as if the show drives on 2 rails, one being the romance part and one the actual story. The story slowly ends, but the romance part goes on for a bit more until the show finishes. I'd best describe the end as &quot;soothing&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation was OK I guess. At no point did the animation bother me, nor did it really fascinate me with its beauty.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is quite good. Both the opening and the ending songs are very joyful, making a good start and end to each episode. The music during the anime itself fits well to each situation. What I found great was the violin playing of one of the protagonists. It really gave a great start and finish to the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are very fleshed out. The show really leaves nothing to question about any character.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment:\\n\r\nThis show was very entertaining. The &quot;mysteries&quot; about the 2 main characters past made me curious to see what really had happened and left me in suspense, which is great, since most romance anime only build suspense upon the relationships of characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nYou'll definitely not regret watching this show. But don't expect too much romance, since in comparison to shows like &quot;True Tears&quot; there isn't much. The feelings in this anime flow through the story telling, not the love stories. I really enjoyed this show.\\n\\n\\n",

I guess I like it so much because I can relate to it, thanks to similar things happening in my ownlive, but even despite that, I think its a good basic plot for an anime\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nTypical well budgeted anime, good picture... doesnt qualify for \"state of the art\" but its right there, and I cant see any reason to knock it down... to me, the art and sound dont really carry any value for the final score anyway...\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nPretty much all I can remember is the OP and ED music [again... no effect on the final score]... I love the OP... its very fun to listen to, and I do like to hear it every now and again... the ED song made me want to pour bleach in my ear... no reason other than I just didnt like it... there is a character voice issue I had, but I decided to address that in the next section\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8\\n\r\nVoice issue - I promise, no hate to the seiyuu, I just happen to hate this particular trope... the character Aoi Oribe has voice characteristics that sound like moe went to a super saiyan level... its about as whimsical as elmo and ive never heard a real person talk that way, even in Japan... now that thats out of the way, the rest of the characters are decent... I feel theyre pretty typical, but theyre decent, and I have very few complaints about the rest of them... I feel that this bit of emo stuff wasnt really necessary, but its not out of the realm of possibility, and some of the reasoning behind it was a little overdramatic, tho some people really are overdramatic, and in worse ways, so Ill buy it, it just wasnt my cup of tea...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\r\nI did overall enjoy the anime... its not really my first choice recommendation, but if you need something to watch, it might keep you entertained... I know in this review, I complain a fair bit about the drama, but there are good points to it too, Im just hoping not to spoil... I did enjoy the level of romance in this anime... its there, but its not totally in your face...\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7\\n\r\nI call it a 7, because I do feel something is missing, but I just dont know how to manifest it into words... again, it has been a little while since ive seen it, so theres a good chance ill update or rewrite this review... but all in all, I think it is worth seeing, but maybe theres something else on your view list you might enjoy better seeing first",

            "content": "Overall\t\r\nA cute but very divided story. There are many good ideas in here, but they are badly carried out with poor directing, poor animation and pretty indifferent voice acting.\r\nAll in all, this could have been good, but it isn't. I heard the game is better, though.\r\nAnimation\t\r\nBackgrounds and general design looks pretty good, with nice visuals like sakura, sunbeams, lighting effects and similar. However, when it comes to animation, movement, poses, facial expressions and stuff that are supposed to make the story come alive, most of it looks stiff and unnatural. It's really annoying since each still frame looks good, but animated, it is a failure.Too bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound\t\\n\r\nVoice acting is another bad point in Myself, Yourself. Some characters sound good, like Aoi and Shuri, but others (most notably the main character Sana) sound really dull and amateurish.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, on the other hand, is generally good. Background soundtrack is kind of varied and fits the mood. The ending track is so-so, but the opening theme is amazeballs. Probably a top 10 if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nThe story is not very one-directional. Every character has their own little side-story, but they are not really connected to each other. Each sub-plot could have been an entirelly separate anime, but competing over the same screen time, they all feel rushed and incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nWierd, because there are some animes of equal length that managed to tell a much larger story in a satisfying way. AIR comes to mind.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nAll the main characters have at least some depth and get rather well developed during the episodes, even though the development feels a bit rushed. The characters' subplots aren't really connected to each other, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters are generally well used and integrated into the different plots. I specially liked the homeroom teacher. Even though she is a stereotype (why are all anime teachers so hot?).\\n\\n\r\nValue\t\\n\r\nI watched the [SHiN-gx] fansubs, which were pretty rotten. The [B-G_&_m.3.3.w] ones seemed better, but most of the files were corrupt and wouldn't play properly. \\n\\n\r\nWhile watching anime, you should always try to read between the lines, but bad grammar and stupid wordings don't really add to the experience.",

Although there are some changes to the town, most has remained the same. On a detour to his apartments, he notices a girl in a shrine maiden outfit watching him when he visits the shrine. He finds out, the next day at school, that this girl is actually Nanaka Yatsushiro, his old childhood friend whom he gave a bracelet to before he left, that she stillwears, even to this day.\\n\r\n(From Anime News Network)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\nFirst off... apparently anime characters bleed black blood nowadays... =/\\n\r\nBack to topic, Myself; Yourself has gotten a lot of comparisons to another anime named &quot;School Days&quot;... Now if you've read about the ending of School Days, then this comparison should be sounding alarms in your head. Fortunately... I can say that the endings aren't similar. \\n\r\nMyself; Yourself starts off like a typical romance/harem/comedy.  A moderate sized cast made up of 2 guys and a lot of girls.  You see the possibility of 3 girls liking the main character.  However this formula gets shattered by the 8th episode as the anime takes a turn for the darker.\\n\r\nNow when I say darker... i don't mean like &quot;heads will roll&quot; kinda dark (that's just f***ed up), i more mean like the pasts and backgrounds of the characters are shown and the happy athmosphere of the first 7 episodes disappear.\\n\r\nThe first 7 episodes were somewhat flawed but really helped me appreciate each character. (Aoi-chan is just tooo cute). It's the final 5-6 episodes that this anime REALLY shines. All the major character developments occur hear and most of these are emotionally touching.\\n\r\nThe final episode closes the anime nicely and leaves the viewer satisfied\\n\\n\r\nI personally would've liked to see some of the secondary characters to get some character development. But i'll take what i get\\n\\n\r\nRATING: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n- Kanon\\n\r\nMany girls who have some problems in their past or present\\n\\n\r\n- Shigofumi\\n\r\nthe 2nd half the series really targeted the faults of humans in general and almost felt like the writer was making a commentary.",

            "content": "12 Episodes. After 12 of the 13 episodes, I had pretty much made up my mind on the series. I had even thought of most of what I was going to say in my review of it. By in large, the characters were either bland or their actions half the time (Nanaka) didn't make any sense. It seemed like it was trying to have some kind of deeper plot going on below the surface, but it wasn't really clicking. There was a definite lack of focus, something that a show with only 13 episodes really cannot afford to have, in my opinion.\r\nBut the 13th episode....thatwas pretty good. While I think a bad ending can ruin a really good show, this is the first time I think I can say that a really good ending improved an otherwise mediocre show. The twists at the end, were great. It completely caught me off guard when I learned what actually happened to Nanaka, and the scenes following the reveal were very touching. As I watched Sana, for the first time I really felt for him and the situation he was in. After I finished that last episode I wanted to stand up and say \"this is what the entire show should've been like!\"\\n\\n\r\nWhile never really bad, Myself ; Yourself really struggles through most of the series. Two episodes are dedicated to a character who almost never appears outside of those episodes, and many of the other episodes spend a lot of time focusing on supporting characters. I'll reiterate that the show suffers from a lack of focus, and while there is the occasional moment or two in which I went \"neat, didn't see that coming\" the plot largely was predictable and sometimes boring. The characters were a bit better, but not anything beyond good; I am grateful that Nanaka did start making more sense as the series went on. But the ending, the ending at least was done right.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't call Myself ; Yourself a romance, and if you are looking for romance this isn't the place. If you're a fan of Drama and Slice of Life, this might be a decent show to watch. But don't expect a lot beyond decent. The ending, while great, doesn't make up for 12 episodes that came before it. Still, with only 13 episodes I could think of worse ways to pass the time, and it's not the worse anime I've ever seen. If you do start it, try to make it to the ending.",

            "content": "Sana Hidaka a sixteen year old high school student returns to his hometown Sakuranomori after five years, re-united with his childhood friends Nanaka, Aoi, Shusuke and Shuri. Sana attempts to return to the life he once had in his hometown, but time has changed Sakuranomori and its inhabitants as secrets and past memories haunt the five friends that could very well decimate their once peaceful and happy lives. \r\nThis anime started off incredibly slow when introducing the characters and going over past events had taken place which took up a good few episodes. As the series progressed it gave hints of events that had happenedprior to the present date without actually telling us what they are and how they happened. As the show came to a close it showed the full extent of what had happened in those five years and along the way we deal with cute crushes, broken friendships, family conflicts and separation.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is mainly centered on Sana and Nanaka, the relationship that they had when in their younger days and the jagged, broken friendship that they currently have. As the story progresses they try rebuild their shattered relationship, uncover dark repressed memories and look to the future for better days that lie ahead. \\n\\n\r\nI was left very disappointed with the slow start of this anime that I dropped it five episodes in only to return to finish it several months later. This series continued with its slow pace just as I had left it and only at episode eight and nine that things had started to get interesting. Questions had been answered, but the thing that annoys me is that why they couldn\u2019t have revealed some of this information sooner rather than show me at the very end.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people would be tempted to drop this show as no real drama occurs until later episodes which can be quite off putting for viewers, though when the drama and secrets unfold satisfaction will be granted. \\n\\n\r\nOther than main characters Sana and Nanaka we have Aoi who doesn't really play that big of a role in the series and is just there for the sake of it. The others are twins Shusuke and Shuri who lost their mother at a young age found comfort in each other as their farther was occupied with work. They have a strong relationship but others see it as more than just brother and sister. Soon rumors spread about the two and they are forced into making some tough decisions. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is not half bad, I particularly enjoy the combination of piano and violin and the opening and closing songs are good and quite enjoyable though at some point you will skip them as it gets boring. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has been compared to the likes of Kanon 2006 which I am not particularly pleased about. Myself;Yourself does show some similarities to Kanon, but the two are nothing alike as the character designs are the only real similarity, adopting the stereotypical moe design. Overall this anime was ok; it was a good shot at the romance/drama anime but falls flat with its slow pacing and satisfying ending which can leave you with mixed thoughts and feelings. To put this into the region of Clannad, Air or Kanon would be a complete overstatement; this anime has it good points but does nothing groundbreaking to stand out on its own. I would not recommend this personally, you\u2019re not missing anything by not watching this show and you could get so much more from the likes of the previous three anime I mentioned as they are essentially the same genre.   \\n\\n",

I was dissapointed about the band not being in the series but I'm also into animes like this.  It's based on a visual novel.  It's got alot of drama in the series, I am drawn to sad animes.  This series was similar to School Days as well.  I cried many times while watching this series.  The character development is pretty good, Nanaka at first came off as a really cold character because Sana didn't remember her after 6 years,he had just returned to the city after moving away 6 years prior to the start of the series.  I found Aoi's voice to be really irritating and it didn't match her at all.  I liked this series alot and now I wish it could be released in America.  I'd recommend it to anybody who is into a drama, school life, psychological anime.",

            "content": "I must say that even though i saw this a while ago, I think about it all the time. It was truely a great anime! I hope i can only do it justice with this reveiw:)\r\nFirst of all, when you read the synopsis, you'll get the impression of a high school drama. THERE IS SOOOO MUCH MORE!!!! This anime is dark, and yet light. If my memory serves me correctly, there are plenty of happy moments. But behind all of those happy moments lies a dark secret, and truth to be discovered. Reconsider this anime is you are casting it aside as another romance/high schoolanime. So many dark times, lies, betrayal, and moments that just shock you await. But also remember, not all is dark, there are happy moments too.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is basically about friends helping out friends through rough times in their life. The story just screams the fact that a friend is there to listen to you, and to help you out and help you stay strong. The characters in this story all have their own struggles and inter turmoils that are expressed during the story. Very heartfelt and touching. It made me wanna text my best friend and tell her how much i loved her:) Beautiful friendships and relationships and moments that just make you wanna cry because your so happy for them and congradulate them for having such wonderful friends! I wish everyone had someone like the main characters of this anime! xD \\n\\n\r\nAlso, Nanaka plays the violin. Being a violin player myself i felt connected to the anime:) She's also pretty. But she holds such sadness within her. Also, being able to relate to that, Nanaka's pain and sadness from the events in her life make the watcher want to give her a hug through their computer screen, and comfort her. Although Hidaka does a pretty good job! haha:)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good too:) I thought the scenes were very nice and the characters were well done:) Some of the moments were beautifully captured through the art! I applaud the artist:)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the story line was fantastic! The synopsis doesn't do it justice. This anime is much more complex and intense then it has led you to believe. Take my advice and watch this anime. But come prepared with some tissues just incase! ;D\\n\\n\r\nThis was just me speaking my mind about this anime:) You don't have to follow my adviceto watch it )or use some tissues:P) but if you read this review wondering if you should watch it or thinking that it's not for you, I highly reccomend this anime:) But then again it's your choice:) Happy watching! \\n",

However because I enjoyed Anohana and Angel Beats one of my friends recommended I check out Myself; Yourself. I don't remember who recommended it to me, but boy do I wish I could thank them. Myself; Yourself was one of the best shows i've ever watched, from the characters to the AMAZING plot everything was perfect.\r\nMyself; Yourself really made me fall in love with each and everyone of thecharacters, I actually felt these characters pain and wanted nothing more than for each of the characters to be as happy as they can possibly be. Even after everything they made each of the characters go through Myself; Yourself gives one of the most satisfying endings i've ever seen, after 12 episodes of peer sadness and despair they ended it off by showing that not everything is as bad as it seems and there's always light at the end of the tunnel...\\n\\n\r\nWhen I saw this anime only had 13 episodes I was kind of weary as from my experience with 12-13 episode drama's, they never seem to be able to get the story across in that short amount of time. Myself; Yourself managed to get the story across perfectly in such a limited amount of time. I managed to feel like I actually knew all of the characters and felt sad seeing them go through some of the stuff they went through. Myself; Yourself deals with some more heavy topics such as family issues, depression and even suicide. Not too many anime's like to try and cover some of these heavier topics as anime's like this tend to go unseen compared to the cute-fun anime's that has swept the anime industry. I really respect Myself; Yourself for taking on these topics and dealing with them in such a fitting way. Myself;Yourself shows that even if you're depressed or having problems, your friends will always be there for you to help you through it all... \\n\\n\r\nMyself; Yourself is one of the best anime's I have watched to date as it goes places very few anime's are willing to go, very few anime's are willing to take on controversial topics as they're afraid they might mess up and choose to take on the easier approach of making a cute and fun anime. I really hope we'll get more anime's like this one but for now i'll gladly re watch Myself; Yourself hundreds of times.",

            "content": "In all honesty I gathered a couple anime to watch during lunch breaks.  I actually confused this one with a different one, and kept thinking to myself this is actually interesting but not at all like what I thought it would be.  So in all honesty I can say I was very happy I watched this, and I actually have issues spoiling the story for myself but because I thought it was a different story that never happened.  I thought some of the plot was just to foreshadowed and was easy to spoil for myself.  That being said I did notsee the ending happen.  Though I will admit the last episode was very powerful, the last scene in it was unneeded.  There are some shows that are so open ended and leave so much to your interpretation that to solidify an ending you must show it.  This was not one, when the second to last scene ended you pretty much could have guessed.  My only thought was they added in the last scene to also be like \"Ow that is why they titled it that\".  Beyond all that though if you want something that will entertain you and does not require much thought to keep up with this is a good show for short breaks.  But I will say it got me twice, where in all honesty I see where you could have pieced it together but I did not.  I really enjoy it when I do not see the story before it unfolds.  I did get most of it but maybe just a bit off and I love that.  If you love that then I would recommend you watch this.",

A lot of the events were predictable based on the hints given away, by there were definitely moments that I never saw coming. I think it's a good time to pause, and evaluate the series as a whole.\r\nLet us start with the better aspects of the show. When it comes down to it, Myself;Yourself is great at getting you involved with the story. The staff create emotional pivots that lock your emotions in with the developments occurring on screen. Althoughvery predictable, it was all the more satisfying as events transpired.The characters were likable....well, I'll go over Aoi a little bit in the negative portion, but overall they had good backstories and were consistent. The animation was fairly standard, good, but nothing spectacular. Oh, and wow. Nanaka is amazing at violin! \\n\\n\r\nTisk, tisk, I must admit I was impressed by this series, but a few things chipped off some brownie points. Aoi was a decent character, but wow, she could really be annoying as hell. I found myself reciting words best left untyped at times when she was babbling on or making odd noises. The music was average to the series. The notable negative I can mention for it was the sound of a ... recorder? It was like 5th grade all over again. There was certainly room for more progression and development was well.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it into perspective, Myself;Yourself is a super deep and engaging work that will leave you deep and emotionally touched. It's a great coming of age drama/romance with deep backstories. Give it a whirl or at least an add to the plan to watch list! \\n\\n\r\nA grand total 8/10 Wrist Watches.",

            "content": "Good points that got me:\r\n1. episode titles kinda catch you off guard: \"Good Luck! Animenger!\" when I knew this show is definitely a heavy hitter, emotional wise, but the lightheartedness was definitely on purpose. Also, \"confession\", seriously I thought the protagonist is finally confessing, but it's not JUST the confession of love, but something heavy yet understandable mixed in.\r\n2. screen time for Aoi san/chan. Not just a yapper/side joke/ditz character, but she really is kind.\r\n3. Aoi-san's mother got the best lines. The eternal narrator voice-over guy was in this show -> boosts fun factor by 9,000. (narrator for Hayate no Gotaku) The show has manynon-serious side to it, but not off putting. They actually make you laugh even when some of them are cliche. Because I totally believe in the situation that this could happen. \\n\r\n4. a feel of everyone is a main character. The little kid's arch, the twins arc, the weird hair girl's arc. yet still maintain a lead character so the story feels more like in the first person perspective. \\n\r\n5. a sense of something strange is going on but it's not bursting. this subtleness makes it easy for the audience, AND the character to be able to feel confused, making chances for mis-communications and thus conflicts and stories. Red herrings and truth mixed in one bag. \\n\r\n6. following up with the strangeness, the show resolves everything it proposed. In sometimes an extremely concise fashion. One line, or a look, a slip of tongue, a gesture. \\n\r\n7. devils in the detail/contrast. connecting previous established rule and apply new meanings is a great technique in hooking the audience. In the first couple of episodes, weird haired girl and the main dude were seen and misunderstood by Nanaka, and later on, the weird haired girl did something similar to what Nanaka did. What irony. Also in teacher's caramel, and later a role reversal in the twins arc. \\n\r\n8. Contrast. related to 7, one way to apply the technique is thru contrast. Opening sequence is the school festival with them all dancing and singing. Well, there's contrast with that and the show. Additionally, music is definitely an element that connected them all from the beginning till the end. I wish they had done the gold ribbon thing in the first episode at the end too. \\n\r\n9. There are so many moving pieces and yet the show was able to show them in one fell swoop and nothing felt really out of timeline or out of place. I should watch it again to see if there's any though.\\n\r\n10. the show's animation style puts me at ease, not too busy, not that bright, with the everyday cloudy grayish kind of look - perfect for a slice of life.. ahh, i mean, a drama. \\n\r\n11. no outright fan service. I say this despite the fact of the first episode when Aoi showed up and the five second bikini line up. This is a pretty serious show and it treats all its characters with due respect. \\n\r\n12- a bit rushed. Now this is a good point, combining with how I watch the series in three days. It kept up with my pace.\\n\\n\r\nsome points that annoyed me:\\n\r\n1- weird haired girl's arc. Not sure why would she do it in front of the main dude. Also in little kid's arc, why does the main dude get all the attention?\\n\r\n2- seriously can the little brother's blushing BE more annoying? \\n\r\n3- more BMG perhaps? I really want to hear more Nanaka's violin. Reminds me of G senjo no maou. \\n\\n\\n\r\nQuick MAL rundown:\\n\r\nstory - 8. Enjoyable. Best thing is they resolved everything. \\n\r\nart - 8 . not everyone's cup of tea but it's relaxing for me. \\n\r\nsound - 5 well there's barely any.\\n\r\ncharactet - 9. it's not about how I love this or that character (aoi: blue sama i get it now lol). but how the characters are presented and the lines they say, man i love the subtle and succinct method of molding characters. seems very natural. \\n\r\nenjoyment - 10. I ran through the whole show in three days. For reasons explained above, this is a very enjoyable show. I might buy the DVD and study them later. \\n\r\nOverall - 9. well, 10 is Monster, Madoka, and this show gets 9. To be honest I like more of the technical aspect of the show then the product. Umm, still a 9.",

I would give it a 8.5, but you cant give a half score so it will be a 8.\r\nStory: This is where the Myself; Yourself both stands out and fails in, though the story is not all too special in the beginning, they reveal more and more interesting pasts of the characters. Unfortunately, the ending was what did it in, they builtup the suspense and drama for the end, but didnt have anything that really wowed me, its like loading a giant firework, lighting the fuse, and it just kind of disappears, no giant awesome explosion or anything... for the story, you can feel that it is being rushed, especially near the end. it would have done much better if they didnt end it the way they did and made it a full 24-26 ep season instead of a half season series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Nice colorful environments and the level of detail for the background is very good, on rare occasions, you can notice that theres something in the art that is a little off if you pay very close attention to the art, but there is nothing really noticeable normally.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I liked the opening and the closing theme songs, however there are points once in a while where the BGM didnt really fit too well with the mood...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Though most of the characters are generic anime romance personalities, I thought they worked quite well together, though they dont get very many points on being very original on character development...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I thought it was well worth watching, though in the end the ending will most likely upset many viewers. Watching the story progress was quite entertaining, and if you take out the fact that the ending was rushed and out of character, its a great romance anime.",

Not only did I like this show, but I could relate; that really sold me on it. In order to really like a romance, I need to cry and cry I did. \r\nI'd say a 9/10 for story. The story could've been slightly better for sure. The build up was a lot slower at first, and relied more on comedy than the plot; they fixed that over time. They dida decent job at bringing it together in 13 episodes.  I could definitely feel for it, but it took awhile to get there. It would have had a 10/10 story rating if there were more feels. \\n\r\n7/10 on animation. This is all about personal preference, and personally I'd say it's pretty standard for what it is. I could see similarities between Clannad and Chaos;Head art styles. I liked it, but it's not exactly the best art I've seen.\\n\r\n8/10 on sound. I liked the OP and liked the ending even better (then again, I'm a Kanako Ito fanboy). The music played during the show itself wasn't really prominent though. If that were better, it would get a better rating. \\n\r\n7/10 on characters. The characters could have been done a hell of a lot better. It seemed they rushed character development in the latter half of the show. Some argue that they didn't develop the characters enough, and that it was hard to connect because of this; I somewhat disagree. I could get a feel for them through their interactions and what was shown. There definitely would have been more feels if character development was more of a focus, for sure. I was fine with it as was though. \\n\r\n10/10 enjoyment. I really enjoyed Myself;Yourself as a rom com. It did everything right in my opinion. There was decent comedy, struggles, and romance. It had a conclusion. That's better than a lot of rom com VN adaptations. \\n\r\n10/10.\\n\r\nI liked it.",

I felt as though there was a little bit of filler, or at least I didn't feel as though the episode in question had any real bearing upon the totality of the story. My dilemma with the story was that it started slow and ended fast so the pace was quite off but I think the melding of those moments of lightheartedness with those of gloom offset my complaint about the pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6 - Overall the art wasn't something special to me but I think more than the art, there were certain moments which were brilliantly drawn, mainly the flashbacks and being a not very detail oriented person, I didn't notice anything that was out of the ordinary with the style of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6 -  I think the voice acting was decent although the change in puberty for one of the characters was a little bit exaggerated. The OP and ED were alright although I prefer the OP much more than the ED. I absolutely hated Aoi's voice .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7 - I definitely enjoyed the characters and honestly, there isn't much I found that was disagreeable with me in the characters. I think they did a pretty good job with developing the back stories of the characters except for like one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 - It was an alright anime overall nothing too special, and I think that's only because I saw AnoHana before I saw this. I think the least enjoyable part of the story was the ending or just how the ending was put forth. It didn't really match the rest of the story, well at least the presentation didn't. \\n",

Romance, love this anime is really strong in these factors but with all kinds of love, you will find out. This is not a harem/ecchi but focuses strongly on romance.

The ending wasn't the best though. It seemed kind of rushed (time skip was kind of random) and left a couple of questions unanswered (like what happened to Suusuke and Shuri??)that will probably remain unanswered. I'm not sure if they're answered in the visual novel or not because I have not played this one.This show could've done a lot better if they had a bit more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe artwork was pretty good.

            "content": "Contains mild spoiler.\r\nAnimes based on visual novels have the potential to be extremely bad, and cliched. Myselfl; Yourself fortunately dodged a few bullets. For starters, it didn\u2019t go into the harem genre (where all girls are into the same ordinary guy for no understandable reason). It is not an overly original anime, but it has its very own interesting plot. Are the characters and situations cliched? Sure. Is the story that bad? No. It is an anime about romance, where one relationship blossoms as the protagonists come to terms with traumatic life events.\r\nThis anime deserves credit for being quite realistic despite its dramatic plot points.Out of the four lead females, only one is actually in love with Sana. Others are good friends of his. Two have a different love interest. I found this very refreshing. Although this anime focusses on the relationship between Sana and Nanaka, it is really about their group of friends, and how friends need to be there for each other. I was touched by the strong feelings of friendship uniting Sana and his friends just as much as I was touched by his romance with Nanaka.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complain would be that the pacing was not the best, but it wasn\u2019t the worst either. The first episodes develop slowly, while the last few episodes unload all the dramatic potential of the series. I would say it is definitely worth watching until the end, otherwise you don\u2019t get a story out of this anime. Plus, the art is nice, so it shouldn\u2019t be too painful to watch 13 episodes. All in all, it is a pleasant anime that you can watch with confidence if you want a sweet romance with heart wrenching drama and lovable characters. It looks a little bit like School Days, but unlike School Days, this one takes a perfectly fine watchable-material route. The only danger is that it might bore some people :)",

If only they would atleast added one more episode and  disregard the 10 years time skip, this anime would be a huge success.  \r\nArt 10/10\r\nthere is nothing more to say regarding the artuse in this anime.

Nanaka being tsudere from the beginning of the story\\n\r\n2. girl to girl feeling\\n\r\n3. incest???( not sure if it really does)\\n\r\nThis just a personal reason, this really doesn't affect my views of the anime series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nIt is really enjoyable but not as enjoyable as some of the anime I've watch before(e.g. Toradora, anu natsu de materu) giving me the reason to give it a 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nIt is definitely a good anime but not the best. I would say the problem would be only at the last episode.

A remake would be fixing the last episode.\\n\r\nSEQUEL??? I guess not, the anime concluded well though it is rush but i would love to watch if there will be a sequel to this.\\n\r\nOVA??? Why not, the ova should be about the last episode or what happen between the 10 years time skip.\\n\\n\r\nhope this helps :D",

They tell enough around the start to give you an understanding and then little by little you learn a bit more at the perfect pace.  The art is very nice too look at and I think the voice acting is splendid.  In conclusion I do not regret watching this Anime at all and I strong encourage others to give it a try.",

They manage to keep the mstery during the entire developemen of the anime, but the pace is a little disturbing; they work nicely with time changes, but seem to have a hard time working with the way things happen in the present time.\r\nArt (8): I've no complaints with the art, don't understand why blood is black, but that's all heh.\r\nSound (8): The music is very well fitting, specilly the opening. Overall thesound was ok, but Aoi's voice turned a bit annoying if she talked too much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6): The characters by themselves are very nice, yet, the way they react at certain times of the anime seem a bit unrealistic. Also, there's a strange excess of development in supporting characters that could have been used to develop more of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6): Ok, the story was ok and the suspense was nicely kept, but I certainly would have enjoyed more character development and less unnecesary ecchi hints, those are too over rated in this kind of animes...\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7): The story improves as it develops and starts leaving behind the fillers. Again, if you enjoy drama and the mystery behind people's actions, you'll probably enjoy Myself, Yourself.",

Other than those interesting details, the story maintains those little sub stories that we're all too familiar with to add dramatic affect.\r\nOverall I give this 8/10, its not a groundbreaking anime unless this is the first drama you've everwatched.",

It's like a bad soap opera met an anime.  \r\nLike a bad teen romance soap.\r\nTo start, the characters are terrible.  The constant change of personality, obvious bending of character traits to fit the story; the list goes on.  This has a drastic impact on the story, as well.  The story, though, is almost impossible to follow half of the time.  Every episode brings a different story to it, only carrying certain things through to the next episodes.  Thepassing of time is completely unknown aside from day and night, so this could occur in days or months; I don't know.  The art and sound was decent enough.  Not 5 centimeters per second good, but passable.  It kept me watching through all the episodes, but only because it managed to somewhat keep my attention.

            "content": "To start off with, I entered this series because of a promised \"Childhood Friend Romance\". I got WAY more than anticipated. WAY more.\r\nStory 6/10: It starts out cliche and boring. Outright generic. But then it picks up pace around Episode 5 and shows it's \"true\" colours. Not to say that it wasn't hinted or foreshadowed in the first 4 episodes, but it starts to actually pick up the pace into something reasonable. For comparison the first 4 episodes are paced like an extremely long-running series. They get virtually nowhere unless you look at the bigger picture. The rest is paced as a normal 12-ish episodeanime. Which means there is 4 or so wasted episodes that could have been properly used.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10: Black Blood. Otherwise self-explanatory.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: The sound was fair, but fell into some major annoyances at some (mostly) remote instances. Most of the problems with sound stem from Aoi's insufferable voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: A diverse cast that generally gets a good amount of screen time each. Sometimes some useless side-characters or people of no importance got screen time, but so be it. Characters:\\n\\n\r\nSana - Indecisive and foolish main character, gets himself together when he starts to understand whats going on rather than agreeing to everything.\\n\\n\r\nNanaka - Broken goods. Hair-trigger PTSD.\\n\\n\r\nAoi - Earsplitting voice that plays no major role despite being a main character?\\n\\n\r\nShusuke - Sana's best friend. Has a twin sister and an abusive, conceited father who marries a cheating gold-digger. Protective of his twin sister for \"reasons\" and frequently takes beatings from his father meant for her.\\n\\n\r\nShuri - Shusuke's twin sister. Tomboy. Needlessly spiteful towards her father and moreso the gold-digger he married. As in, unjustifiably spiteful. Her reasoning is completely biased towards herself and childish \"You're not my mom!\" based arguments.\\n\\n\r\nHinako - Unimportant side-character that disappears as fast as she came. Is a 10/11 year old who has a crush on Shusuke. 10 years later she seems to be dating a 15 year old highschool student at the age of 20, simply because he resembles her first love. Statutory rape anyone? Mind you she looks like a highschool student by reasoning of being a washboard-Loli.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: This is where things are debatable between different viewers. On some notes the stories for each characters are relatively well done. On other notes, some viewers can be turned off by quite a few events that are unpleasant to watch or implying \"taboo\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: Could have had a much better ending. Most of it was only implied. Most of what turns people off about the ending are 3 things that imply whats going on, but don't 100% confirm it. The viewers basically know with what's given, but for whatever reason they didn't outright confirm anything by being vague or purposely omitting information that by all means should be there.",

It stays focused on the main characters, so you get to understand some of the dynamics of each person and between the characters. There is somewhat of a \"train wreck\" ending, but not completely. Some loose ends were left perhaps in the event of a second season, but that seems unlikely at this point.\r\nThe problem with series, and the main reason why I only gave it 4 stars, is that many of the main dramatic events in were so unbelievable that the story began to lose its credulity. I thinkits OK to have one or two shockers in a story line, but this story has them by the barrel-ful and at some point it just becomes exhausting. Still, it was an enjoyable, bittersweet story, but it will probably leave you unsatisfied at the end.",

            "content": "Fifteen year old Sana returns to the town where he grew up, after spending five years away and is reunited with his childhood friends. While he finds that dorky Aoi and twins Syusuke and Syuri are much the same, the once sweet and shy Nanaka has become cold and withdrawn. He also meets a cute fellow student named Asami, and a brattish elementary school student called Hinako. All of these characters experience a certain amount of character development, with the exception of cheerful Aoi who simply remains a fun comic element throughout. The dark story lines that develop in the second half add some depthto the romantic comedy elements and don\u2019t really jar. There\u2019s plenty of emotion and drama, although it may be too much for some (not me, I like melodrama!) and when the plot twists aren\u2019t predictable, they do tend a little towards the ridiculous. I was a little disappointed with the ending \u2014 while I quite liked the reveal of a certain mystery, the episode was rushed and the epilogue didn\u2019t really seem to add anything.\\n\\n\r\nVisually it has a typical anime style (complete with big eyes and unnatural hair colours and styles) but it expresses itself well, and at times the colouring is very pretty. The music is pretty good, with a catchy OP and some suitably dramatic incidental music.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like fanservice-filled romantic comedies and want to see something with a little more depth and seriousness, this is definitely worth a try. It doesn\u2019t succeed in all areas, but it does have something unique about it.",

He then returns 5 years latter and meets up with his friends Aoi,Wakatsuki Twins and then when he meets the girl he really liked she has changed so much he doesnt reconise her and gets a SLAP.\r\nI was in WOW mode (not world of warcraft lol ), the characters were good and the background infomation was good too. The music for the OP was average but the ED theme was AMAZING its so catchy and though the anime the music used for tension was great too.\r\nthe story was quite good but with a 12episode series it went too quick and the ending was mega-rushed, although i can't give any spoilers the ending is terrible not because of an incedent but due to the way it was rushed, during the anime i was thinking this could be an &quot;Underdog&quot; but it just got worse with time.",

            "content": "I had to put a pause on this anime around episode 4 so please keep that in mind if I for got anything. I overall did enjoy Myself;Yourself, it was a nice change of pace, and story altogether compared to all the other anime I have watched that usually have the same stereotypical stories, and endings. \r\nand despite what I have said over 10 times in this review the anime is not as dark as I say it is, however it is darker than most anime I am used to so for me it is fairly dark, although I still really enjoyed it.\r\nStory\r\nThe story initself is very dark for the most part in my opinion, now that being said there are the happy times in play. When Sana moves back he reunited with his old friends, and from that point everything is very happy, until an incident happens that causes a little drama and from this point I feel it was a roller coaster ride, with something new to add into play each and every episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThis may just be me, and I didn't look at dates these anime were made so excuse me about that but I feel whenever I am watching a dark anime there is normally this kind of art, I have no idea why I am using this as an example, but I find this art makes everything seem more real and set on a more personal level.  This may not make sense, however I hope most will understand what I mean. I feel this art just makes everything stick out more, and so we are not always focusing on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the opening, not as much as others, but it was okay. I even listened to it more than once while watching the series, the violin music was also very nice, I especially enjoyed the song that she played for sana. The background sound normally fit into what it was being played for whether it be a dark and depressing moment or a happy and cheerful one, although I didn't really pay much attention, as I don't normally. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nNow the character development was amazing, all characters had a backstory, and I guess you coud say problem, although some more dark than others. I do wish some of the back stories weren't as rushed, and we had a little more development I still find it was a decent character development for a 12 episode anime, had it been 24 episodes we could have seen a little more, and maybe had a little cleaner ending. (not to say it wasn't good)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\nNow as I stated at the top I did have a pause on the anime for a short time, because of me not really enjoying it. When I sarted again and passed episode 5 I believe it was I started enjoying it much more, because the plot was getting a little thinker in a sense, I really did enjoy this anime. I enjoyed the happy times and the sad times.  Although there are some weird things that happened that I was very confused about, they pushed the story. Now back on topic I overall enjoyed the anime very much. 8/10 for being a little different and original. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI overall enjoyed it as stated, I would recommend anyone to give this anime a try, unless you can't stand sad or depressing anime. I believe this is my first review unless I did one that I forgot about, but that being said please excuse the crappiness of it.",
