            "content": "\"I don't do anything I don't have to. What I have to do, I do quickly.\"\r\nFor most people, the short years spent in highschool are often the turning point and highlight of their lives; a time filled with introspection and change, where some dreams end and others are born to take their place. On the other hand, there are some who reject this notion and choose to spend their days as uneventfully and routinely as possible, never straying too far from their comfort zone and established lifestyle. After all, why waste the energy on trivial matters?\r\nOreki Houtarou is one of these individuals. \r\nSet during thedull and grey life of Oreki's first year in highschool, the story begins with an important change to his individual status quo \u2014 the joining of the school's Classics Club, albeit out of obligation rather than choice. Receiving a letter from his older sister asking him to join the club to keep it from being disbanded from lack of membership, he solemnly accepts his duties and sends in a club registration form, which appropriately causes surprise for his close friend Satoshi. For an individual uninterested by studying, sports, and socalizing, joining a club can be an arduous and painful ordeal. And indeed, if not for a certain girl immediately joining the club, Oreki could very well have maintained his status quo of living dully and freely. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps change isn't always a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nThis changing force is Chitanda Eru, serving as the contrast to Oreki's behavior. Shortly after their first exchange, Chitanda drives Oreki into a set of mysteries involving the club and its later two members, a repeated occurence often instigated by her eyes lighting in excitement and being followed by her catchphrase, \"I can't stop thinking about it!\". These mysteries are what form the bread and butter of the story, so it's a fortunate thing then that the mysteries themselves are varied; involving fairly interesting situations such as a room being locked or ghost sightings during a hot springs trip, and trivial events such as why a student was suddenly called to the office after school. No two mysteries are the same, and while several of the episodes are independent stories, three distinct arcs constitute the bulk of the episodes and the development of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately (and not so fortunately) the fairly lighthearted formula established in the self-contained stories is mostly reversed into something more dramatic and serious in the main story arcs once things finally get heated. It provides a refreshing contrast between the two and prevents things from feeling too repetitive or stale. Problems unfortunately come as a result  with this change in tone, however. The dialogue can sometimes come across as being cheesy with overdramatized and exaggerated reactions to some of the events, such as  Chitanda gasping in shock like the world has just ended when a book is missing from the clubroom, Oreki yelling and giving a death glare when his senior manipulates him a little bit, or the other three members of the Classics Club treating Oreki as some kind of savant for solving what are often very simple mysteries. Considering the trivial and often lighthearted nature of these mysteries, the overdramatization in the script is something that stands out as being very inconsistent with the overall tone of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw exists with the mysteries themselves, and those watching the series primarily for that aspect are very likely to find themselves disappointed or bored, especially with the self-contained stories whose mysteries are often so trivial and juvenile that they are more equivalent to a curious question than anything else. They lack the depth necessary to truly become something well-written and engaging, and have very little in common with the mystery novels that the anime frequently references. Though these mysteries don't qualify as being bad, they're mostly mediocre and certainly don't stand well on their own. Instead, much of the appeal and enjoyment of Hyouka comes from the relationship between the characters and their interactions with one another.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the dynamic between Sherlock Holmes and Watson, three of the main characters in Hyouka each fill a specific role in the club: Chitanda instigates the mystery, Satoshi provides information, and Oreki deduces. While the early episodes may give an impression of this being formulaic, the characters soon break from the mold and begin to do things that don't strictly pertain to their accepted role and behavior. For example, Oreki may decide to instigate the mystery himself or in one specific case Satoshi attempts to be the one to unravel and deduce. One main character even ends up being the culprit in one episode which makes for a fairly surprising conclusion.  \\n\\n\r\nLuckily, there's enough substance to their interactions that they come across as normal human beings rather than simple stereotypes, though Chitanda's eccentric traits and curiosity are often exaggerated for comedic effect. The characters all show a wide spectrum of emotion and get disappointed or angry depending on the situation (despite problems with the aforementioned overdramatization) or joke around and playfully criticize one another when things are going well. What mainly shines, though, is Oreki's and Chitanda's relationship, stemming from how heavily their personalities and behavior contrast with each other. Seeing him react and deal with her curious and capricious behavior always makes for some endearing and amusing scenes, with blushing and romantic moments abound.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, none of this would be very interesting in the first place if these characters didn't stand out by themselves or possess any distinguishing qualities. It's thanks to the writers' aptitude that the main characters undergo a considerable amount of development over the course of the series, resulting in something that is fundamentally more complex and dynamic. The majority of this development is focused on the protagonist, Oreki, as his dull life slowly changes into something more colorful and vibrant. At the start he's very reluctant to expend energy on anything that isn't absolutely necessary which is what causes him to repeatedly rebuke Chitanda for roping him into these situations. Mainly a result of the enjoyable time he has with Chitanda and the Classics Club, Oreki begins to realize that being involved and competent with something might not be such a bad thing after all. He starts to willingly pursue these mysteries through his own effort and curiosity, without the need of Chitanda urging him to investigate. For a person so bent on doing nothing with his days and conserving all time and energy possible, it's only natural for the rest of the club members to point out his change in behavior.\\n\\n\r\nChange isn't only evident in Oreki, though, as Chitanda, Satoshi, and Mayaka also experience it to varying extents. In particular, Satoshi \u2014 often serving as the comic relief \u2014 becomes unsatisfied with his role and lack of recognition in comparison to Oreki. For several episodes he trails off into the mystery by himself in a mostly unsuccesful effort to duplicate or better Oreki's deductive skills. The jealousy being portrayed in some scenes is a somewhat unneeded and perhaps cliche, but this arc in the story provides a pleasant change to Satoshi's character and   is successful in fleshing him out much more than in the early episodes. The second-to-last episode takes this further as well with even Satoshi understanding his change and becoming happy with his new lifestyle. Mayaka also gets some much needed screentime during the third arc which involves her status in the Manga Society club and her relationship with its members, with the outcome of this sidestory being something fairly satisfying and conclusive. Chitanda on the other hand changes surprisingly little over the course of the series though perhaps it's for the best. After all, she fills a necessary and important role in the story as the foil of Oreki and catalyst for his change and development. If Chitanda wasn't her usual self, where would Oreki be?\\n\\n\r\nNow, there's one thing that can be agreed upon in regards to Hyouka, and that is that Kyoto Animation has made this show absolutely stunning visually.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of Hyouka is one of the most outstanding aspects about the series. Mood and atmosphere is set by the prominent lighting and by the events and monologues which are heavily stylistic and surprisingly abstract at times, occasionally taking the viewer away from the normality of the situation and into a place much more surreal.  There's a distinct visual element present in Oreki's thought process with the layer of each mystery being carefully mapped out to the viewer, which serves not only to make the mystery more clear but to provide a much more immersive experience than the characters simply speaking to each other. Some scenes also possess a very dreamlike quality, with a couple particular examples including Chitanda's first inquisitive moment which succeeds in captivating Oreki or the dozens of little curious Chitandas crawling and tugging on him in the sixth episode. This type of dichotomy between the normal and the abstract is what makes Hyouka a very unique experience.  \\n\\n\r\nThe underlying animation and designs are also phenomenal. KyoAni has long been lauded for the standard of detail and animation set in their works and this is taken even further with Hyouka, with the entirety of the anime feeling very much movie-quality throughout of all its episodes. The realistic and lifelike movements of the characters is praiseworthy but what stands out most is the focus on eyes and facial expressions. The characters of Hyouka are easily some of the most visually expressive seen in an anime for quite some time. Even the side or background characters receive much of the same detail to animation and character design, making nobody seem bland or the derivative of another. It's surprising then that KyoAni managed to keep to this level of quality for all 22 episodes, with no noticeable decrease visual nor artistic quality. The seemingly limitless attention to detail here is really something commendable. \\n\\n\r\nBut it's not all about visuals technically, either. Hyouka boasts a very fitting and eloquent soundtrack that accentuates the atmosphere set by the visual design. Composed mostly of classical tunes and eerie or quizzical melodies, the music is what creates the inherent sense of intrigue within Hyouka. It perfectly manages to capture the principal feeling of mystery in both the relaxed and dramatic moments of the series, never feeling overbearing nor out of place. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Hyouka does fall short of some of its potential due to issues with the script, but what the anime lacks in mysteries it more than makes up for with its characterization and presentation. It's just a bit of a shame that many people will choose to write the anime off and treat it as something weak and disappointing because the mystery aspect didn't hold up to their expectations. A misconception exists where people treat Hyouka as a strictly mystery title, and while it does hold true to some extent, these mysteries are instead used to develop the characters and have them interact in a remarkable manner, distinctive manner. This is an anime that essentially amounts to mundane events presented in a stylized and intriguing way. For those looking for something fresh in an age of uninspired rom-coms and homogeneity, Hyouka is a title that is easily worth your attention. \\n\\n\r\nThere's this sweeping notion that deep and action-oriented storytelling is necessary for a quality experience, but titles like Hyouka can safely disprove that line of thought.",

            "content": "Mod Edit: Review may contain spoilers.\r\n-----------\r\nAlright folks, let's talk some Hyouka. Time to exercise your brains and turn that curiosity light bulb ON. \r\nHyouka (also the same name of the first volume of the Classic Literature Club that's also a implied term of \u201cIce Cream\u201d) is an anime series adapted from the mystery novel written by Honobu Yonezawa. The story? Well, if you're curious like a certain purple eyed girl in the series, Hyouka details the Kamiyama High School's Classic Literature Club and its members having fun while solving mysteries and enjoying the time of their boring lives. \r\nIt all begins with the unenthusiastic youngboy by the name of Oreki Houtarou. He is the type of guy that is hard to make friends with because Oreki in his minds and his friend describes him as someone who is not keen in joining clubs, play sports, or socializing. Despite this, he is very intelligent and observant of the tinest events as well as having an insightful intuition. After joining the club reluctantly by his elder sister, the mysteries, fun and, Hyouka stories begin. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, Hyouka wouldn't be much fun without the other members of the club, right? We have the calm and happy girl with the keen curiosity. With those large purple moe eyes, she is curious about various events and mysteries that often involves others and goes \u201cwatashi kininarimasu!\u201d (I'm curious!). She is a fun and happy go girl who despite being annoying at times brings the fun and entertainment in the story. On other hand, there's her best friend Mayaka Ibara who calls her affectionately \u201cChi-chan\u201d. Mayaka is sort of the opposite of Chi-chan as she seems to be the type of girl who wants to avoid confrontations and if possible, end it as peacefully and swiftly as possible. Last but certainly not least is Satoshi Fukube. He's the happy guy who is carefree about life but deep down a great guy as he cares about others' well being. With a powerful memory, he is a useful as well as a compatible partner of Oreki who balances out the cheerfulness and moody mood of the duo/club. \\n\\n\r\nNow at this point, you might be as curious as Eru Chitanda herself or even had a thought of \u201cwatashi kininarimasu!\u201d on whether the series is worth to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the arcs and story is well crafted. Detection fiction stories involving a group of friends is never new in the anime industry. Series such as Detective School Q, Heaven's Memo Pad, and Spiral: The Bonds of Reasoning also have such elements. What makes the series more interesting seems to be the interactions between the four main members of the club with each other that goes beyond the typical mysteries. The actors plays their roles well with their voice acting that reflects the personalities of the characters. With nearly all the characters having different characteristics, it's amusing to see how they all get along in the club. Surprisingly though, it actually does work well. But of course adaptation an anime always has its problems of the script not flowing or losing its touch in some of the filler like episodes. Personally though, it works out fine.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the series takes place at a school life setting, there are other characters in Hyouka that interacts with the club. These are often included in some of the mysteries and requires the clubs' various skills to crack that case. \\n\\n\r\nIf animation was part of a popularity poll this year, Hyouka would take the grand prize. Kyoto Animation (Clannad, K-On!, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) does a pretty damn good job with its production quality and that's not an understatement. I remember watching the first episode and the first thing that popped into my mind was \u201cwow, that animation is out of this world!\u201d No but seriously, the production quality is top notch and Kyoto Animation does not disappoint. It even includes word play illustrated in the minds of Oreki and some of the other characters during cases to depict clues in a more realistic way of telling the story. With its gorgeous artwork and beautiful style of presenting the characters, it goes on without say that \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is smooth that is well coordinated. When a mystery case scene is presented, the soundtrack flows. When a comedy scene (usually involving our curious girl Eru Chitanda), an OST of rhythm is played. Even when Oreki is bored, it shows that he really is bored through the soundtrack. Talk about unenthusiastic. The two opening songs are also well orchestrated in the series. The first OP song, \"Yasashisa no Riyuu\" by Choucho presents a smooth flowing song that gives us a lighthearted feeling of Hyouka. The second OP song \"Mikansei Stride\u201d by Saori Kodama presents a more humorous way of the series with Oreki peeking around with curiosity himself. (somewhat similar to Medaka Box's Opening). And of course, the ED songs are also there to make us feel the mystery. Well, not exactly. The first ED song seems to be quite naughty to say the least. Chitanda and Mayaka in those curious positions?! Turn that imagination bulb ON. The second ED song though fits more within the mystery genre and is generally entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hyouka is one of those lighthearted series to watch by the end of a long weekend. The series does have flaws such as the the repetition in some of the intertwined arcs as well as mindless word plays that goes on in some episodes that can be bothersome to watch. Chitanda's signature phrase \u201cwatashi kininarimasu!\u201d is also infectious at times and gets annoying. Additionally, some of the mysteries are a bit dull and not realistic as it seems. If it's a real mystery, why not involve some real murders and crimes? Needless to say, it's why Hyouka is rated PG-13. \\n\\n\r\nHyouka is a school mystery series that involves...guess what, mysteries. If you're not into detective fiction or that sort of genre, then hit that drop button. No one is stopping you. But if you're curious like Eru Chitanda, then sit back, relax, and watch some mysteries as well as the members of the Classic Literature Club do what they do best at. \\n\\n\r\nCuriosity kills the cat but Hyouka is what kills the boredom.",

Are you looking for a mystery anime that has a badass detective? Are you looking for a mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat? Well look somewhere else. Because Hyouka isn't that kind of anime.\r\nStory-Hyouka revolves around a boy called Oreki Houtarou. An apathetic guy who has little interest in anything or anyone. His life motto is \"I don't do anything I don't have to. What I have to do, I do quickly.\" But when her older sister who lives inindia sends him a request to join the classical club to keep it from being shut down. He accepts, thinking that the club could be a good place to stay alone and conserve his energy. But his conservative life is in trouble as he finds out that the club is also occupied by A curious girl by the name by Chitanda Eru.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story and mysteries for this anime are well crafted. Most of the mysteries were interesting and enjoyable.But sadly, A few of the mysteries were poorly made and downright boring. Luckily, these mysteries are only a few and were rather short. There is also a good bit of romance and comedy in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Kyoto Animation is always praised for it's good art and animation. But Kyoto Animation decided to take Hyouka to another level in art. Hyouka is by far one of the most beautiful animes I've ever seen. The characters design is designed so well and fit with their personality almost perfectly. The backgrounds were created with such detail that it felt like I was watching an anime movie instead of a tv show. Movements are also fluid and small details like the wind blowing the character's hair is also greatly done. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The soundtrack fits the anime perfectly. From comedy to drama to the start of the mystery the soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and only brings more enjoyment to the viewer. The first and second openings are also great songs that went on my ipod after first listening to it. The two endings are also quite good for endings and I enjoyed them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Now the true reason this anime is so enjoyable is not only because of the mysteries.But also character interaction. In this anime we have four main characters. Oreki Houtarou, Chitanda Eru,Satoshi Fukube, and Mayaka Ibara. Three of the four people have different roles in solving a mystery. Satoshi is the database.Chitanda is the person who raises the question and opens the mystery, and Oreki is the person who solves the mystery. But these roles do change at times. Sometimes Satoshi would be the one to try and deduce the mystery, and Oreki would raise the question himself. Each character also goes through character development through the anime. Especially Houtarou. He develops to the point that even he gets a bit curious throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'll just say it right now. Hyouka is one of the best mystery animes for me. The mysteries are enjoyable. The character interaction was great.The animation phenomenal. Whats more there to say. I would definitely recommend this to people who love romance and mysteries. No, scratch that. If you like anime.Then definitely give this anime a try.",

            "content": "High school \u2013 It is probably not incorrect to suggest that this is the most ubiquitous setting for anime nowadays. Yet even amongst the endless swathes of high school anime that inevitably centre around cute high school girls, there are always exceptions and Hyouka is one of them.\r\nWe find ourselves in the Classic Literature Club of which Oreki Houtarou, our energy-conserving protagonist is reluctantly a member and is soon joined by his eclectic group of friends, thus completing the groundwork for this \u201cmystery\u201d anime.  When one considers what constitutes a \u201cmystery\u201d show, it is often associated with preconceptions of crime, horror and eerie suspensebut Hyouka is not your typical mystery show as it centralises on mysteries of little real-life consequence. These aren't mysteries whose resolution will lead to justice being carried out but mysteries whose consequence lies in how it affects our characters. Nonetheless, Hyouka excels at executing these mysteries and in an atypical manner, with each of our main characters bringing a unique perspective in solving these mysteries, making the process fascinating as we observe the quirky and unpredictable methodologies being used. \\n\\n\r\nHyouka does not have one unrealistically prodigious detective that can unravel and deconstruct even the most intricate of puzzles but a range of characters, some unique to each case, that all contribute key aspects leading to the solution. This makes for a more fulfilling and genuine resolution as you feel part of the process rather than a bystander in awe of some amazing detective. The solutions themselves are meticulously well-written and thus accurate and realistic yet simultaneously complex making you feel slightly more intelligent by the end of every one. Some may find the lack of ramification in the mysteries innately boring as the characters aren\u2019t actually usually directly involved in them, for they act for their own various reasons but they at least create a desire for you to solve them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what makes Hyouka so enjoyable is not the satisfaction of decrypting it all but the development of our 4 main characters throughout each one. Hyouka is an exemplar of how the high school slice of life genre could be achieved as the relationships between our characters are captivating yet incredibly realistic with each action remaining true to the psyche of high schoolers and the ways they make decisions. The pacing is slow but constant and we can see a smooth progression in the development of our characters which tackle real-life issues that high schoolers face but nonetheless in a Hyouka-esque fashion, usually amongst the mysteries. Besides the hyperbolised curiosity of our female lead, the dialogue is extremely genuine and for me at least, indistinguishable from your real life conversations with friends at school. As the characters interact more with one another and face their problems, we are shown a vast array of emotions and considerable depth to their actions and motivations which are relevant, accurately portrayed and likely to be issues that you yourself may have faced. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, Kyoto Animation (Kyoani) must be lauded for how brilliantly Hyouka is presented. The atmosphere is prominently compelling with both the visuals and the sound contributing vastly in creating a well-constructed universe that entirely fits Hyouka\u2019s quirkiness. The animation is also of the best I\u2019ve seen \u2013 be it the expressions, movements or the background/setting -they are all smoothly animated with appropriate lighting and colour palette to fit the tone of each episode. Hyouka\u2019s episodes are visually stunning to behold in particular when mysteries are being solved, as it involves the use of experimental animation that diverges completely from the usual crisp style to a tailor-made style suited for each different mystery. To top it off, complementing this is a fantastic soundtrack that consists of light instrumental pieces which further amplifies the ambience in each situation. The majority of the pieces share a \"playful mystery\" theme and whilst lacking in variety, the entire musical score is definitely a strong one that can instantly be identified as \"Hyouka's OST\" rather than forgettable music which lacks the identity of the show it aims to enhance.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I feel Hyouka is an excellent anime. For me, it fell slightly short simply due to the sense of incompletion in the way the show ends. I say no more to avoid spoilers but if you do watch it you may find out. If you\u2019re looking for a unique mystery or slice of life show whose fortes lie in its characterisation, production values and its take on the mystery aspect - this is one to watch. If you\u2019re however looking for a serious mystery (\u00e0 la Death Note) then this might not be for you as the satisfaction you receive derives from observing how these mysteries are solved rather than the fear of heavy consequences, and the impacts each one has on the development of our characters. Some anime attract an audience through heavy fanservice, others via an action-packed plot and others with a deep/profound plot. However, Hyouka is an anomaly. It shows us how even seemingly mundane things can be made fascinating. Whilst I obviously cannot guarantee you'll enjoy it, if you\u2019re looking for a distinctly novel anime experience in either mystery or slice of life, then I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading if you got this far!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, it tried, I'll give it that.\r\nHyouka, also known as \"Hyou-ka: You Can't Escape\" is the latest series by acclaimed studio Kyoto Animation, who, despite their huge fanbase, generally produce work of more style than substance. Hyouka unfortunately follows this trend, though superficially it doesn't fit in with the rest of KyoAni's back catalogue very much, as Hyouka is generally very dry in tone.\r\nHyouka is a mystery series, revolving around four high school students in the Classic Literature Club (an aimless club that happens to end up solving mysteries a lot). The students in question are main character Oreki Houtaro, whom I am about 99%certain has some form of autism. He has zero interest in socialising, fun, or... well, anything. He deliberately tries to live life as uninterestingly as possible. This is hampered a bit by him being insanely gifted at solving mysteries. This gift goes untapped until he meets Chitanda Eru, a plucky, cheerful girl with an insatiable curiosity who refuses to let the even the smallest of mysteries go unsolved. They are joined by Satoshi Fukube, a cheerful happy-go-lucky human database simply full of useless facts who is seemingly Oreki's only friend prior to the series, and Mayaka Ibara, a library assistant who's known Oreki since childhood, who is probably the most level-headed member of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nNow, remember how I said Eru refused to let even the smallest of mysteries go unsolved? Well... that's the big problem Hyouka has. The mysteries really are the smallest of mysteries. Each and every one revolves around a very trivial subject, and just about all of them could have gone unsolved without any real problems. Something so down to earth could in theory have been a good idea, but unfortunately Hyouka doesn't really deliver. As a result, Hyouka is, in a word... dull. With the exceptions of one or two mysteries, Hyouka totally fails to be entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBut that isn't to say they didn't go the extra mile to make Hyouka more interesting. KyoAni's huge animation budget is flexed quite a bit. Random quirks in the presentation show up every now and then when Oreki is explaining his theories, sometimes in rather trippy fashion. The unusual techniques in the directing aren't limited to these, though. Hyouka plays around with angles and closeups a lot, to try and make every scene more dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nWhile they occasionally spice up a scene a little bit, they really don't do much to save Hyouka from being very, very bland. And often, the harder they try, the worse it gets. It's most \"dramatic\" moments end up being, if anything, idiotic for how hard they're trying to sell something so insignificant.\\n\\n\r\nDirecting techniques aren't the only thing in Hyouka intended to spice things up, though. Character-driven subplots are also involved. All of Hyouka's cast members are likeable, if nothing special... though Oreki's disinterest with everything can be irksome, and Chitanda can be more saccharine than cute sometimes. Romantic subplots flare up between the characters, as well as some mild feelings of envy from Fukube towards Oreki, and these would all help a lot more if it wasn't for the fact that all of this goes absolutely nowhere and amounts to nothing. Just like the directing techniques, it's an attempt to spice it up that at best is a mild amusement, usually falls flat, and at worst, is simply idiotic.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that having been said, Hyouka is not bad. But it certainly is not good either. At the end of the day it is simply very average. But there are really much better wastes of your time out there than Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: For the biggest of mystery enthusiasts and diehard KyoAni fans only.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8/10\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\r\nActing: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: UN-GO, Gosick",

            "content": "At first, I really wasnt impressed. The characters, especially the two guys, talk as if they are hinting the deeper theme to each episode. That was a little unnecessary. I didn't mind the plot though. The trivialized version of mysteries interested me more than the big mysteries that are either too fake or too unreal. I understand that this might be disappointing for mystery fans, but I feel like hyouka is a breeze that can change the stagnant mystery genre. \r\nI honestly look forward to this a lot each week. I got used to the talkative characters and the lack of character development. There aresome changes in the main character so far, but I wouldn't say it's development. However, the literacy club itself is developing and moving forward as a whole. The club grew on me, so I began to see the characters less individualistically and probably accepted their way of talking. \\n\r\nThe animation and sound are pretty impressive. I like the animation style, especially when the main guy starts to solve the cases. It makes even the most trivial case interesting. The background music approprately fits each scene, and I find the ending especially cute. I understand this animation style has been used before in the past, and sometimes I even feel like its an act of stealing. I wouldn't forgive it if it's been used badly or didn't improve on it. However, it did improve on it, not in terms of style though, but in terms of where and how it's used. I don't like the idea of using creativity for its own sake. Some people may like it though, but I do not. Randomness, uniqueness, or craziness for me cannot stand alone. They are only for enhancement, not for the real substance. (Im excluding comedy on this one) I've offended some people and their love, but thats my belief. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that rather irrelevant detail, I want to talk lastly about the plot that made me fell in love with hyouka. Beside the obvious downplay, I think as a consequence, you can detect a trace of elegance in mystery solving. The art and sound helped too, but I think the elegance would have been lost if the cases were big scale murder cases or a national crisis because they would usually give away obvious hints, some distracting, and you would be too busy guessing the culprit. Hyouka involves the audience in another way. Hyouka makes sure that you can't guess logically until the guy solves it. Yes, you'll realize how stupid or trivial the solution turns pout to be and the story becomes anticlimactic, but isn't exactly this anticlimactic feeling telling you that it's reality? People like to cook things up, and the bigger the scandal, the bigger the followers. Reality is often trivial, grand in scale only in how trivially detailed it is. The elegance of hyouka is therefore how trivially detailed it makes the cases to be. In the anticlimactic conclusion, you might start to find the trivially detailed reality more interesting on its own.",

            "content": "I had looked at Hyouka a while back but saw a lot of negative reviews so decided to give it a miss and just recently picked it up due to a friend's recommendation. Having just finished episode 7 I feel that I can safely say I am glad to have decided to watch it.  I felt compelled to write a review to hopefully clear up some misunderstandings people might have about the series.\r\nI think the big thing that may disappoint some viewers has to do with their expectations going into it.  More specifically, the show is listed as a mystery and while thereis a mystery to be solved in every episode, the mysteries thus far have been very mundane in nature.  If you go in expecting a murder mystery type series, you should leave your expectations at the door or else you will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\n If I had to describe the shows genre i would be more inclined to describe it as slice of life as it follows the adventures of the classic literature club (which often feels more like a mystery club).  There is no real apparent overarching plot and the character development is fairly slow as each character's personality is revealed little by little  as we watch their day to day lives.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9 - The characters are nicely portrayed. While in many cases they are archetypes we are very familiar with, there is enough a personal quirk from them to not seem boring, rehashed or two dimensional.  While no character is especially standout, I feel the entire cast is well done and very likable and they all interact well with one another.  Specifically Chitanda and Houtarou are being fleshed out nicely, and play off each other very well.  It would be nice if Satoshi and Ibara got more attention, but it is still relatively early in the series and they are side characters, so it quite possibly coming in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9 - The art style is simple and clean, using a lot of soft colors.  The character designs are nicely done and the show does not have excessive fanservice.  The backgrounds are simplistic, but nicely rendered.  Overall I am definitely a fan of the art style; it differs enough from standard shows these days to have its own feel, but the style is not especially notable.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9 - the show is a slice of life show, there is little significant overarching plot. Ones satisfaction with the story really comes down to how compatible they are with slice of life shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7 - The soundtrack is simple and plays well with the scenes. It always enhances the scenes, but is not exactly standout.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 - I'm a big fan of slice of life shows and I'm finding Hyouka to be very enjoyable.  It is a simple, easy going show that is easy to watch.  It's not going to give you any deeper insights to life, but if you like the slice of genre it should be able to entertain you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Hyouka  is not a masterpiece as it lacks anything that truly makes it stand out as being above and beyond other shows.  That being said, it is still very well done, and quite a entertaining show to watch casually.",

            "content": "[Slight Spoiler Warning]\r\nHyouka is a slice of life anime that does a very good job of referencing famous mystery novel authors, yet fails to be a good mystery itself.  Hyouka is a Kyoto Animation show with a generic high school setting (of course) and features trade mark, cute, moe, animation.  I am not a huge fan at all of slice of life shows as they offer little to no substance plot wise but, I was oddly excited to watch this series because I am a huge mystery fan.  On top of this, I heard Houtarou was a very cool and laid-back characterthat resembled Kyon (Haruhi Suzimiya).  But, sadly, I was extremely disappointed after watching the show unfold with its dreadful pacing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:  \\n\r\nThe art here is very similar to other Kyo-ani shows such as K-On!.  It has that moe, cutsie style like K-On! and has very detailed backgrounds.  The colour tones of this show is what can be described as \u201clazy\u201d which relates very well to our main character.  The character designs were not too out of the ordinary either but, one note to make is that our main female lead, Chitanda, looked a little too much like Mio (black haired lead) from K-On!.  The animation was also very nice and fluid.  Overall, the art and animation were both solid while the character designs were a bit too generic. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAll of the opening and ending themes for this show were forgetful and boring.  The opening and endings sounded like generic pop music and I honestly skipped them most of the time.  The background music for this show was mixed.  Half of it was happy slice of life music while the other half was more mystery themed.  The mysterious background music playing while Houtarou did his deductions actually did a very nice job of making the mystery itself seem more suspenseful than it really was.  The other slice of life type music was not very memorable and actually wasn\u2019t played that often giving the show a more mysterious feel at times as well.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (this is where the bashing begins):\\n\r\nThe show features 4 main characters... first up, you have our main protagonist, Houtarou Oreki who is a laid back, lazy guy who likes to conserve as much energy as possible (by not doing anything).  This makes Houtarou very boring.  Houtarou is not special in the least; he doesn\u2019t have any interesting ideas or deep monologues and rarely provides comedic relief unlike other characters who are similar to him.  All Houtarou can do is solve mysteries and only does it (usually) when the main female lead forces him to.  That brings up another point about him; Houtarou believes in always conserving energy yet is always falling victim to Chitanda\u2019s pleas to solve pointless mysteries.  He can easily avoid this but, he doesn\u2019t, instead it seems like he grows feelings for her yet he continues keep up the charade of conserving energy which brings up yet another point.  He gets little to none character development.  During the film mystery arc, it had appeared that there would be some character development for him but, sadly, it lasts for about one episode and he goes back to being his old self again, never changing and never expressing his true self.  The next character, our female lead, is Eru Chitanda.  There is not much to say about her other than the fact that she is extremely annoying.  In the beginning, her curiosity was sort of cute but, after a while it really gets frustrating because all she ever does is get curious.  She is an airhead girl who apparently is, somehow, one of the smartest people in the school.  She doesn\u2019t provide much other than the occasional suggestion for a mystery, being Houtarou\u2019s master, and doing absolutely nothing.  The male side character, Satoshi Fukube, is your average overly energetic character, albeit he does have the most depth than anyone else in the cast.  He is constantly struggling with being better than his best friend, Houtarou, and also has some love issues with the female side character.  Though, none of this is actually that deep at all and it really just seems more melodramatic than anything e.g. they were crying over the fact that Satoshi broke some chocolate for Valentine\u2019s Day that the side female character made.  The last character is Mayaka Ibara (the female side character mentioned earlier).  There\u2019s not much to say about her, she\u2019s just a basic tsundere type character who really loves manga; doesn\u2019t provide much more than some manga club drama. \\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot:\\n\r\nThis is where Hyouka really fails miserably for me.  Basically, Hyouka is set up in a way where there are multiple mystery arcs and these mysteries are what the plot consists of.  The thing is, Hyouka starts off pretty strong with the first real mystery of the show (which is what the show is named after).  This mystery is more serious and more important than any of the other mysteries presented but, it only lasts about till episode 5.  After this one there are some other mysteries that are completely useless until we get to the film mystery.  This one was actually quite intriguing and suspenseful and it was fun trying to figure it out with the characters.  Disappointingly though, this is where all the good regarding Hyouka\u2019s mysteries and plot ends.  After this we are left with the big build up towards the crazy school festival.  Now this is what really bothered me about this show.  For 4 or so episodes we get no mysteries at all!  During this time all we see is \u201cfun times\u201d at the school festival and extremely slow build up/set up for the school festival mystery.  In fact, the mystery is solved in 2 episodes!  I wouldn\u2019t really say it was solved either since in those two episodes there was no deduction process by our main character, he just figured it out.  In contrast, during the film arc, it took the main character quite a lot of thought and effort (which we actually saw on screen) to figure out the mystery but, here we just see Satoshi trying (and failing) to solve it himself and then all of a sudden Houtarou solves it.  Even more frustrating is that, after this arc ended, the rest of the mysteries, I wouldn\u2019t even consider mysteries.  They were even more useless than the earlier more \u201cimportant\u201d big mysteries.  Basically, towards the end of the show nothing happens at all (this is about 5 or 6 episodes).  To top it all off, the series ends incomplete with no ending in sight and an open ended \u201cromance\u201d where Houtarou is too scared to actually admit his feelings.  Overall, some mysteries were very fun to watch (two or three) but, in the end most of them were completely useless and mundane.  Also, this mystery show stops showing mysteries for about 4 episodes just to build up to one lack luster conclusion for one bad mystery.  Other than the 3 main mysteries in the show, the rest is just useless with the main purpose of taking up space.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe art for the show is generic but, functional and the animation and detail is spot on.  But, the character designs are a little generic. The sound matches the different tones of the show at times and the music playing while the characters are trying to solve a mystery adds a very fitting feel to the show.  But, the opening and ending themes to the show are forgetful.  Overall, the aesthetics are fine.  The characters are dull and mostly generic with little to no character development.  Some of the mysteries in the show are fun to watch but, most of the show is filled with useless fodder that does nothing and is \u201csolved\u201d within one episode.  Also, the show stops for 4 episodes for a stupid school festival.  The story and characters mostly fail.  Overall, Hyouka is a mystery anime with more references to actual good mysteries than having good ones itself.  And for this reason I am utterly disappointed and feel since it didn\u2019t accomplish being good at what it was supposed to be that it is, in fact, worse than average.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10 :(\\n",

It has unpredictability and sometimes you wouldn't expect the things that did happen to happen. \r\nArt: Character designs and background are decent at least. KyoAni as usual does quite a good job with the anime they produce. The art is elaborate and makes you feel like the place is real.\r\nSound: Hmm Ihave to say i do like the OST's for this anime especially the opening ( probably coz im a fan of choucho though) I also find the voices to be decent ( especially Nakamura Yuuichi /o.o/) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters are interesting and although may be not to a very large extent, unique. For example, we get a male character who helps others occasionally, not really special. That male character has quite good deductive skills, maybe not so special but definitely not common. He doesn't like wasting energy unless absolutely necessary, quite special. When he helps others it's normally because he has to do it or he has to waste even more time later, definitely not common.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Definitely will help you kill some time when you're bored or want to watch something you should give it a try. It may seem a little plain at first but it slowly becomes more and more special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: First of all: confession. To be truthful i was rather skeptical when i started to watch this anime. After the 1st ep i thought it would be able to kill some time. Howerver, after watching 2-3 episodes i began to slowly find this anime more and more interesting and i can say now that while its not certain, this anime has potential to be the best anime this season and maybe even the best this year.",

            "content": "After reading some of these reviews explaining how amazing Hyouka is, I thought I should set the record strait.  Yes Hyouka has good art, likable characters, and does an excellent job explaining and executing idea's.  However, at the end of the day the lack of any sort of interesting story really takes a toll on the show.\r\n...THE GOOD...\r\nI'll start with the good because there is a lot of good in this show. \r\nART: for starters it's one of the better animated shows out there, the art is very well drawn, and they do a good job portraying the characters.  Though i feelbad that the artist's are being forced to draw such mundane settings all the time.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: surprisingly enough the characters are very likable.  I enjoyed Oreki, and how he contrasts with Chitanda.  In general these characters are well acted, and well played. They defiantly stand out from other anime characters in there own way.\\n\\n\r\nEXECUTION: If anime filler has taught us anything, it's proved that just because you have an Idea doesn't mean that you can execute it correctly.  Hyouka proves that it can execute an idea with precision and care, when explaining a mystery.\\n\\n\\n\r\n...THE BAD...\\n\r\nthere is really only one thing I can complain about and it's a big one.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT/STORY\\n\r\nto say that this story is boring would be incorrect because to be honest there is no story, it's just an ordinary kids life.  Now to be honest I am slightly biased here, I can't really understand peoples fascination with regular high school stories.  However, this go's beyond that because unlike in most anime's, were the characters are trying to achieve something of importance.  This show is literally dedicated to some of the most mundane mysteries i'v ever seen.  Might as well have made a show, about the mystery of how you tie your shoes because thats what the story feels like.\\n\\n\r\nNow look I'm not saying you need to the next fate zero here, with explosions, and sword fights but I do expect something to happen in the show.  Here is an example of which I am trying to explain, minor spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nEX: episode 3 o wow that kid was smoking SO INTENSE!!!!! \u201cpot\u201d would have made more sense. episode 2 who cares about a dam library book. episode 1 wow how did that door get locked \"it's a mystery\". \\n\\n\r\nnot since Shining Hearts: Shiawase no Pan (IE: all about bread) have I seen a show so dedicated to the most trivial things, no one cares why people have been taking the same library book out  \"\"\"NO ONE CARES\"\"\". \\n\\n\r\nI don't expect this kid to be solving murders, but give me something, give me anything that will let me say wow I actually care about this mystery.\\n\\n\\n\r\n...CONCLUSION...\\n\r\nthis is a love hate anime, it will draw people in because of it's interesting character's.  However, because It does not seem to be getting interesting any time soon I expect viewers to drop off in the long run.  The show can be summed up like this.  \"do you place more of an emphasis on how the story is executed, or do you place more of an emphasis on what the story is actually about.\"\\n\\n\r\nstory 3/10 poor\\n\r\nart 7/10 good\\n\r\nsound 6/10 fair\\n\r\ncharacter 8/10 very good\\n\r\nenjoyment 6/10 fair\\n\r\noverall 6/10 fair",

            "content": "The real mystery here, is how could anyone produce 22 episodes for one of the easily most boring animes this planet has ever known. Everyone rating Hyouka over six is either biased or just really illusive. No, I'm not trolling; keep on reading.\r\nHyouka is your typical slice-of-life anime that deals with a group of high school students living everyday with their school club surrounding their little, personal stories. Over 22 episodes, the main protagonist (Oreki) is a laid-back, bored, and unmotivated teenager who's been trying his hardest to \"conserve energy\" by doing the minimum in every aspect of his life. That includes facial expressions, too.He's got his happy-go-luck friend, a cute and naive classmate who is ideally the main love interest of the story, and her friend, too. Together, they solve mysteries that has been happening around the school.\\n\\n\r\nOnly, each episode (or most of them) that deals with a certain issue taking place on said episode is done really badly. The mysteries are so boring, I don't think anyone actually cared about them being solved. If you expected suspense of sorts or being somewhat intrigued, then parish the thought -- you won't find any of that here. Oreki is always the one to come up with the brightest solution to them and being the leader of the group whilst still being really uninterested in... well, any of it. \\n\\n\r\nYeah, I get it's slice-of-life, but there is practically nothing interesting about this anime whatsoever. The mysteries are boring and drag on and on, characters are likeable but really unrelateable, and even for the shippers of the main show -- neither Oreki or his love interest show any signs to each other whatsoever. If you thought you'd get anything in the ending, scratch that; anyone spoiling you what is happening in the last episode won't actually be spoiling anything, because /nothing/ happens there. Oops.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is beautifully crafted, drawn and animated, with very nice character designs, theme songs and what not -- but otherwise, the show is lacking, and lacking big. I really wanted to love this anime, but the only reason I finished it was so that I wouldn't have to change its status to \"dropped\" on MAL.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Curiosity. Whether you love it, hate it, or lack it, curiosity is an unavoidable human nature in all of us. Daily explorations and innovations are all often made due to someone's curiosity. Even the Internet was built upon someone's curiosity for a virtual universe. Honestly, Hyouka sparked my curiosity when Kyoto animation first decided to produce it. Because I've had many great experiences with the studio's previous works, Hyouka didn't seem it would be an outlier to this trend.\r\nBut, looks can be deceiving.\u00a0\r\nHyouka, it appears, extinguished my curiosity just as easily as it had lit them.\u00a0Hyouka played out as perhaps one of the most disappointingmystery shows I've ever seen. But I don't mean that it ended up so terrible for a Series as a whole. Rather, the first 12 episodes of Hyouka alone out-shadowed any potentials of newer mysteries that could've matched some of the galvanizing story lines it began with.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of Hyouka is also misleading in itself since it takes place in the typical high school era, where most students are just beginning to reach the realization of their own ambitions. In this seemingly normal, typical school setting, something about the atmosphere within Hyouka's artwork suddenly set an alarm off. Immediately after the first episode, we find out Hyouka's main focus: Mysteries!\\n\\n\r\nHyouka circles around the Classics clubs, of all clubs, to unravel several obscure cases. Although the reason for solving them is at first unknown, Oreki, a man sloth who only wishes to live his life by conserving as much energy as possible, suddenly decides to solve these mysteries for his beloved high school classmate, Chitanda. Following Chitanda are Oreki's two middle school friends, Satoshi and Mayaka. These characters all play significant roles themselves, but I'll talk about that after some bits. For now, all you need to basically know is: Trivial mysteries around the school easily provoke Chitanda's curiosity, Oreki solves them, and Satoshi and Mayaka speculates the scenes as Oreki ends up solving the cases.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nDespite its oversimplified cheesiness, Hyouka's mysteries provide a great sense of suspense that even a woman could enjoy. Each episodes utilize typical mystery novel devices such as cliffhangers and over dramatic scenes. However, they are all placed in concise places which constantly makes you rethink thoughts as new informations are being presented. What if the evidence is faked? Isn't she lying? What if there's another person involved? Perhaps, it wasn't intended to be pranks but rather.. a message? Each items worthy of mysteriousness \u00a0forced me to re-think each solutions of the mystery and essentially, each case gathered more and more details every single minute to the point that hypothesizing who the culprit is based on empirical observations became a rather naive thing to do.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nActually, it's almost like describing a painting. First, imagine that there's a grass field drawn with bright vibes of warm colors. You would assume then, that the painting takes place in a peaceful, sunny location where the quietude could not be disturbed, right? What if then, a little girl holding balloons and a teddy bear is drawn in? Wouldn't that help re-assure the peacefulness within the illustration? Lastly, you look at the final piece drawn into the art: a man resembling that of your worst nightmare is hiding behind a random bush, armed, and seems to be hissing at the little girl. Well, doesn't that ruin the whole illustration. Ironically, Hyouka does something very similar to the process described above; at first an obvious answer is presented, glimpses of other alternatives are shown, and finally the different, appropriate route will be revealed. Hyouka keeps you guessing, and sharpens your analysis skills to an extent. Sometimes it gets to the point that watching Hyouka became less of an anime experience, and more of a scrappy puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical aspects of Hyouka easily over-sieges many other productions with its greatly effective soundtracks. Whether it's the befitting contribution to the suspenseful atmosphere mentioned or stand alone chilling music, Hyouka accomplished them all. Some over repetitive soundtracks also created a sense of security as each episodes begun, but soon transitioned into snaky, backstabbing orchestra music as soon as mysteries were being solved. The two OP's and ED's are deemed to be rather classic J-pop styled music, but the animation took the initiative to even step up its creativeness a notch.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I'm sure most viewers of Hyouka could at least agree that the animation in Hyouka is spectacular. Shadow drops on figures and faces masking their identity were really effectively done to provoke a sense of danger, and many productions of artistic productions often generated spontaneous amounts of emotions. Lots of scenes referring back to an older scene or flashbacks gave off the just right balance between romanticism and realism. It was truly amazing that Hyouka expressed the exact emotion it intended to gave off with the mixture of Kyoto animation and original OSTs.\\n\\n\r\n\"He has no ambition and no energy. He will not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. Again and again [Sherlock] has taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe prior quote described Oreki Houtarou, otherwise Hyouka's main protagonist, perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAs a mystery Series, it's only natural for Hyouka to make references to the famous Sherlock Holmes novels. But instead of Sherlock, arguably, Oreki follows the path of Mycroft Holmes (Sherlock's older cousin) more accurately. Similar to Mycroft, Oreki starts out as someone who seems to be wasting his potentials. Oreki solves logical problems easily and applies appropriate solutions to most problems; but there's a major issue, Oreki is a sloth. By that, I mean Oreki doesn't like to waste time on anything trivial and rarely goes out of his way to do any outside activities. He's a smart guy who doesn't use his talents, and bored me with a rather dull personality as the series began.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, once a cheerful, sparkly-eyed girl named Chitanda Eru intervened in the daily life of Oreki sloth, everything changes. Instead of being selfish, Oreki started reconsidering what he deemed as arbitrary \u00a0matters around him and developed into a character who later inspected situations and cared for the resultant. The teasing relationship between Chitanda and Oreki is also one to be envied, as it gives a sense of hope that maybe even turtles can stand up for itself if given the circumstances.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, someone could describe Chitanda as the ocean to Oreki's turtle-headed mindset.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, from even the first episode there's an evident amount of flirting & blushing between the two which suggests that the relationship between Oreki and Chitanda roots itself as a fatuous, romantic one more than anything else. Chitanda herself serves as an interesting comedy release, who gets intrigued by almost anything, in the quadruplet of the classics group. Chitanda has a pair of the most mesmerizing eyes in the world, and oftenly, she doesn't even realize her own curiosity being so infectious and transmissive through those hypnotizer-eyes. Chitanda even attempts to learn the art of seduction from a Senpai and though she doesn't successfully master it, we learn from a direct statement that Chitanda has her own charming, attractive qualities as a woman. Even so, Chitanda sometimes makes rather silly mistakes and it's within those memorable klutz performances that we realize Hyouka has a rather Slice of Life/Comedy side which can be as entrancing as its mystery aspects.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the main duet, there were also other noteworthy characters. Hyouka specifically assigned most other (side) characters to a role which would either occur once or as a reoccurring pattern throughout the Series. Most substantially, Oreki's two elementary friend who joined the same high school as him, Satoshi and Mayaka's more dramatized relationship, played a nice contrast in addition to Oreki & Chitanda's more flirty one. \u00a0Like many people, Satoshi is one who conforms with society but hides the secretive parts of himself, and as Hyouka progresses we learn more of him and Mayaka's past. As a female, Mayaka suppresses many of her feelings as well and only late in the series we find more than just what seems like her tsundere character. Otherwise, while solving mysteries, Satoshi and Mayaka both collect information for Oreki to solve and for Chitanda to be intrigued by. They also contributed to the unique storytelling technique Hyouka came up with, and became characters I absolutely respected even with their at times shady personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all these great remarks, I felt that Hyouka could've improved on some aspects.\\n\\n\r\nWhat originated with Hyouka's initial premise came with a problem. Most characters in Hyouka are put in too perfect of situations and they are all given the most convenient excuses to somehow miraculously find and solve mysteries for themselves. Oreki, for example, got shoved into many crime cases by his sister and since her character was never really elaborated on, it seems as if his sister's whole existence was nothing more than an excuse to push plot lines across. Instead of saving the best elements for last, Hyouka also did the exact opposite. In the beginning of Hyouka, I barely recognized that Hyouka's mysteries were so realistic yet negligible. Only later did I find some of the writing to be unconventional and inconvenient in comparison to how over-dramatic some scenes were meant to play out. If Hyouka decided to suppress romanticism over realism, they could've at least attempted to make some of the mysteries sound more exciting. Instead, the producers decided to give Hyouka a rather dry, deceiving outlook.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hyouka is like a cup of coffee. At first glance, one can only observe a pool of muddy, shady imageries. After the first sip, you began to taste the bitterness only realizing you forgot to add sugar. Once Kyoto animation is delicately mixed along with other sweet flavored ingredients can you finally taste the truly colorful quintessences of Hyouka Coffee. Of course, not everyone could grow accustomed to the taste. It certainly isn't everyone's cup of coffee. However, without a doubt, Hyouka truly prevails as a work displaying how nothing is as it seems.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Slice of Life, I thoroughly enjoyed both the comedy and secretive aspects of Hyouka. As a curious being, you may desire to watch Hyouka because it produces splendid animation, misleading riddles, and ambiguous relationships. But in the end, I promise Hyouka will not be the enigma you expected. In most cases, it turns out for the better.",

            "content": "\"I'm curious,\" says Chitanda Eru, and Oreki Houtarou, unable to resist the sparkle in her eyes, knows that once more he has to give up on his lazy ways to help her solve a new everyday mystery.\r\nHyouka is a series that takes elements of both the mystery and school life genres, mixes them together, and churns out a product that is a very interesting blend of the two. At heart it is very much what you'd expect from a school comedy, from the cast to the plot. The cynical, dry male lead with a sarcastc streak to his inner thoughts and narrating, the airheaded somehow-top-of-her-classfemale lead with more energy than a hamster on coffeine, the male lead's goofy, easygoing guy friend, and so on. Episodes centering around onsen visits, pool days and cultural festivals, a carefree after-school life in a club that does relatively little, and so on. The cliches and stereotypes line up, but what it presents isn't as bad as the premise makes it out to be, in part because the characters carry something more than just their stereotype. Especially in Mayaka's story arc there's very interesting characterization, and the love stories that are presented don't feel forced or out of place, being subtly sweet rather than diabetic.\\n\\n\r\nThe most significant reason for the decent presentation lies in its crossover with the mystery genre however, and the way it handles this. Essentially what the main characters spend their time doing is solving everyday mysteries, be that a strangely locked door, mysterious disappearances of school property, or other such events. The main character, Oreki Houtarou, while strangely devoid of any other noteworthy talents, has an uncanny knack for piecing together bits and pieces of information and form a theory on the passing of events - indeed, he is the kind of detective you see in the classics of crime, only instead of crimes and murders he solves minor mysteries of daily life.\\n\\n\r\nThe sequence of events and the way hints to the mystery's solution are presented is done rather well, and while some can be missed easily, or relies on understanding aspects of Japanese language and culture, upon properly watching through episodes after a mystery's solution, most if not all the clues used to piece the mystery together are clearly there for the viewer to see, and pieced together the finished conclusion seems coherent and logical.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the mystery solving is aided by creative visualizations of the characters' trains of thought, helping the viewer to understand and comprehend what is being reasoned more easily. This is a very good decision by the creators, because if there were only spoken words some of the explanations could easily go over the heads of the viewers, but with the visual element, it's very easy to comprehend. \\n\\n\r\nEven putting that aside the art remains very lovely, using a vivid colour palette, which together with lush background, clear lighting effects and camera angles that are not often seen in anime series gives the series a very liely and engaging visual appeal, as should be expected of a school series, plus plus. The music is likewise very appropriate for a mystery series, with suspenseful and sometimes dramatic instrumentation and dynamics, yet it does not forgo some of the more typical tracks of school anime, from the exciting tunes of fun days to the goofy tunes of funny scenes. Of particular note is that it also uses a few pieces of classic music as \\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes are both decent, lively j-pop tunes, a little upbeat but nothing quite over the top. Thematically they draw on some central aspects of the main character's leading issue of him feeling a little gray and distanced from his friends and the 'normal', lively high school life, with some lovely colour and effect use mixed amidst the more standard anime opening clips. The first ending theme is a more bright, sung-by-the-female-leads pop song, while the animation is ninety percent silly fanservice. The second ending song is a very upbeat pop song that sort of screams \"school anime ending theme\", with bright backgrounds and the like, though it does an amusing job making references to older detective fiction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Hyouka is a decent series that brings something new and refreshing to the school anime genre, and while it doesn't point itself out as a very good anime, falls to a few stereotypes and so forth, it does stand out above the massive crowd of school anime that are less successful in their attempts to break away from the masses. It offers lovely visuals and music and does a very good job at visually presenting the characters' thoughts in a orderly but also fun fashion, and it's fun seeing the mysteries get solved. If you're a fan of either genre this series will probably offer you something interesting, without being particularly outstanding.",

            "content": "Hyouka..  Actually I feel sorry for this anime..  The anime is given a lot of negative reviews... \r\n  The way the anime anime started was pretty slow... When it was put in Mystery genre , I kind of expected it to be like its predecessors (Detective School Q, Gosick etc) ... When it turned out the anime was nothing of that sort, I was fairly disappointed at first and even made me angry.  \r\n    Well you may be wondering why I gave it a rating of 9.. The first thing you have to do before you see thisanime is not to classify it as any other mystery animes... To be specific , the mystery genre has become a cliche.. It is well associated with thriller, horror etc and  as a result the very base of mystery has lost its meaning.. As I said earlier, this anime does not have anything like that and this is probably the main reason why people started to take the anime in a negative way. When it comes to mystery, people tend to have lots of expectations and if u invest huge expectations when u see this anime , u will feel let down just like me at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\n   To do justice, I felt like continuing the series and not to judge it by seeing a mere 4-5 episodes. Well to my surprise, I loved the anime..The short story arcs were beautiful. And the cases were equally intriguing. The anime kind of radiated a warm feeling through out.. The cases are mostly mundane as some one put it earlier. Well for a real mystery fanatic, it will not seem to matter. Apart from the  plot, the sound sort of gives a mysterious aura  and an uncomfortable feeling that it may reach to a point that you want to badly know the answer. The art was also good and I loved the characters a lot. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helps..(:(: Enjoy\\n",

            "content": "In retrospect, Hyouka only becomes a greater anime. My initial score was a 9. Now it's probably the most solid 10 I'll ever give.\r\nThe series is completely unpretentious and brilliantly executed. I know there are people out there who hate on slice-of-life anime because it's full of manipulative nonsense meant to make the viewer go 'aww'. Hyouka does none of that. Hyouka shows you why, ironically enough, considering the main character, ordinary life can be exciting and energising. That ordinary life, ordinary pleasures, ordinary amounts of logic, thinking, and effort can indeed result in something extraordinary.\r\nThe genius in Hyouka lies in its subtlety. The maincharacter, Oreki Houtarou, is determined to lead a lifestyle of serenity and peace, which involves expending as little energy as possible. The anime doesn't diverge from this - indeed, it is an atmospheric masterpiece attuned to the ideal world that Oreki craves. Everything is beautiful, everything moves slowly, and everything is surprisingly perfect. Even the most ardent of hearts will be calmed with Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nOreki's task is basically that of solving mysteries within a very human context. Unlike Detective Conan, the focus here is less on the how, and more on the why. Human motivations are what drive the mysteries in Hyouka, and its up to our indolent protagonist to solve navigate the thorny path. We are taught that truth is by no means necessarily good and is more likely painful. We learn why humans cause each other pain and grief. We are guided by KyoAni's steady hand.\\n\\n\r\nWe do so, because much like Chitanda Eru, the female lead - we are curious.",

            "content": "It\u2019s retro-review time again, and today I\u2019m going to be talking about an anime I was afraid to go back to because I was sure it wasn\u2019t going to hold up over time. And really, can you blame me? After sitting through so many coming-of-age/character-based anime that most people consider to be good, but I consider to be shit, Hyouka looked like a prime candidate for \u201cdon\u2019t believe the fans. It\u2019s nowhere near that good unless you\u2019re under that fanboy delusion that character interactions/development is good enough to entertain on its own\u201d. And you know what? I am not.\r\nIn fact, I\u2019ve come to really despisecharacter stories for the sake of character stories over time because I have enough boredom trying to examine my own miserable life and I don\u2019t need the f*cking Oscars to complicate said examination with their own shallow input, let alone anime. So whenever I hear praise regarding how Durarara is awesome because watching Vorona chat emptily on about how intelligent and violent she is, only for that exact same person to criticize the upcoming Yuki Nagato-chan anime because it contains the same empty conversations except replaced with nostalgia and moe, I feel the urge to ring my bullshit bell after swatting their head with the barf bag I just filled up. Who cares what the subject is about if both conversations are empty go-nowhere crap at the end of the day? I certainly don\u2019t. Just because \u201cmoe conversations\u201d set the bar so goddamn low doesn\u2019t mean I want to watch an entire show consisting solely of a travelling furry and his foxy love interest exchange romantic quips that is ultimately cock-teasing for a resolution we\u2019ll never get.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, what was I supposed to be talking about again? Oh right, Hyouka. Anyways, when this anime first arrived on the scene, it got a bit of a mixed response for its dull conversations and over-directed nature, but it was the latter that got me through the show because I was a lot more shallow when it first came out and the animation tricks along with the hilarity of the two males being the Clannad protagonists with better personalities was funny to me. I ended up loving the thing, considering it to be one of the few anime from KyoAni and 2012 that were actually good, but now that three years have passed and most of my revisited favorites had to get the axe, I was worried that Hyouka would join their ranks. And you know what? It almost did.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the banter was still indeed charmingly smart \u2013 although Chitanda might grate on some people \u2013 and the direction continued to be top-notch, the first seven episodes of the show fell under Steins;Gate syndrome of starting on a really dull note because said good aesthetics weren\u2019t being applied to anything the least bit interesting unless you\u2019re a fan of Houtarou flexing his thinking muscles and Chitanda wanting to revive the club because \u201cvague reason\u201d. Whilst a bunch of people have complained about the mysteries being weak, it\u2019s less the fact that the mysteries themselves are too simplistic and more the fact that the reasoning behind them was too simplistic. Because if murders and kidnappings were all that was needed to make a good mystery, we\u2019d be watching Kindaichi Case Files.\\n\\n\r\nNo, the problem with Hyouka\u2019s first few episodes is that the underlying story is one we\u2019ve seen before: the lonely introvert will get cured of his loneliness through the girl (and the other two members of the Scooby gang) with a mission and they\u2019ll fall in love. And just like mysteries, action, and character porn in general, romance for the sake of romance is really boring to me. There were few jokes and whilst there is some Japanese commentary mixed into the whole mess, it wasn\u2019t the kind of commentary that I cared for \u2013 and even when I found it kind of intriguing (Chitanda\u2019s family situation, the fact that you can\u2019t smoke in schools, etc.), it was surface-level stuff at the end of the day. But most damning of all, the mystery elements were just \u201cthere\u201d. You could have exchanged them for f*cking DDR elements and it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. Whilst I\u2019m not going to deny the character porn was good, that means nothing to me without a use for it.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, I realized the rewatch wasn\u2019t going too well and was worried that my only attachment to KyoAni from this point on would be an anime they made over a decade ago. So in desperation, I skipped ahead to the second arc, which I remembered being the point when the anime really clicked with me. And you know what? I liked it alot.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the \u201cplothole\u201d regarding why the students couldn\u2019t just ask the writer was noticeable \u2013 although it does eventually get addressed in a way that was semi-convincing \u2013 but otherwise, the second arc had a strong enough plot to support the great aesthetics because it actually bothered to instill some goddamn complexity into the thing. The movie arc actually examined the mystery tropes along with how people see them today, as well as brought our main character down a peg when he realized his brains can\u2019t outmatch beauty, which is the kind of substance that actually makes me give a shit regarding whether or not a film will be ready in time for the cultural festival, as well as the kind that will allow me to revisit your product again in the future. Also, it had a hilarious student-made film. It\u2019s like Shirobako if Shirobako had something resembling conflict.\\n\\n\r\nRelieved that the show wasn\u2019t completely lost on me, I ended up watching the school festival arc and enjoyed it just as much as last time because it had everything I could want in a coming-of-age/slice-of-life story: good pacing, interesting narrative tricks, engaging dialogue, and really relevant/interesting themes about talent, dreams, and the roles people play in the mystery genre underneath everything to give them a sense of weight. Enough praise has been written about that arc, so I won\u2019t go into detail regarding it other than it would be in my top 5 films of 2012 if it had actually been a standalone feature-length title. The final five episodes, on the other hand, were a bit of a mixed bag because they were supposed to function as random side stories to tie up loose ends and we all know how I feel about that sort of stuff in general. It\u2019s nice to see couples form and everything, but whilst that\u2019s what a lot of people like about Hyouka, that\u2019s not what I personally like about it.\\n\\n\r\nI like the show at its best because when it can, it mixes in all those fun character aesthetics into a plot that tickles my mystery-loving bone in a way that I want it to be tickled. It\u2019s all about context at the end of the day, and that\u2019s what separates the good (not just in the slice-of-life genre) from that godawful Steins;Gate movie. It\u2019s fine to like the show simply for those \u201cfun\u201d elements I described earlier, but let me reiterate that I don\u2019t do \u201cfun\u201d shows \u2013 unless they\u2019re Mobile Fighter G Gundam of course \u2013 because liking a show because it\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d is everything I consider wrong/weird about fanboys. What can I say? I\u2019m a huge believer in Sturgeon\u2019s Law, and when you define something as \u201cfun\u201d, you\u2019re using a reason that can be applied to 99.9% of all entertainment (with a 3.1% margin of error). Yes, even total dreck like Superman 64. Brrrrrrr.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, I still do like Hyouka - or to be more precise, the middle two arcs of Hyouka. Thankfully, they\u2019re separate enough from the arcs I find kinda dull that I don\u2019t have any guilt in pretending the show is a series of four films where the middle two sit among my favorite anime. Most people consider Jojo to be a favorite despite the fact that it only has one good arc that hasn\u2019t aged well at all (as of this writing). Babe: Pig in the City is a great movie and I couldn\u2019t care less about the first film. There are people who have no interest in seeing Urusei Yatsura that love the second film. And whilst I love Lupin, if you think I\u2019m going to watch all of it\u2026okay you get my point by now. It\u2019s not really \u201cit gets better\u201d with the later arcs so much as \u201cit gets different\u201d. I won\u2019t blame people if they don\u2019t care about the difference, but I personally do and that\u2019s all that matters, along with the undisputed fact that anyone who stills think Kuragehime is a good show is a raging nostalgia-blinded hypocrite.",

            "content": "-The following is a spoiler-free review-\r\n\"I'm curious, I can't stop thinking about it!\"\r\nThese words best described how I felt as I swept through the Hyouka series. Though initially slow, as I watched more and more episodes, I began to feel myself pulled into the curiosity of Chitanda Eru and the mundane school life of our protagonists, Eru and Oreki. By the end, I found myself personally enjoying the Hyouka series greatly and wishing for much much more. But here's a disclaimer; If you're looking for a thoroughbred Mystery or Romantic slice of life, you won't find it here. In the words of one of themain cast, (Fukube) - \"I won't be the best at anything, or rather, I've stopped trying to be.\" and these words fit Hyouka perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is not the heavy mystery we're typically used to seeing attached to that tag. There are no violent or ingenious crimes which require an equally ingenious protagonist to tackle, nor are there deep and dark underlying secret behind the characters' actions, neither are there floods of epic romance as with most other school / slice of life anime. But what Hyouka does succeed in is by maintaining a harmonious balance of the school life / mystery elements in a setting which we can consider completely average and mundane school life. And the lens through which it views the events which constitute this school life is what makes the show so amazing, albeit hated by some. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Let me get this straight. This is the kind of story you get from an average student plucked straight from school. There are no events which stick out all that much. It is an accurate portrayal of how one would expect a Japanese student to be. While this might be offputting for some, the way which these mundane daily tasks are viewed through the eyes of Chitanda and Oreki are what really makes the story shine. \\n\\n\r\nWhile most would just move through their day without even noticing such trivial matters, seeing them through the eyes of Chitanda and Oreki allow the viewer to see mystery in seemingly meaningless and small events, making the smallest of things, like a school rumour or a library book the subject of an entire adventure with its own backstory and explanations. And though trivial, the boundaries of the mystery is usually highlighted early and the evidence is presented to the viewers early as well, allowing the viewer to play along with the mystery if they wish to. Ultimately, the mysteries are well crafted without overstepping its boundaries as a school-themed mystery, though specific incidents were rather boring. (Such as the first 2...)\\n\\n\r\nHowever that being said, some arcs were also especially strong, particularly in my opinion the first arc and the third arc and may hit you slightly in the feels when you least expect it. All in all, a pretty well written story despite being completely average which still manages to achieve its goals, but suffers when the incident at hand fails to pique the viewer's interest or is simply too easy to solve. \\n\\n\r\nART: This quality of art is rarely seen in a slice of life anime. The reason being that slice of life is rarely an art or animation intensive genre unlike fantasy. Yet, the opening scenes of Chitanda's sparkling eyes and even in the OP, one can easily tell how much effort went into animating those scenes. The artwork is just gorgeous and the animation flows perfectly. You get exquisite detail and you can even see flowers and hair bobbing in the wind at some points.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I have no complaints with the sound. The sound complements the moods of the show well, and OP 1 is a particular favorite of mine. Yasashisa no riyuu is playlisted in my anime playlist and it's been stuck on repeat in my head for quite some time. Not forgetting Mikansei Stride (OP 2) and Kimi ni matsuwaru mystery (ED 2) which are also excellent and extremely fitting tracks in their own right. I draw a blank when trying to think of ED 1 though, I didn't particularly like it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: The characters I felt contributed to my enjoyment of this series greatly. Though initially they felt rather stereotyped or fitting into certain archetypes, after awhile their quirks began to differentiate them from the bulk of other characters. Who could mistake the sparkly eyed 'Kimi narimasu!' of Eru and the hair twirling sigh of Oreki. Their quirks made them enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses, we also begin to see the backgrounds of all 4 of the main cast, getting insights into their life, their past and their philosophies. More importantly, it allows you to see how the four of them grow as the Hyouka series progresses, particularly that of Oreki and Fukube. Seeing them grow made me really glad to have invested in those characters and their relationships with each other (Particularly Chitanda x Oreki), though I must say the inconclusive ending was rather disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: As someone who likes to think and immerse himself in the world of the characters presented, I found this extremely enjoyable and I constantly found myself trying to theorize the explanations behind the mysteries presented and extremely eager to click 'next' and find out more after every single episode. It was the perfect treat, stimulating my brain cells without me having to tax them ceaselessly, as such I enjoyed it greatly.\\n\\n\r\nWith all these factored in, what else is there for me to say. Hyouka has been one of the most enjoyable school-life / mystery anime which I've come across. It's definitely not the anime for everyone, but if you're into a more light-hearted mystery series with a hint of romance and school life, then you'll definitely enjoy it as much as I have.",

            "content": "Anime are known to usually be over-the-top no matter what genre they are. When I think of what makes anime great, I think of epic action, intense mind battles, heart-wrenching emotions, exciting drama, unrealistically awesome characters, and crazy plot twists.\r\nHyouka is none of that. It\u2019s nowhere near \u201cover-the-top\u201d in any way. Hyouka is the definition of subtlety. It\u2019s serene, relaxing, beautiful, funny, and smartly written. But the best thing about Hyouka is that it makes you think\u2014and not just about the mysteries.\r\nThe mysteries are small-scale cases that manage to be incredibly intriguing, causing you to become \u201ccurious\u201d. No, the writers don\u2019t try to instill inthe viewer a burning desire to figure out the solution\u2014they elicit from us a compelling curiosity that will drive us to want to figure the mysteries out. To me, sometimes mystery stories are so grand and dramatic that I feel like I can\u2019t solve them on my own. But in Hyouka, the understated enigmas are so accessible yet simultaneously complex. The peaceful atmosphere draws you in until you find yourself becoming the detective, trying to ascertain the truth. I thoroughly enjoyed this format for the mysteries\u2014it was a breath of fresh air from the mind-boggling conundrums of Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes. \\n\\n\r\nThough the mysteries are well executed, it\u2019s really the characters that shine in Hyouka. As the story progresses, each of the four main characters gradually undergo great changes in character. These changes are masterfully portrayed\u2014while most anime will just slap you in the face with character change, the evolution of these characters is so subtle and understated that you hardly notice it until the end\u2014which is when you\u2019ll look back on the series and marvel at the beautiful transformation the characters went through.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Hyouka is simply beautiful. In fact, it is the most beautiful animation I have ever seen. Technically, Fate/Stay Night\u2014Unlimited Blade Works has the best animation in terms of raw graphics, but Hyouka is more beautiful because of the idyllic, serene setting and picturesque locations. And the animations that visualize what Houtarou is thinking are bafflingly complex, creative, and artistic. Fate/Stay Night might have the better graphics, but Hyouka has superior artistic direction for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes in Hyouka are elegantly expressed. There are so many of them, but each is hidden well within the mysteries and character development. I love the way they are presented\u2014not like Naruto\u2019s \u201cNever give up!\u201d speeches that straight up pound the themes into you. The themes in Hyouka are quietly implied and are there for the viewer to pick up on if they think hard enough about it.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka encourages you to think through things that may seem trivial, and to find meaning in the mundane. It\u2019s when you get to the end of Hyouka that you realize that the whole anime was a hidden message that the author was encouraging the viewers to pick up on by analyzing the show, just like the main character analyzes other seemingly simple things. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you look back on the anime and realize the themes presented therein, you realize that while Hyouka may seem to be a simple anime on the surface, it is in reality a masterpiece of subtlety, beauty, and surprising depth.",

            "content": "I'm a sucker for mystery stories.\r\nAnd I'm a sucker for KyoAni. They have produced so much hype from their past original productions, from Fumoffu, Haruhi and Lucky Star to Clannad and K-on!\r\n*Take note that this review is just my first impression of Hyouka based on its first episode.I'll edit this only when the series is over :D:D:D*\r\nLet's proceed with the art first. Though it's the traditional style and swagger of a KyoAni production, I fell in love at the last scene of the episode where it was raining. The contrast is just.. so cool, like having anime character in a somewhat 'real' world. I guessthis is one of the few moments where I can just only see but can not describe.\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna go on and say an unnecessary opinion: the lead heroine looks like a hybrid of Mio (hair), Yui(body language and stature), and Ritsu(same voice actress) from K-on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked the most is the usage of some witty quotes that a lot of people can relate to. Of course, my favorite was Houtarou's life motto: \"I don't do anything I don't have to do; if I need to do something I do it quickly.\" Also, there's some classical music right here, yo. It's always kewl to have classical tracks be put in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I recommend that you watch Hyouka now, whether you're a mystery fan, got a hangover from \"Another\" or a fanboy of KyoAni. Expectedly, there was no plot development happening in the first episode, but I must say that the characters shown so far were introduced smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nI think that I'll rate Hyouka better if it proceeds with a little faster pace, though it was refreshing to find out that this mystery anime won't be episodic like Detective Conan (btw a classic detective mystery anime, mind you.)",

            "content": "Alright, just like many others, i've decided to give a review of Hyouka after I've finished watching the whole series. I'll stick to keeping the review spoiler free for the sake of interested users who haven't watched the series yet and just want an idea of what the anime is all about.\r\nHyouka is an anime that definitely starts off slow. We are introduced to our male lead called Oreki who seems to be devoid of passion of any sort as he just follows the same old boring routine everyday without having any interest in life. We are exposed to his way of life, as wellas his principles of energy conservation. His quote about himself sums it up nicely: \"I don't have to do anything i don't have to.\"\\n\\n\r\nJoining him in the classics club are Satoshi, his witty and knowledgeable sidekick, Mayaka who is a outgoing and friendly girl. Last but not least, the female lead Chitanda, who can be described in one quote, \"I'm curious!\" (watch the series and you'll understand why). At first glance, Oreki seems like the outliner among the group, considering that he is the only guy who is so unenthusiastic among all of them. The story starts when they try to solve the true mystery of the classics club from long ago...\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries in Hyouka are not your typical mysteries which are action packed, but they do give you a run for your money as the simplest of all matters can actually involve a lot of thinking behind it. The mysteries in Hyouka turn out to be pretty trivial matters at times (in fact, one of  the mysteries solved was just through a conversation between the two leads). However, what is impressive is how the characters show great thinking by analysing every nitty gritty before coming to the main conclusion (in which Oreki always wraps things up nicely). Events which seem insignificant at the start could just add up together and end up being the key to the entire mystery. When it all connects, you just have a \"wow\" feeling and find that the mystery aspect is really well-done.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing in the slice-of-life genre is the character development in my opinion. Hyouka has just the thing. The characters show changes after episodes and episodes of hanging out together. We start to see love in the air. We understand why Satoshi plays second fiddle to Oreki and is contented with not being the best, we understand why Mayaka is so determined in her feelings towards Satoshi as well as why she feels so strongly towards manga, we understand why Chitanda is so curious in finding out all these little mysteries that happen in their daily lives. Even Oreki gets influenced by the personalities of the 3 that he even takes the initiative to do certain things at later parts of the show, something which we would have never seen in the early episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself also touches on many aspects and themes. Expectations is one of them. Expectations are something heavy, whether it is placed on yourself or on others. Does having expectations on yourself motivate you to do things even better, or does the notion of having expectations of someone make you feel dejected and admit that you are no match for that person? Expectations is a theme that will be talked about in the show, albeit not the only one.\\n\\n\r\nThe other aspect i would like to mention is one's true feelings. When faced with an important choice you have to make, would you follow your heart and accept it with all you've got, or will you take the easy way out, afraid that if you accept something, you might make the mistakes you made in the past and screw things up. \"I am obsessed with being obsessed over nothing.\" After all, sometimes avoiding things is the easiest way out. However, is this truly the right decision to make? Sometimes, trying new things out might not be so bad after all. Following your true feelings instead of letting your head make the decisions might be better at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic in my opinion. The animation that left me in awe was the cherry blossoms under the purple sky, along with the flower petals flying around during the last episode (no spoilers =D). Plus, its KyoAni doing it, so details are generally well-done and will not disappoint viewers who use the art of an anime over its plot to determine its watchability (if there is even such a term, but i digress).\\n\\n\r\nBoth OPs and EDs are upbeat songs which suit the theme of the anime, which was honestly never meant to be dark despite it being of a mystery genre... They are really nice to listen to and somehow leave you addicted. (happened to me for the second ED.)\\n\\n\r\nI understand that some might be skeptical over how slow-paced Hyouka is compared to other series, but as the story progresses we start to have attachment to the characters since we start to relate to them already, thus enhancing the plot in the progress. So even if slice-of-life/mystery has never been your cup of tea, i still recommend giving Hyouka a go!\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is an anime that shines in how simple it is, yet so entertaining. The characters are only thrown in typical real life situations that have happened to us as well in one way or another, yet the mystery aspect does not feel any less dull despite that. The series being short and sweet appealed to me. As they say, \"Simplicity is beauty.\"\\n\\n\r\nWow, it has definitely been quite the long review. To sum things up, Hyouka was a series that kept be hooked from start to finish (me being a sucker for its genre). For fans of slice-of-life and mystery, there's nothing to hesitate about for i'm sure you'll be able to enjoy Hyouka! I hope this review was a good read as well as being informative to you, the reader. To end things off on a random note, my favourite characters are ironically the supporting characters Mayaka and Satoshi xD. Once again, hope you enjoyed this review!",

            "content": "\"I don't do anything I don't have to. What I have to do, I do quickly.\"\r\nFor most people, the short years spent in highschool are often the turning point and highlight of their lives; a time filled with introspection and change, where some dreams end and others are born to take their place. On the other hand, there are some who reject this notion and choose to spend their days as uneventfully and routinely as possible, never straying too far from their comfort zone and established lifestyle. After all, why waste the energy on trivial matters?\r\nOreki Houtarou is one of these individuals. \r\nSet during thedull and grey life of Oreki's first year in highschool, the story begins with an important change to his individual status quo \u2014 the joining of the school's Classics Club, albeit out of obligation rather than choice. Receiving a letter from his older sister asking him to join the club to keep it from being disbanded from lack of membership, he solemnly accepts his duties and sends in a club registration form, which appropriately causes surprise for his close friend Satoshi. For an individual uninterested by studying, sports, and socalizing, joining a club can be an arduous and painful ordeal. And indeed, if not for a certain girl immediately joining the club, Oreki could very well have maintained his status quo of living dully and freely. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps change isn't always a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nThis changing force is Chitanda Eru, serving as the contrast to Oreki's behavior. Shortly after their first exchange, Chitanda drives Oreki into a set of mysteries involving the club and its later two members, a repeated occurence often instigated by her eyes lighting in excitement and being followed by her catchphrase, \"I can't stop thinking about it!\". These mysteries are what form the bread and butter of the story, so it's a fortunate thing then that the mysteries themselves are varied; involving fairly interesting situations such as a room being locked or ghost sightings during a hot springs trip, and trivial events such as why a student was suddenly called to the office after school. No two mysteries are the same, and while several of the episodes are independent stories, three distinct arcs constitute the bulk of the episodes and the development of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately (and not so fortunately) the fairly lighthearted formula established in the self-contained stories is mostly reversed into something more dramatic and serious in the main story arcs once things finally get heated. It provides a refreshing contrast between the two and prevents things from feeling too repetitive or stale. Problems unfortunately come as a result  with this change in tone, however. The dialogue can sometimes come across as being cheesy with overdramatized and exaggerated reactions to some of the events, such as  Chitanda gasping in shock like the world has just ended when a book is missing from the clubroom, Oreki yelling and giving a death glare when his senior manipulates him a little bit, or the other three members of the Classics Club treating Oreki as some kind of savant for solving what are often very simple mysteries. Considering the trivial and often lighthearted nature of these mysteries, the overdramatization in the script is something that stands out as being very inconsistent with the overall tone of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw exists with the mysteries themselves, and those watching the series primarily for that aspect are very likely to find themselves disappointed or bored, especially with the self-contained stories whose mysteries are often so trivial and juvenile that they are more equivalent to a curious question than anything else. They lack the depth necessary to truly become something well-written and engaging, and have very little in common with the mystery novels that the anime frequently references. Though these mysteries don't qualify as being bad, they're mostly mediocre and certainly don't stand well on their own. Instead, much of the appeal and enjoyment of Hyouka comes from the relationship between the characters and their interactions with one another.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the dynamic between Sherlock Holmes and Watson, three of the main characters in Hyouka each fill a specific role in the club: Chitanda instigates the mystery, Satoshi provides information, and Oreki deduces. While the early episodes may give an impression of this being formulaic, the characters soon break from the mold and begin to do things that don't strictly pertain to their accepted role and behavior. For example, Oreki may decide to instigate the mystery himself or in one specific case Satoshi attempts to be the one to unravel and deduce. One main character even ends up being the culprit in one episode which makes for a fairly surprising conclusion.  \\n\\n\r\nLuckily, there's enough substance to their interactions that they come across as normal human beings rather than simple stereotypes, though Chitanda's eccentric traits and curiosity are often exaggerated for comedic effect. The characters all show a wide spectrum of emotion and get disappointed or angry depending on the situation (despite problems with the aforementioned overdramatization) or joke around and playfully criticize one another when things are going well. What mainly shines, though, is Oreki's and Chitanda's relationship, stemming from how heavily their personalities and behavior contrast with each other. Seeing him react and deal with her curious and capricious behavior always makes for some endearing and amusing scenes, with blushing and romantic moments abound.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, none of this would be very interesting in the first place if these characters didn't stand out by themselves or possess any distinguishing qualities. It's thanks to the writers' aptitude that the main characters undergo a considerable amount of development over the course of the series, resulting in something that is fundamentally more complex and dynamic. The majority of this development is focused on the protagonist, Oreki, as his dull life slowly changes into something more colorful and vibrant. At the start he's very reluctant to expend energy on anything that isn't absolutely necessary which is what causes him to repeatedly rebuke Chitanda for roping him into these situations. Mainly a result of the enjoyable time he has with Chitanda and the Classics Club, Oreki begins to realize that being involved and competent with something might not be such a bad thing after all. He starts to willingly pursue these mysteries through his own effort and curiosity, without the need of Chitanda urging him to investigate. For a person so bent on doing nothing with his days and conserving all time and energy possible, it's only natural for the rest of the club members to point out his change in behavior.\\n\\n\r\nChange isn't only evident in Oreki, though, as Chitanda, Satoshi, and Mayaka also experience it to varying extents. In particular, Satoshi \u2014 often serving as the comic relief \u2014 becomes unsatisfied with his role and lack of recognition in comparison to Oreki. For several episodes he trails off into the mystery by himself in a mostly unsuccesful effort to duplicate or better Oreki's deductive skills. The jealousy being portrayed in some scenes is a somewhat unneeded and perhaps cliche, but this arc in the story provides a pleasant change to Satoshi's character and   is successful in fleshing him out much more than in the early episodes. The second-to-last episode takes this further as well with even Satoshi understanding his change and becoming happy with his new lifestyle. Mayaka also gets some much needed screentime during the third arc which involves her status in the Manga Society club and her relationship with its members, with the outcome of this sidestory being something fairly satisfying and conclusive. Chitanda on the other hand changes surprisingly little over the course of the series though perhaps it's for the best. After all, she fills a necessary and important role in the story as the foil of Oreki and catalyst for his change and development. If Chitanda wasn't her usual self, where would Oreki be?\\n\\n\r\nNow, there's one thing that can be agreed upon in regards to Hyouka, and that is that Kyoto Animation has made this show absolutely stunning visually.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of Hyouka is one of the most outstanding aspects about the series. Mood and atmosphere is set by the prominent lighting and by the events and monologues which are heavily stylistic and surprisingly abstract at times, occasionally taking the viewer away from the normality of the situation and into a place much more surreal.  There's a distinct visual element present in Oreki's thought process with the layer of each mystery being carefully mapped out to the viewer, which serves not only to make the mystery more clear but to provide a much more immersive experience than the characters simply speaking to each other. Some scenes also possess a very dreamlike quality, with a couple particular examples including Chitanda's first inquisitive moment which succeeds in captivating Oreki or the dozens of little curious Chitandas crawling and tugging on him in the sixth episode. This type of dichotomy between the normal and the abstract is what makes Hyouka a very unique experience.  \\n\\n\r\nThe underlying animation and designs are also phenomenal. KyoAni has long been lauded for the standard of detail and animation set in their works and this is taken even further with Hyouka, with the entirety of the anime feeling very much movie-quality throughout of all its episodes. The realistic and lifelike movements of the characters is praiseworthy but what stands out most is the focus on eyes and facial expressions. The characters of Hyouka are easily some of the most visually expressive seen in an anime for quite some time. Even the side or background characters receive much of the same detail to animation and character design, making nobody seem bland or the derivative of another. It's surprising then that KyoAni managed to keep to this level of quality for all 22 episodes, with no noticeable decrease visual nor artistic quality. The seemingly limitless attention to detail here is really something commendable. \\n\\n\r\nBut it's not all about visuals technically, either. Hyouka boasts a very fitting and eloquent soundtrack that accentuates the atmosphere set by the visual design. Composed mostly of classical tunes and eerie or quizzical melodies, the music is what creates the inherent sense of intrigue within Hyouka. It perfectly manages to capture the principal feeling of mystery in both the relaxed and dramatic moments of the series, never feeling overbearing nor out of place. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Hyouka does fall short of some of its potential due to issues with the script, but what the anime lacks in mysteries it more than makes up for with its characterization and presentation. It's just a bit of a shame that many people will choose to write the anime off and treat it as something weak and disappointing because the mystery aspect didn't hold up to their expectations. A misconception exists where people treat Hyouka as a strictly mystery title, and while it does hold true to some extent, these mysteries are instead used to develop the characters and have them interact in a remarkable manner, distinctive manner. This is an anime that essentially amounts to mundane events presented in a stylized and intriguing way. For those looking for something fresh in an age of uninspired rom-coms and homogeneity, Hyouka is a title that is easily worth your attention. \\n\\n\r\nThere's this sweeping notion that deep and action-oriented storytelling is necessary for a quality experience, but titles like Hyouka can safely disprove that line of thought.",

            "content": "Mod Edit: Review may contain spoilers.\r\n-----------\r\nAlright folks, let's talk some Hyouka. Time to exercise your brains and turn that curiosity light bulb ON. \r\nHyouka (also the same name of the first volume of the Classic Literature Club that's also a implied term of \u201cIce Cream\u201d) is an anime series adapted from the mystery novel written by Honobu Yonezawa. The story? Well, if you're curious like a certain purple eyed girl in the series, Hyouka details the Kamiyama High School's Classic Literature Club and its members having fun while solving mysteries and enjoying the time of their boring lives. \r\nIt all begins with the unenthusiastic youngboy by the name of Oreki Houtarou. He is the type of guy that is hard to make friends with because Oreki in his minds and his friend describes him as someone who is not keen in joining clubs, play sports, or socializing. Despite this, he is very intelligent and observant of the tinest events as well as having an insightful intuition. After joining the club reluctantly by his elder sister, the mysteries, fun and, Hyouka stories begin. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, Hyouka wouldn't be much fun without the other members of the club, right? We have the calm and happy girl with the keen curiosity. With those large purple moe eyes, she is curious about various events and mysteries that often involves others and goes \u201cwatashi kininarimasu!\u201d (I'm curious!). She is a fun and happy go girl who despite being annoying at times brings the fun and entertainment in the story. On other hand, there's her best friend Mayaka Ibara who calls her affectionately \u201cChi-chan\u201d. Mayaka is sort of the opposite of Chi-chan as she seems to be the type of girl who wants to avoid confrontations and if possible, end it as peacefully and swiftly as possible. Last but certainly not least is Satoshi Fukube. He's the happy guy who is carefree about life but deep down a great guy as he cares about others' well being. With a powerful memory, he is a useful as well as a compatible partner of Oreki who balances out the cheerfulness and moody mood of the duo/club. \\n\\n\r\nNow at this point, you might be as curious as Eru Chitanda herself or even had a thought of \u201cwatashi kininarimasu!\u201d on whether the series is worth to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the arcs and story is well crafted. Detection fiction stories involving a group of friends is never new in the anime industry. Series such as Detective School Q, Heaven's Memo Pad, and Spiral: The Bonds of Reasoning also have such elements. What makes the series more interesting seems to be the interactions between the four main members of the club with each other that goes beyond the typical mysteries. The actors plays their roles well with their voice acting that reflects the personalities of the characters. With nearly all the characters having different characteristics, it's amusing to see how they all get along in the club. Surprisingly though, it actually does work well. But of course adaptation an anime always has its problems of the script not flowing or losing its touch in some of the filler like episodes. Personally though, it works out fine.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the series takes place at a school life setting, there are other characters in Hyouka that interacts with the club. These are often included in some of the mysteries and requires the clubs' various skills to crack that case. \\n\\n\r\nIf animation was part of a popularity poll this year, Hyouka would take the grand prize. Kyoto Animation (Clannad, K-On!, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) does a pretty damn good job with its production quality and that's not an understatement. I remember watching the first episode and the first thing that popped into my mind was \u201cwow, that animation is out of this world!\u201d No but seriously, the production quality is top notch and Kyoto Animation does not disappoint. It even includes word play illustrated in the minds of Oreki and some of the other characters during cases to depict clues in a more realistic way of telling the story. With its gorgeous artwork and beautiful style of presenting the characters, it goes on without say that \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is smooth that is well coordinated. When a mystery case scene is presented, the soundtrack flows. When a comedy scene (usually involving our curious girl Eru Chitanda), an OST of rhythm is played. Even when Oreki is bored, it shows that he really is bored through the soundtrack. Talk about unenthusiastic. The two opening songs are also well orchestrated in the series. The first OP song, \"Yasashisa no Riyuu\" by Choucho presents a smooth flowing song that gives us a lighthearted feeling of Hyouka. The second OP song \"Mikansei Stride\u201d by Saori Kodama presents a more humorous way of the series with Oreki peeking around with curiosity himself. (somewhat similar to Medaka Box's Opening). And of course, the ED songs are also there to make us feel the mystery. Well, not exactly. The first ED song seems to be quite naughty to say the least. Chitanda and Mayaka in those curious positions?! Turn that imagination bulb ON. The second ED song though fits more within the mystery genre and is generally entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hyouka is one of those lighthearted series to watch by the end of a long weekend. The series does have flaws such as the the repetition in some of the intertwined arcs as well as mindless word plays that goes on in some episodes that can be bothersome to watch. Chitanda's signature phrase \u201cwatashi kininarimasu!\u201d is also infectious at times and gets annoying. Additionally, some of the mysteries are a bit dull and not realistic as it seems. If it's a real mystery, why not involve some real murders and crimes? Needless to say, it's why Hyouka is rated PG-13. \\n\\n\r\nHyouka is a school mystery series that involves...guess what, mysteries. If you're not into detective fiction or that sort of genre, then hit that drop button. No one is stopping you. But if you're curious like Eru Chitanda, then sit back, relax, and watch some mysteries as well as the members of the Classic Literature Club do what they do best at. \\n\\n\r\nCuriosity kills the cat but Hyouka is what kills the boredom.",

Are you looking for a mystery anime that has a badass detective? Are you looking for a mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat? Well look somewhere else. Because Hyouka isn't that kind of anime.\r\nStory-Hyouka revolves around a boy called Oreki Houtarou. An apathetic guy who has little interest in anything or anyone. His life motto is \"I don't do anything I don't have to. What I have to do, I do quickly.\" But when her older sister who lives inindia sends him a request to join the classical club to keep it from being shut down. He accepts, thinking that the club could be a good place to stay alone and conserve his energy. But his conservative life is in trouble as he finds out that the club is also occupied by A curious girl by the name by Chitanda Eru.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story and mysteries for this anime are well crafted. Most of the mysteries were interesting and enjoyable.But sadly, A few of the mysteries were poorly made and downright boring. Luckily, these mysteries are only a few and were rather short. There is also a good bit of romance and comedy in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Kyoto Animation is always praised for it's good art and animation. But Kyoto Animation decided to take Hyouka to another level in art. Hyouka is by far one of the most beautiful animes I've ever seen. The characters design is designed so well and fit with their personality almost perfectly. The backgrounds were created with such detail that it felt like I was watching an anime movie instead of a tv show. Movements are also fluid and small details like the wind blowing the character's hair is also greatly done. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The soundtrack fits the anime perfectly. From comedy to drama to the start of the mystery the soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and only brings more enjoyment to the viewer. The first and second openings are also great songs that went on my ipod after first listening to it. The two endings are also quite good for endings and I enjoyed them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Now the true reason this anime is so enjoyable is not only because of the mysteries.But also character interaction. In this anime we have four main characters. Oreki Houtarou, Chitanda Eru,Satoshi Fukube, and Mayaka Ibara. Three of the four people have different roles in solving a mystery. Satoshi is the database.Chitanda is the person who raises the question and opens the mystery, and Oreki is the person who solves the mystery. But these roles do change at times. Sometimes Satoshi would be the one to try and deduce the mystery, and Oreki would raise the question himself. Each character also goes through character development through the anime. Especially Houtarou. He develops to the point that even he gets a bit curious throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'll just say it right now. Hyouka is one of the best mystery animes for me. The mysteries are enjoyable. The character interaction was great.The animation phenomenal. Whats more there to say. I would definitely recommend this to people who love romance and mysteries. No, scratch that. If you like anime.Then definitely give this anime a try.",

When one considers what constitutes a \u201cmystery\u201d show, it is often associated with preconceptions of crime, horror and eerie suspensebut Hyouka is not your typical mystery show as it centralises on mysteries of little real-life consequence. These aren't mysteries whose resolution will lead to justice being carried out but mysteries whose consequence lies in how it affects our characters. Nonetheless, Hyouka excels at executing these mysteries and in an atypical manner, with each of our main characters bringing a unique perspective in solving these mysteries, making the process fascinating as we observe the quirky and unpredictable methodologies being used. \\n\\n\r\nHyouka does not have one unrealistically prodigious detective that can unravel and deconstruct even the most intricate of puzzles but a range of characters, some unique to each case, that all contribute key aspects leading to the solution. This makes for a more fulfilling and genuine resolution as you feel part of the process rather than a bystander in awe of some amazing detective. The solutions themselves are meticulously well-written and thus accurate and realistic yet simultaneously complex making you feel slightly more intelligent by the end of every one. Some may find the lack of ramification in the mysteries innately boring as the characters aren\u2019t actually usually directly involved in them, for they act for their own various reasons but they at least create a desire for you to solve them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what makes Hyouka so enjoyable is not the satisfaction of decrypting it all but the development of our 4 main characters throughout each one. Hyouka is an exemplar of how the high school slice of life genre could be achieved as the relationships between our characters are captivating yet incredibly realistic with each action remaining true to the psyche of high schoolers and the ways they make decisions. The pacing is slow but constant and we can see a smooth progression in the development of our characters which tackle real-life issues that high schoolers face but nonetheless in a Hyouka-esque fashion, usually amongst the mysteries. Besides the hyperbolised curiosity of our female lead, the dialogue is extremely genuine and for me at least, indistinguishable from your real life conversations with friends at school. As the characters interact more with one another and face their problems, we are shown a vast array of emotions and considerable depth to their actions and motivations which are relevant, accurately portrayed and likely to be issues that you yourself may have faced. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, Kyoto Animation (Kyoani) must be lauded for how brilliantly Hyouka is presented. The atmosphere is prominently compelling with both the visuals and the sound contributing vastly in creating a well-constructed universe that entirely fits Hyouka\u2019s quirkiness. The animation is also of the best I\u2019ve seen \u2013 be it the expressions, movements or the background/setting -they are all smoothly animated with appropriate lighting and colour palette to fit the tone of each episode. Hyouka\u2019s episodes are visually stunning to behold in particular when mysteries are being solved, as it involves the use of experimental animation that diverges completely from the usual crisp style to a tailor-made style suited for each different mystery. To top it off, complementing this is a fantastic soundtrack that consists of light instrumental pieces which further amplifies the ambience in each situation. The majority of the pieces share a \"playful mystery\" theme and whilst lacking in variety, the entire musical score is definitely a strong one that can instantly be identified as \"Hyouka's OST\" rather than forgettable music which lacks the identity of the show it aims to enhance.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I feel Hyouka is an excellent anime. For me, it fell slightly short simply due to the sense of incompletion in the way the show ends. I say no more to avoid spoilers but if you do watch it you may find out. If you\u2019re looking for a unique mystery or slice of life show whose fortes lie in its characterisation, production values and its take on the mystery aspect - this is one to watch. If you\u2019re however looking for a serious mystery (\u00e0 la Death Note) then this might not be for you as the satisfaction you receive derives from observing how these mysteries are solved rather than the fear of heavy consequences, and the impacts each one has on the development of our characters. Some anime attract an audience through heavy fanservice, others via an action-packed plot and others with a deep/profound plot. However, Hyouka is an anomaly. It shows us how even seemingly mundane things can be made fascinating. Whilst I obviously cannot guarantee you'll enjoy it, if you\u2019re looking for a distinctly novel anime experience in either mystery or slice of life, then I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading if you got this far!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, it tried, I'll give it that.\r\nHyouka, also known as \"Hyou-ka: You Can't Escape\" is the latest series by acclaimed studio Kyoto Animation, who, despite their huge fanbase, generally produce work of more style than substance. Hyouka unfortunately follows this trend, though superficially it doesn't fit in with the rest of KyoAni's back catalogue very much, as Hyouka is generally very dry in tone.\r\nHyouka is a mystery series, revolving around four high school students in the Classic Literature Club (an aimless club that happens to end up solving mysteries a lot). The students in question are main character Oreki Houtaro, whom I am about 99%certain has some form of autism. He has zero interest in socialising, fun, or... well, anything. He deliberately tries to live life as uninterestingly as possible. This is hampered a bit by him being insanely gifted at solving mysteries. This gift goes untapped until he meets Chitanda Eru, a plucky, cheerful girl with an insatiable curiosity who refuses to let the even the smallest of mysteries go unsolved. They are joined by Satoshi Fukube, a cheerful happy-go-lucky human database simply full of useless facts who is seemingly Oreki's only friend prior to the series, and Mayaka Ibara, a library assistant who's known Oreki since childhood, who is probably the most level-headed member of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nNow, remember how I said Eru refused to let even the smallest of mysteries go unsolved? Well... that's the big problem Hyouka has. The mysteries really are the smallest of mysteries. Each and every one revolves around a very trivial subject, and just about all of them could have gone unsolved without any real problems. Something so down to earth could in theory have been a good idea, but unfortunately Hyouka doesn't really deliver. As a result, Hyouka is, in a word... dull. With the exceptions of one or two mysteries, Hyouka totally fails to be entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBut that isn't to say they didn't go the extra mile to make Hyouka more interesting. KyoAni's huge animation budget is flexed quite a bit. Random quirks in the presentation show up every now and then when Oreki is explaining his theories, sometimes in rather trippy fashion. The unusual techniques in the directing aren't limited to these, though. Hyouka plays around with angles and closeups a lot, to try and make every scene more dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nWhile they occasionally spice up a scene a little bit, they really don't do much to save Hyouka from being very, very bland. And often, the harder they try, the worse it gets. It's most \"dramatic\" moments end up being, if anything, idiotic for how hard they're trying to sell something so insignificant.\\n\\n\r\nDirecting techniques aren't the only thing in Hyouka intended to spice things up, though. Character-driven subplots are also involved. All of Hyouka's cast members are likeable, if nothing special... though Oreki's disinterest with everything can be irksome, and Chitanda can be more saccharine than cute sometimes. Romantic subplots flare up between the characters, as well as some mild feelings of envy from Fukube towards Oreki, and these would all help a lot more if it wasn't for the fact that all of this goes absolutely nowhere and amounts to nothing. Just like the directing techniques, it's an attempt to spice it up that at best is a mild amusement, usually falls flat, and at worst, is simply idiotic.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that having been said, Hyouka is not bad. But it certainly is not good either. At the end of the day it is simply very average. But there are really much better wastes of your time out there than Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: For the biggest of mystery enthusiasts and diehard KyoAni fans only.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8/10\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\r\nActing: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: UN-GO, Gosick",

            "content": "At first, I really wasnt impressed. The characters, especially the two guys, talk as if they are hinting the deeper theme to each episode. That was a little unnecessary. I didn't mind the plot though. The trivialized version of mysteries interested me more than the big mysteries that are either too fake or too unreal. I understand that this might be disappointing for mystery fans, but I feel like hyouka is a breeze that can change the stagnant mystery genre. \r\nI honestly look forward to this a lot each week. I got used to the talkative characters and the lack of character development. There aresome changes in the main character so far, but I wouldn't say it's development. However, the literacy club itself is developing and moving forward as a whole. The club grew on me, so I began to see the characters less individualistically and probably accepted their way of talking. \\n\r\nThe animation and sound are pretty impressive. I like the animation style, especially when the main guy starts to solve the cases. It makes even the most trivial case interesting. The background music approprately fits each scene, and I find the ending especially cute. I understand this animation style has been used before in the past, and sometimes I even feel like its an act of stealing. I wouldn't forgive it if it's been used badly or didn't improve on it. However, it did improve on it, not in terms of style though, but in terms of where and how it's used. I don't like the idea of using creativity for its own sake. Some people may like it though, but I do not. Randomness, uniqueness, or craziness for me cannot stand alone. They are only for enhancement, not for the real substance. (Im excluding comedy on this one) I've offended some people and their love, but thats my belief. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that rather irrelevant detail, I want to talk lastly about the plot that made me fell in love with hyouka. Beside the obvious downplay, I think as a consequence, you can detect a trace of elegance in mystery solving. The art and sound helped too, but I think the elegance would have been lost if the cases were big scale murder cases or a national crisis because they would usually give away obvious hints, some distracting, and you would be too busy guessing the culprit. Hyouka involves the audience in another way. Hyouka makes sure that you can't guess logically until the guy solves it. Yes, you'll realize how stupid or trivial the solution turns pout to be and the story becomes anticlimactic, but isn't exactly this anticlimactic feeling telling you that it's reality? People like to cook things up, and the bigger the scandal, the bigger the followers. Reality is often trivial, grand in scale only in how trivially detailed it is. The elegance of hyouka is therefore how trivially detailed it makes the cases to be. In the anticlimactic conclusion, you might start to find the trivially detailed reality more interesting on its own.",

            "content": "I had looked at Hyouka a while back but saw a lot of negative reviews so decided to give it a miss and just recently picked it up due to a friend's recommendation. Having just finished episode 7 I feel that I can safely say I am glad to have decided to watch it.  I felt compelled to write a review to hopefully clear up some misunderstandings people might have about the series.\r\nI think the big thing that may disappoint some viewers has to do with their expectations going into it.  More specifically, the show is listed as a mystery and while thereis a mystery to be solved in every episode, the mysteries thus far have been very mundane in nature.  If you go in expecting a murder mystery type series, you should leave your expectations at the door or else you will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\n If I had to describe the shows genre i would be more inclined to describe it as slice of life as it follows the adventures of the classic literature club (which often feels more like a mystery club).  There is no real apparent overarching plot and the character development is fairly slow as each character's personality is revealed little by little  as we watch their day to day lives.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9 - The characters are nicely portrayed. While in many cases they are archetypes we are very familiar with, there is enough a personal quirk from them to not seem boring, rehashed or two dimensional.  While no character is especially standout, I feel the entire cast is well done and very likable and they all interact well with one another.  Specifically Chitanda and Houtarou are being fleshed out nicely, and play off each other very well.  It would be nice if Satoshi and Ibara got more attention, but it is still relatively early in the series and they are side characters, so it quite possibly coming in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9 - The art style is simple and clean, using a lot of soft colors.  The character designs are nicely done and the show does not have excessive fanservice.  The backgrounds are simplistic, but nicely rendered.  Overall I am definitely a fan of the art style; it differs enough from standard shows these days to have its own feel, but the style is not especially notable.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9 - the show is a slice of life show, there is little significant overarching plot. Ones satisfaction with the story really comes down to how compatible they are with slice of life shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7 - The soundtrack is simple and plays well with the scenes. It always enhances the scenes, but is not exactly standout.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 - I'm a big fan of slice of life shows and I'm finding Hyouka to be very enjoyable.  It is a simple, easy going show that is easy to watch.  It's not going to give you any deeper insights to life, but if you like the slice of genre it should be able to entertain you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Hyouka  is not a masterpiece as it lacks anything that truly makes it stand out as being above and beyond other shows.  That being said, it is still very well done, and quite a entertaining show to watch casually.",

            "content": "[Slight Spoiler Warning]\r\nHyouka is a slice of life anime that does a very good job of referencing famous mystery novel authors, yet fails to be a good mystery itself.  Hyouka is a Kyoto Animation show with a generic high school setting (of course) and features trade mark, cute, moe, animation.  I am not a huge fan at all of slice of life shows as they offer little to no substance plot wise but, I was oddly excited to watch this series because I am a huge mystery fan.  On top of this, I heard Houtarou was a very cool and laid-back characterthat resembled Kyon (Haruhi Suzimiya).  But, sadly, I was extremely disappointed after watching the show unfold with its dreadful pacing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:  \\n\r\nThe art here is very similar to other Kyo-ani shows such as K-On!.  It has that moe, cutsie style like K-On! and has very detailed backgrounds.  The colour tones of this show is what can be described as \u201clazy\u201d which relates very well to our main character.  The character designs were not too out of the ordinary either but, one note to make is that our main female lead, Chitanda, looked a little too much like Mio (black haired lead) from K-On!.  The animation was also very nice and fluid.  Overall, the art and animation were both solid while the character designs were a bit too generic. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAll of the opening and ending themes for this show were forgetful and boring.  The opening and endings sounded like generic pop music and I honestly skipped them most of the time.  The background music for this show was mixed.  Half of it was happy slice of life music while the other half was more mystery themed.  The mysterious background music playing while Houtarou did his deductions actually did a very nice job of making the mystery itself seem more suspenseful than it really was.  The other slice of life type music was not very memorable and actually wasn\u2019t played that often giving the show a more mysterious feel at times as well.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (this is where the bashing begins):\\n\r\nThe show features 4 main characters... first up, you have our main protagonist, Houtarou Oreki who is a laid back, lazy guy who likes to conserve as much energy as possible (by not doing anything).  This makes Houtarou very boring.  Houtarou is not special in the least; he doesn\u2019t have any interesting ideas or deep monologues and rarely provides comedic relief unlike other characters who are similar to him.  All Houtarou can do is solve mysteries and only does it (usually) when the main female lead forces him to.  That brings up another point about him; Houtarou believes in always conserving energy yet is always falling victim to Chitanda\u2019s pleas to solve pointless mysteries.  He can easily avoid this but, he doesn\u2019t, instead it seems like he grows feelings for her yet he continues keep up the charade of conserving energy which brings up yet another point.  He gets little to none character development.  During the film mystery arc, it had appeared that there would be some character development for him but, sadly, it lasts for about one episode and he goes back to being his old self again, never changing and never expressing his true self.  The next character, our female lead, is Eru Chitanda.  There is not much to say about her other than the fact that she is extremely annoying.  In the beginning, her curiosity was sort of cute but, after a while it really gets frustrating because all she ever does is get curious.  She is an airhead girl who apparently is, somehow, one of the smartest people in the school.  She doesn\u2019t provide much other than the occasional suggestion for a mystery, being Houtarou\u2019s master, and doing absolutely nothing.  The male side character, Satoshi Fukube, is your average overly energetic character, albeit he does have the most depth than anyone else in the cast.  He is constantly struggling with being better than his best friend, Houtarou, and also has some love issues with the female side character.  Though, none of this is actually that deep at all and it really just seems more melodramatic than anything e.g. they were crying over the fact that Satoshi broke some chocolate for Valentine\u2019s Day that the side female character made.  The last character is Mayaka Ibara (the female side character mentioned earlier).  There\u2019s not much to say about her, she\u2019s just a basic tsundere type character who really loves manga; doesn\u2019t provide much more than some manga club drama. \\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot:\\n\r\nThis is where Hyouka really fails miserably for me.  Basically, Hyouka is set up in a way where there are multiple mystery arcs and these mysteries are what the plot consists of.  The thing is, Hyouka starts off pretty strong with the first real mystery of the show (which is what the show is named after).  This mystery is more serious and more important than any of the other mysteries presented but, it only lasts about till episode 5.  After this one there are some other mysteries that are completely useless until we get to the film mystery.  This one was actually quite intriguing and suspenseful and it was fun trying to figure it out with the characters.  Disappointingly though, this is where all the good regarding Hyouka\u2019s mysteries and plot ends.  After this we are left with the big build up towards the crazy school festival.  Now this is what really bothered me about this show.  For 4 or so episodes we get no mysteries at all!  During this time all we see is \u201cfun times\u201d at the school festival and extremely slow build up/set up for the school festival mystery.  In fact, the mystery is solved in 2 episodes!  I wouldn\u2019t really say it was solved either since in those two episodes there was no deduction process by our main character, he just figured it out.  In contrast, during the film arc, it took the main character quite a lot of thought and effort (which we actually saw on screen) to figure out the mystery but, here we just see Satoshi trying (and failing) to solve it himself and then all of a sudden Houtarou solves it.  Even more frustrating is that, after this arc ended, the rest of the mysteries, I wouldn\u2019t even consider mysteries.  They were even more useless than the earlier more \u201cimportant\u201d big mysteries.  Basically, towards the end of the show nothing happens at all (this is about 5 or 6 episodes).  To top it all off, the series ends incomplete with no ending in sight and an open ended \u201cromance\u201d where Houtarou is too scared to actually admit his feelings.  Overall, some mysteries were very fun to watch (two or three) but, in the end most of them were completely useless and mundane.  Also, this mystery show stops showing mysteries for about 4 episodes just to build up to one lack luster conclusion for one bad mystery.  Other than the 3 main mysteries in the show, the rest is just useless with the main purpose of taking up space.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe art for the show is generic but, functional and the animation and detail is spot on.  But, the character designs are a little generic. The sound matches the different tones of the show at times and the music playing while the characters are trying to solve a mystery adds a very fitting feel to the show.  But, the opening and ending themes to the show are forgetful.  Overall, the aesthetics are fine.  The characters are dull and mostly generic with little to no character development.  Some of the mysteries in the show are fun to watch but, most of the show is filled with useless fodder that does nothing and is \u201csolved\u201d within one episode.  Also, the show stops for 4 episodes for a stupid school festival.  The story and characters mostly fail.  Overall, Hyouka is a mystery anime with more references to actual good mysteries than having good ones itself.  And for this reason I am utterly disappointed and feel since it didn\u2019t accomplish being good at what it was supposed to be that it is, in fact, worse than average.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10 :(\\n",

            "content": "Hmm i suppose it may be a little too early to write a review considering that its still quite early in the anime so pardon me if my review isn't too good.\r\nStory: Once again i'll repeat that its only been 5 episodes but i think that this anime has quite a good story. It has unpredictability and sometimes you wouldn't expect the things that did happen to happen. \r\nArt: Character designs and background are decent at least. KyoAni as usual does quite a good job with the anime they produce. The art is elaborate and makes you feel like the place is real.\r\nSound: Hmm Ihave to say i do like the OST's for this anime especially the opening ( probably coz im a fan of choucho though) I also find the voices to be decent ( especially Nakamura Yuuichi /o.o/) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters are interesting and although may be not to a very large extent, unique. For example, we get a male character who helps others occasionally, not really special. That male character has quite good deductive skills, maybe not so special but definitely not common. He doesn't like wasting energy unless absolutely necessary, quite special. When he helps others it's normally because he has to do it or he has to waste even more time later, definitely not common.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Definitely will help you kill some time when you're bored or want to watch something you should give it a try. It may seem a little plain at first but it slowly becomes more and more special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: First of all: confession. To be truthful i was rather skeptical when i started to watch this anime. After the 1st ep i thought it would be able to kill some time. Howerver, after watching 2-3 episodes i began to slowly find this anime more and more interesting and i can say now that while its not certain, this anime has potential to be the best anime this season and maybe even the best this year.",

            "content": "After reading some of these reviews explaining how amazing Hyouka is, I thought I should set the record strait.  Yes Hyouka has good art, likable characters, and does an excellent job explaining and executing idea's.  However, at the end of the day the lack of any sort of interesting story really takes a toll on the show.\r\n...THE GOOD...\r\nI'll start with the good because there is a lot of good in this show. \r\nART: for starters it's one of the better animated shows out there, the art is very well drawn, and they do a good job portraying the characters.  Though i feelbad that the artist's are being forced to draw such mundane settings all the time.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: surprisingly enough the characters are very likable.  I enjoyed Oreki, and how he contrasts with Chitanda.  In general these characters are well acted, and well played. They defiantly stand out from other anime characters in there own way.\\n\\n\r\nEXECUTION: If anime filler has taught us anything, it's proved that just because you have an Idea doesn't mean that you can execute it correctly.  Hyouka proves that it can execute an idea with precision and care, when explaining a mystery.\\n\\n\\n\r\n...THE BAD...\\n\r\nthere is really only one thing I can complain about and it's a big one.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT/STORY\\n\r\nto say that this story is boring would be incorrect because to be honest there is no story, it's just an ordinary kids life.  Now to be honest I am slightly biased here, I can't really understand peoples fascination with regular high school stories.  However, this go's beyond that because unlike in most anime's, were the characters are trying to achieve something of importance.  This show is literally dedicated to some of the most mundane mysteries i'v ever seen.  Might as well have made a show, about the mystery of how you tie your shoes because thats what the story feels like.\\n\\n\r\nNow look I'm not saying you need to the next fate zero here, with explosions, and sword fights but I do expect something to happen in the show.  Here is an example of which I am trying to explain, minor spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nEX: episode 3 o wow that kid was smoking SO INTENSE!!!!! \u201cpot\u201d would have made more sense. episode 2 who cares about a dam library book. episode 1 wow how did that door get locked \"it's a mystery\". \\n\\n\r\nnot since Shining Hearts: Shiawase no Pan (IE: all about bread) have I seen a show so dedicated to the most trivial things, no one cares why people have been taking the same library book out  \"\"\"NO ONE CARES\"\"\". \\n\\n\r\nI don't expect this kid to be solving murders, but give me something, give me anything that will let me say wow I actually care about this mystery.\\n\\n\\n\r\n...CONCLUSION...\\n\r\nthis is a love hate anime, it will draw people in because of it's interesting character's.  However, because It does not seem to be getting interesting any time soon I expect viewers to drop off in the long run.  The show can be summed up like this.  \"do you place more of an emphasis on how the story is executed, or do you place more of an emphasis on what the story is actually about.\"\\n\\n\r\nstory 3/10 poor\\n\r\nart 7/10 good\\n\r\nsound 6/10 fair\\n\r\ncharacter 8/10 very good\\n\r\nenjoyment 6/10 fair\\n\r\noverall 6/10 fair",

            "content": "The real mystery here, is how could anyone produce 22 episodes for one of the easily most boring animes this planet has ever known. Everyone rating Hyouka over six is either biased or just really illusive. No, I'm not trolling; keep on reading.\r\nHyouka is your typical slice-of-life anime that deals with a group of high school students living everyday with their school club surrounding their little, personal stories. Over 22 episodes, the main protagonist (Oreki) is a laid-back, bored, and unmotivated teenager who's been trying his hardest to \"conserve energy\" by doing the minimum in every aspect of his life. That includes facial expressions, too.He's got his happy-go-luck friend, a cute and naive classmate who is ideally the main love interest of the story, and her friend, too. Together, they solve mysteries that has been happening around the school.\\n\\n\r\nOnly, each episode (or most of them) that deals with a certain issue taking place on said episode is done really badly. The mysteries are so boring, I don't think anyone actually cared about them being solved. If you expected suspense of sorts or being somewhat intrigued, then parish the thought -- you won't find any of that here. Oreki is always the one to come up with the brightest solution to them and being the leader of the group whilst still being really uninterested in... well, any of it. \\n\\n\r\nYeah, I get it's slice-of-life, but there is practically nothing interesting about this anime whatsoever. The mysteries are boring and drag on and on, characters are likeable but really unrelateable, and even for the shippers of the main show -- neither Oreki or his love interest show any signs to each other whatsoever. If you thought you'd get anything in the ending, scratch that; anyone spoiling you what is happening in the last episode won't actually be spoiling anything, because /nothing/ happens there. Oops.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is beautifully crafted, drawn and animated, with very nice character designs, theme songs and what not -- but otherwise, the show is lacking, and lacking big. I really wanted to love this anime, but the only reason I finished it was so that I wouldn't have to change its status to \"dropped\" on MAL.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Curiosity. Whether you love it, hate it, or lack it, curiosity is an unavoidable human nature in all of us. Daily explorations and innovations are all often made due to someone's curiosity. Even the Internet was built upon someone's curiosity for a virtual universe. Honestly, Hyouka sparked my curiosity when Kyoto animation first decided to produce it. Because I've had many great experiences with the studio's previous works, Hyouka didn't seem it would be an outlier to this trend.\r\nBut, looks can be deceiving.\u00a0\r\nHyouka, it appears, extinguished my curiosity just as easily as it had lit them.\u00a0Hyouka played out as perhaps one of the most disappointingmystery shows I've ever seen. But I don't mean that it ended up so terrible for a Series as a whole. Rather, the first 12 episodes of Hyouka alone out-shadowed any potentials of newer mysteries that could've matched some of the galvanizing story lines it began with.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of Hyouka is also misleading in itself since it takes place in the typical high school era, where most students are just beginning to reach the realization of their own ambitions. In this seemingly normal, typical school setting, something about the atmosphere within Hyouka's artwork suddenly set an alarm off. Immediately after the first episode, we find out Hyouka's main focus: Mysteries!\\n\\n\r\nHyouka circles around the Classics clubs, of all clubs, to unravel several obscure cases. Although the reason for solving them is at first unknown, Oreki, a man sloth who only wishes to live his life by conserving as much energy as possible, suddenly decides to solve these mysteries for his beloved high school classmate, Chitanda. Following Chitanda are Oreki's two middle school friends, Satoshi and Mayaka. These characters all play significant roles themselves, but I'll talk about that after some bits. For now, all you need to basically know is: Trivial mysteries around the school easily provoke Chitanda's curiosity, Oreki solves them, and Satoshi and Mayaka speculates the scenes as Oreki ends up solving the cases.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nDespite its oversimplified cheesiness, Hyouka's mysteries provide a great sense of suspense that even a woman could enjoy. Each episodes utilize typical mystery novel devices such as cliffhangers and over dramatic scenes. However, they are all placed in concise places which constantly makes you rethink thoughts as new informations are being presented. What if the evidence is faked? Isn't she lying? What if there's another person involved? Perhaps, it wasn't intended to be pranks but rather.. a message? Each items worthy of mysteriousness \u00a0forced me to re-think each solutions of the mystery and essentially, each case gathered more and more details every single minute to the point that hypothesizing who the culprit is based on empirical observations became a rather naive thing to do.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nActually, it's almost like describing a painting. First, imagine that there's a grass field drawn with bright vibes of warm colors. You would assume then, that the painting takes place in a peaceful, sunny location where the quietude could not be disturbed, right? What if then, a little girl holding balloons and a teddy bear is drawn in? Wouldn't that help re-assure the peacefulness within the illustration? Lastly, you look at the final piece drawn into the art: a man resembling that of your worst nightmare is hiding behind a random bush, armed, and seems to be hissing at the little girl. Well, doesn't that ruin the whole illustration. Ironically, Hyouka does something very similar to the process described above; at first an obvious answer is presented, glimpses of other alternatives are shown, and finally the different, appropriate route will be revealed. Hyouka keeps you guessing, and sharpens your analysis skills to an extent. Sometimes it gets to the point that watching Hyouka became less of an anime experience, and more of a scrappy puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical aspects of Hyouka easily over-sieges many other productions with its greatly effective soundtracks. Whether it's the befitting contribution to the suspenseful atmosphere mentioned or stand alone chilling music, Hyouka accomplished them all. Some over repetitive soundtracks also created a sense of security as each episodes begun, but soon transitioned into snaky, backstabbing orchestra music as soon as mysteries were being solved. The two OP's and ED's are deemed to be rather classic J-pop styled music, but the animation took the initiative to even step up its creativeness a notch.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I'm sure most viewers of Hyouka could at least agree that the animation in Hyouka is spectacular. Shadow drops on figures and faces masking their identity were really effectively done to provoke a sense of danger, and many productions of artistic productions often generated spontaneous amounts of emotions. Lots of scenes referring back to an older scene or flashbacks gave off the just right balance between romanticism and realism. It was truly amazing that Hyouka expressed the exact emotion it intended to gave off with the mixture of Kyoto animation and original OSTs.\\n\\n\r\n\"He has no ambition and no energy. He will not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. Again and again [Sherlock] has taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe prior quote described Oreki Houtarou, otherwise Hyouka's main protagonist, perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAs a mystery Series, it's only natural for Hyouka to make references to the famous Sherlock Holmes novels. But instead of Sherlock, arguably, Oreki follows the path of Mycroft Holmes (Sherlock's older cousin) more accurately. Similar to Mycroft, Oreki starts out as someone who seems to be wasting his potentials. Oreki solves logical problems easily and applies appropriate solutions to most problems; but there's a major issue, Oreki is a sloth. By that, I mean Oreki doesn't like to waste time on anything trivial and rarely goes out of his way to do any outside activities. He's a smart guy who doesn't use his talents, and bored me with a rather dull personality as the series began.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, once a cheerful, sparkly-eyed girl named Chitanda Eru intervened in the daily life of Oreki sloth, everything changes. Instead of being selfish, Oreki started reconsidering what he deemed as arbitrary \u00a0matters around him and developed into a character who later inspected situations and cared for the resultant. The teasing relationship between Chitanda and Oreki is also one to be envied, as it gives a sense of hope that maybe even turtles can stand up for itself if given the circumstances.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, someone could describe Chitanda as the ocean to Oreki's turtle-headed mindset.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, from even the first episode there's an evident amount of flirting & blushing between the two which suggests that the relationship between Oreki and Chitanda roots itself as a fatuous, romantic one more than anything else. Chitanda herself serves as an interesting comedy release, who gets intrigued by almost anything, in the quadruplet of the classics group. Chitanda has a pair of the most mesmerizing eyes in the world, and oftenly, she doesn't even realize her own curiosity being so infectious and transmissive through those hypnotizer-eyes. Chitanda even attempts to learn the art of seduction from a Senpai and though she doesn't successfully master it, we learn from a direct statement that Chitanda has her own charming, attractive qualities as a woman. Even so, Chitanda sometimes makes rather silly mistakes and it's within those memorable klutz performances that we realize Hyouka has a rather Slice of Life/Comedy side which can be as entrancing as its mystery aspects.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the main duet, there were also other noteworthy characters. Hyouka specifically assigned most other (side) characters to a role which would either occur once or as a reoccurring pattern throughout the Series. Most substantially, Oreki's two elementary friend who joined the same high school as him, Satoshi and Mayaka's more dramatized relationship, played a nice contrast in addition to Oreki & Chitanda's more flirty one. \u00a0Like many people, Satoshi is one who conforms with society but hides the secretive parts of himself, and as Hyouka progresses we learn more of him and Mayaka's past. As a female, Mayaka suppresses many of her feelings as well and only late in the series we find more than just what seems like her tsundere character. Otherwise, while solving mysteries, Satoshi and Mayaka both collect information for Oreki to solve and for Chitanda to be intrigued by. They also contributed to the unique storytelling technique Hyouka came up with, and became characters I absolutely respected even with their at times shady personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all these great remarks, I felt that Hyouka could've improved on some aspects.\\n\\n\r\nWhat originated with Hyouka's initial premise came with a problem. Most characters in Hyouka are put in too perfect of situations and they are all given the most convenient excuses to somehow miraculously find and solve mysteries for themselves. Oreki, for example, got shoved into many crime cases by his sister and since her character was never really elaborated on, it seems as if his sister's whole existence was nothing more than an excuse to push plot lines across. Instead of saving the best elements for last, Hyouka also did the exact opposite. In the beginning of Hyouka, I barely recognized that Hyouka's mysteries were so realistic yet negligible. Only later did I find some of the writing to be unconventional and inconvenient in comparison to how over-dramatic some scenes were meant to play out. If Hyouka decided to suppress romanticism over realism, they could've at least attempted to make some of the mysteries sound more exciting. Instead, the producers decided to give Hyouka a rather dry, deceiving outlook.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hyouka is like a cup of coffee. At first glance, one can only observe a pool of muddy, shady imageries. After the first sip, you began to taste the bitterness only realizing you forgot to add sugar. Once Kyoto animation is delicately mixed along with other sweet flavored ingredients can you finally taste the truly colorful quintessences of Hyouka Coffee. Of course, not everyone could grow accustomed to the taste. It certainly isn't everyone's cup of coffee. However, without a doubt, Hyouka truly prevails as a work displaying how nothing is as it seems.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Slice of Life, I thoroughly enjoyed both the comedy and secretive aspects of Hyouka. As a curious being, you may desire to watch Hyouka because it produces splendid animation, misleading riddles, and ambiguous relationships. But in the end, I promise Hyouka will not be the enigma you expected. In most cases, it turns out for the better.",

            "content": "\"I'm curious,\" says Chitanda Eru, and Oreki Houtarou, unable to resist the sparkle in her eyes, knows that once more he has to give up on his lazy ways to help her solve a new everyday mystery.\r\nHyouka is a series that takes elements of both the mystery and school life genres, mixes them together, and churns out a product that is a very interesting blend of the two. At heart it is very much what you'd expect from a school comedy, from the cast to the plot. The cynical, dry male lead with a sarcastc streak to his inner thoughts and narrating, the airheaded somehow-top-of-her-classfemale lead with more energy than a hamster on coffeine, the male lead's goofy, easygoing guy friend, and so on. Episodes centering around onsen visits, pool days and cultural festivals, a carefree after-school life in a club that does relatively little, and so on. The cliches and stereotypes line up, but what it presents isn't as bad as the premise makes it out to be, in part because the characters carry something more than just their stereotype. Especially in Mayaka's story arc there's very interesting characterization, and the love stories that are presented don't feel forced or out of place, being subtly sweet rather than diabetic.\\n\\n\r\nThe most significant reason for the decent presentation lies in its crossover with the mystery genre however, and the way it handles this. Essentially what the main characters spend their time doing is solving everyday mysteries, be that a strangely locked door, mysterious disappearances of school property, or other such events. The main character, Oreki Houtarou, while strangely devoid of any other noteworthy talents, has an uncanny knack for piecing together bits and pieces of information and form a theory on the passing of events - indeed, he is the kind of detective you see in the classics of crime, only instead of crimes and murders he solves minor mysteries of daily life.\\n\\n\r\nThe sequence of events and the way hints to the mystery's solution are presented is done rather well, and while some can be missed easily, or relies on understanding aspects of Japanese language and culture, upon properly watching through episodes after a mystery's solution, most if not all the clues used to piece the mystery together are clearly there for the viewer to see, and pieced together the finished conclusion seems coherent and logical.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the mystery solving is aided by creative visualizations of the characters' trains of thought, helping the viewer to understand and comprehend what is being reasoned more easily. This is a very good decision by the creators, because if there were only spoken words some of the explanations could easily go over the heads of the viewers, but with the visual element, it's very easy to comprehend. \\n\\n\r\nEven putting that aside the art remains very lovely, using a vivid colour palette, which together with lush background, clear lighting effects and camera angles that are not often seen in anime series gives the series a very liely and engaging visual appeal, as should be expected of a school series, plus plus. The music is likewise very appropriate for a mystery series, with suspenseful and sometimes dramatic instrumentation and dynamics, yet it does not forgo some of the more typical tracks of school anime, from the exciting tunes of fun days to the goofy tunes of funny scenes. Of particular note is that it also uses a few pieces of classic music as \\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes are both decent, lively j-pop tunes, a little upbeat but nothing quite over the top. Thematically they draw on some central aspects of the main character's leading issue of him feeling a little gray and distanced from his friends and the 'normal', lively high school life, with some lovely colour and effect use mixed amidst the more standard anime opening clips. The first ending theme is a more bright, sung-by-the-female-leads pop song, while the animation is ninety percent silly fanservice. The second ending song is a very upbeat pop song that sort of screams \"school anime ending theme\", with bright backgrounds and the like, though it does an amusing job making references to older detective fiction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Hyouka is a decent series that brings something new and refreshing to the school anime genre, and while it doesn't point itself out as a very good anime, falls to a few stereotypes and so forth, it does stand out above the massive crowd of school anime that are less successful in their attempts to break away from the masses. It offers lovely visuals and music and does a very good job at visually presenting the characters' thoughts in a orderly but also fun fashion, and it's fun seeing the mysteries get solved. If you're a fan of either genre this series will probably offer you something interesting, without being particularly outstanding.",

            "content": "Hyouka..  Actually I feel sorry for this anime..  The anime is given a lot of negative reviews... \r\n  The way the anime anime started was pretty slow... When it was put in Mystery genre , I kind of expected it to be like its predecessors (Detective School Q, Gosick etc) ... When it turned out the anime was nothing of that sort, I was fairly disappointed at first and even made me angry.  \r\n    Well you may be wondering why I gave it a rating of 9.. The first thing you have to do before you see thisanime is not to classify it as any other mystery animes... To be specific , the mystery genre has become a cliche.. It is well associated with thriller, horror etc and  as a result the very base of mystery has lost its meaning.. As I said earlier, this anime does not have anything like that and this is probably the main reason why people started to take the anime in a negative way. When it comes to mystery, people tend to have lots of expectations and if u invest huge expectations when u see this anime , u will feel let down just like me at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\n   To do justice, I felt like continuing the series and not to judge it by seeing a mere 4-5 episodes. Well to my surprise, I loved the anime..The short story arcs were beautiful. And the cases were equally intriguing. The anime kind of radiated a warm feeling through out.. The cases are mostly mundane as some one put it earlier. Well for a real mystery fanatic, it will not seem to matter. Apart from the  plot, the sound sort of gives a mysterious aura  and an uncomfortable feeling that it may reach to a point that you want to badly know the answer. The art was also good and I loved the characters a lot. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helps..(:(: Enjoy\\n",

            "content": "In retrospect, Hyouka only becomes a greater anime. My initial score was a 9. Now it's probably the most solid 10 I'll ever give.\r\nThe series is completely unpretentious and brilliantly executed. I know there are people out there who hate on slice-of-life anime because it's full of manipulative nonsense meant to make the viewer go 'aww'. Hyouka does none of that. Hyouka shows you why, ironically enough, considering the main character, ordinary life can be exciting and energising. That ordinary life, ordinary pleasures, ordinary amounts of logic, thinking, and effort can indeed result in something extraordinary.\r\nThe genius in Hyouka lies in its subtlety. The maincharacter, Oreki Houtarou, is determined to lead a lifestyle of serenity and peace, which involves expending as little energy as possible. The anime doesn't diverge from this - indeed, it is an atmospheric masterpiece attuned to the ideal world that Oreki craves. Everything is beautiful, everything moves slowly, and everything is surprisingly perfect. Even the most ardent of hearts will be calmed with Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nOreki's task is basically that of solving mysteries within a very human context. Unlike Detective Conan, the focus here is less on the how, and more on the why. Human motivations are what drive the mysteries in Hyouka, and its up to our indolent protagonist to solve navigate the thorny path. We are taught that truth is by no means necessarily good and is more likely painful. We learn why humans cause each other pain and grief. We are guided by KyoAni's steady hand.\\n\\n\r\nWe do so, because much like Chitanda Eru, the female lead - we are curious.",

            "content": "It\u2019s retro-review time again, and today I\u2019m going to be talking about an anime I was afraid to go back to because I was sure it wasn\u2019t going to hold up over time. And really, can you blame me? After sitting through so many coming-of-age/character-based anime that most people consider to be good, but I consider to be shit, Hyouka looked like a prime candidate for \u201cdon\u2019t believe the fans. It\u2019s nowhere near that good unless you\u2019re under that fanboy delusion that character interactions/development is good enough to entertain on its own\u201d. And you know what? I am not.\r\nIn fact, I\u2019ve come to really despisecharacter stories for the sake of character stories over time because I have enough boredom trying to examine my own miserable life and I don\u2019t need the f*cking Oscars to complicate said examination with their own shallow input, let alone anime. So whenever I hear praise regarding how Durarara is awesome because watching Vorona chat emptily on about how intelligent and violent she is, only for that exact same person to criticize the upcoming Yuki Nagato-chan anime because it contains the same empty conversations except replaced with nostalgia and moe, I feel the urge to ring my bullshit bell after swatting their head with the barf bag I just filled up. Who cares what the subject is about if both conversations are empty go-nowhere crap at the end of the day? I certainly don\u2019t. Just because \u201cmoe conversations\u201d set the bar so goddamn low doesn\u2019t mean I want to watch an entire show consisting solely of a travelling furry and his foxy love interest exchange romantic quips that is ultimately cock-teasing for a resolution we\u2019ll never get.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, what was I supposed to be talking about again? Oh right, Hyouka. Anyways, when this anime first arrived on the scene, it got a bit of a mixed response for its dull conversations and over-directed nature, but it was the latter that got me through the show because I was a lot more shallow when it first came out and the animation tricks along with the hilarity of the two males being the Clannad protagonists with better personalities was funny to me. I ended up loving the thing, considering it to be one of the few anime from KyoAni and 2012 that were actually good, but now that three years have passed and most of my revisited favorites had to get the axe, I was worried that Hyouka would join their ranks. And you know what? It almost did.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the banter was still indeed charmingly smart \u2013 although Chitanda might grate on some people \u2013 and the direction continued to be top-notch, the first seven episodes of the show fell under Steins;Gate syndrome of starting on a really dull note because said good aesthetics weren\u2019t being applied to anything the least bit interesting unless you\u2019re a fan of Houtarou flexing his thinking muscles and Chitanda wanting to revive the club because \u201cvague reason\u201d. Whilst a bunch of people have complained about the mysteries being weak, it\u2019s less the fact that the mysteries themselves are too simplistic and more the fact that the reasoning behind them was too simplistic. Because if murders and kidnappings were all that was needed to make a good mystery, we\u2019d be watching Kindaichi Case Files.\\n\\n\r\nNo, the problem with Hyouka\u2019s first few episodes is that the underlying story is one we\u2019ve seen before: the lonely introvert will get cured of his loneliness through the girl (and the other two members of the Scooby gang) with a mission and they\u2019ll fall in love. And just like mysteries, action, and character porn in general, romance for the sake of romance is really boring to me. There were few jokes and whilst there is some Japanese commentary mixed into the whole mess, it wasn\u2019t the kind of commentary that I cared for \u2013 and even when I found it kind of intriguing (Chitanda\u2019s family situation, the fact that you can\u2019t smoke in schools, etc.), it was surface-level stuff at the end of the day. But most damning of all, the mystery elements were just \u201cthere\u201d. You could have exchanged them for f*cking DDR elements and it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. Whilst I\u2019m not going to deny the character porn was good, that means nothing to me without a use for it.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, I realized the rewatch wasn\u2019t going too well and was worried that my only attachment to KyoAni from this point on would be an anime they made over a decade ago. So in desperation, I skipped ahead to the second arc, which I remembered being the point when the anime really clicked with me. And you know what? I liked it alot.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the \u201cplothole\u201d regarding why the students couldn\u2019t just ask the writer was noticeable \u2013 although it does eventually get addressed in a way that was semi-convincing \u2013 but otherwise, the second arc had a strong enough plot to support the great aesthetics because it actually bothered to instill some goddamn complexity into the thing. The movie arc actually examined the mystery tropes along with how people see them today, as well as brought our main character down a peg when he realized his brains can\u2019t outmatch beauty, which is the kind of substance that actually makes me give a shit regarding whether or not a film will be ready in time for the cultural festival, as well as the kind that will allow me to revisit your product again in the future. Also, it had a hilarious student-made film. It\u2019s like Shirobako if Shirobako had something resembling conflict.\\n\\n\r\nRelieved that the show wasn\u2019t completely lost on me, I ended up watching the school festival arc and enjoyed it just as much as last time because it had everything I could want in a coming-of-age/slice-of-life story: good pacing, interesting narrative tricks, engaging dialogue, and really relevant/interesting themes about talent, dreams, and the roles people play in the mystery genre underneath everything to give them a sense of weight. Enough praise has been written about that arc, so I won\u2019t go into detail regarding it other than it would be in my top 5 films of 2012 if it had actually been a standalone feature-length title. The final five episodes, on the other hand, were a bit of a mixed bag because they were supposed to function as random side stories to tie up loose ends and we all know how I feel about that sort of stuff in general. It\u2019s nice to see couples form and everything, but whilst that\u2019s what a lot of people like about Hyouka, that\u2019s not what I personally like about it.\\n\\n\r\nI like the show at its best because when it can, it mixes in all those fun character aesthetics into a plot that tickles my mystery-loving bone in a way that I want it to be tickled. It\u2019s all about context at the end of the day, and that\u2019s what separates the good (not just in the slice-of-life genre) from that godawful Steins;Gate movie. It\u2019s fine to like the show simply for those \u201cfun\u201d elements I described earlier, but let me reiterate that I don\u2019t do \u201cfun\u201d shows \u2013 unless they\u2019re Mobile Fighter G Gundam of course \u2013 because liking a show because it\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d is everything I consider wrong/weird about fanboys. What can I say? I\u2019m a huge believer in Sturgeon\u2019s Law, and when you define something as \u201cfun\u201d, you\u2019re using a reason that can be applied to 99.9% of all entertainment (with a 3.1% margin of error). Yes, even total dreck like Superman 64. Brrrrrrr.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, I still do like Hyouka - or to be more precise, the middle two arcs of Hyouka. Thankfully, they\u2019re separate enough from the arcs I find kinda dull that I don\u2019t have any guilt in pretending the show is a series of four films where the middle two sit among my favorite anime. Most people consider Jojo to be a favorite despite the fact that it only has one good arc that hasn\u2019t aged well at all (as of this writing). Babe: Pig in the City is a great movie and I couldn\u2019t care less about the first film. There are people who have no interest in seeing Urusei Yatsura that love the second film. And whilst I love Lupin, if you think I\u2019m going to watch all of it\u2026okay you get my point by now. It\u2019s not really \u201cit gets better\u201d with the later arcs so much as \u201cit gets different\u201d. I won\u2019t blame people if they don\u2019t care about the difference, but I personally do and that\u2019s all that matters, along with the undisputed fact that anyone who stills think Kuragehime is a good show is a raging nostalgia-blinded hypocrite.",

            "content": "-The following is a spoiler-free review-\r\n\"I'm curious, I can't stop thinking about it!\"\r\nThese words best described how I felt as I swept through the Hyouka series. Though initially slow, as I watched more and more episodes, I began to feel myself pulled into the curiosity of Chitanda Eru and the mundane school life of our protagonists, Eru and Oreki. By the end, I found myself personally enjoying the Hyouka series greatly and wishing for much much more. But here's a disclaimer; If you're looking for a thoroughbred Mystery or Romantic slice of life, you won't find it here. In the words of one of themain cast, (Fukube) - \"I won't be the best at anything, or rather, I've stopped trying to be.\" and these words fit Hyouka perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is not the heavy mystery we're typically used to seeing attached to that tag. There are no violent or ingenious crimes which require an equally ingenious protagonist to tackle, nor are there deep and dark underlying secret behind the characters' actions, neither are there floods of epic romance as with most other school / slice of life anime. But what Hyouka does succeed in is by maintaining a harmonious balance of the school life / mystery elements in a setting which we can consider completely average and mundane school life. And the lens through which it views the events which constitute this school life is what makes the show so amazing, albeit hated by some. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Let me get this straight. This is the kind of story you get from an average student plucked straight from school. There are no events which stick out all that much. It is an accurate portrayal of how one would expect a Japanese student to be. While this might be offputting for some, the way which these mundane daily tasks are viewed through the eyes of Chitanda and Oreki are what really makes the story shine. \\n\\n\r\nWhile most would just move through their day without even noticing such trivial matters, seeing them through the eyes of Chitanda and Oreki allow the viewer to see mystery in seemingly meaningless and small events, making the smallest of things, like a school rumour or a library book the subject of an entire adventure with its own backstory and explanations. And though trivial, the boundaries of the mystery is usually highlighted early and the evidence is presented to the viewers early as well, allowing the viewer to play along with the mystery if they wish to. Ultimately, the mysteries are well crafted without overstepping its boundaries as a school-themed mystery, though specific incidents were rather boring. (Such as the first 2...)\\n\\n\r\nHowever that being said, some arcs were also especially strong, particularly in my opinion the first arc and the third arc and may hit you slightly in the feels when you least expect it. All in all, a pretty well written story despite being completely average which still manages to achieve its goals, but suffers when the incident at hand fails to pique the viewer's interest or is simply too easy to solve. \\n\\n\r\nART: This quality of art is rarely seen in a slice of life anime. The reason being that slice of life is rarely an art or animation intensive genre unlike fantasy. Yet, the opening scenes of Chitanda's sparkling eyes and even in the OP, one can easily tell how much effort went into animating those scenes. The artwork is just gorgeous and the animation flows perfectly. You get exquisite detail and you can even see flowers and hair bobbing in the wind at some points.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I have no complaints with the sound. The sound complements the moods of the show well, and OP 1 is a particular favorite of mine. Yasashisa no riyuu is playlisted in my anime playlist and it's been stuck on repeat in my head for quite some time. Not forgetting Mikansei Stride (OP 2) and Kimi ni matsuwaru mystery (ED 2) which are also excellent and extremely fitting tracks in their own right. I draw a blank when trying to think of ED 1 though, I didn't particularly like it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: The characters I felt contributed to my enjoyment of this series greatly. Though initially they felt rather stereotyped or fitting into certain archetypes, after awhile their quirks began to differentiate them from the bulk of other characters. Who could mistake the sparkly eyed 'Kimi narimasu!' of Eru and the hair twirling sigh of Oreki. Their quirks made them enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses, we also begin to see the backgrounds of all 4 of the main cast, getting insights into their life, their past and their philosophies. More importantly, it allows you to see how the four of them grow as the Hyouka series progresses, particularly that of Oreki and Fukube. Seeing them grow made me really glad to have invested in those characters and their relationships with each other (Particularly Chitanda x Oreki), though I must say the inconclusive ending was rather disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: As someone who likes to think and immerse himself in the world of the characters presented, I found this extremely enjoyable and I constantly found myself trying to theorize the explanations behind the mysteries presented and extremely eager to click 'next' and find out more after every single episode. It was the perfect treat, stimulating my brain cells without me having to tax them ceaselessly, as such I enjoyed it greatly.\\n\\n\r\nWith all these factored in, what else is there for me to say. Hyouka has been one of the most enjoyable school-life / mystery anime which I've come across. It's definitely not the anime for everyone, but if you're into a more light-hearted mystery series with a hint of romance and school life, then you'll definitely enjoy it as much as I have.",

            "content": "Anime are known to usually be over-the-top no matter what genre they are. When I think of what makes anime great, I think of epic action, intense mind battles, heart-wrenching emotions, exciting drama, unrealistically awesome characters, and crazy plot twists.\r\nHyouka is none of that. It\u2019s nowhere near \u201cover-the-top\u201d in any way. Hyouka is the definition of subtlety. It\u2019s serene, relaxing, beautiful, funny, and smartly written. But the best thing about Hyouka is that it makes you think\u2014and not just about the mysteries.\r\nThe mysteries are small-scale cases that manage to be incredibly intriguing, causing you to become \u201ccurious\u201d. No, the writers don\u2019t try to instill inthe viewer a burning desire to figure out the solution\u2014they elicit from us a compelling curiosity that will drive us to want to figure the mysteries out. To me, sometimes mystery stories are so grand and dramatic that I feel like I can\u2019t solve them on my own. But in Hyouka, the understated enigmas are so accessible yet simultaneously complex. The peaceful atmosphere draws you in until you find yourself becoming the detective, trying to ascertain the truth. I thoroughly enjoyed this format for the mysteries\u2014it was a breath of fresh air from the mind-boggling conundrums of Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes. \\n\\n\r\nThough the mysteries are well executed, it\u2019s really the characters that shine in Hyouka. As the story progresses, each of the four main characters gradually undergo great changes in character. These changes are masterfully portrayed\u2014while most anime will just slap you in the face with character change, the evolution of these characters is so subtle and understated that you hardly notice it until the end\u2014which is when you\u2019ll look back on the series and marvel at the beautiful transformation the characters went through.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Hyouka is simply beautiful. In fact, it is the most beautiful animation I have ever seen. Technically, Fate/Stay Night\u2014Unlimited Blade Works has the best animation in terms of raw graphics, but Hyouka is more beautiful because of the idyllic, serene setting and picturesque locations. And the animations that visualize what Houtarou is thinking are bafflingly complex, creative, and artistic. Fate/Stay Night might have the better graphics, but Hyouka has superior artistic direction for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes in Hyouka are elegantly expressed. There are so many of them, but each is hidden well within the mysteries and character development. I love the way they are presented\u2014not like Naruto\u2019s \u201cNever give up!\u201d speeches that straight up pound the themes into you. The themes in Hyouka are quietly implied and are there for the viewer to pick up on if they think hard enough about it.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka encourages you to think through things that may seem trivial, and to find meaning in the mundane. It\u2019s when you get to the end of Hyouka that you realize that the whole anime was a hidden message that the author was encouraging the viewers to pick up on by analyzing the show, just like the main character analyzes other seemingly simple things. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you look back on the anime and realize the themes presented therein, you realize that while Hyouka may seem to be a simple anime on the surface, it is in reality a masterpiece of subtlety, beauty, and surprising depth.",

They have produced so much hype from their past original productions, from Fumoffu, Haruhi and Lucky Star to Clannad and K-on!\r\n*Take note that this review is just my first impression of Hyouka based on its first episode.I'll edit this only when the series is over :D:D:D*\r\nLet's proceed with the art first. Though it's the traditional style and swagger of a KyoAni production, I fell in love at the last scene of the episode where it was raining. The contrast is just.. so cool, like having anime character in a somewhat 'real' world. I guessthis is one of the few moments where I can just only see but can not describe.\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna go on and say an unnecessary opinion: the lead heroine looks like a hybrid of Mio (hair), Yui(body language and stature), and Ritsu(same voice actress) from K-on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked the most is the usage of some witty quotes that a lot of people can relate to. Of course, my favorite was Houtarou's life motto: \"I don't do anything I don't have to do; if I need to do something I do it quickly.\" Also, there's some classical music right here, yo. It's always kewl to have classical tracks be put in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I recommend that you watch Hyouka now, whether you're a mystery fan, got a hangover from \"Another\" or a fanboy of KyoAni. Expectedly, there was no plot development happening in the first episode, but I must say that the characters shown so far were introduced smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nI think that I'll rate Hyouka better if it proceeds with a little faster pace, though it was refreshing to find out that this mystery anime won't be episodic like Detective Conan (btw a classic detective mystery anime, mind you.)",

            "content": "Alright, just like many others, i've decided to give a review of Hyouka after I've finished watching the whole series. I'll stick to keeping the review spoiler free for the sake of interested users who haven't watched the series yet and just want an idea of what the anime is all about.\r\nHyouka is an anime that definitely starts off slow. We are introduced to our male lead called Oreki who seems to be devoid of passion of any sort as he just follows the same old boring routine everyday without having any interest in life. We are exposed to his way of life, as wellas his principles of energy conservation. His quote about himself sums it up nicely: \"I don't have to do anything i don't have to.\"\\n\\n\r\nJoining him in the classics club are Satoshi, his witty and knowledgeable sidekick, Mayaka who is a outgoing and friendly girl. Last but not least, the female lead Chitanda, who can be described in one quote, \"I'm curious!\" (watch the series and you'll understand why). At first glance, Oreki seems like the outliner among the group, considering that he is the only guy who is so unenthusiastic among all of them. The story starts when they try to solve the true mystery of the classics club from long ago...\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries in Hyouka are not your typical mysteries which are action packed, but they do give you a run for your money as the simplest of all matters can actually involve a lot of thinking behind it. The mysteries in Hyouka turn out to be pretty trivial matters at times (in fact, one of  the mysteries solved was just through a conversation between the two leads). However, what is impressive is how the characters show great thinking by analysing every nitty gritty before coming to the main conclusion (in which Oreki always wraps things up nicely). Events which seem insignificant at the start could just add up together and end up being the key to the entire mystery. When it all connects, you just have a \"wow\" feeling and find that the mystery aspect is really well-done.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing in the slice-of-life genre is the character development in my opinion. Hyouka has just the thing. The characters show changes after episodes and episodes of hanging out together. We start to see love in the air. We understand why Satoshi plays second fiddle to Oreki and is contented with not being the best, we understand why Mayaka is so determined in her feelings towards Satoshi as well as why she feels so strongly towards manga, we understand why Chitanda is so curious in finding out all these little mysteries that happen in their daily lives. Even Oreki gets influenced by the personalities of the 3 that he even takes the initiative to do certain things at later parts of the show, something which we would have never seen in the early episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself also touches on many aspects and themes. Expectations is one of them. Expectations are something heavy, whether it is placed on yourself or on others. Does having expectations on yourself motivate you to do things even better, or does the notion of having expectations of someone make you feel dejected and admit that you are no match for that person? Expectations is a theme that will be talked about in the show, albeit not the only one.\\n\\n\r\nThe other aspect i would like to mention is one's true feelings. When faced with an important choice you have to make, would you follow your heart and accept it with all you've got, or will you take the easy way out, afraid that if you accept something, you might make the mistakes you made in the past and screw things up. \"I am obsessed with being obsessed over nothing.\" After all, sometimes avoiding things is the easiest way out. However, is this truly the right decision to make? Sometimes, trying new things out might not be so bad after all. Following your true feelings instead of letting your head make the decisions might be better at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic in my opinion. The animation that left me in awe was the cherry blossoms under the purple sky, along with the flower petals flying around during the last episode (no spoilers =D). Plus, its KyoAni doing it, so details are generally well-done and will not disappoint viewers who use the art of an anime over its plot to determine its watchability (if there is even such a term, but i digress).\\n\\n\r\nBoth OPs and EDs are upbeat songs which suit the theme of the anime, which was honestly never meant to be dark despite it being of a mystery genre... They are really nice to listen to and somehow leave you addicted. (happened to me for the second ED.)\\n\\n\r\nI understand that some might be skeptical over how slow-paced Hyouka is compared to other series, but as the story progresses we start to have attachment to the characters since we start to relate to them already, thus enhancing the plot in the progress. So even if slice-of-life/mystery has never been your cup of tea, i still recommend giving Hyouka a go!\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is an anime that shines in how simple it is, yet so entertaining. The characters are only thrown in typical real life situations that have happened to us as well in one way or another, yet the mystery aspect does not feel any less dull despite that. The series being short and sweet appealed to me. As they say, \"Simplicity is beauty.\"\\n\\n\r\nWow, it has definitely been quite the long review. To sum things up, Hyouka was a series that kept be hooked from start to finish (me being a sucker for its genre). For fans of slice-of-life and mystery, there's nothing to hesitate about for i'm sure you'll be able to enjoy Hyouka! I hope this review was a good read as well as being informative to you, the reader. To end things off on a random note, my favourite characters are ironically the supporting characters Mayaka and Satoshi xD. Once again, hope you enjoyed this review!",

            "content": "Hyouka is a part slice of life, part mystery show about everyday occurrences. Starring a highly introverted and lazy male protagonist as well as his clubmates, the story revolves around the group of them together resolving small and seemingly insignificant \"mysteries\" taking place inside or close to the school. It can be anything from finding out who stole a book from the club room to who the culprit in a homemade amateur murder mystery film is. Nothing in this show really \"matters\" but rather it's all done merely for idle curiosity.\r\nInstead of writing a wall of text this time however, I've decided to break thisdown into a quick list of pros and cons for this show, as well as why you should or should not watch it:\\n\\n\\n\r\n--The Good--\\n\r\n\u2022\tFor once, a show that actually isn't a generic romcom despite the high school setting\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe mysteries are simplistic and therefore easy for everyone to understand\\n\r\n\u2022\tUtilizes many famous detective novels as basis for approaching the various riddles and puzzles\\n\r\n\u2022\tInteresting and original main characters\\n\r\n\u2022\tVery relatable protagonist that a lot of anime fans should be able to connect with\\n\r\n\u2022\tEccentric and funny female lead who keeps the series on its toes\\n\r\n\u2022\tGreat character development, you can clearly see all of the main characters change and grow over the course of time\\n\r\n\u2022\tEnjoyable character interaction, both in a comedic and in a serious sense\\n\r\n\u2022\tOutstanding animation quality (as you might expect from KyoAni)\\n\r\n\u2022\tGood choice of music which fits the atmosphere of the series very well, both when it's being light hearted and when it's being eerie and mysterious\\n\r\n\u2022\tNext to no fanservice\\n\\n\r\n--The Bad--\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe mysteries themselves are completely trivial and unimportant, and are solely resolved for the sake of curiosity but without any actual significance whatsoever, which may turn off a lot of people since none of it really matters in the end\\n\r\n\u2022\tOftentimes overdramatized, as the characters' reactions to the completely silly plot events can come across as cheesy, clich\u00e9 and just plain exaggerated\\n\r\n\u2022\tSomewhat repetitive story design, the plot itself never really improves as the show goes on\\n\r\n\u2022\tSlow pacing which drags down the actual entertainment value every so often\\n\r\n\u2022\tEpisodic \u2013 this is not necessarily a bad thing per se but for a mystery show I think the lack of any sort of overarching story is a bit disappointing\\n\r\n\u2022\tHighly unsatisfying ending which leaves a ton of questions unanswered\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hyouka is not really a typical mystery show but not really a typical slice of life or romcom either. It's something that tries to be all of them at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show for people who care a lot about relatable characters and to see them grow, as well as those who pay a lot of attention to an anime's production value as the actual presentation of this show is stunning. On the other hand if you're looking for a thrilling mystery show with a captivating plotline and a really good punchline, then I'd advise you to look someplace else. You are most certainly not going to find it here.",

            "content": "Too lazy to read this review? Yeah I know, just conserving energy.\r\nDrink an energy drink? Yeah I know, too tired to even opening the lid, just conserving energy.\r\nHoutarou Oreki is an energy-conserving boy who avoids non-compulsory activities at all costs. However, he joins his high school\u2019s classical literature club at the request of his sister to keep it from being disbanded. In the club, he befriends a girl with boundless curiosity named Chitanda Eru, whose personality is outwardly the opposite of his. Alongside his friends Satoshi and Mayaka, Oreki finds himself unwittingly dragged into activity by Chitanda\u2019s curiosity as they attempt to solve mysteries ineveryday life.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka started off way too slow, but that ended up ironically being its biggest strength. That, and a ton of other things, but your mileage does indeed vary.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka never conforms to one specific style of storytelling (compare the Kanya Festival arc versus Chitanda and Houtarou trapped in a shed), it never just sticks to the mysteries (indeed, my biggest complaint with this show was the assumption it was going to be a mystery show) but yet the constant references to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes) and other famous mystery writers are persistent. The characters started off a bit one sided, but eventually were given ample time for development. You never can pin down what Hyouka will do next, or how it will do it. Indeed, the biggest mystery in this show is the show itself. My answer to the question posed above: It is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is laid out with basically three major arcs, and all kinds of random episodic stories in between them. The episodic stories are nice and creative, but this series really sets itself apart in its multi episode arcs. The stories around them are simple, yet have very complicated stories behind them. They are full of people speculating different theories, and often getting things wrong. The storytelling takes a while to get going due to all of the slice of life put into it, but that allows it to put a ton of detail in these stories, examine everything on multiple layers, and the pay-off really manages to make use of its build-up.\\n\\n\r\nThe series features excellent music, voice acting and general sound work. From the extremely memorable two OP/ED songs to the general OST, Hyouka is just simply special and magical. To add to the already high bar set by the series, Hyouka features some of the Anime industry\u2019s most talented seiyuu. These amazing voices appear sometimes in no more than one episode minor roles, adding to a near magically performance and great believability to every character that appears on screen, for however long.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if it\u2019s an attention to detail you want, then Hyouka really delivers on that. Whether it\u2019s in the relationships between the characters, or the different environments. Kyoani\u2019s animation really brings those to life. The characters themselves are all teenagers who at first sight seem like the usual stereotypes, yet develop into completely different directions. There is one character who will probably get on people\u2019s nerves a lot though: Chitanda. She\u2019s well fleshed out in some areas, but also rather forceful. Or make that very forceful.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries that Oreki solves, tie directly into his own personal life, development and that of his friends. With every event, the characters, very organically grow and mature. At the same time, the story develops and builds on top of little events to create some really big pay off moments. When at its best, Hyouka truly shows what the Anime medium is capable, fusing intricate story-telling with amazing character development.\\n\\n\r\nFor all that Hyouka achieves, which, lets be honest at this point, is more than most anime series have achieved in the last few years, it does have one flaw that may prevent some people from being engaged with it. Hyouka is simply put a sophisticated piece of storytelling. Perhaps a bit too sophisticated at times? Basically, the series is at times unapologetic and feels slow. Like any great story, Hyouka slowly and carefully builds up to some truly amazing story and character moments. The issue is, that while there are a lot of good moments, there are truly only two stand out \u201cepic\u201d parts. The stand out parts of the series being both the Kanyaa Festival arc as well as the last two episodes of the series, add up to a total of two.\\n\\n\r\nLife definitely feels like its being \u201cled\u201d by the characters in the series. By the end of the series, each character has gone through a major character arc, and in the process, truly changed and grown as a person. While  the ending could be described as \u201copen-ended\u201d, it is, in fact the best kind of open-ended ending one can hope to find in anime. It brings the theme of the series full circle, and really shows how far all the characters have come.While there are definitely more novels to potentially adapt a second season from and continue the franchise, Hyouka is also one of those rare series that actually delivers a satisfying open-ended conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThough I agree sometimes the lack of actual consequence made the mysteries\u2026inconsequential, Hyouka gave me an appreciation for the long, twisting stories surrounding the ordinary things filling our day-to-day lives. Animation was brilliant, as to be expected, but Eru\u2019s eyes took character design to new level, something about those \\n\\n\r\nHyouka is a series of tremendous style, intelligence and wit \u2013 a series that indulges its own creativity and treats the audience with respect.  It\u2019s a series \\n\r\nexploding with heart. A heart full of intriguing characters, a heart with an eye for artistic beauty, a heart with a sense of restraint in music and a heart that always opened itself to our viewing pleasure.\\n\\n",

            "content": "A lot of people love Hyouka. The friend who recommended it to me adores it, and it was largely her introduction to anime. Therefore I came in with high hopes. Presentation wise, Hyouka lived up to those expectations. On a deeper level, however, I found this anime quite lacking.\r\nFirst, the good. The obvious draw is the animation. Kyoani went above and beyond for Hyouka, resulting in a fluid, recognizable style that looks enticing even when the characters are doing very little. The character designs are memorable, the backgrounds are beautiful and the colours are simply superb.\r\nThe next best part is the music. All openings andendings are nice, and the in episode music suits the theme very well. My only quibble is that some pieces are repeated a few too many times - this is mostly due to the 'monster of the week' mysteries, wherein there are 'mystery is discovered' and 'oreki monologue' music pieces. They're still nice, though, so I can forgive this easily.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the bad. I was excited to watch Hyouka as a lover of mystery stories and an avid reader of Agatha Christie novels. Unfortunately the mysteries are barely mysterious at all. The titular 'hyouka' mystery is the most interesting IMO, but it goes downhill from there into stuff like 'there's a book missing from the library' or 'why did our teacher say he liked helicopters?'. The smaller mysteries are boring and mostly insignificant, which disappointed me. It seems like Hyouka found itself in limbo between being a full-on mystery anime and being a slice of life anime, and found itself becoming a weird, slow hybrid.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem I had was the characters. I. Hate. Chitanda. I hate her with a burning passion. She is every moeblob character I've ever seen before, wrapped up into one clumsy, curious, irritating creature. Her breathy, high pitched voice was incredibly annoying and I couldn't stand her idiocy during mysteries. Satoshi was also underwhelming, and although he had some character growth he came off as flippant in a bad way. Oreki wasn't too bad, and I quite liked Mayaka, but I can't say I really loved any of them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hyouka was visually beautiful but otherwise did not live up to my expectations. I struggled to finish it, forcing myself through the last 5 episodes in a fit of grim determination. The last episode was a melancholy sendoff that, while beautiful, could not salvage this anime into something worthy of more than a 6/10. Sorry, Hyouka fans. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Don't watch Hyouka if you are a fan of mystery. Watch it if you're a fan of slice of life and don't mind plot-light storylines.",

            "content": "Hyouka isn't your typical mystery show with elaborate murders/thefts, or intricate schemes and traps, or intellectual battles of incredible depth. Instead, Hyouka gives us a more relaxed take on the genre, mixing elements of high school life with light mystery cases. These mysteries are better described as unusual circumstances or situations that leave an explanation to be desired. Hyouka follows the activities of the Classics Club, their involvement in various problems and situations, and the daily lives of its members and their relationships. From deciphering the meaning of the word \"hyouka\" to figuring out why all students who shopped at a certain store were calledto the school office, there are a plethora of puzzles the Classics Club takes upon themselves to solve. While it may not be the most event-filled or action packed show and can be considered dull at times, Hyouka's charm lies in its ability to be clever along with an interesting and likable cast of characters, and how their individual personalities and talents interact with one another as they tackle various mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nThe first member of the Classics Club is Oreki Houtarou, who at first glance, appears to be a simple unmotivated high school student with little to no aspirations other than getting through life in the most cost efficient manner possible. However, he is quite intelligent and has a knack for logical deduction and reasoning, although he isn't fully aware of it himself. He joins the Classics Club due to the request of his older sister, and treats it as simply another task he has to complete, but as a result gets more than he bargained for. However, as the type who won't do something unless he absolutely has to, what possible motivation would he have in putting in the effort to solve these mysteries when it conflicts with his very nature?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer to that question is our second member of the Classics Club, Chitanda Eru. A veritable ball of energy, she is described as \"a person that cannot be ignored\" according to Houtarou. The daughter of a distinguished family, her insatiable curiosity often forces Houtarou to quench that curiosity with a logical explanation. She serves as the foil to Houtarou's personality, and pulls him out of his comfort zone and shows him how life doesn't have to be a series of bothersome tasks. A polite and talented girl who excels in academics, she joins the Classics Club to discover a certain truth.\\n\\n\r\nJoining the Classics Club as our third member is Fukube Satoshi, Houtarou's middle school friend and the one known as a walking database. Jack of many trades but master of none, he encourages Houtarou to use his talents and realize his potential while hiding his own feelings of insecurity about his own abilities. He joins the Classics Club to humor Houtarou and keep him company. While on the outside he appears to be a cheery troublemaker and handyman, his issues with confidence and struggle with who he wants to be constantly worries a certain girl who's had an unrequited crush on him since middle school.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, we introduce our fourth and final member of the Classics Club, Ibara Mayaka. A girl who enjoys reading and drawing manga and giving her friends endearing nicknames, she serves as the foil to Satoshi's personality. Whereas Satoshi is indirect and not honest with himself, Mayaka is more straightforward and blunt, and pushes Satoshi to be more sure and confident in himself and his abilities. She joins the Classics Club due to her interest in Satoshi.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is broken up into various arcs with a couple of standalone episodes. Other than the first arc, Hyouka does not have a set end or goal in mind, and oftentimes the plot involves some mystery the group stumble upon, and the process in which they solve that mystery. Thus, Hyouka's biggest selling point lies within the dialogue between the characters. It reveals how each character approaches a problem, and their mindset on how to solve that problem. I personally found Houtarou's thought process and logic quite clever and was a large factor in my enjoyment of the show. The mysteries do seem to lack substance and motivation, and it does become tiring to hold interest at times, but at the same time, others were clever and creative and were enough to keep me watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, in typical KyoAni fashion, is hit or miss for a lot of people. However, the fact that it is well animated and fluid means it is pleasant to watch. The animations for the deduction process in particular were impressive and creative. The music is a typical high school slice of life soundtrack. As Hyouka is fairly uneventful, the music is quaint and appropriate. I found myself watching the OP and ED every episode; they are quite creative and catchy, with some nice animations.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an adrenaline filled, high drama mystery show, look elsewhere. Hyouka's relaxed atmosphere and logical nature may seem to make for a boring show, but if you put in the effort to understand and appreciate the dialogue and logic, it's certainly worth the watch.",

            "content": "Hyouka is perhaps one of the most beautifully-captivating anime I've ever seen that has much to do about nothing. Of course, that's a very odd way of stating what this anime is, but generally speaking, this is probably the best anime I've ever seen that doesn't have a major conflict. To me, that's interesting considering this is considered to be a mystery. \r\nOverall, this anime does not have many flaws and has many strengths. I would even go so far to say that it is probably the best anime I have seen in 2012. \r\nSo what makes this anime so good? The perfect combination ofinteresting, unique, and likable characters in mild-mannered, soft-toned story that has some of the best production value I have seen thus far in 2012.\\n\\n\r\nHere's how I rated each category...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThe story of this anime I'd consider to be the weak point...but that's not saying much. The story revolving around the characters of the Classics Club was still interesting. I thought some of the mysteries that they solved/tried to solve were pretty interesting, while others felt a little forced and a little off the beaten path (like the mystery of the school supply store and the mountain-climbing teacher mystery). I do feel those mysteries still did their job in the character-building department, but as for the overall narrative, seemed pretty lacking. However, it's only a minor complaint to what I consider to be a very strong narrative about a group of close-knit students. There really isn't much conflict in this story, however, despite that, I consider the story to be quite strong despite a lack of conflict.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is by far the most artistic and beautifully animated anime I have seen this year. The artwork and character design was second-to-none and the use of color during the events scenes/thought scenes were great. I think the best part about this anime though was the artistic expression of Oreki's thought process. It was extremely imaginative and added a flavor to the scenes that might otherwise rub off as boring. Even the character/setting designs were very well done and the use of facial expressions were very well drawn. There was nothing \"cartoonishly\" animated about this anime. All of the expressions seemed realistic and that in itself is refreshing to see in anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music was gorgeous. It fit the mood perfectly in every way. I found the implementation of classical music with this anime's own unique tracks created a beautifully crafted soundtrack. Honestly, if they came out with a soundtrack for this anime, I think I'd buy it just for it's smooth, relaxing flow. Even the OP and ED songs were great and fit the anime perfectly. I'm sort of linking this with the artwork, but the artistic expression along with the beautiful music for both OPs and EDs for this anime were just gorgeous. Even watching these 1 1/2 minute segments can be just as entertaining as watching a full episode (and that is not an insult of the episodes). The voice acting was spot-on perfect. The main cast of Yuuichi Nakamura (Oreki), Satomi Satou (Eru), Daisuke Sakaguchi (Satoshi), and Ai Kayano (Mayaka) were perfectly casted in their roles. I honestly can't think of who would've made a better cast for these roles. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nWhile I did mention that the cast was perfect for the roles, the roles themselves were very good. Oreki made for an interesting protagonist. He was sort of a unique role for an anime protagonist where he wasn't exactly charming and charismatic. He was sort of a slouch who cared more for energy-conservation and a bland use of emotion. That might sound in itself boring, but its integration with the rest of the characters made it interesting and watching Oreki's character evolve and progress made for an interesting watch. However, I'm sure the fan favorite (and rightfully so) is Eru. Her character in this anime was the very definition of moe. Her appearance, her actions, her personality, her expressions, everything about her was extremely adorable and it was refreshing to see a lead female character with this sort of personality. Even Satoshi and Mayaka made for some interesting \"friend\" characters, with Satoshi being the energetic and outgoing best friend of Oreki, and Mayaka being the tsundere and boisterous female friend/love interest of Satoshi. The side characters were also very well done. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was an extremely enjoyable anime and I was very close to giving it a 10 (just by a hair). I was a little mixed toward the ending but it seemed very beautiful in its own right. It did enough where it could make a sequel (which there is more content in the light novel to do so) or they could leave it be. All-in-all, Hyouka went a little different direction than your typical modern day anime. It implemented the mystery genre with the monotony of real life. One comment I made to a friend of mine while watching it was it is nice to see an anime take a realistic approach for once. The story, the characters, the plot, everything about this feels real. This might be a tough watch for someone who likes conflict in their animes but for those who love a dynamic group of characters in a real-life atmosphere, this is a must watch.",

            "content": "It's doesn't matter how the sound is, or the quality is in an anime. What matters is how the anime impacted on the viewers. How it leaves an impression for its viewers. And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.\r\nFor anyone who is thinking about watching Hyouka. I won't say any spoilers. I hope my review will pique your interest on watching this anime.\r\nSeems pretty common right? 2 guys and 2 girls. Nothing wrong with that. You already know what's going to happen. But that is just only a part of the show. They solve mysteries. YESS Mysteries. Not the boringkind where someone dies and you have to find the culprit. This mystery kind of anime happens to be simple in its own way. It  mainly revolves around the school, and other places as well.\\n\\n\r\n The 4 friends join together in a club for their own reason, and it turns out, 3 characters has their own knack for playing a role in solving mysteries. \\n\\n\r\n Oreki Houtarou happens to have the brains to solve mysteries, and joined the classics club because of a request from his siste. Houtarou, himself just goes through life because he's lazy at everything he does. Turns out there is more to high school then he thought. As time goes by, he will soon find out that there are things he doesn't realize himself.\\n\\n\r\n Fukube Satoshi, the \"Date Base\". Satoshi is a friend that somehow understands Houtarou more than Houtarou does himself, that goes for Houtarou's sister. He was friends with Houtarou and Mayaka since middle school. And is also the guy that is the brightest out of everyone. Though he is always a happy go person. There are things in life he just can't do. \\n\\n\r\n Chitanda Eru, the one that will not let Houtarou get away from a mystery when something interests her. She became friends with the 3 of them because of the classics club. There is more to her than what you would think.\\n\\n\r\n Ibara Mayaka, friends with Houtarou since Elementary, and Satoshi since middle school, She joined primarily due to Satoshi being a member. She also has a crush on Satoshi since middle school. Satoshi usually just brush her feelings aside with a joke. But what she is oblivious too is that Satoshi reciprocates her feelings and that makes him hesitant to act upon. Due to that she restrains her emotion.\\n\\n\r\n The simplicity of the mystery is what you would sometimes find in your daily lives. What do you do if there was a mystery? You would try to find out why that happen or how that happened right? and sometimes we just give up and wait for the answers. Hyouka won't let you down. It will even get you to solve the mystery with them.\\n\\n\r\nThough it's not all about mystery. Each friends have something in there past that makes them who they are. Houtarou himself is just someone who doesn't understand himself. Just going through life until something in his life will change. \\n\\n\r\nI would say relationship plays a big role in Hyouka. Since you need others to better understand ones self. You may think you would understand yourself the most. But there are things that you yourself won't realize it until someone points it out to you. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all. I love this anime. I even bought the set. It has a great opening and ending. I already knew once I saw the opening that it was going to be good. It's not common to watch an anime like this. I hope you guys will watch it, cause I know I'll definitely re-watch it with one of my friends.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(+) Well-done conventional character design. Nothing super exaggerated like the chibi-style in Mahou Shoujo or the large-face huge-eyes in Higurashi. \r\n(+) Good attention to detail as in befitting of a 2013 anime and consistent animation quality as far as I observe.\r\n(+) Some innovative ideas to capture viewer interest like the bizarre floating gears while Oreki(protagonist) is thinking which is somewhat reminiscent of those in OP of Stein's Gate and Chitanda's(main girl) trademark shiny purple eyes and catchphrase \"\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\uff01\".\r\n(+) Interesting characters with the coveted 'development' that is so over-hyped on MAL but whatever, it's there. Also very well-timed introduction of characters throughout the series so asnot to overwhelm but also managing to add flavor when it is desired. Oreki(protagonist) impresses while managing not to be overpowered by making mistakes now and again.\\n\r\n(+) Mysteries are well-done, well-paced, well-thought, and generally believable while managing not to be predictable.\\n\r\n(+) Very captivating central arc and climax.\\n\r\n(+) Almost no fan-service signifies a no-nonsense and serious approach of the producers.\\n\\n\r\n(-) Music is not particularly outstanding. For me, I just skipped all the OPs and EDs because they failed to interest me. BGM fits in but not really exceptional like that of F/SN, NHK ni Youkoso!, GITS etc.\\n\r\n(-) Being episodic, some episodes tend to be a bit boring and I had to prevent myself from falling asleep in one of them.\\n\r\n(-) In a few parts the reasoning was confusing and I had to replay to try and understand what was happening.\\n\r\n(-) While they did faithfully stick to 'character development/growth', a point so often belabored by critics, I feel some of it was a little overdone. Just a little. Hyouka has the full potential of being more plot-driven than character-driven without having to pander to the expectations of said critics.\\n\r\n(-) Chitanda's voice is just shrill enough to cross the line of annoyance. Sigh...\\n\r\n(-) Some small portions unexplained even in the end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nA very interesting episodic, detective anime with almost everything done right. It is able to combine the beauty of Byousoku and the intrigue of GiTS(just examples that occurred to me) while retaining the interesting elements of slice-of-life/high-school drama to make a very well-done piece. Why hesitate? Join the Classics Club in their adventures and immerse yourself in some of the most engaging high-school mysteries right now!",

            "content": "\"The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.\u201d\r\n-Sherlock Holmes\r\nIn a world dominated by streamlined genres, few times does a series truly differentiate itself enough not to conform to rules subconsciously set out by the masses. Slice of life is perhaps the genre with the most to say, because it really conveys parts of our everyday \"lives\". However, many are quick to disassociate from this \"genre\" because the thought of watching an animated version of themselves completing repetitive, mundane tasks sounds like the farthest thing from entertainment. Hyouka seeks to mold an immersive experience by adding a lens to lookat the lives of the characters through. This lens, or mystery sub-genre exists as a conduit to explore the depths of the main four character's development. An anime appreciable in multiple perspectives, Kyoto Animation creates a visually stunning masterpiece that holds more weight than I could've possibly anticipated.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka wastes no time illustrating how different life can appear based on perspective. Oreki Hotaro lives life in the most pragmatic way possible. Going out of his way to do something or help someone would only waste energy, a concept he's not willing to validate. He reluctantly joins the Classics Club at his sister's request at the rumor that it could be shutdown due to low membership.\\n\\n\r\nEverything changes when he meets Eru Chitanda.\\n\\n\r\nThe sequence when Hotaro first meets Chitanda is one of the most beautifully choreographed anime scenes I have ever watched. The entire scene is shown though Oreki's eyes, really emphasizing the perspective aspect i mentioned previously. The way it is animated embodies the feelings of seeing your true love for the first time. What transpires afterward is a truly remarkable journey of self realization, love and curiosity.\\n\\n\r\nMany have been quick to judge (myself included) Hyouka's main plot for being \"pointless\" or \"mundane\". Sure, the execution is brilliant, but the surface subject matter isn't all that exciting. I mean, who really cares how the writer of a school club video's script wanted the story to end or why a student got called to the teacher's office after class? When I said the mystery genre exists as a lens to view the story from, I truly meant it. The mysteries themselves are not the main point of the series, but a catalyst to unearth the character's strengths and emotions. It's not all that exciting. That being said, Hyouka is a series best watched with an open mind, free of distraction, since the most you'll be getting out of it wont necessarily smack you in the face with sensationalized content.\\n\\n\r\nTo expound on the matter of perspective, Hyouka's messages can mean something entirely different depending on who's listening. That's not to say it's ambiguous, since there is no correct answer regarding its themes. It's entirely subjective, and a valid argument could be formalized in many respects. Hyouka can be about the power of observation, social hierarchies, growing up or even self identification, whichever suits the viewer. The narrative is honestly up to you. The mystery aspects actually detracted from my overall enjoyment after awhile. I ended up caring more about the characters than the overall point of the story. Without giving too much away, the ending was both dissatisfying and perfect at the same time. It was a juxtaposition of expectations versus reality, and it couldn't have been better written.\\n\\n\r\nSome anime develop characters to suit a progression of plot, and are reverted back after the arc has concluded. Great character development separates itself from the flippant by creating a gradual change in a character's overall emotions and personality. This is what we witness regarding the characters of Hyouka. Chitanda evolves her innate curiosity by exploring the reasons for why people do what they do, while using Oreki as an aide. Oreki's apparent feelings for Chitanda make helping her an obligation, she's someone \"he just can't ignore.\" With Chitanda's help, Oreki goes from avoiding wanting to assist others to actively pursuing it on his own. Perhaps the most important example of his change throughout the series is with the tree from the beginning and end of the series. His perception and feeling towards this image changes from disdain to hopeful, without even realizing it.\\n\\n\r\nSatoshi reminds me quite a bit of myself at a similar point in life. He often puts on a facade by acting cheerful, but his inner feelings bubble over from time to time, with the viewer getting a first hand view of the struggle of silencing your emotions. He's a self-proclaimed database who plays second fiddle to most, interjecting helpful tidbits as necessary and not to disturb the ebb and flow. He and Mayaka never get closure, but more of acceptance with their roles in the grand scheme of things. They realize how it can be better to settle than to aim for the stars. This kind of bothered me due to their age in the anime. From personal experience, sometimes the most seemingly insignificant individuals get the biggest breaks. It's the hope that keeps things alive. At 14, it may be a tad early to rule yourself down for the count.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about Kyoto's animation in Hyouka. It's nothing short of breathtaking. When studios have this high of a quality, it's possible to emphasize the mood or theme of a series based on its art... Almost like creating its own aura. From the initial exchange between Chitanda and Oreki to the almost experimental animation shown while exploring the character's various hypotheses, Hyouka continuously produces stimulating imagery, entrancing the viewer. It may be one of the best looking anime in existence. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also a must download. The alternative takes on classical music tracks close the gaps in the series' environments. There are few shows I can say that I've skipped back to enjoy the melodic ambience Hyouka's music creates. Simply remarkable. Voice acting is above average, and the second OP does something relative to shows like Barakamon: it tells a story. Most of the time, anime OP and EDs exist as nothing more than to showcase the various characters in a sensory overload. Hyouka was a nice change of pace.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Hyouka? Well, although I initially didn't care for it, the outstanding characterization and art caused it to grow on me. If you're looking for a suspenseful mystery show because of its listed genre, you might want to look elsewhere. Sure it has the added flair of Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie, with \"whodunit\" mini arcs, but that isn't the meat of the show. Hyouka is a masterpiece for the right frame of mind, but can be overlooked as a dull, pointless dud if you watch it at the wrong time. Again, it's all about perspective. Don't make the same mistake I almost did and write it off. I enjoyed Hyouka for what it was, but I can't say it was the most \"enjoyable\" show. It's not necessarily something you binge through. A few episodes a night make its viewing experience one you'll surely remember for many years.",

            "content": "Ok, I've just finish watching this 22 episode anime, so what can I say? Ok, let's get down to business:\r\nStory: Very Good 8.\r\nWhat I like about the story is the simplicity itself, it doesn't have anything fancy like we always see the school and mystery genre really did played well. Though, this anime may have a romance genre, it isn't much of a true romance since neither Oreki nor Chitanda ever declared their love for each other nor did anybody made an effort to express it. Though there were some gestures that Chitanda has feelings for Oreki. The romance part belongs to Fukube and Ibara,since it was Ibara who did express her feelings for Fukube in a form of chocolate shape heart.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI'm no art critic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nSince I like both the 2nd opening and closing theme and I do find Chitanda's voice cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, enjoyment and overall: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nOk, the title \"Hyouka\" maybe a bit off since it literally means \"Frozen Delights\"  which can be a pun for \"I Scream.\" The character's of this anime are more of wishy washy bunch because one would hate them at one point then in another point one will love them, like Oreki being a slacker at one point to being a smart guy at another, Chitanda, you'll be piss at her for her curiosity and her constant pestering of Oreki but in another point you'll love her cuteness and her tenacity. As for Fukube and Ibara, I really do like that they have a romantic arc from the very first episode of this anime. Enjoyment? I guess what's really enjoyable is the arc that we the audience were hoping for a romantic arc between Oreki and Chitanda, but alas, all we have is more of gesture than an actual arc, also, I would never understand as to why Oreki's elder sister was not given a face, now c'mon that character does deserve a face.... a very cute face. Overall, this is one anime that doesn't need to have some fanservice to sell, co'z the simplicity of this anime's production already suffices everything.        \\n\\n",

            "content": "Just finished this anime and wanted to write a review till the feelings it gave me are still fresh.\r\nSo!\r\nStory: 9\r\n If you're looking for a \"normal\" high school slice of life then Hyouka might be or may be not what you're looking for. Either way, it is quite enjoyable and you will be drawn to it right from the first few episodes. (mostly if you're a fan of mysteries). The best part about Hyouka is that the author didn't try bringing in ridiculous and impossible mysteries which can be somehow explained thanks to some demonic or magical force. No. This is all about development, astory where \"normal life\" turns out to be interesting with all the rumors, object disappearances or hidden reasoning and feelings high school students might have. Also it gives off an important lesson: everybody has a hidden talent, being it skills at observing and memorizing or putting different ideas together to resolve a certain situation or even knowing bits of everything and be a human database, but even so many would fail to see what they're really good at.\\n\r\nI gave it a 9 though because at the end of it all something just felt incomplete. But not necessarily. Maybe I was just sad it ended. xD \\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\\n\r\nTypical KyoAni. Which is really good since I tend to love all animes KyoAni put their hands on. The angles, the sceneries (like the sky, water, trees) but also expressions and the focus they put on the characters' eyes was just amazing from my point of view. The art is pretty soft too and tries to avoid contorted faces and unusual movements as much as possible. The openings are also pretty original, like the water droplets on the images which made Hyouka's first opening my favorite of the season.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI gave a 10 to the sound. Why? Well because i just couldn't help but replay some scenes because the damn music was so intense. And Hotarou's explanations would just become more epic because of that music. A kind of horror-like soft song that sends both anticipation and suspense. There was another track that would start playing right after or when a character would make a personal confession which also felt pretty intense and almost like you can get the idea of how the character really feels. OP-ED included too, outstanding sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe development all the characters got in only 22 episodes That's why the characters get a 9. The first episodes seemed like they stabilized stereotypes as the 4 main characters and this is how they'll be for the entire series. well no. They all change. They all go through a constant changing, because of what happens around them or the people they meet so at the end of the series you just can't help but smile thinking of how many characters we might have initially misjudged. Hotarou, the main and his friend, Satoshi, I think went through the biggest changes of heart. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nAll those things above said, are you even wondering why I gave a 9 to enjoyment? xD I would have given it a 9,5 but MAL doesn't allow half votes unfortunately.",

            "content": "Hyouka is a different from a lot of the anime series being released these days, it doesn't try to go over the top, it's slow paced and can be very refreshing to watch. The series definitely isn't flawless but as a whole, Hyouka is a piece of art.\r\nThe plot is pretty simple, the characters live a regular life, go to school and solve mysteries that pop up every now and again. Some of the mysteries span for several episodes but most of them are only an episode in length. Although the plot may not seem all too exciting, Hyouka does a real good job atexecuting each mystery and pacing them. Some people may feel that the series moves too slowly but I disagree. The pacing is slow at times but most of the time the pacing of the series is just right. The series also does a really good job at balancing story and character development as it is not extremely focused on one or the other. The mysteries themselves aren't very special, and some of them just come out of nowhere. However, because of the way the characters solve it and the ordeals the characters go through when solving it, they become very enjoyable to watch. Hyouka does suffer from a slow start, as some of the first mysteries in this series can get very boring and aren't too impressive. However, overall Hyouka executes most of it's mysteries very well, and although most of mysteries themselves aren't very exciting, everything else Hyouka does makes them interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a strong point of this series. The main male protagonist, Houtarou Oreki is a very unique character, his principle is \"I don't do anything I don't have to. What I have to do, I do quickly\" because he wants to conserve his energy. Also from a knowledge standpoint, he doesn't have all the answers but his deductive reasoning and analytical skills are just amazing. His trait alone makes him very appealing as it separates him from male protagonists in most other series. Houtarou also gets a fair amount of development throughout the series. As he is \"forced\" to solve these mysteries, he begins to get curious himself and no longer has to be pushed to solve mysteries. Because of this, Houtarou also starts to compromise his own energy conservation principle. While this is all happening, he begins to develop a crush on the main female protagonist, Eru Chitanda.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female protagonist, Eru Chitanda has a less unique character than Houtarou, she is very polite, energetic and a bit of an airhead even though she is a top student.She is also shown to be a very caring person. Also when she gets curious she gets all up in Houtarou's face and won't stop until he agrees to solve the mystery. Some people may find her annoying but at the same time,she is very important to Houtarou's development because of the way she pushes him. Eru herself, also develops through out the series (but not as much as the other characters), as she learns to hold some of her curiosity back. At first she holds a great admiration towards Houtarou but later this develops intro a crush.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Houtarou and Eru is done very well. As the series progresses they get closer and develop crushes for each other. The development of their relationship is not rushed which makes it seem more natural. Although many would have liked to have seen their relationship go all the way (I was one of these people), it is far more realistic that it didn't because it would have been a bit forced and not natural at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, Satoshi Fukube and Mayaka Ibara are also very noticeable. They each undergo some development such as Satoshi, developing a jealousy towards Houtarou, and Mayaka who's relationship with her other club (the manga society) also changes. They are both likable in their own way, and are probably some of the best side characters I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just outstanding, everything is very well drawn, the movements are smooth and it creates a wonderful atmosphere for Hyouka. The abstract artwork used as analogies to represent the situation that the characters are in is what really blows you away though. Words cannot describe how amazing the animation. Kyoto animations, you have impressed me once again.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka also presents also has a very good soundtrack, the background music always matches the scene and help give the events more of an impact. The voice actors do a really good job presenting the characters. The openings match the mood of series and are both great to listen to. The second ending also really matches the mystery theme of the anime. The first ending however, isn't something that really goes with the series and I really don't see a point of it being there. Other than that there is nothing bad to say about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is a great series because it is different from most anime out there. Some people may be turned off by it's pace and the simplicity of the mysteries. However it has a wonderful balance between characters and story and the characters themselves are great too and because of all this, Hyouka is a very memorable series.",

            "content": "Hyouka is a mistery anime made by KyoAni and consequently being the best show they ever made.\r\nNow dont get me wrong when I say its the best show of KyoAni it doesnt mean its a good show, however KyoAni is so full of crap that even a show like Hyouka manages to mark their place as the best one.. And yes I consider\r\nit to be better than CLANNAD the first season and its probably on the same level has the 2nd one\r\nStory:\r\nBased of a very famous light novel by Yonezawa,Honobu called Koten-bu stories, Hyouka is basically a spin off with the same characters and story,the original material is known for their said engrossing writting and complex themes wich can be higly regarded by other people has a \"masterpiece\" wich in this person opinion is far from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace of the story is incredebly slow, it doesnt do much in the 22 eps that its composed off, most of the events are overshadowed by the constant use of filler scenes or just minor-fanservice however the themes in the show are \\n\r\nstill decently handled. The thought of turning a mistery theme into classroom shenenigans was not a bad idea however since you\u00b4re posi-\\n\r\n-tive and you already predict that nothing major will happen the tension is very lacking and there isnt much excitement since most of the proposed misteries are like \"who put a rat on that kid\u00b4s schoolbag\".. It comes of has a show about a bunch of teens playing detective, I did like the misteries, despite having no tension whatsover it still managed to make me care, the atmosphere in the show is astonishing and very subtle wich is basically 2 major tropes I enjoy in anime. The 2nd cour of the anime was basically filler since the over arking mistery had already been solved, so the 2nd cour is just filler with some minor misteries just to feed the fans something.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was mind blowing, both backgrounds, details and other related stuff, those moments wich took place in  oreki\u00b4s mind where his emotion were being expressed trough art were actually quite ingenious.. Being probably the most high budget show of KyoAni it definetly helped enchacing the experience wich blended with the tone and the subtletly of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nMost of the sountrack are from other artists such has bach wich while not being original in the very least it fits the show like a glove and generally the soundtrack has a great coreography has it gives off a great aura wich contributes to the atmosphere\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI consider the characters to be the most important factor of an anime, and in Hyouka\u00b4s case they are either plot devices or are there for the sake of it.. Focusing on Oreki who is a minimalistic relate-to-me character who is strangely fresh comparing to the other characters of the its kind  due to his internal monologues and unexplained sharp and wise mind, he doesnt have a backbone has he is easily influenced by people, then theres CHitanda who is a plot device whose only purpose is to give motivations to the motivationless main character, Satoshi was a good character has he actually had a good characterization and development  wich made me happy I have nothing to say about Mayaka other than being a sexually confused teenage girl who hates Oreki for some reason. The side characters are there just to take part in the mistery and then again they\u00b4re just plot devices.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nNow your question is.. Is Hyouka worth watching ?? Well I guess so? If you like slow atmospheric slice of lifes with romance sprinkles and mistery,\\n\\n\r\nthen you\u00b4ll love it otherwise it will be really boring.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for watching and tell me your opinion in the comments below\\n\\n\r\nGood Things:\\n\\n\r\n- Great Art\\Animation \\n\r\n- Amazing Atmosphere\\n\r\n- Voice Acting is fitting and good\\n\r\n- Despite being School themed misteries they are still thrilling to say the least\\n\r\n- Satoshi\\n\\n\r\nBad Things:\\n\\n\r\n- 2nd half is pratically filler\\n\r\n- Pace might turn some people off\\n\r\n- There is no tension in the dilemmas whatsoever despite being interesting\\n\r\n- Characters are forgetablle for most part.\\n\r\n- Slow pace is slow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hyouka is a visual masterpiece. From Kyoto Animation, you wouldn't expect anything less from this studio in their works on K-On, Nichijou, and Clannad.\r\nArt- 10/10\r\nFrom detailed character expressions to beautifully crafted scenery, Hyouka has it all. I've been captivated on how much detail is drawn on every character. The anatomy of hands, wrinkles on their clothes, to the strands loose of hair on their backs. The animated mystery visuals are handled so smoothly.And the way this anime skillfully uses colors ,shading, and contrast to their environments to fit the tone on each and every scene. So much effort is put into the animation, that youcan't help but stare in awe in each and every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\r\nVoice acting was exceedingly one of the best parts of Hyouka.  With a cast that includes Nakamura Yuuichi (Clannad, Durarara!, FMA:B, etc.) and Sakaguchi Daisuke (Clannad, Baccano!, Gintama, etc.) You can hear each actor put so much skill and emotion through our animated characters. In terms of music, the soundtrack is great, with various elegant classical pieces played throughout the series.The openings have also been one my favorite songs this anime season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10/10\\n\r\nThis is what drives Hyouka. From the beginning, each character is set in their own way.  They have likes, dislikes, fears, interests, strengths, and weaknesses. It doesn't stick to character stereotypes. The dialog is smart, funny, and rather refreshing. But now what Hyouka handles so skillfully, that most animes aren't able to accomplish, is character development. This anime is driven by the characters . Each Mystery Arc will develop these characters. The differences in development will be small, but incredibly significant enough for you to realize the romance and interactions of the characters have been handled so smoothly and realistically that you can't help but call it amazing. \\n\\n\r\nStory- 9/10\\n\r\nThis might be called Hyouka's weak point, because Hyouka is considered to be a Slice-of-Life/Mystery show, a combination you rarely see. It's not a based with a large plot, but divided and driven into Arcs, each a differently unique mystery added inside them. A twist to the anime mystery genre, mostly about conspiracies and murders, Hyouka takes a different approach. These mysteries are not driven as to \"Who did it?\", but as to \"What happened?\" and \"How did it happen?\". All intricately designed. I found myself caring for things I didn't care about before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall- 10/10 \\n\r\nWhat Hyouka made me realize is that you don't need plot and big, world-ending problems to be a great anime. It can be driven by the characters and their life, their stories, interactions, and experiences. The way it weaves a world filled with people who you actually grow to care about, that in the end,  hate to part ways.The fact that I was never let down in each episode, is truly miraculous. Hyouka is a great ride, and if you would give it a try, i'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed.",

Now, ifthey can keep this going for 20+ episodes without getting dull is a different story.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\\n\r\nHyouka excels when it comes to Art. Clean lines, perfect lighting, cut shadows. It does everything immaculately. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said that it's the best animated show this season so far. But the point is, Hyouka does quite amazing things with it's art, in that it fully emphasises it with long cuts and off-angle shots reminiscent of \"5 Centimetres per Second\" and \"Bakemonogatari\". What can we expect from KyoAni?\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nBumped this down a score simply because I think the use of Classical works in the anime (such as in Episode 3, my Favourite; Air on the G) feels forced and out of place. They use the music at the wrong time, during the wrong scene and I don't really think it fits in with the Anime at all. They seem to want to add them because they somehow create an air of \"intelligence\" or \"exclusiveness\" to the Anime; which I think is wrong. The original work besides that isn't anything special that has stuck in my head yet. \\n\\n\r\nJust now realised there isn't an OP. Don't know what to make of that. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, voice acting. Very good. It's only when you start actively noticing (and enjoying) a character's voice that you know a voice actor's done well. In my case, Chitanda. I'm a sucker for moe. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8\\n\\n\r\nBesides the fact I do not like the Protag in the slightest (most lame, overused excuse for a character insert I've seen), the other 3 are actually quite well made. They each have their own likeable aspects. Of course, we're only 3 episodes in so we're not going to get any depth. However, I can quickly see Chitanda becoming another fan-crush. Heck, even I'm falling for her. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\\n\r\nSo far; Hyouka is a very calming watch. It you watch it expecting some sort of Masterpiece or Brain-Boggler then you'll be disappointed. If you watch it snuggled up with a cup of tea (or coffee, whatever floats your boat) and relax to the gentle soundtrack, soft voices and hidden comedy  then you'll be sure to enjoy it. Hyouka is all about undertones, and if you don't like Anime that's in your face and overly excessive and loud, you'll probably enjoy it. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hyouka has been sitting in my \"Plan to Watch\" list for some time, and I can report that I'm very glad to have gotten around to watching it. I was originally allured by the beautiful animation and reputable ratings, and I was definitely not disappointed.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nCharacter: 7/10\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\r\nOverall: 8/10\r\nStory (8):\r\nHyouka is centered around four charming students in the Classics Club and their desire to dive into the subtle mysteries of the world around them. The main character Oreki has committed to his \"energy conserving\" lifestyle, as he does not want to stand out, waste energy, or do things that aren't required of him.Upon joining the Classics Club, the club president Chitanda discovers that Oreki has excellent deduction skills and can solve simple mysteries that spontaneously spark her curiosity. Oreki develops into the group's lead detective as they discover the world around them. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is a charming and simple one focused around development of the Classics Club, as we watch the personal growth of the members during their first year of high school. A rather uncomplicated story work in its favor, as the the episodes develop \"moment-by-moment\", which engages the viewer into the story excellently. I regularly found myself getting lost in the episode that before I knew it, they were over. That's an impressive feat for a slice of life anime. However from a critical standpoint, the story was sometimes inconsistent and hard to follow, seeing that a lot can happen in a short amount of time. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nThis is definitely Hyouka's most impressive element. The art was almost flawless. Chitanda's sparkly purple eyes, the flow of the hair, the beautiful resolution, the stunning scenery. You'll definitely want to watch this in at least 720p, or you're not fully appreciating what this show has to offer. Throughout the series I was consistently impressed with the animation. The only thing holding this back from a 10 is some of the little things. Sometimes the hands lacked detail along with things like faces in the background etc. If it was just a little more detailed it would be a total 10. Still can't complain. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8): \\n\r\nNever sure of what to say in this section, sound seemed good, nice and HQ but nothing that stood out as impeccable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7):\\n\r\nI really found myself relating a lot to the main character Oreki, as I too have been accused of not caring, being lazy, can't put effort into things, is never excited or smiling, etc. Some of the jokes the supporting cast say about his personality are things that have been actually said to me, even. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have great, unique personalities and each had some growth in themselves throughout the series. However, this is also my lowest score for all the elements of the show (though a 7 is still good). I was hoping for a bit more development in the supporting cast and the relationships between them, as most of the development seemed to focus around Oreki. He is the mc, but regardless this could have been a very strong category otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8):\\n\r\nI never thought I would watch a slice of life anime this fast. Episode after episode is completely packed with story and meaning and the series seemed to fly by. The innocent curiosity of the Classics Club kept me engaged and entertained, as I practiced by deductive skills and honed in on the world in front of my eyes. Especially through the great animation, falling into the story was easy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8):\\n\r\nHyouka is a great example of a slice of life / mystery done right. Beautiful art and story from beginning to end, engaging and curious. Can't believe I waited so long to watch this! if you're looking to get lost in a cute and charismatic story, Hyouka is definitely the way to go.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "I don't know about you, but I find that interaction is difficult. Putting effort into things which ultimately provide nothing but some surface level satisfaction often comes with the price of mental and even some level of physical exhaustion, and frankly that's not a fair trade. So why do so many people choose to be so active? It's so much easier to just not waste energy. \"If I don't have to do it, don't do it. If I have to do it, make it quick\" is a catchphrase that rings very true, and also which defines Oreki Houtarou at the start of Hyouka. \r\nHyouka followsOreki as he is forced to join the Classics Club at the behest of his older sister. A character who defines himself by his own laziness and desire to \"conserve energy,\" he gets by while committing as little as possible to everything he has to do, feeling like those around him are deluding themselves believing in a \"rose-colored\" life. Thinking he can just put his name on the club sign-up form to satisfy his sister, he ends up meeting Eru Chitanda, who's captivating presence and tendency to not think about personal space (in a way that's endearing and well-meaning), forces Oreki to stay and changes him for the better. Alongside friends Satoshi Fukube and Mayaka Ibara, Oreki and Chitanda go about solving various mysteries and discovering themselves in the process. \\n\\n\r\nMany often make the mistake of calling Hyouka a mystery anime, and get disappointed when the mysteries are mundane questions about things that happen all the time but which most wouldn't think about at all. With mysteries about why a door that should be open is locked, or the nature of an announcement over the intercom system, one might question how it could be compelling. But this mundanity is a purposeful decision, because Hyouka is not a mystery series, but a character drama. The first episode sets up Oreki's laziness, but he quickly shows cracks in his facade, revealing that rather than being lazy, he doesn't want to commit himself fully to anything because he is afraid of finding that things aren't quite what they seem. He is incredibly smart, with the impressive talent of deduction, being able to very easily put numerous pieces of evidence together to solve mysteries which most would give up on quickly, but despite his talent he refuses to use it. His issue is one of fear and self-esteem, and it becomes apparent that he believes he is unable to achieve this \"rose-colored\" life which everyone else seems to be saturated in. Chitanda is very much the opposite of this. Almost like a dog, anything and everything makes Chitanda immensely curious, to the point where it bothers her not knowing answers. As each provides something the other wants, they are drawn to each other. \\n\\n\r\nOreki is immediately captivated by Chitanda's overwhelming presence, and his attempts to escape before being forced to expend energy and commit to solving mysteries are quite literally blocked by Chitanda, because Oreki's knack for solving mysteries is invaluable to someone who is fascinated by every mundane thing imaginable. It's through this interaction that we see Oreki's true feelings. He attempts to con Chitanda with a fake mystery, but the guilt plagues him. Slowly, we see that perhaps Oreki hopes he can find the rose-colored life more than he lets on. This is where the mundane nature of the mysteries comes in. Chitanda represents the ideal of the \"rose-colored\" life, and her curiosity about everything stems from her ability to find beauty and meaning in everything. In essence, Hyouka posits that to be truly satisfied and fulfilled, one must engage with everything around them to some degree, and that for the low price of some energy, you can find some level of satisfaction that makes life feel more meaningful. So Chitanda makes Oreki engage with these mundane mysteries, forcing him to interact with things he never would have given a chance before and allowing him to feel the satisfaction one can find in daily life. The mysteries would not work at all if they were more grand, because they need to be applicable to things which Oreki will interact with often, rather than rare, special events. \\n\\n\r\nThe stars of Hyouka are the characters, and the mysteries are the vehicles through which they grow, change, and discover themselves. Of course, this means the characters have to be interesting, but Hyouka provides a cast that is both endearing, relatable, and multi-faceted. Oreki is a complex and nuanced character. He may be drawn to Chitanda but he is also still afraid of change. Through solving mysteries with her, he comes to understand the worth that his talent has, and find satisfaction in a potential \"rose-colored\" life. He doesn't change immediately, and he's scared and unsure if he even wants a \"rose-colored\" life at first, but slowly he starts to become less reluctant to Chitanda's prodding, and at some points he even actively seeks out his own mysteries. His growth is slow, but its rewarding, and the main reason for Hyouka's massive success. But though Oreki may be the character with the most focus, the rest of the cast shines through in many ways. Chitanda's curiosity stems from a desire to understand people, and herself. In learning about her past and her circumstances, we get a more complete picture of her person, and slowly we learn about the insecurities of a character who at first seems perfect. Her relationship with Oreki is a highlight of the show, as they each slowly open up to each other and bring out the best in each other. While their feelings do seem to blossom into romantic feelings, this is not the focus, but regardless, the dynamic between the two is thoughtful, endearing, and emotionally resonant. \\n\\n\r\nSatoshi and Mayaka are also complex, multifaceted characters with their own personal and interpersonal struggles. Satoshi sees himself as the reverse of Oreki. While Oreki refuses to give anything his all but is great at coming up with answers, Satoshi is energetic and gives his all to everything, but is not able to come up with answers of his own, calling himself purely a \"database,\" something which can only provide information, but not connect it to a bigger picture. Throughout the series, it becomes apparent that this is an insecurity for Satoshi, and his jealousy of Oreki is a compelling part of his character. Balancing it out is Mayaka, who basically has it all together. She's smart, thoughtful, and mature, with a hilariously snarky personality, although she's not quite as extraordinary as the other three. Her relationship with Satoshi is also compelling, as she is waiting for the immature Satoshi to come to grips with himself and allow for a more balanced relationship, something which Satoshi is well aware of as he strives to grow. This is not to say that Mayaka doesn't have any of her own insecurities though. She is very opinionated and easily gets emotional over certain things, namely about manga and the nature of judging what a masterpiece should be, and she is at least disappointed that she doesn't provide much to the solving of mysteries bar some personal connections. Ultimately, she's an endearing character who is both a goal for Satoshi in terms of maturity, and she provides balance for a great cast. \\n\\n\r\nHyouka doesn't have much of an overarching plot-line. I would call the series semi-episodic, as each episode or arc is complete, but provides to the characters overarching development. This is not an issue, since Hyouka is completely character driven, and the \"story\" is that of Oreki and the others growing as people and discovering themselves through solving these mysteries. Even though the mysteries are mundane, they are not boring, both because of what they provide for the characters, but also because of how creative and well-thought-out they are. Because the series can't do more \"compelling\" mysteries thanks to its high school setting, it finds creative ways to incorporate standard Sherlock-style mystery plots without sacrificing the believability of it's setting. For example, instead of having a murder mystery plot-line, it has Oreki and the gang figure out the remaining plot of a murder mystery film after the script-writer falls ill and loses the script. Structurally, the mysteries are similar to those of classic detective stories, many of which are even directly referenced in the show. The series is most compelling during its three-episode school festival arc, which hides hints and details in the bustling, energetic event as we explore the various classes attractions and give each main character a chance to shine, until a big twist and a satisfying conclusion tie it all together. The mysteries are not so easy that you can figure them out with no issues, but also not so difficult that you have to be a master detective to pick up on the subtle clues. I only managed to solve one mystery before it ended, but I never felt the series pulled something out of nowhere, or that I couldn't have solved it with more time, and that ability to play along with the characters as they discover new info makes the mysteries that much more fun. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the best part about all of this, and the elephant in the room, is Hyouka's astonishingly gorgeous visuals. I am not even remotely exaggerating when I say that, at the time of this writing, I believe that Hyouka is arguably the best looking anime which has aired on TV. As gorgeous as Unlimited Blade Works and KyoAni's own Violet Evergarden is, what puts Hyouka above both of them for me is it's creativity, variety, and cinematography. Kyoto Animation is known for providing in-depth characterization and character development solely through visuals, providing subtle visual cues in the characters body language and how the camera frames them to showcase their mindsets at all times, usually without dialogue or exposition. For example, at the very beginning of Hyouka, great care is taken to put us into Oreki's headspace, as he is usually cloaked in dark shadows and placed in the corner of the frame, isolated from other characters, while his friends and especially Chitanda are bathed in bright light and open, spacious shots next to large crowd shots. Hyouka's visual storytelling is perhaps better than any of KyoAni's other anime because it goes  a step further in how it portrays everything. For example, I said earlier that Oreki is immediately captivated by Chitanda's aura, drawn deeply into her eyes after trying to leave the room. Hyouka portrays this as Chitanda trapping Oreki in the corner of the frame while blocking the door on the other side. Oreki then looks into her eyes, beginning an absurdly gorgeous and immensely detailed cut of Chitanda's long, beautiful hair, now with flowers, ensnaring Oreki in a rose-colored filter. Without a lick of dialogue, we see the extent to which Oreki refuses to commit himself, how much Chitanda's curiosity eats away at her through her good-natured but overbearing treatment of Oreki, Oreki's curiosity of Chitanda and the rose-colored life she is surrounded by, and how Oreki sees her in general, as gorgeous, overwhelming, and impossible to ignore; all in a short but absurdly memorable and iconic moment thanks to its creative and powerful presentation. This visceral nature of Hyouka's visuals extends into the mysteries as well. There are numerous segments where the characters will posit their ideas about each mystery, which are accompanied by a different art-style, from a pop-up-book look, to paint-on-glass animation, and various styles that fit each scenario. Looking at each of these moments reveals something about the character giving the information, and its that level of detail that puts Hyouka above most anime visually. And even beyond that, the series has visual motifs that change with the characters mindsets, such as how the shadows that I've been mentioning as cloaking Oreki change as his mindset towards the \"rose-colored\" life changes. The show likes to trap characters in the frame or between objects, and things like colors, ripples, and reflections are consistent motifs that change alongside the characters, and are worth looking out for. Hyouka is not just pretty colors wrapped around nothing; each moment tells us something important about either the mystery or the characters, and does so in the most creative and emotionally effecting way possible. It's absolutely stellar directing that shows why Yasuhiro Takemoto (Maid Dragon, Lucky Star, Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya) is one of the industry's very best.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka's soundtrack is littered with classical music, such as Bach's \"Cello Suite No. 1,\" and Gabriel Faur\u00e9's \"Sicilienne,\" among others. These tracks are massively fitting for Hyouka, providing an air of mystery and melancholy as well as a hint of beauty to compliment the grounded story and earthy tones in the visuals. The actual original music is also very wonderful, understated but enhancing the tone of each scene. It's not the kind of music you'll listen to on your morning jog, but it's fitting for the series its a part of, and its best tracks bring me back to specific moments from the show, which is in my opinion the true mark of a great soundtrack. Hyouka also has 2 OP's and 2 ED's, 3 of which are fantastic. The OP's each use visual motifs, ripples and reflections respectively, to show a facet of Oreki's character, backed by great musical showings from ChouChou and Saori Kodama. Hyouka's second ED is my favorite of the bunch, with an adorable show of detectives Chitanda and Mayaka apprehending the criminals who stole their hearts while their voice actors sing about it. The first ED is kind of lame imo, and has the only real fanservice in the show (apart from the episode 11.5 OVA which I don't really care for). Speaking of voice acting, its great. Oreki is the perfect combination of cute deadpan and emotional self-doubt, and Satomi Sato's performance as Chitanda shows an incredible range both for the character, and compared to her other notable roles like Ritsu from K-On and Chiya from Is the Order a Rabbit. While Hyouka's visuals are often visceral and powerful, with subtlety when appropriate, Hyouka's audio prowess underscores it, providing a balance to the technical side of this production. \\n\\n\r\nAs much praise as I've been lavishing on to Hyouka, it is not a perfect series, and while the amount to which these flaws may bother you will vary, I think they are very much worth pointing out. First and foremost, Hyouka is the epitome of a show that's not for everyone. It's slow paced, and entirely lacks in melodrama. It's certainly very cute, but it's not really a \"moe\" anime. The appeal of this show is in slow-burning drama with gradual, realistic, and understated character development. It's very much the kind of coming-of-age story Kyoto Animation is known for excelling at, only without the consistent cuteness and laughs of K-On, the melodrama of Clannad, the bombastic imagination of Chuunibyou, or the intimate romance of Tamako Love Story. It's completely mundane, and that certainly won't appeal to everyone. The same goes for its semi-episodic structure. After the festival arc, the series ends on a long string of single-episode mysteries. Personally, I don't find this to be a problem, as each of these episodes contributed greatly to the characters and also serve to show that this is still daily life, and that the mysteries they solve will often be mundane and not always multi-episode \"epics\" that take lots of time and energy. This portion of the show even hosts one of my favorite episodes, which involves Oreki and Chitanda sitting alone at a table and trying to figure out the nature of an announcement calling a student to the office over the intercom. It sounds boring, but like always, Hyouka makes it compelling. Finally, I want to touch on the ending, which is surprisingly controversial. Hyouka ends without fanfare, with no drama, no big revelations, and perhaps most controversially, no romance despite some build-up. In my opinion, Hyouka ends perfectly. Oreki has grown a lot by the series conclusion, but he also still has plenty more growing left to do, and him confessing at the end of the series would be way out of character for him at that point in the story. It wraps up the main character arcs, but leaves open a few threads for a potential sequel. If you are someone who needs a definitive and concise ending, Hyouka could disappoint you, though I personally don't agree with that assessment. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, Hyouka is one of my favorite anime series of all time. Oreki is an immensely relatable, complex, and endearing character, and the rest of the main cast follows suit. The mundane mysteries are purposefully used to allow Oreki to interact with things he sees every day and find meaning in things he refuses to look at, and the presentation of these mysteries and the way they effect the overarching character growth keeps them from being boring. Hyouka is drop-dead gorgeous, impeccably directed, and overflowing with visual creativity, and backed by an understated but noticeable soundtrack that enhances the mood, and by 2 great OP's and one top tier ED. It's helped by strong vocal performances all around (the dub is decent as well), and the series is a joy to watch in general. Hyouka has an understated beauty and resonance to it. It's relatable, poignant, and compelling, and if the idea of a grounded, realistic slow-burn drama appeals to you, than you basically can't do better. The characters in Hyouka legitimately change, and witnessing these small changes add up is immensely satisfying. Much like how Oreki learns to engage with the world around him, should you choose to engage with Hyouka, perhaps you will be one step closer to the satisfaction found in a \"rose-colored\" life.",

            "content": "Now here is where i begin my fruitless attempt to put into words what i actually thought of Hyouka. Which is actually harder than you may expect, because this is just one of those shows where i can\u2019t really think clearly on what it was exactly that i like. \r\nWell to begin I should mention what may be the most obvious; this is by far the best animated show I\u2019ve seen all year. Characrers are detailed and had fluid motion, all the desighns were likable and it all added to that slight sense of realism that persists thoughout the experience. Background were all equally beautifulwith bright colors or muted colors to to great effect when need. Even something that I had never seen before: a handheld shaky-cam effect, which impressed me to no end on just a technical level. This proved to be one of the main examples that i use when i argue thst anime has spoiled me in turms of 2D animation quality, it just looks that good, yet still manages not to be overbearing, and instead allows you to get immersed in the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe more difficult thing to really pinpont and talk about (though i\u2019ll probably end up talking alot anyway) is the story and characters. In my opinion characters are the most important part in any anime because they can make or break it independent of the plot. The plot can be a great or interesting idea, but if the characters aren\u2019t at all interesting or likable I\u2019m not going to enjoy the show as much. However this is definitely an are in which Hyouka excels. One of the things that one may consider essential in a plot-filled story is the idea of character development, that a characters have to grow along that story. Since this is more of a slice-of-life ( actually more than any other show ever, but I\u2019ll get to that later) that same idea doesn\u2019t apply and the growth has to be applied a bit more subtly, much more how it may seem in real life. If you look at yourself yesterday or a few days ago you may not see any substantial difference, but if you do the same a few years ago it should be more noticeable. And that is the case here; as you look on an episode-by-episode basis your not likely to notice all the changes, but look at the characters on the first and last episodes they are different. I won\u2019t go into detail with everyone but take a look and you\u2019ll see it. Above all else the characters are also very likable, or at the very least I liked them enough to come back each week. The girls were very adorable and the interactions between everyone felt very natural.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this also added to an over-arcing sense of realism. Besides the look an the characters the passage of time and structure of the \u201cplot\u201d made it feel like real life. From the introduction and as wells as various elements in the show itself you may have been lead to believe that this is a  mystery show, perhaps in the vein of Scooby-Doo or Sherlock (awesome British show by the way) but I don\u2019t really believe that this is the case since a major percentage of time is spent not solving mysteries but rather doing other things such as enjoying the school festival or going to an Onsen. Sure there are mysteries bu I never felt that it was the main focus outside of a few episodes or in other cases certain segments of certain episodes. It almost gave me that sense that Hyouka was confused and perhaps didn\u2019t really know if it wanted to be mystery or straight slice-of-life. In the end I came to the conclusion that this may be one of the best adaptations of real life I seen in an anime, with an underlying theme of mysteries in order to tie the episodes together. Thing more or less seem to just happen in Hyouka usually without in sort of foreseeable meaning or reason to them, and events play out very naturally much like in real life. You don\u2019t remember things that happen day to day, you remember big events or ones that mattered the most to you, festvals, vacations, or smaller events such as Oreki investigating his teacher or trying to prove to Chitanda that he can\u2019t be trusted to solve mysteries. Real life also doesn\u2019t have a clear plot or constant themes other than those you make for yourself. All of which is the case here; not much is consistent  in terms of plot as you watch, and its not until you look back that you realize that had this been your life this may have been how you would remember it with all the subtle shifts and changes intact.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these changes and shifts made Hyouka a hard show to really give a rating for since I never had a clear idea throughout of what I was meant to look for or enjoy. In the end all that really matters is that I greatly enjoyed watching every episode and continued to maintain Kyoto Animation\u2019s consistent quality standard.\\n",

I give the idea a 10, because not only is it not the typical school anime, it has a twist. \nArt 10/10\nThe art in Hyouka is probably the best I've ever seen. They are all HD and very appealing. If all anime art was like this, I'd have no worries.\nSound 10/10\nWhen it's needed, the sound effects are always there. They aren't too much, and that's just the way I like it. Too many sounds are just annoying.\nEnjoyment 10/10\nHyouka is very amazing. So much that I anticipate every single episode to date. Honestly,everything about this anime is great.\\n\\n\nSo, should you watch this?\\n\nDEFINITELY.\\n\nOut of all the 2012 anime, this would be one of the few I would recommend. It's different, so if you don't want that typical, love story, slice of life anime with supernatural heroines, then this is for you.\\n\\n\nOverall 10/10 \\n",

            "content": "A mystery, that left me with more mysteries.\r\nSo many questions, so many unsolved mysteries and plot holes, I just...Can't.\r\nLet me just begin with the art of the series, amazing, superb, beautiful, and there is a lot of scenery porn for all of you scenery porn fans out there.\r\nBut I didn't watch this anime for scenery porn, if I wanted to look at scenery porn I could have just gone on tumblr instead of watch this anime. \r\nWhy did I watch this anime you may ask? I'm going to be honest with you, the art attracted me, I loved the style and the quality animation.\r\nBut IMANLY watched for the romance that I kept seeing scenes of on other sites.\\n\\n\r\nI was so excited to watch this because all of the characters looked very unique and beautiful and the art was just outstanding to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nBut the story, which is the biggest part of an anime, fell lackluster, and became very tedious to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe series begins with Oreki, and his mindset on life;  how he'd rather do nothing and doesn't want an exciting highschool life. \\n\r\nHis character is extremely lazy, he's almost like a sloth. \\n\r\nHe has a motto that is repeated throughout the show. \\n\r\n\"I don't do anything I don't have to. What I have to do, I do quickly.\"\\n\\n\r\nHis friend Satoshi is flamboyant, he may seem simple minded at first; very loud, friendly, always cheerful, but he is actually very competitive and wants to be better than Oreki when it comes to solving mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nHe meets Chitanda shortly after, and instantly becomes infatuated with her.\\n\r\n(Don't get your hopes up though.)\\n\\n\r\nChitanda is simple minded, almost dumb, yet she gets one of the highest top scores in school. \\n\r\nShe is the epitome of innocence.\\n\r\nAnd the field for Oreki's hyperactive imagination.\\n\\n\r\nShe uses her famous catchphrase \"I'm curious!\" And her eyes sparkle and she gets super close to his face, within kissing distance basically, but when she snaps out of it, she backs away and Oreki and her often end up flustered, but pushes it aside and continues on to the mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nIbara, is a feisty little girl, she seems to have many issues, but the biggest ones are her love for Satoshi and her low self esteem/insecurites. She is an extreme anime/manga fan, being in the club and also cosplaying, even though she's embarrassed to do it, she wants to.\\n\\n\r\nWith this, they all create the classics club.\\n\\n\r\nThe series begins with a big mystery: Chitanda's uncle.\\n\\n\r\nHe left their high school, and disappeared, Chitanda needs to solve her Uncle's mystery before the end of the 7th year of his disappearence or the government will label him as dead.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the biggest mystery, for HER, and for everyone else, is her last memory of her uncle, where she asked what hyouka was, and he tells her, and she cries, but why does she cry? \\n\\n\r\nThat's the big mystery, what did he tell her, why did he disappear, why did she cry? What does Hyouka mean exactly?\\n\\n\r\nBut the mystery gets solved within a few episodes, with like 19 episodes still ahead of us, and the meaning of Hyouka already solved; I had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nBut then I realized, and couldn't stop watching anyways.\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever seen scooby doo? You know how every episode is exactly like the last hundreds of episodes? Where there's a mystery, they find clues, there's a chase, they solve it, everything's cool.\\n\\n\r\nThat was basically Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nThey had a mystery EVERY episode, there wasn't one episode where they didn't get a new mystery to solve, or was solving a previous one.\\n\\n\r\nThey get a mystery, Chitanda does her famous \"I'm curious!\" states at Oreki, he gives in and begins to think about the mystery, they find clues and the chase ensues, except there's usually no one to chase and no one gets the cop called on them, Oreki ALWAYS, and I literally mean ALWAYS figures EVERYTHING out, and all the little details are brought forth as he supposedly blows your mind when confronting the culprits.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries, were not even that interesting, 3/22 times I was actually curious and wanted to find out why was a student shopping at a store near the elementary school called down to the staff room.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, they make a mystery out of everything, every little thing from life became a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe thoughts Oreki has seems deep and we could all use a little more psychological insight on life. But then I felt like he was psychoanalyzing every situation and every person and every little detail of life, was turn, twisted, and turned into something deep.\\n\\n\r\nSo the mystery part of the series was turned into trash, some scooby doo type kiddish crap that was repeated every show, in a more serious realistic manner.\\n\\n\r\nBut even when the mysteries and every episode started become a chore to watch, why did I continue?\\n\\n\r\nOne thing in this show gave me hope, and that was the romance between Oreki and Chitanda.\\n\\n\r\nHell, basically more than half the show is about her pushing him out of his comfort zone and getting him to do shit he would have never done until he met her.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning he says he doesn't want a colorful highschool life, but Chitanda came and brought color into his dull life, whether he liked it or not.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode was filled with shy glances, interest in each other, and most times, Oreki's perverted thoughts about Chitanda.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was nice and steady, slow, you can see the progress as the episodes continue on and Oreki cares even more about Chitanda than he'd really like to let on.\\n\\n\r\nSecond to last episode is Valentines day, and here I was thinking she was going to give Oreki chocolate, instead the whole episode is about Ibara's unrequited love for Satoshi.\\n\\n\r\nWhich in the end the producers let YOU decide if they actually got together or not, but the vibes Ibara gives me, tells me they didn't.\\n\\n\r\nIbara asks Chitanda if she has someone she likes, she blushes furiously and thinks about it, (obviously Oreki seriously it's Oreki, even my 4 year old little sister would know that she likes Oreki and he likes her too)\\n\\n\r\nValentine's day, she apologizes to Oreki because the custom in her family is that they do not give gifts/chocolates to people they are close with on Valentines day, and so she didn't get him anything.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a whole mystery that episode about who stole Ibara's chocolate that she made for Satoshi.\\n\r\nTurns out it was satoshi so that he could continue to push her feelings aside.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day he eats the crappy chocolate his big sister gave to him earlier in the morning, takes a bite from it, and says \"bitter\" \\n\\n\r\nAgreed.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode, of course just has to have a mystery, but the final scene is what really, realllllly, grinds my gears.\\n\\n\r\nThey both talk about the different fields, such as sciences and humanities for their future, turns out Chitanda chose sciences, and Oreki chooses Humanities.\\n\r\nThis gives us the idea that they will part ways in the future due to their different fields.\\n\\n\r\nChitanda must take over her family's business, and focus on that.\\n\\n\r\nChitanda sets out her plans for the future, but there's a missing puzzle piece for her grand plan; in which, is an open position for Oreki to fill and continue to be part of her life.\\n\\n\r\nOreki IMAGINES, that's right, /IMAGINES/ that he offers himself to her for the future, for her grand plan, he offers himself to help her and her family's business in the future.\\n\\n\r\nBut, back to reality, he didn't propose any idea of him working with or for her, and gets really flustered at the thought of himself saying that he would.\\n\r\nChanges the subject, talks about the weather/season, chitanda replies, and it's a beautiful moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe End.\\n\\n\r\nI guess.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then that's basically how it ends.\\n\\n\r\nYou never get to really find out what really happens to her uncle.\\n\r\nYou never get to really find out about Oreki's strange mysteriously outgoing and happy go lucky sister or what she knew or had to do with Chitanda's uncle.\\n\r\nYou never get to really find out if Satoshi rejected Ibara or will end up with her in the future.\\n\r\nYou never get to really find out if Oreki and Chitanda will be together.\\n\\n\r\n[ Story: 3/10] \\n\r\nIf there was any story to this, there were no decent conclusions for it.\\n\\n\r\n[ Art: 10/10]\\n\r\nSuperb, honestly, eye candy all over.\\n\\n\r\n[ Sound: 7/10 ]\\n\r\nEveryone's voice actors were great, Chitanda's voice was a little too unrealistic for my liking.\\n\\n\r\n[ Character: 6/10 ] \\n\r\nEveryone had issues and made a big deal out of them, got me really down and depressed when watching them and their issues, especially Mayaka, but none of them really fixed their ways. \\n\r\nThere wasn't any real character development except for Oreki, the other main characters are pushed aside.\\n\r\nBut most characters just seem really flat compared to Oreki.\\n\r\nHe was able to morph and change, while the other characters........stayed.......the.......same...................................yeah\\n\\n\r\nExcept Oreki's predictableness and personality started annoying me towards the end.\\n\\n\r\n[ Enjoyment: 2/10 ]\\n\r\nThis series honestly felt like a CHORE to finish, it was so TEDIOUS, I was like, ugh I have to finish hyouka, just for the sake of finishing it. Though I was curious about how Chitanda and Oreki would end up.\\n\r\nThey ended up with nothing.\\n\r\nA huge disappointment for me.\\n\\n\r\nOreki and Chitanda's relationship for me was like this, a girl teases you, and she's completely interested in you, you KNOW something's gonna happen, and she tells all her friends about you, and you talk to all your friends about her, and you guys talk every night for hours and then when the time comes, she teases you to the point you have a big fat raging boner, and then her phone rings, and she has to leave, forever, to another country, and she has a boyfriend in that country.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you're just sitting there with your big fat giant boner, that will never be relieved or touched by that girl.\\n\\n\r\nThis completely left me HANGING AND I FEEL SO INCOMPLETE AFTER WATCHING THIS SHOW FML.\\n\\n\r\n[ Overall: 3/10 ]\\n\r\nArt is amazing, that's basically it.\\n\\n\r\nDid the leave an impression on me? \\n\r\nYeah, as a big fat waste of time that amounted to nothing what-so-ever.",

            "content": "People wouldn\u2019t normally sell you an idea for a show by saying that \u201cIt\u2019s about high school kids who solve mysteries, sometimes with inconsequential results\u201d but that\u2019s what Hyouka honestly is - and it\u2019s great. You can tell when you have well written characters in front of you when they can carry a plot that is, honestly, little more than that quote. Despite very little earth-shattering moments taking place in the world of Hyouka we get a great leading quartet of characters who, though at times can get repetitive and annoying, feel down to earth and real. Watching them go about their school lives withvery different goals while faced with brain-teasers is entertaining, funny and endearing. The show\u2019s gradual build up and little payoff on occasions mean it isn\u2019t the easiest of recommendations. But for any lovers of mystery, and a high school setting that isn\u2019t dependant on despair and melodrama, then you can\u2019t go wrong.\\n\\n\r\nOur story follows new high school student Houtarou Oreki, someone who won\u2019t go out of his way to do anything unless it must be done. Begrudgingly, out an obligation to his older sister, he joins the Classics Club where he meets Eru Chitanda, Satoshi Fukube, and Mayaka Ibara. Suddenly his dream of breezing through high school life without having to use up energy is thrown out the window. The inquisitive nature of Chitanda in particular - a girl who can\u2019t rest easy without understanding the secret behind something - starts to lead him down a mysterious path.\\n\\n\r\nOreki within the space of a single episode became more interesting than the standard high school lead character. First up, he isn\u2019t an idiot. Far from it. I\u2019m fed up with seeing ignorant protagonists whose lack of awareness is often used as a means to keep a story droning on for too long. Oreki\u2019s ability to read a situation with ease yet not wanting to put that to use is always entertaining. There were moments where I kept thinking to myself \u2018I get it, you don\u2019t want to use energy\u2019 as the opening episodes continued to drum his rhetoric into my head. Thankfully that goes away after some time and the show lets his actions convey that message instead. Oreki\u2019s progression can be summed up in one simple idea: motivation. What makes us want to be proactive? How much effort are we willing to put in? It\u2019s not very complex but he expresses these ideas perfectly, helped greatly from superb voice acting from Yuuichi Nakamura who nails the deadpan and disinterested tone.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a big danger in this show that the trio outside of Oreki could simply become foils to just develop him alone. Thankfully this isn\u2019t the case as Chitanda, Fukube and Ibara all have their own flaws, desires and issues. These are all varied as well. We have jealousy, greed, insecurity and love all at hand. Heck, there\u2019s even some \u2018meta\u2019 commentary on the value of criticising media and the nature of subjectivity thrown in for good measure. While the trio\u2019s main purpose is definitely to help breathe some energy into Oreki\u2019s dull outlook on school life, it takes their toll on them as well. Fukube questions his own intelligence. Ibara questions what makes her happy. Chitanda questions her ability to help others. It\u2019s all great to watch unfold. They are a group all built upon really interesting contradictions: Fukube is knowledgeable but lacks the ability to piece things together. Ibara is outgoing yet unsure of herself. Chitanda has a good memory but gives off an air-headed persona.\\n\\n\r\nChitanda is the clear front-runner of the supporting crew, in terms of importance to the story and screen time. Her purpose is to push Oreki into helping out with mysterious situations, against his will of course. Similar to Oreki, she initially came off as annoying with the incessant repetition of her catchphrase (\u201cI\u2019m curious!\u201d) but it grew on me. Chitanda arguably gets the least development of the lead four though in a way it\u2019s perhaps for the best. Part of her appeal was her calm nature and ignorance to a lot of what is going on around her. It\u2019s adorable. To see that disappear would be a big pity. Instead there\u2019s a definite level of maturity and confidence growth you can see going on with her character, coming to the fore in a beautifully crafted final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle third of the show stands out for having not only the most interesting stories but also the peak moments of conflict for characters. That is perhaps the biggest thing to take away from the mysteries - their dual purpose. They are there to both entertain and involve us as a viewer but to also provide development for the characters caught up in them. These mysteries range from a lost piece of school-changing history to a simple hypothetical solution to a PA announcement. Some riddles didn\u2019t grab me. One is slightly lost in translation. Most manage to hit the mark. Above all however, the show is a great reminder though that no matter how pointless some exercises may be to you they can mean a lot for others.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you talk Kyoto Animation you know that you are guaranteed to get a great level of production. Background art is beautiful. Animation is smooth. Character designs are on point. Lighting in particular plays a big role. A lot of the mysteries see KyoAni getting experimental with their presentation. During explanations they will often jump to a new art style, one to suit the mystery at hand. Kept things fresh. It\u2019s one big charming package.\\n\\n\r\nAside from a slow start and some arcs that miss the mark, it\u2019s one of the more interesting anime in a high school setting you can take a shot at. If you\u2019re sick of romance being at the forefront of such settings then this may pique your interest. If you want to watch characters discover not only themselves but also the environment around them then let me point you in the direction of Hyouka.\\n",

            "content": "The primary reason for any form of story-telling media to fail is because of a lack in character development. Hyouka may not have yet revealed the most riveting plot, but I am able to continue watching in good faith. Even if it does not reveal such a plot, I can't say I would regret spending the time to see it because I've really grown to adore these characters.\r\nHonestly, characters really are the most important facet to a story. Jack Sparrow practically made Pirates of the Caribbean. The Last Airbender movie failed because M. Night ignored the fan-base's love of the characters. While all pieces ofa story are important, the characters are the authors, and Hyouka is clearly written by the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, I would like to note how clever each mystery is. Granted, no dark murders or kidnappings have appeared on campus, but seeing how I am still watching, the author works with the \"mundane\" very well. Also, I am not sure that the mysteries are going to remain so light. After all, Chi's uncle has been missing for seven years, and for those of you who have gotten this far, \"I scream\" sounds a little ominous. I am fascinated to see where the overall plot goes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the sound are wonderful as well - I love the sequences when Chi's curiosity takes Oreki by surprise.",

First, you have silly eps. There the mystery is no really mystery (eg. \"Why did I get angry? I never get angry!\"), the characters don't really develop, and the focus is mainly on comedy which I personally find dull. Second, there are arcs composed of several episodes in which something interesting is goingon. The mystery is not the typical murder case, but also something casual, however it is not silly. The characters are being developed. The comedy is still there, of course.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, while the show started with a lot of the first kind of eps, since episode 9 there has only been one of them, and it was actually a special (11.5). And, for those who want some diversity amongst the characters, two new characters have appeared in the last two arcs (one per arc) who, while not main, seem to be more important than 'just classmates' and Irisu is still having some screen time after the arc she appeared in is finished.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, while it seems the arcs seem to be finished, they have some loose ends untied. While I wouldn't like to spoil, I can say that they are not important and leaving them as is won't ruin the show, I feel like the show could win a lot for closing them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are believable for the most part and I enjoy watching them.\\n\\n\r\n3) Art and sound: I don't usually pay special attention to the art and sound. In this case, however, the art has made me pay attention to it - in the good sense - so It gets a 10. The sound is good - never annoying, but nothing spectacular - so 7.",

            "content": "[Feel free to read. This review does not contain spoilers]\r\nHyouka. A very delightfull anime which reminds me of the years when i was a carefree and crazy teenager. Also, the friendship between the main characters was something that all people would like to have. At first i found Hyouka just ok. But i the end, i loved it. An awesome work from Kyoto Animation. And that ending blew my mind!\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story focuses on Oreki and his friends, who try to solve different mysteries. The series have a good pacing with no filler episodes and it has a unique story, but it is still missingthis wow factor that other anime have. If you stuck with the series and watch at least the first 15 episodes, it will be difficult to drop it after that. I'd love to see a sequel after that ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThis is an awesome art by Kyoto animation. The characters, the landscapes and the mood that the series try to give you is great. It perfectly fits Hyouka, and the details are amazing. The quality remains great all the time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound of Hyouka gives you a 'slice of life' mood. Kyoto animaton does a great job here and many of the soundtracks are awesome. Not the best you'll hear, but definetely will make you feel emotional. The backround music is very good and you may feel sad, happpy, get angry or you'll be unexpressed all the time (like Oreki). Kyoto animation used every single soundtrack in a very good way. The perfect song for every special and regular moment. Also, the voice actors fit every Hyouka character perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nJust great characters. They are very interesting, both the main and secondary. Escpecially, the character development of the main characters throughout the series will give you the chills, mostly in the final 2 episodes. Each character has his/her own unique characteristics, making the anime even more interesting. The secondary characters are very good to support the series. Also, there is no narrator.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nMemorable series for me. Although i loved the series, sometimes, this 'solving many different  mysteries' thing was boring. Some of them were worth solving and special, but not all of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nHyouka is recomended for everyone who wants to watch a more 'down to earth' anime, with no battles, no magic,no supernatural, no gore, no psychilogical and dark content. I believe, this anime needs to become more popular, and also, i believe it is underrated. Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that it's the best of it's genre, but definetely unique.\\n\r\n(English is not my native language, so sorry for my mistakes, if there are any)\\n\r\nThank you for reading!",

            "content": "I was really Curious (oh the irony) of why this anime were praised as one of the best, I really TRIED to see what was so great about this anime... but I'm sorry, I couldn't just see what was so great about it.\r\nI'm pretty sure that many people could have gave this anime a 10/10 just because Shitanda was \"Adorable\" or some other reason like that (Pretty sure her name is written that way) but I'm not here to praise this, neither hating it... well, at least I will try not to. also more things to take in while reading my Review about hyouka isthat I have enjoyed other Moe Anime, or even SoL anime, so having as an excuse that \"SoL or Moe anime isn't a thing for me\" will not help to change my mind whatsoever. (neither the fact that this anime was \"meant\" this way) there might be spoilers ahead, so be warned, also, if you are a fanboy of Shitanda, you might like to stop reading.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not by any means bad, having a high school club that solves some \"mysteries\" that keeps happening around is quite interesting, but my major problem with the story is that it stretches for way too long with unnecessary stuff. what was made in 22 episodes, could have been easily told in 13 episodes. why is that? well if you are going to make an anime with 22 episodes, at least make the characters a bit interesting, there was NO development for the characters, they all were plot devices just to fill in the story, that basically means that if you eliminate the world's most annoying girl from the show (Shitanda), there wouldn't be any plot. also, the mystery theme on this show was extremely repetitive and annoying, lets put an example:\\n\\n\r\n\"Something weird happens, Shitanda is curious, Shitanda harasses Oreki until he gives in, they go around trying to solve the mistery, they find clues, Oreki comes with a conclusion, mystery solved. Repeat\"\\n\\n\r\nand let's not forget that asspull when suddenly Shitanda and Oreki started to \"feel\" something for each other (what a waste of 3 episodes) when there was no clue that their \"love\" were going to happen, there was just Oreki thinking that Shitanda was some sort of goddess in the first episode... or maybe I missed something because I wasn't really interested in their romance development that I had to skip it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nyeah, KyoAni almost always has nice visuals and animation on their show, I won't deny the possibility of falling for a character just because he/she looks cute or cool. the atmosphere for some scenes were actually quite good and likable that developed that sense of mystery into it. (even if the moments between Oreki and Shitanda were forced, there was some nice animation put on it)\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: \\n\\n\r\nthe Atmosphere between scenes while having a nice background music sure gets me, but ask someone if you want to hear an annoying airhead telling everyone that she's curious about every damn thing she thinks that must be solved isn't something of my like, but that aside, the sound department did a good job for the background music, I don't consider myself a fan of any OP or ED\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10:\\n\\n\r\noh, this is where the show flaws the most, aside of having bullshit development, I just couldn't stand to the cast of characters they had to use for this show. Oreki was an interesting guy at first, he was quite serious about his \"job\"... but everything changed when the moe nation attacked. Shitanda appeared and she ruined what could have been a good main character. and here guys, is what a plot device/convenience is, for the whole purpose of the story, Oreki needs to be harassed by a cute annoying girl to the point of having her almost in top of him just to fulfill her curiosity desires (Curiosity Kills) If I were Oreki, I would honestly just set her apart, I don't need that a girl spams over my face about her curiosity over a \"mystery\" that she is curious about, if she is curious, why wouldn't her just go and solve it on her own? and if she can't do it alone, why does she needs to harass someone just to ask for help? I don't get it, and I won't know why there is a lot of people that adores this girl. \\n\\n\r\nas for the rest of the cast, I couldn't really get interested into anyone, because I felt that there wasn't enough development in them for me to even like them. I didn't even understand how did Oreki and Shitanda started to blush at each other out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10: my enjoyment value could have been better if certain character wasn't around, but without her, there would be no story, because that way, mysteries would end unsolved with no one to look at, so in a way \"Chitanda\" was necessary. but why did they make her completely annoying? if she were handled better, things would have been way better than it turned to be, but she ended being Shitanda, instead of Chitanda\\n\\n\r\nyou may think that this was a whole rant against Chitanda, it might be, but think for it over a second, why popular anime needs to have an annoying character among their number? take for Example Yukki from Mirai Nikki, Mumei from Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Subaru from Re:Zero, Shinji from Evangelion (at least Shinji had his reasons, but that doesn't quit that he is annoying) and the list can go on. for me things could have gone better if there wasn't an annoying character ruining the whole experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10:\\n\\n\r\nnow don't think that 5 out of 10 is a bad score, at least on my language, 5 could mean \"not bad, but not good either\" yet, even adding a \"not annoying\" Chitanda in the anime wouldn't make me give this a 10 or something that high, at least 7 or 8.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Good premise, bad execution, annoying characters, plot that could have been easily told in 13 episodes\\n\\n\r\nnow if you excuse me, I will try to get that \"bad mouth taste\" off (try not to go to my profile to find something to defend your anime, after all is my opinion)\\n",

            "content": "KyoAni's latest outing is just like, and yet totally different than what we're used to from them.\r\nFirst off, the good. The art in this show is fantastic. So far, they've had almost the quality of animation that was in Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu, and considering that was a movie, that's damn impressive. Background characters aren't just stable backdrops, they're always moving, the lighting is done fantastically, tiny details are animated even if they don't matter - it all together makes a beautiful show. Which is a shame, because it does the K-On! bobbing heads talking, which can be quite distracting, and the moe character designsaren't very interesting. Oddly KyoAni has taken a page out of Shinbo Akiyuki's work and have very SHAFT-esque animation when they're doing their mystery work, really reminding one of Bakemonogatari. Bakemonogatari did it better, but that's like saying, \"Well, he's good at puns, but he's not as good as Zaltor the Merciless.\" Overall, though, the animation is the best part of this show. It's easily the prettiest of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is decent, what little we've seen of it. I'm not going to describe it for spoiler reasons, but it's pondering but interesting enough to get hooked. The detective writing is very good, however - this show has sections each episode where they try to figure out a somewhat ordinary but interesting mystery, and the main character solves in classic Poirot fashion by noticing every tiny little detail.\\n\\n\r\nBut, now it's to the ugly part. The characters are nowhere near as good. The main character's shtick is that he is so lazy that he measures out how much energy he uses per day. It comes off less as lazy on his part than lazy on the writer's part, allowing the \"quirky\" girl to bring him to do things.\\n\\n\r\nI should probably cover what my problem with the \"quirky\" girl as a concept is. It falls under the same category as the dogged nice guy/friend zone thing. It's the nerdy guy's version of sexist entitlement. She basically exists to be cute and \"quirky\", but not to exist as a character. Her life outside of the main character is pointless - she is here to bring excitement and fun into his life, no matter what else. I'm not saying that girls can't be weird. I'm saying that it's really sad how these movies and shows, which usually in the United States get labeled on the \"hipster\" side (a side that usually prides itself on being anti-discrimination, despite they're almost all white rich kids), almost never pass the Bechdel test. Hyouka certainly doesn't. *I'm not trying to say that Hyouka is hipster. I'm saying that quirky girls usually show up in American cinema in indie stuff.*\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, besides my feminist rant, she's just not that interesting. She acts cute and moe and... worries a lot about a random student she knows nothing about and her uncle that she hasn't seen in over half a decade. Huh. \\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters are a straight-up tsundere and That Other Guy, which I've seen both a hundred times. He gets more screen time than most That Other Guys, but he's still not that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's pretty to look at and pretty interesting, but if you like characters more than story you should probably skip Hyouka, at least as far as episode 4 shows. I'm going to keep with it myself, but to each their own.",

For example, if you like action, Hyouka is not for you. But if you like a slice of life that is very different from the others, you will certainly like Hyouka. \r\nI think Hyouka is one of the greatest series of 2012, because it takes mystery to another level; it doesn't portray any cliche, like murders, police cases, etc.; it takes things to the everyday's life, and it may even be possible inour real lives.\\n\r\nIn the beginning and in the middle of the series, there are arcs with mysteries that are solved in a brilliant way of thinking. In the end, there are some psychological aspects of each character, in a way I've seen in few animes.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the rating is:\\n\r\nStory - 9: The story in Hyouka is very simple, but that's why it's terrific. The simplicity of the story makes it seem possible in real life, which is very good for those who are watching the series.\\n\r\nArt -10: The art in Hyouka is amazing, both the overall art and the mystery's solution scenes. That is what you expect from Kyoto Animation. \\n\r\nSound -10: The sound in Hyouka really fits the atmosphere.

            "content": "Hyouka is an anime based on a series of novels by Yonezawa Honobu. The anime adaptation was handled by Kyoto animation. You may know them as the studio behind, Lucky Star, Nichijou, the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and K-on. So, they gravitate towards slice of life series, or series with strong slice of life elements, with widely varying degrees of quality. Let's look at Hyouka and see where it lands on the spectrum. \r\nHyouka doesn't have one underlying plot. Rather, the series starts with a high-school student named Houtarou joining the Classics club, because his sister told him to join it in order to preventits dissolution and he's afraid of what she'll do to him if he doesn't comply. As a member of the Classics club, he encounters a lot of minor mysteries, which he doesn't want to bother with because it takes energy and he's very lazy. Most of them get solved in a single episode. The big problem with Hyouka as a mystery series is just that most of the minor mysteries are exceedingly obvious and the viewer can easily solve them before Houtarou does. So you spend a lot of time waiting for him to catch up. The only reason he looks like a competent detective is that he's surrounded by morons who have no idea what to do with the clues. The multi-episode mysteries are kind of interesting since the information is paced much better, which does create some suspense.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character who's kind of interesting is Houtarou, even if his abilities are greatly exaggerated by everyone around him. The rest range from kind of bland to outright obnoxious. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is pretty good. The character designs are well done and the backgrounds are pretty vibrant. It's most apparent in the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this does a decent job. The biggest issue is just that most of them don't have a lot to work with since a lot of the characters are pretty one note. The music is pretty strong. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1.5/10. Chitanda and Mayaka get kind of touchy at times, but there's nothing beyond that. \\n\\n\r\nHyouka isn't a bad anime but it's nothing special either. The mystery elements fall flat and the characters are just kind of dull. My final rating is a 5/10. It's an average series. If you want to see a lazy guy solve minor mysteries for a bunch of twits, check it out. If the premise sounds interesting give an episode or two a try. Me, I'll stick to my Holmes and Dresden.",

            "content": "Before reading, please take a moment to read about my review structure on my page.\r\nTL;DR\r\nOVERALL: 80/100\r\nSetting: 6/10\r\nPlot: 8.5/10\r\nArt: 9.5/10\r\nAnimation: 7/10\r\nOST: 8/10\r\nVoicing: 8/10\r\nCharacter Set: 8/10\r\nCharacter Development: 6/10\r\nDirecting: 9/10\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\r\nSetting 6/10\r\nHyouka is set in a modern day Japanese high school, your typical slice of life setting. Nothing too special to comment on.\r\nPlot 8.5/10\r\nThe overall story is very slow-moving and not much really changes from beginning to end. \r\nThe story begins when the main character, Oreki Houtarou, is requested by his elder sister to join the \"Classics Club\". Throughout the story, Oreki is constantly dragged into solving mysteries by the club president, Chitanda Eru. Although there is nota thick overall plot, these short trials are engaging enough to make each episode entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9.5/10\\n\r\nThis was a pleasant surprise for me. Diving nose first into an Anime which was classes as \"Slice of Life\" gave the implications that there was little room for artist exhibitionism. How wrong I was. For such a simple and down to earth Anime, the beautiful palette and breath-taking scenes were almost unbelievable. There's not much else I could ask for.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\nTying in very closely with Art, the animation was relatively above average. As there was little room for introducing high intensity action scenes, it it hard to judge how well exactly they presented movement. Luckily, there were a handful of scenes which were enough to remind the production quality of Kyoto Animation.\\n\\n\r\nOST 8/10\\n\r\nA beautiful audio track to match the equally beautiful visuals. From it's engaging classical pieces to it's innocent Opening by Choucho. The atmosphere built from the OST is a pleasing fit.\\n\\n\r\nVoicing 8/10\\n\r\nI couldn't think of any mismatched voices off the top of my head. In fact, casting Nakamura Yuuichi (Greed, Gray Fullbuster, Nozaki) as Oreki was a great choice.\\n\r\nThe only other voice I noticed was Sakaguchi Daisuke (Sunohara Youhei from Clannad) which felt right because of the similarities between Sunohara Youhei and his role in Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter set 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: Although these characters are not the most interesting, they are easily relatable and likable, and most importantly fit the setting incredibly well. I'll only mention two main characters although there should really be four.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Oreki Houtarou, is a lazy high school boy whose motto is \"If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick.\" Although he is seen by his peers as antisocial and stupid, it is soon clear that he has a sharp mind, as he has a talent for solving mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nAnother of our main characters, Chintanda Eru, is the single daughter of a wealthy family. She is portrayed as the cheerful and \"curious\" club president.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development 6/10\\n\r\nHyouka has a good character set which is a shame that they could not develop the characters personas as well as I would have liked. This doesn't mean there was absolutely no character development, as we can see the characters backgrounds. Furthermore, the way they react to situations differs ever so slightly beginning to end. \\n\r\nUltimately, this lack of character building was the biggest let down.\\n\\n\r\nDirecting 9/10\\n\r\nTakamoto Yasuhiro's (Clannad, K-On!!, Suzumiya Haruhi Series) work is definitely of quality, directing the aforementioned successful series. He once again proves himself in Hyouka, creating a stunning air of mystery while keeping the down to earth nature.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI loved this series and it is definitely one of my favourites. A lovable cast, a sense of mystery, a hint of romance and stunning audiovisuals. Regardless of what was theoretically missing, I enjoyed this Anime thoroughly because of it's potent mix of the above.\\n\\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION: Watch it if you enjoy slice of life and mystery. \\n\r\n(Not for the action lover.)",

            "content": "Before you read this review, I should tell you that this review is more than special for me as it's not only my first but it will be my only. After two years on MyAnimeList I was determined that I would never take the time to write a review and would simply read reviews done by others, but after watching Hyouka I find it hard to not come on here and give my opinion.\r\nI gave Hyouka a 10 for one reason, there's something special about it that almost anyone who has watched it can feel. The special feeling you get when watching Hyouka isn't onethat you can sum into words, but it truly takes you out of this world and plants you into the anime world. Through this review I'll try to express how Hyouka creates this feeling for anyone who hasn't seen it, so here goes nothing:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nHyouka doesn't seem to really focus on a main plot, it's more like a make up of a ton of sub-plots put together into one big show. If you were to take the time and really think about it, Hyouka is really just kids in an after school club solving miscellaneous mysteries that pop-up in daily life. Of course this doesn't sound special and it hardly sounds like something that would catch an anime watchers eye, but it's strange. Even though the mysteries that are solved are quite small and short you are still dragged into each and every one of them. At first you'll probably think \"Oh, it's just some lame mystery that has no purpose, boring.\", and well... You're right, but the thing that makes Hyouka stand out so much is that it can take these boring mysteries and make them fascinating, because it expresses each piece of evidence and then gives the viewer time to ponder on the conclusion as the characters do so as well. As you think about the answer the characters move along and obtain more clues, leading you closer and closer to the answer you want and then if you get it right you get a small feeling of joy as you took part in the anime yourself, even if all you did was solve a \"mystery with no purpose.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHyouka has some interesting art, it's nothing absolutely amazing but it is different from the common anime and it does catch your eye. Of course when animes like Guilty Crown came out people were going crazy over the art from start to finish, but that's not really how Hyouka is. The art in Hyouka doesn't exactly make anyone go crazy over how good it is, but still it's elegant and there is a vivid use of colors and textures that help you to feel more like you're actually there. The art used seems to immerse the brain in the plot and mystery, especially during segments where Oreki (the lead character) is thinking, and that's really all a mystery anime needs. If the art can bring you into the mystery then the plot of it can work to keep you there, so in that sense the art in Hyouka is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like the sound in Hyouka, like, I REALLY like the sound in Hyouka. There are a few music tracks within the anime that repeat themselves, and each music track seems to express a different mood. The music will have you go from pondering on the mystery, to laughing at the characters jokes, to hoping a romance will develop between the characters. The music in Hyouka really brings out each segment of the show, and when you get to certain parts and expect a track to come on, it normally does, and you can't help but smile about the foreshadowing of the music. The tracks that are played when the characters are stumped leaves you feeling stumped as well, and it agitates you, but the quicker the characters get to finding the conclusion to the mystery the faster paced and more vibrant the music becomes  and naturally when they find it out you grin and say \"I thought so\", and the music serves as more of a victory tune for you and your mystery-solving ways. Along with that the character voices fit all too well and help to bring out each characters individual personalities, and the expression in each voice helps to express each character as a real person solving real mysteries, just another aspect that pulls you into the swing of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything I've wanted to write about in this review, it'd have to be the characters. The characters in Hyouka are all so unique and you can't help but grow attached to them through the course of the anime. To break it down I'll separate each main character and give my two cents about all of them.\\n\\n\r\nOreki: I love Oreki. Well.. I don't actually love him, but I love his character type. Oreki is so different from the normal anime leads that he really stands out. Oreki has the motto \"If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick.\" and he really follows it. This is so different from our normal protagonist who is always so outgoing and wants to 'beat up the bad guys'. Another thing that's different about Oreki is how shy he is. Most anime leads spend episode upon episode curling up and being shy because the girls in the show are attached to them, but Oreki usually just blushes and then gets on with it. He doesn't waste any time, which is what makes him so great.\\n\\n\r\nFukube: Fukube is quite interesting as well. Despite being Oreki's best friend he is almost the polar opposite of Oreki. He's out-going and he's good at almost everything, however throughout the anime he seems to change and more is revealed about his character that helps to build him up in a unique way. \\n\\n\r\nIbara: Ibara is strange... but in a way she has to be there or the group isn't complete. Ibara is a member of the manga club and also a very shy girl, generally she serves to insult Oreki and fawn over Fukube, but at the same time she is also her own character. She's very shy even though she doesn't express it, and the love interest between Fukube and her really adds a large sub-plot to the anime that interests the viewers who are attached to these two characters.\\n\\n\r\nChitanda: Chitanda is so strange, but you can't help but love her. She's very out-going and awkward in the sense that she's so interested in mysteries. She seems to get very involved in even the tinniest little cases and she's probably the biggest enemy of Oreki's style of life. However without her you wouldn't get Oreki to do anything, so we can be glad to have her around provoking the mysteries that do come about. Chitanda is so unique as a heroine of an anime that you'll eventually grow attached to her, and with that you'll be able to feel the same way that Oreki does when she goes on her \"I'm curious\" streaks. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter typing all this up I would find it hard to believe that you don't already know I enjoyed this anime. Out of the 600 or so anime series I've watched this might be one of my top 3, and nothing very significant has even happened, so that says a lot about how the show brings you in. It gives you a chance to be a part of the anime yourself solving mysteries, and it presents so many of them that you have multiple chances to try your brain out. Along with that so many things happen that aren't related to mysteries you'll end up loving the anime just because out of all the things happening you'll likely find yourself pulled into one. \\n\\n\r\nFor my final statement (TL/DR): If you love anime, watch Hyouka, or you'll likely regret missing out on this fantastic anime.",

            "content": "At a first glance, Hyouka seems like an ordinary \"slice of life\" school anime with romance. In reality, Hyouka transcends the typical cookie cutter archetypes of school-slice of life stories with a great mix of mystery. While this anime can't necessarily be called \"mystery\" because it does not deal with thefts and murders like the Detective Conan series, it deals much more with \"everyday mysteries\" - small questions that sometimes need good answers. \r\nI'll save you the summary, but let me say this: Hyouka's story is not only strong and enjoyable but also touching. This anime is a mixture of many emotions: happiness, curiosity, fun,jealousy, love, ambition, and even despair. The anime's mysteries aren't what drives the show forward, it is the relationships forged from them which truly make this show propel towards greatness. \\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the anime Oreki Houtarou and Chitanda Eru are two strangers meeting in the same club room, and by the end their relationship becomes much more meaningful. Through all the \"mystery cases\" the classics club solves, they group of four teenagers (Houtarou, Satoshi, Mayaka, and Chitanda) reveals their backgrounds, struggles, and personal stories. This slow unveiling of the characters creates an immersive experience albeit quite slow for some viewers. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best aspects of Hyouka is its art. Kyo Ani has once again impressed me again with their amazing artwork and beautiful graphics. The first episode is full of amazing eye candy visuals, and the series continues strong with great display. Hyouka and Pet Girl of Sakurasou are quite arguably the best visuals I have ever seen, and I was never disappointed with their art. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're familiar with classical music (fitting, since the story revolves around a \"classics\" club), then you will definitely enjoy the music in this anime. Being a classical music lover, I recognized many of the music played in the anime such as Bach's Cello Suite No 1. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime might not be for everyone. It doesn't have a straightforward plot, and it focuses more on telling the stories of four characters coming together as part of Classics Club. It's a beautiful tale of friendship and love, and it is arguably one of my favorite series so far. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys an immersive story telling experience.",

            "content": "First of all I must warn you, the cover for the anime is quite misleading. The synopsis too provides little to the fact that this is not your regular mystery with typical character.\r\nThe story depicts Oreki Houtarou, who is, in all considerations, lazy. After joining the classics club of his school upon his sisters request, he gets dragged into mysteries by the overly-enthusiastic memberof the club, Chitanda Eru, mostly against his will. The series consists of small stories, and some 3-5 episode long ones.\r\nStory -\r\nIt's difficult to find a proper mystery story, especially one with non-supernatural/school theme. The reason should be obvious, such anime wouldn'thave a lot of scopes to be built on. Most of the times mystery stories go overly serious, having organizations or large scale crimes involved. However, in case of Hyouka, this was not the case at all. The stories were mostly small cases, actually it'd be better to call them puzzles than cases.\\n\\n\r\nAs said before, the stories are mostly small, even insignificant stories. The puzzles are nothing of importance, no one cares. But it was THAT what made it so impressive. They did not try to build some deep, complex mystery involving something big. If they did, well it'd be simply unnatural. \\n\\n\r\nArt - \\n\\n\r\nNothing much to say in this case. Good, fitting, the occasional visualization of thought was a good addition to the art. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nSound - \\n\\n\r\nNot much to in this case either. The opening and endings were good, I liked them. In case of BGMs, the did their work of depicting state of the story well. Once again, good, fitting, nothing to mention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - \\n\\n\r\nThe story mainly portrays 4 characters. Oreki Houtarou, with his motto of \"I don't do anything I don't have to. What I have to do, I do quickly.\", who has a Sherlock Holmes in him despite the fact he doesn't really want to use his brain. Chitanda Eru, as par the synopsis \"The Embodiment of Curiosity\", who keeps nagging Oreki if something catches her attention. Fukube Satoshi, Oreki's friend, who has a rather vast knowledge of, well, trivia. and Ibara Mayaka, a strict girl, whose role, well I'm not quite sure if she plays some unique role, didn't seem so. Apart from them some other characters pop up occasionally, mostly for the sake of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rather unique, and it's their diverse personality that makes up most of the story's fun. So i gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - \\n\\n\r\nSimply stating - I Enjoyed It. The small puzzles were fun. Not challenging, but I wasn't looking for one. The characters kept things interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if your looking for some serious dramatic action/mystery or horror/gore/mystery, Hyouka is not what you are looking for. It is, as far as I believe, a mystery inspired from Sherlock Holmes, and toned down to School setup. Despite being a mystery, it has a refreshing tone, instead of the serious heavy atmosphere of general mystery. Which is what impressed me the most.",

            "content": "\"I'm curious\"\r\nThere are some anime that when you see some sequence from the show, it immediately catches your attention. Indeed, when I looked up Hyouka, I was curious. Having seen it's catchy OP sequence, I was determined that this was an anime that I had to see. I was definitely not disappointed.\r\nWhen making a live action film, the director can tell a story through many mediums: the dialogue, the actors, and the cinematography.  While the director can create visual effects, he/she is bound by the physical world. What makes anime so fascinating and appealing is a director has one additional tool at his/her disposal:the artwork. With the lift of a pen, an artist can realize any image he/she can think of. That power is extraordinary because the way you can express your ideas is virtually limitless. Indeed, the artists at Kyoto Animation were flexing their artistic muscles and produced scene after scene of artistic virtuosity. The crisp animation, the fantastic backdrops, and the amazing \"theory explanation sequences\" (where Houtarou, our MC, is doing his explanation of what happened in the mystery) are all part of this fantastic visual journey planned out by the Kyoto Animation artists. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also very strong. The OST is composed of mostly classical music. Being a classical music fan, I appreciated their choice in using Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 as the main background music. If the art hadn't already provided a great experience, the music picked up whatever slack the art left behind. There is one piece of music they play when a new mystery arises that sounds a tad creepy and watching this anime at night made me reluctant to go to sleep. Perhaps the composer was trying to achieve a mysterious atmosphere but to me, it came off as creepy. The first OP and ED are very catchy but the second OP and ED fell slightly short. Nevertheless, they were very good. A cool fact if you did not know already: Houtarou is voiced by the same voice actor for Tomoya (Clannad: After Story) and his sidekick Satoshi is voiced by the same actor for Sunohara (Clannad: After Story)!\\n\\n\r\nAs a non-frequent mystery watcher, I felt the story was really engaging. Basically, we follow Houtarou, a brilliant sloth, as he reluctantly joins/re-establishes the Classics Club at his school (even perhaps coerced) . Unknowingly, he meets Chitanda, a girl who also happens to be interested in joining. These two characters have really great moments together. Chitanda is a very curious girl so anything piques her interest. Reluctantly fueled by her curiosity, Houtarou sets his thinking gears into motion every time she says, \"I'm curious!\" We all know a great mystery is ahead of us. The types of mysteries that the Classics Club solves are very intriguing and realistic. Mainly, they are characterized by their simplicity. But when Houtarou gives his theory (and usually it\u2019s the answer), we come to realize how we often overlook so many details. Of course, given these interesting cases, I found myself attempting to solve the cases before Houtarou can but obviously, I always lost to this great detective mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe only negative aspect of Hyouka was that the story started off slow. The mysteries during the slow episodes were engaging but felt drawn out. In addition, the characters had close to no development in the first 10 episodes so that also contributed to the reason that Hyouka was a tad boring in the beginning. However, after those 10 episodes, the characters got much more exciting and subsequently, the story as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnother trip in Hyouka is its romance. Although Hyouka is not in the romance genre, there is some romance in the anime. If you were brought here because of a romance recommendation, you may find yourself unsatisfied by the end.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the strong art, Hyouka also has a cast of strong characters. Aside from the 4 main protagonists, there are some characters who appear but not given much development as they are only used for one or two mysteries. That means we get much more screen time for our main people! The other two characters who eventually join the Classics Club are Satoshi, a walking database, and Ibara, who is probably the most \"normal\" person in the entire group. The characters develop really slowly but this way, we get the immersive experience of how the character feels at the first stage before they move onto the next stage. They are very likable characters in that they have their struggles that we can relate to. For instance, Satoshi wishes to be a great detective but given that he is a \"database\" he is much slower than Houtarou at coming to conclusions. Satoshi's struggle is how he must reconcile the fact that he may never be as good as Houtarou.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hyouka was an enjoyable anime. Great mysteries, great visuals, and great characters. If you are a fan of mystery, this is definitely an anime for you. If you are simply into artwork, you will have no problem immersing your eyes in all the glory that is Hyouka.  \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! Let me know what you think of the anime! \"I'm curious!\"",

            "content": "''Hyouka: Mystery=Conan? think again!''\r\nHyouka is really something for me, it's not a complex mysteries shown here but there's lot of curious things to be found here.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story revolves around Oreki Hotarou, laid back guy whose notable for it's motto ''i don't do what i don't have to, if have to do, i'll make it quick'', Chitanda Eru, beautiful-energetic-always curious noblewoman, Fukube Satoshi, human wannabe and a walking database, and Mayaka Ibara, baby face but dangerous one- girl. they join the Classic Club and doing lot of fun things, mostly with mystery cases.\r\nHyouka is really KyoAni style, combination of SOL-School and moe, don't forget aboutthat. In addition, Hyouka got ''Mystery\" genre for it's central plot. So, a high-schoolers doing detective works on murdering case? no, not really, the case given is really dead simple, like ''who's steal Ibara's chocolate?'' or ''who's Jumoonji?''\\n\\n\r\nBut what makes it enjoyable is how Oreki and Chitanda has a contrast behavior, while Oreki is trying to retrain it's motto, Chitanda act crazily when something mysterious attracted her, and in the end Oreki is ''forced'' to solved cases Chitanda ask for. Also there was a love complex between Oreki and Chitanda, and also Satoshi and Ibara, which makes Hyouka really amuse.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI have to say that i'm fan of after-2005 KyoAni seris for it's stunning art, but Hyouka is another level- KyoAni efforts. the quality is movie-like, the movement is fluid and details are at their best. i have to praise KyoAni for presenting really good scene when Oreki trying to problem-solving the case.I can't say much about Hyouka's art but it was really splendid.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nStarting with the lighthearted OP ''Reason Behind Kindness'' by Choucho, then truly masterpiece japan traditional-feel soundtracks, sound aspect in Hyouka is really shines,especially the soundtrack that really fit the story, while also increasing the mystery feel. i don't really like the ED but it was  ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nI really love the way every characters develop, especially Oreki, Chitanda is get it's roll too, especially if she's so curious so badly and Oreki has no choice but to deduces the cases. Satoshi and Ibara on the other hand, had a love complex that really colors the story out of the box.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed every Hyouka's episodes, especially in the problem solving scene, it's amazing despite the cases given is dead simple, and Hyouka succed to presenting it into a very good moment, without a forced-feel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThere's nothing left i can say about Hyouka, sure i'm fan of KyoAni works, but Hyouka is different case. I don't enjoy it just because i love the studio behind it, but the story, sound, and art is really amuse me. Mystery isn't always Conan or Kindaichi, or mystery isn't always about real murdering cases, that's what Hyouka and Oreki Hotarou stands for.\\n\\n\r\n''i'm curious!''",

            "content": "Maybe this anime will not transfer you in to the romantic atmosphere where music and romance merge into one without words, as this year's Anime Kids on the Slope, but will definitely make you smile. Only body language and atmosphere worth a lot. Sarcastic jokes made me positive all the time. Art not only nice, but just cinematographic! Yes, not all the stories were very interesting, but for the atmosphere, feelings and characters - highest rating. In a few words: charming, juicy, slow and rich series.\r\nWhen I heard in background slowly passing Sebastian Bach (Air on the G-string), and a stunning scene in front ofmy eyes, as if went back to Mushishi, I felt that something was trying to go under my skin. This combination with classical masterpieces was fantastic, probably the most beautiful anime of 2012. Anime about everyday life with a detective + mistery spices, and who could think that this work can win some of the audience's hearts.\\n\\n\r\nIf Oreki - sleep, laziness, apathy, so the first and true friend Chitanda - movement, fire, passion, curiosity, eternal engine, bursting enthusiasm,  flaming projectile. Unbelievable how it was displayed during the show. And our character Chitanda even did not noticed how magical and enchanting powers her ayes are. As a couple, they will surely suit each other, balancing on a tight string and completing each other.\\n\\n\r\nTheres no end to talk about the details and what is behind them and only blind can not see that this is what lies behind them - absolutely fine. They're graceful, precise and charming, like a Swiss watch. There's only one problem - the clock do not work. Those details - only the tools, but their performance should not only admire, but they have to serve something and be a part of something else. But here details - independently of each other and the story  tells us as we should take it by our own.  \\n\\n\r\nI heard a lot of comparisons. Yes, this anime have something similar to K-on, because of almost the same voice actors tram and character design, but thats it! K-on fan-service and empty, but Hyouka have characters, atmosphere and some original flow. The only anime with which I could compare - The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. \\n\\n\r\n- Goodbye, peaceful days of\ufeff energy conservation...\\n\r\n- May I spend this year living a perfect low-energy life!\\n\r\n- I dont want to see what happens if Ibara finds out her chocolate was stolen. Im not a fan of horror stories.\\n\r\n- My low-energy lifestyle is in mortal danger.\\n\r\n- ... \\n\\n\r\nThanks who was reading and sorry for my bad English,\\n\r\nDenis ;)",

A weak slow guy that wants a normal boring life who isn't interested in romance or what you so called \"spring time\" when you get in high school.Oreki  believes and lives with a code that everything he does should be done as little effort and time as he can. but this guy has something on his sleeves. when he's doing something, rest assured that it is close to perfect.\r\nAnd that was tapped by a girl name Chitanda. A girl who's curiosityis on the top that he makes Oreki solves and explain simple things but in the end things gets more complicated and Oreki doesn't like spending too much time on that kind of things because of his nature. but, in the the end he can't avoid being played by the hands of the girl named Chitanda so Oreki solves and answers Chitanda's question as little effort as he can. but sometimes it doesn't end that way. \\n\\n\r\nGood thing we have some back up to help our main protagonist.\\n\r\nWe got Oreki's best-friend Fukube who is really good at memorizing things.\\n\r\nand last but not the least we got Ibara.

            "content": "Do not be put off by its slice of life, high school tag. In my opinion, it is a hidden gem in a rather overused genre of anime. It has mysteries without horror. Mysteries without deaths, yet are no doubt as intricate as those in Detective Conan.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story revolves the Classics Club, that consists of the 4 main characters. On the surface, it is a typical non-competitive high school club who plays only a small role in the yearly cultural festival. Nothing will be interesting for our characters according to the club's agenda. However, mysteries are always finding them, regardless of our male lead'sreluctance. The story has 3 major arcs, each requiring 5-6 episodes to wrap up its individual mystery. The resolution is important in any mystery, but the process of uncovering must not be ignored too. If the writer regurgitates everything within a single moment, the audience will be left feeling empty, confused and unsatisfied. Here, Hyouka did great by emphasizing the journey our character takes before the resolution is out. Those mysteries also do not seem out of place despite a mundane, typical school setting. Unfortunately, I am unable to give a resounding 10/10 since the remaining episodes, after the 3 arcs, are desserts with mystery toppings. The ending is also  inconclusive, leaving the audience wanting for more. However, considering just the 3 major arcs aforementioned, it's definitely nothing short of a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nBy KyoAni, enough said. Watch it yourself and be overwhelmed by the brilliant and vibrant animation this studio is famous for.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nBetween sound and story, the story stands out more. Hence, I hardly paid attention to the background music. To my knowledge, none of them feel out of place. If I have to add on, the openings and endings are superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nI guess here's where the series falls slightly short. We have 2 main characters and 2 psuedo main characters. Character development is minimal and though the writer tries not make the characters question their beliefs and \"motto\", they remain more or less the same throughout the series. Romance is there but the conclusion is not one that the audience is expecting and be satisfied with. However, the characterization of the main leads is well written and unique as they are not confined to any overused stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nWhat else can you say for a well written mystery. Within each major arc, until you reach the conclusion, you will not feel complete. Upon reaching the conclusion, you are left wanting to see more of what the series have to feed its audience. These are the motivations that push me to finish the series in 2 days. What else can I give for this criteria, other than a 10/10?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9+10+8+8+10=45, 45/5=9\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is a brilliant work that is guaranteed to satisfy its audience. Besides, it's completed and hence is all packaged nicely for you to marathon. If you are into mysteries, do check this out. Unfortunately, I am unable to find any similar anime to recommend, and hence, I am sorry if you are left frustrated after finishing it. Maybe its too unique for its own good?",

            "content": "This is the first anime review I'm writing so please bear with it and show me the ropes.\r\nOne of the better animes of summer/spring 2012, Hyouka falls into mystery and slice of life genre. And although I don't usually watch mystery and slice of life animes, i found Hyouka to be an excellent one.\r\nIt's mysteries are simple yet clever which would be very appealing to people who would like to sit back and relax. Not to mention, everything is very realistic and not something impossible to happen in reality.\r\nNow to get to the point,\r\nStory: 8\r\nA very mundane plot with nothing extreme going on, the mysteriesare very interesting and certainly even non-mystery lovers would enjoy them.\\n\r\nAfter it has been solved by the ever so intelligent Oreki, I would often think 'Why didn't I thought of that!'\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is impressive with good choices of colours, espcially the character's eyes. The background is also well done with a realistic look.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe background music definitely fits most of the scenes and can be very calm. Both openings displays its slice of life genre well and the endings showed the cuteness of the characters, especially Chitanda and Mayaka.\\n\r\nExcellent voice acting, Fukube's unique voice intrigued me the most.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAll the characters are interesting but not unique, Oreki just being the usual average student but his intelligent 'guesses' never fails to interest me. Chitanda is espcially likeable and Fukube's also quite an interesting character with his surprising jealously towards Oreki. Character development is alright as seen by how Oreki grows fond of Chitanda as the show continues.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed Hyouka mainly because of the interesting conclusions of the mysteries, seeing the characters develop and the catchy sound tracks. Every episode leaves me with a smile on my face and I'm sure it would do the same to most viewers too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nAlthough Hyouka is extremely enjoyable, I would not say it is a masterpiece. It is my favourite anime up to date.\\n\\n\r\nI would certainly recommend Hyouka to anyone. Readers, please give feedback! Thanks.",

            "content": "My Hyouka's Opinion\r\nStory : 8/10\r\nHyouka is in the mystery genre, and as such, it uses these familiar settings in order to set up its stories. By this I mean, not only is there a new, peculiar mystery to be solved each time, but viewers are given more and more insight into the main characters, their motivations, and their relationships to one another\u2014hidden bits and pieces of the characters\u2019 personalities are revealed, and prior events and twists, which viewers were not aware of, arise to wreak havoc on their perception of what they thought they had previously understood. Hyouka is thus a show that actively reciprocatesits audience\u2019s feelings and thoughts, constantly keeping them guessing in a playful manner, and at times, in an unexpectedly dark way as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe first character we are introduced to is Oreki Houtarou\u2014a lazy guy who prefers an unconventional \u201cgray\u201d life as opposed to the stereotypical \u201crose-colored\u201d one of his fellow peers. After receiving a request from his sister to join the Classics Club, lest it be shut down, Oreki travels to the clubroom and discovers a girl, Chitanda Eru, standing at the window and looking out over the schoolyard.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\r\nBrought to viewers by the staff of Kyoto Animation\u2014famous for providing \u201cin-your-face\u201d dramas (Clannad, Kanon, Air), and cute high school girls doing cute high school things (Lucky Star, K-On!)\u2014, one would not expect something so \u2026 subtle and complex. Part of the reason for this may be the fact that the show is originally based off of Honobu Yonezawa\u2019s series of \u201cClassic Literature Club\u201d novels, as opposed to following the popular trend of adapting from light novels. Since the former is a medium that places emphasis on prose, instead of  illustrations as in the case of the latter, it lends the author greater capability to delve into his characters\u2019 psyche. And in a show that is as character-driven as Hyouka, the novel\u2019s structure of story-telling is apparent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nDidn't hear that much about soundtrack while focusing on the story.butsurely it has good OP and ED in Part 1 neither Part 2.Well at least it makes me refresh after continue each of episode which is hard to understand quickly\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :10/10\\n\r\nPerhaps even this may not impress the veteran anime-watchers because learning a new side to a character is a common feature of all animes. Hyouka, on the other hand, is a show that consistently brings up new and different information about each character, making it difficult to pin them down as any particular \u201ctype\u201d (the most notable to mention, in terms of his development, perhaps being Fukube). Even the characters themselves are often surprised, not only with some of the choices the others make, but with some of the choices they make themselves. The method of \u201cshowing\u201d and not \u201ctelling\u201d is also an impressive feature of the show, for, while there are brief instances when characters\u2019 thoughts are narrated, the writers of the show don\u2019t belabor the descriptions of characters\u2019 emotions to the point where it becomes tedious, or employ \u201cdeep\u201d metaphors for the sake of creating a \u201cdramatic effect.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEach character brings to the table their own unique emotional baggage, and while their feelings do occasionally slip out from behind their attempts at stoicism, direct conflict where characters are soap-operatically yelling and venting their thoughts to one another never occur.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10\\n\r\n>For veteran anime watchers: It is definitely worth checking out; if not for the story, then at least for the style itself as it is very unique. You will discover a show that is very different from your typical run-of-the-mill high school anime, and if you\u2019re a fan of thoughtful, realistic suspense stories, then it will be a solid viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\n>For non-anime watchers: This show may be a difficult one to tackle especially since it requires so much of the viewer\u2019s attention. I would suggest watching a few animes belonging to similar genres before trying this one out. Death Note is a great place to start in terms of a detective/suspense show, despite how much of a polar opposite it is from Hyouka, and a couple short high school animes to familiarize with certain tropes would help as well.\\n\\n\r\nAfterall It depends on your education about Japanese and culture which will help you to understand how the story goes on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\nThe only issue which some viewers may have is the enigmatic nature of Chitanda Eru. Part of the reason for this is because we are constantly viewing her from Oreki\u2019s perspective\u2014a character who often thinks he has Chitanda all figured out, but who constantly finds himself surprised the more he discovers about her. On the one hand, it makes Chitanda an interesting character to observe, but on the other hand, viewers may feel that she is ironically a \u201ccharacterless character,\u201d and point to it as a fault of the show. Such an opinion is difficult to comment on objectively, so I will leave viewers to decide for themselves.\\n\\n\r\n\"I don't do anything I don't have to. What I have to do, I do quickly.\"\\n\\n\r\nRECOMMENDED",

            "content": "Curiosity kills the cat. In Hyouka, curiosity is one harmless puppy.\r\nIt is important to note that Hyouka is an anime with borrowed elements from the mystery genre and the slice of life genre and it never totally devotes itself to one side. The anime plays out with both genres seamlessly like the classical music theme of the anime. Nobody dies, there are no murderers and the cops hardly ever gets involved with the cases in Hyouka. It's light-hearted tone is derived from the fact that each mystery solved doesn't really make much of an impact to anyone involved in it. It is just a bunchof high school kids solving little mysteries that happens in school, such as the case of the locked Geography room and the case of the blunder of the Maths teacher. At times, it seems as if the anime is unnecessarily extended with fillers. A case could have been put to a satisfying end in under 3 episodes but in Hyouka you get 6 episodes and some people may be put off by the slow pace. Characters sit around and discuss the cases giving theories and dispelling them. Even as the mysteries are being revealed and solved, there are little intense moments that may fail to grip the hearts of hardcore mystery fans that hails from the Detective Conan series.\\n\\n\r\nHence, if you are a heavy mystery fan, this may not be the anime for you. This is a mystery anime that does not forget its slice of life genre.\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY is based upon several cases which the 4 main characters: Oreki, Satoshi, Chitanda and Mayaka comes across in their first year of highschool life. Though each cases are really of little importance in general, it is impressive to see how much deduction can be put into these little 'insignificant' cases which makes Hyouka worth watching. For example, an entire episode based upon deciphering what a short 5 seconds announcement by a teacher blew my mind. The level of detail covered in that one episode and the theories that built upon theories baffled me. How did anyone manage to think up of all of that? I'll not post any spoilers but the attention to every small details that comes back to become a huge clue in the end of each cases shows that Hyouka is a well thought out thinking-men's anime. Despite its small mundane mystery, Hyouka manages to make solving each of them fun and enjoyable. -8/10\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART is incredible, and completely fitting of Hyouka. It has incredibily detailed backgrounds and each supporting characters are memorable and you can really see the effort spent in making each little detail stand out. The sunset-painted classroom is a pleasure to see and really sets the mood for Hyouka. Furthermore, its abstract art that comes alive when theories are being made are creative and has a distinct taste to it. All I can say is it is the art in Hyouka is thoroughly enjoyable, and helps make the anime an enjoyable experience. -9/10\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND is paired up wonderfully with the beautiful art. I find the OPs and EDs of the anime soothing and sets the tone well. I hardly skipped any of them. Most notably, the Cello Suite was one of my favorite tune in the entire anime as it is just so elegant and moving, almost as if describing the pacing of Hyouka. I love it. -9/10\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS in Hyouka were all unique and fun. I especially enjoyed Oreki Houtaro's energy conservation lifestyle and always marvel at how he manages to solve each case even though he is basically a sloth in human skin. Chitanda Eru, at first glance seems to be a typical ditsy ojou-sama, always curious, always looking forward to Oreki's deductions and answers. At first, I found that to be rather annoying, especially her \"I'm Curious\" phrase which made me peeved. However, there would be no story without her striking Oreki's match of motivation to solve the case. I grew to like her eventually. Satoshi Fukube is almost a generic cheerful character and he makes watching the anime fun. Without him, Hyouka may become really dull. And he dresses up as Saturn and inspires to be a Quiz King. That's all it takes for me to like him. I'm actually most interested in Mayaka Ibara, especially in how her character will develop eventually. She shows the most emotion, the counter-opposite of Oreki and I am really looking forward to how her relationship with Fuku-chan will unfold. -8/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT wise, I love Hyouka. I do, I really do. It's a welcoming change of pace for me who was indulging in action anime all this while. Hyouka is funny, smart and intriguing. The ending to each cases never fails to surprise me as the twist and turns takes me for a ride down to enlightenmentown. It's slow pacing is a merit to its story and character development which makes Hyouka an interesting watch. -8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL, I was a little disappointed that Hyouka ended in a rather anti-climatic way. I am really looking forward to a second season. As a whole, Hyouka may not be top anime of the year material, but there certainly is potential in becoming my favorite anime. It's the most pleasant and relaxing anime I've seen in a while, and it comes with its own share of emotional dispute that is seen in a slice of life anime, not forgetting to solve the mystery at the end of the day. I believe that Hyouka can inspire to be a little more, as it tends to stay in the safe area. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it may make for a more interesting experience is Hyouka deals with slightly more controversial cases instead of always sticking to common everyday curiosity cases.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I'm secretly interested about Oreki's sister. Please show more of her (face!) in the next season! I am curious!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cOh no. Here we go again. There's no escaping the unbearable curiosity of Eru Chitanda.\u201d\r\nIn such musings, one has to wonder if Oreki hates being in his own anime. There is good reason for him to be, as his principal companion is an insufferable dimwit who only manages to seduce him with the power of moe. Oreki\u2019s best friend is no better, with his facade of carefree happiness ready to crumble into melodramatic outbursts of jealousy at any moment. Fortunately, this good friend of Oreki is being crushed on by someone that has spent so much time in Manga Club that she only knows howto be a tsundere girl.\\n\\n\r\nWhat on earth is going on here? What happened to the mysteries? Fear not, for they were never really there. Hyouka is a celebration of the mundanity of life, and with inconsequential questions come inconsequential answers. Yet instead of making a Buddhist statement on finding beauty in the ordinary, Hyouka plays up the drama of its mysteries and portrays Oreki as some kind of Ultimate Detective.\\n\\n\r\nAt least Danganronpa has the spectacle going for it. As charming as the animation is for the machinations of Oreki\u2019s mind, the problems needing to be solved are usually quite boring. The only fun to be had is in trying to figure things out before the characters do. Beyond that, there is little pay-off. About all that can be said for the eponymous story arc (the first five episodes) is that Chitanda has her curiosity satiated, and in gratitude, she heaps saccharine praise onto Oreki. Aside from the effusive Chitanda, no one is greatly moved by anything being resolved. With so much focus afforded to the deciphering of mysteries in its first cour, Hyouka neglects the development of its characters such that they become tools for the servicing of a mediocre story. This is exacerbated by the narrative arcs being almost wholly self-contained, and the number of references to prior events can be counted on one\u2019s hand. But it would be unfair to blame the characters; they have no reason to bring up unremarkable memories.\\n\\n\r\nOn the heels of the hot springs episode\u2014not to be confused with the later pool episode\u2014Hyouka presents its only decent story arc. This quest to find a Watsonian explanation for a movie murder mystery is not enrapturing by any means, but the breadth of interpretations from the ensemble cast makes the experience feel more like a puzzle than anything else in the anime. Hyouka is partially liberated from the confines of trivial curiosities in this segment, and the level of depth given to the set-up is fairly remarkable. Moreover, there is appearance of something actually interesting happening with the character dynamics in the process of solving this mystery, which may leave hopes high at the conclusion of the eleventh episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the second cour arrives.\\n\\n\r\nIt is here that Hyouka abandons any pretense of being within the mystery genre. There are still some things to investigate here and there, but they begin to exist on the periphery of the anime. This is of course to make way for a much needed Culture Festival, which sends all four members of the Classic Lit Club on their own adventures, each dreadfully uneventful. Perhaps this might be fun if this were a one-off episode, but the audience is instead taken along on a six episode ride\u2014the longest story arc of the anime\u2014to bear witness to insipid melodrama. No better is this exemplified by Ibara\u2019s very serious debate as to whether any manga can be a masterpiece... with members of the Manga Club. Apparently, this question shakes the club to its core, and it makes Ibara the subject of bullying from people in Vocaloid apparel. The matter is resolved when Ibara listens to her club leader admit that the whole thing was a joke, and that her hostility emanated from her inability to admit jealousy for some manga artist friend that transferred. The plot thread is bizarre, and yet astoundingly petty.\\n\\n\r\nThese absurd happenings plague Hyouka\u2019s second half. Fukube in particular begins to seem like a psychopath. The \u201cDatabase\u201d that formerly served as Oreki\u2019s source of moral support suddenly flies off the handle at the smallest provocation, which he vaguely explains to other members of the cast as some jumble of jealousy and admiration. Fukube also tosses a thoughtful Valentine\u2019s Day gift in the trash because, although he truly has feelings for Ibara, he does not want to be \u201cfixated\u201d on her. How this justifies an attempt to sabotage a gesture of goodwill, or what this outlandish distinction is supposed to mean, are questions beyond the interest of the anime. Fukube\u2019s inability to be remotely phased by what he has done makes the whole thing seem as if this were the product of aliens trying to model human behavior.\\n\\n\r\nAssessment of Chitanda need not enter the realm of the bizarre, for she is simply annoying. The cynical might surmise that her presence in the series is to inject a substantial dose of moe into everything, and her vacuous characterization speaks volumes to that effect. Ostensibly, the intent is for Chitanda\u2019s ineptitude to be seen as some kind of cute quirk, but she only appears useless when paired with Oreki who does just about everything for her.\\n\\n\r\nOreki understandably shines when surrounded by fools. There are times when it genuinely seems as though he is in the wrong anime, and perhaps there is merit to this since he has some similarities with Hikigaya Hachiman from Oregairu. Oreki\u2019s monologues are not nearly as weighty, but his morose observations are nevertheless entertaining. On occasion, the candid nature of Oreki\u2019s introspection provides for some reflective moments, and it gives the impression that even in his apathy, Oreki does care a great deal about his friends and other people. This also shows him to be thinking, which is a lot more than can be said for much of the cast. Unfortunately, he falls in love with Chitanda for the sake of anime cliche. This romance becomes the subject of the final episodes, and yet it still fails to develop into anything substantive. The ending, much like the rest of the anime, is a grand exercise in anticlimax, and it exceeds in the capacity of making the whole journey seem to be an enormous waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are the only aspects deserving of praise. Characters move with realistic finesse and occupy exceptionally detailed spaces. Any scene with a natural landscape is itself a treasure to behold. In the sound department, the music can be rated positively but not always in the superlative. The first OP is a beautiful song, but all other pieces are fairly pedestrian. Additionally, Bach\u2019s Cello Suite No.1 Prelude is pleasant accompaniment for the first 5 times it plays, but at that point, one beings to appreciate the possibility that it is only number on the anime soundtrack. With consideration to the stellar animation being in opposition to an uninspired story, it seems everything might be more enjoyable if there were no sound.\\n\\n\r\nThat would make no difference to Oreki. His eyes would still scream for help. He wants to get out of here, and so would anyone else. But this is Hyouka: You Can\u2019t Escape.",

            "content": "STORY - 9\r\nART - 10\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\r\nAmidst the ever-growing number of high school shows out there, Hyouka is a shimmering key with a gleam bright enough to catch my attention. It opens up a lock to a teenager life full of mundane things and trivial mysteries. So be curious. Be laid-back. And why not bring out the deerstalker cap and magnifying glass with you too? Acting like your own Sherlock Holmes can be fun every now and then.\r\nWe start off with an energy conservationist who joins the Classics Club, though more out of obligation than his own interest. Being lazy andindifferent, his dull life is in for a rosy change upon meeting other members who join the club, thus marks the start of the slow-paced story. If there's one way to describe Hyouka, it really is an enthralling journey through the small mysteries of life. Although these mysteries are usually sparked from trifling curiosity than something like a crime, seeing them unraveled piece by piece brings engagement to the story. The variations and well-constructed build-ups are not only there to provide diverse entertainment, they also provoke thoughts, give a sense of satisfaction, and reference details related to the mystery genre. But the biggest takeaway here is that these puzzles complete the framework needed to drive the characters themselves. As they spend their time together, each member of the club undergoes change on a gradual basis. Their distinct personalities pave way to a whole range of interactions that segue into the next, and in turn, it establishes this complementary back-and-forth dynamic that is enjoyable to watch. How they react and influence each other all add up into a collection of scenes with plenty of fun, youth, and even some delicate romance. It helps to construct these characters as realistic people than mere simplifications. Though exaggerations are present at times and can jar the realism, they didn't linger too long to become overbearing. The characters have mostly remained as the strong pillars of the story, giving this show much of its enjoyment and vitality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can also be said as the other supporting pillars are easily found through our ability to see and hear. Hyouka is an excellent example of how a reliable audiovisual can immerse one with the storytelling. Right off the bat, the atmosphere relaxes itself as the sunset-stained lighting gives off a vintage tone fitting for the Classics Club. Throughout the whole show, this pleasant warmth mesmerizes one's gaze onto the story and the lifelike backgrounds. The animation is another praiseworthy work by Kyoto Animation as they proved themselves to be the masters of realistic characterization. Seeing the myriad of character personalities through the smooth movements strengthens them as people. Combined with the strong expressions and solid voice actings, their interactions feel as natural as the high school dynamic we might find in real life. There's also no doubt that the show's visual and auditory elements come out strongly during the sequences when they're trying to solve a mystery. It usually involves some unique stylistic choices along with different sound effects to emphasize the nature of each puzzle. As these presentations are well-made, they are able to place our imagination into the world of the show itself, thereby simulating the reality needed to make the experience even more immersive. And the soundtracks further contribute to the whole transfixion with their soothing nature. Being gentle to the ears, the classical ambience is a great source of relaxation. Both the opening and ending songs are quite similar too, having pleasant melodies to delightfully initiate and conclude each episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Hyouka is a school mystery, its intrigue lies deeper than just the puzzles themselves. Take out your magnifying glass, look through it, and you will find a mundane-turned-dynamic world driven by all sorts of character interactions, significant developments, and youthful lives. Coupled with the spectacular audiovisual, this show is undoubtedly a title worth experiencing.",

The animation looked way better than it had any right to, especially in the first and last episodes.  The artwork was also quite original and creative in some spots as well, which I greatly applaud the series for.\r\n- Beautiful music.  Very often it felt like the soundtrack to a bigger budget film rather than your typical anime series.  The inclusion of Bach's \"Air on a G String\" also added a nice familiar touch despite being absolute music not intended specifically for the series.\r\n- Characters are likable and relatablewith a noticeable arc and progression throughout the series.  Very well written.\\n\\n\r\n- Very interesting mysteries throughout.  There were only a couple episodes where I could really predict the outcome.  Most of the time the results completely threw me off.  Very well written and intelligent\\n\\n\r\n- Manages to either bring something new to the table, or completely bypass tired anime cliches.\\n\\n\r\n- Well paced, doesn't feel too rushed or too bogged down.  Perfect length.\\n\\n\r\n- For the sub at least, the voice acting is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n- Without giving too much away, the ending is a bit ambiguous.  I, personally, loved it.  It may, however, not be other people's cup of tea though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI'm surprised how much I connected with this series.  I noticed I tend to enjoy a lot of anime with heavy emphasis on problem solving and puzzles, and this one definitely does a fantastic job of blending the high school setting while still being primarily a mystery anime first and foremost.  \\n\r\nNot only that but the music and animation are absolutely astounding creating not only an intellectually engaging series, but also an aesthetically interesting one as well.  I highly recommend this series as an absolute must watch.",

            "content": "This is my first ever written review on MAL, and I decided to do it on Hyouka. There are tons of other anime out there that are probably better than this one, as one could be opinionated about his/her perspective. I'll be frank, there are series we all may view as a Masterpiece, but it feels unrealistic to single one out of all the others. When I say it's a 10, it's OUTSTANDING. I know this may not be a 10 in a lot of people's books, but it is in mine, and I would like to review about it.\r\nArt: 10\r\nFans could tell a lotof money was poured into budgeting for the art, and that's where it contributes the quality of it. It's KyoAni, and they've made works of incredible artwork, and this is no different. The pictures are of bright colors, and great details. It's not just the characters themselves, but the environment surrounding them that is quite the amazement of how it's near the levels of being realistic in some scenes of the anime. It's simply outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe main casts revolve around the Classics Club members, and each of them have their unique ingredients that contributes to spicing up the story. They all can't stand alone individually, since we would never see their true colors unless they are amongst each other. The traits that each character has are what makes the story interesting, and they are what is driving it. Other than their traits, it's the romance that's just there that hits me the most. It's obvious there are characters in any series fans feel they should already get together. When they just simply don't do that, it stirs up fan's reactions to bring themselves to be piqued at the drama of being \\n\r\nwhy not?! why isn't THIS happening??\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI give the story an 8.5 as I feel there are some missing gaps I feel are present. Don't get me wrong, the directing of the transitioning from each episode to the next are done quite smoothly. I like to look at it from outside the box, and I view some minor inconsistencies. In every episode, there's a new mystery to solve because a certain one's curiosity. After that mystery is solved, they move onward to the next in a snap just like that. It's not as though there isn't any plot, since every other episode, the characters reference back to the previous ones in respect to relate their current dilemma. The other thing I feel at odds of whether I like it or not, is the main plot overall. The dislike factor I have is what is the goal the story is driving towards? But in opposition to that, I like how the way things are like that since it opens up to endless possibilities of new mystery cases.  The most obvious theme any viewers see that progresses Hyouka is... What is it? \"...I'm curious!\" \u00f4.\u00f4\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nIf I recall correctly, every background tracks or song was outstanding at the right timing of its cue. When there are good times, positive-toned tracks are played. When there are dark or serious moments of the anime, the right tracks for that atmosphere is played off greatly as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI don't know about you all, but I've enjoyed this serious tremendously. A lot may dislike how a mystery being this in a school environment, meaning they may not be as intense or serious as mysteries seen in darker-toned genres that include some sort of action-packed moments or a horrendous death. I look at the way this series played its cards of being a mystery genre, and they have hit it off very well. So what if it's 4 high school students making some drama out of the things they encounter. THAT'S THE BIG DEAL! Not only do those mysteries just come out as that, but there are some serious plot twists in those mysteries, and they are what brings my attention to Hyouka as being outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my first MAL review, and being able to read it all as how I wanted to express my thoughts about the series.",

            "content": "\"Jokes are to be made on the spot, so too misunderstanding to be dispelled right away\"\r\nI think there's some misunderstanding about Hyouka's plot. It's not your average flashy anime for sure, I assure you. To say there's no plot would be unfair to the creator because there's one in fact. To avoid spoilers, I won't mention the plot; the hint is the characters themselves. Then again, this is my opinion.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nIt's not flashy as I said before but there's a subtle advancement of characters. Relationships were strengthen, bonds were connected and the characters developed. A hint, after you finish watching all the episodes... compareOreki Ep22 and Oreki Ep1. There's a huge difference.\\n\\n\r\nEnough with the characters... now to the story. I pretty much enjoyed all the 'mysteries' the author had written. It got my head spinning at times. You'll start to predict the answers along with the characters themselves at some point of the anime. Admittedly, I only managed to guess a few of the episodes right...\\n\\n\r\nIn short, people who SOLELY like action animes like Naruto and Bleach probably won't enjoy this as much. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nKyoto Animation really nailed this! The graphic is superb IMO. No complaints whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nI freaking love the soundtrack! I think it's one of the aspect that sets the mood of the anime. I'm trying to find it though...\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason that drawn me to this anime was the VA. I love Satou Satomi voice acting in K-on! so in Hyouka. She managed to flesh the character perfectly. Not to mention the 1st ED song was so good!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters is the key to any story no matter what. In Hyouka, the characters is really life-like and believable. The best thing is their correlations! Each character complement the other's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nI can't give a full score because I found myself yawning a lot in one episode...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hyouka is a generally nice anime in my opinion. There's a storyline divided with a few arcs throughout the anime along with interesting knowledge. You might learn something from watching this anime...\\n\\n\r\np.s. This is my first review. I don't really know how to write one so I blatantly followed the guidelines.",

            "content": "In high school, different types of students exist\u2014the studious, the athletic, the sociable. With the stress of university not yet present and parental restrictions generally becoming more lax during this stage of life, these adolescents are given the opportunity to live these few years to the fullest. But how one views a fruitful high school life is entirely up to them. To some, simply spending their high school days alone in peace appeals to them\u2014a grey-coloured life\u2014while others seek to socialize and immerse themselves in extra-curricular activities\u2014a rose-coloured life. But what would happen if individuals from the two group were to interact with each otheron a regular basis? Will one's lifestyle influence the other's? These are the questions Hyouka seeks to answer.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nIf it's Kyoto Animation, the art will definitely be good, right? While I myself agree to this, do keep in mind that art is a subjective matter\u2014and so are reviews. That said, I have grown to love the unique character designs that are associated with KyoAni productions\u2014and Hyouka isn't exception. The designs give off somewhat of a light and fluffy feeling, in contrast to other anime where the character designs are considerably more rough-looking; female characters greatly benefit from this. Another aspect of the art which I liked was the SHAFT-like style of animation accompanying narration. And while I feel SHAFT's execution of it is better, KyoAni didn't do a bad job themselves. Finally, background details were nicely done like always and accompanied the character designs well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nIndeed, in a slice-of-life anime, characters are generally the focal point. Whether the show is a hit or miss greatly depends on the quality of the characters, with character development being a key factor in determining this. At first, Hyouka presents a group of four seemingly average characters who have their own little quirks but nothing more. However, aided by the mysteries along the way, the personalities of the individuals\u2014particularly main protagonist Oreki H\u014dtar\u014d\u2014in the group slowly changed, more so in the latter half. Seeing H\u014dtar\u014d's transformation from an unmotivated, energy-reserving individual into a slightly sociable person with an interest in mystery was satisfying. It just goes to show that, no matter how firm one is with their current lifestyle, given the right people, change is inevitable\u2014and in H\u014dtar\u014d's case, it was all for the better. If good character development is what you're seeking, Hyouka definitely delivers.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nFrom great theme songs to a cast of talented seiy\u016b, Hyouka did not fall short in this category either. The four theme songs were quite catchy and grew on me quickly, with the second OP and ED pair being slightly more upbeat overall; personally, I preferred the first OP and ED. The BGM was decent too, with some tracks here and there that were memorable. Most impressive was probably the voice acting. In terms of popularity, the duo of Nakamura Y\u016bichi and Sakaguchi Daisuke of CLANNAD fame (Okazaki Tomoya and Sunohara Y\u014dhei, respectively) make their return once again, with Sat\u014d Satomi (Tainaka Ritsu from K-ON!) and Kayano Ai (Yuzuriha Inori from Guilty Crown) completing the main cast. And while popularity is one thing, the four were also able to deliver great performances with their respective characters, truly bringing out the best in each one.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\nIn a sense, it's not so much the mysteries that drive the story, but the characters themselves. While I initially thought Hyouka would be primarily focused on Sherlock Holmes-style mysteries integrated into high school life, I later realized this was not the case. Aside from the one \"main\" mystery, if you would call it that, the story itself was mostly comprised of mini mysteries whose purpose was to serve as a catalyst for character development. Thus, it could be argued that the story was somewhat lacking. That being said, I will admit that quite a handful of them were interesting to say the least, especially when it came to seeing how they were solved. But given that this is a slice-of-life anime to begin with, I guess character development is essentially the overall focus of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nAlthough it has the mystery tag, don't expect Hyouka to be like a Detective Conan. For the lack of a better comparison, think of it like a more lighthearted version of last year's Kamisama no Memochou. From great characters to interesting mysteries, Hyouka is a solid series overall. It was able to successfully integrate the generally dark genre of mystery into a typical high school romantic comedy. And while it wasn't particularly spectacular, I can wholeheartedly say that I enjoyed watching Hyouka.",

            "content": "The show is tagged as a mystery, but that is misleading, I think. It isn't one of those shows with flashy cases where the biggest mystery may be why so many people are being murdered around the amateur genius detective. For Hyouka it is more like puzzles than mysteries... these are day-to-day things that are bothering people, and Oreki is being forced into being involved in solving these conundrums. I suspect the main significance of the puzzles will be that they are being used in the story to involve Oreki in the concerns of others. Given that, I thought it might be useful to layout the surprisingly-nuanced background they've given Oreki, and how Chitanda's unusual nature is locking into that.\\n\\n\r\nLeft to his own devices, Oreki Houtarou would make as little use of his abilities as possible. There is a certain amount of effort that is required to maintain a life with few complications, and that is how much he will expend. There is a certain amount of participation in society that is required to keep you from drawing attention, and that is how much he will participate. He gets amused or annoyed, but not excited or angry... this isn't because he has iron self-control, it is because he has spent years reinforcing the habit of avoiding that level of involvement.\\n\\n\r\nIn the show, this is described as a grey course of minimal participation in life, as opposed to a rose/pink course of actual involvement (with all the dramatic ups and downs that involvement can bring). He doesn't choose the grey course because he believes it to be superior... the show's early minutes make it pretty clear that, if anything, he is inclined to feel the opposite. He chooses the grey course for himself because he honestly believes it to be the right course for him... he is an outsider. The rose course is foreign to him, and filled with behavior and situations he doesn't understand, and that he doesn't have the energy to deal with. He is fascinated with it, as any outsider is with the inside, but he doesn't see any reasonable way that he can be an authentic participant inside. As a result, he has consciously maintained his reclusive approach for many years, comfortably secure even in the face of the goading and criticism of his small circle of acquaintance. His story begins in earnest when he first enters the club space for the Classic Literature Club... and encounters Chitanda Eru.\\n\\n\r\nChitanda is as successful at the rose course as Oreki is at the grey course. Like him, she isn't a participant in her course because she has decided it is the best course for everyone, or because she needs to climb these ladder rungs to reach some particular future goal. She has a natural bent that encourages her course... she has retained a childlike curiosity, coupled with a childlike ability to focus. Those could be applied in successful ways to the sorts of structured challenges we set up for childhood achievements, and I suspect that is the primary source of her list of accomplishments. Unfortunately, there are problems that her curiosity and focus lead her to, which are too complicated for curiosity and focus alone to solve. She needs someone who can analyze things at a system level to proceed, and it was just at a point that her need was the greatest that Oreki Houtarou came into her life.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this combination of timing, need, focus, and curiosity, she innocently becomes the arch-nemesis of Oreki's path through the grey course. She repeatedly pulls him along (often literally) with her on her rose course path, and forces him to become involved in activities and situations that he would otherwise have reflexively, and effortlessly, withdrawn from. Oreki's reactions to her onslaught are beautifully (and hilariously) illustrated by a series of fanciful representations of their interaction, where he is caught in her web, and forced away from his comfortable course, by her singleminded need.\\n\\n\r\nShe isn't cruel, and doesn't dominate him or abuse him... those approaches, often a staple of \"lazy guy\" anime, are ones his habits would allow him to simply sidestep through the logical course of withdrawal. Instead, she -needs- him... desperately, energetically, tirelessly. It is the innocent need a curious child has for someone they trust to help them. As with a child, he could end the relationship in a short order by actively disillusioning her, by breaking her trust in him. But he finds he can't bring himself to do that, and that reluctance is where he becomes pinned down and unable to escape. That reluctance stems from him not being sure he even wants to withdraw from her influence... she is satisfying a need he has, as well (though one, I suspect, that he has reasoned away as unrealistic in the past).\\n\\n\r\nAs Oreki is forced to use his abilities for more than treading life's water, he learns more about himself. While the initial puzzles just laid the character groundwork for us, the first arc puzzle, where they learned the story behind Hyouka, was a bigger milestone. This journey to the truth was deftly handled, so that we could follow the compelling path of discovery he shared with the other club members and, through Oreki's thoughts, the way it touched him in particular.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Oreki's experience with Chitanda has led to him actively considering the merits of his path through the grey course, this is certainly not the first time he has had cause to do that in his life, so we'll have to wait to see how things develop. While the course of the story and the characters will ultimately decide how I feel about the series, I feel comfortable enough at this point to say that it's unlikely that my final score for the series won't be in the 8-10 range. Even if it is handled in a way that I don't consider interesting, the show itself has other merits to recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, it is rather beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation quality is notably high. Far from panning across a still picture, here we see students walking in the distance that are actually walking, etc. In addition to the main setting of the anime, there are flashbacks and reconstructions (as well as those flights of fancy that are used to illustrate Oreki's point of view at that moment). These are presented in unique and creative styles that distinguish them from the main setting, and serve to create a mood that enhances the impact they are intended to have on the story. Sound and music are also well-handled, and support the story in a rich way without becoming distracting.\\n\\n\r\nI find the character designs I've seen so far to be both attractive and appropriate. As for the characters themselves, I've gone on at great length about the main [an/pro]tagonists, Oreki and Chitanda, above. Oreki has two acquaintances from middle school, Fukube Satoshi and Ibara Mayaka, who also have been drawn into the Classic Literature Club's circle. Ibara Mayaka has not received much development at this point of the series, so I don't know what her role may end up being. So far, she seems just to represent an embodiment of an unsuccessful approach to negatively-motivating Oreki into action. While Fukube's discussion approach has also proven unsuccessful in the past, the addition of Chitanda has given him more of a king maker role now. While he has been active in supporting both Oreki and Chitanda's positions in the interactions between those two, he frankly seems more amused by (and more in favor of) Chitanda drawing Oreki out. Fukube is also the single greatest beneficiary of the animation quality of the series, since it allows his continual overly dramatic mannerisms to be portrayed in just about every opportunity he has to speak. :)\\n\\n\r\nI don't think the show will be appealing to folks who are big fans of traditional mystery anime settings. It also doesn't have a hint of fan service, if that is your thing. At this point I'd say an overt romance story is off the table. If you are a fan of an intriguing story that may end up featuring some interesting character development, however, I would say you should definitely check at least the first five episodes of this one out, to see if it works for you.",

            "content": "I'm curious, how this anime amazed me in which I rewatched 2 times.\r\nI'm curious, on what happen after episode 22. The end?\r\nI'm curious\r\nI'm curious.\r\nHyouka, definitely it's a mystery show BUT not your typical mystery show. I find it difficult on distinguishing if this should be a mystery show or mystery + slice of life show. 22 episodes weren't that bad at all. So let me give my thoughts on this.\r\nThe story focuses about Houtarou Oreki, a high school student and is completely withdrawn into himself. His motto is \u201cIf I don\u2019t have to do it, I won\u2019t, if I have to, make it quick.\u201dHer sister who is abroad ask him a favor to join the classics club to prevent from disbanded, since he knew that it's gonna be disbanded, he might take up the favor since he is the only member to join the club and continue to conserve his energy, well not so much after discovering Chitanda Eru is in the club too, and well he might not have the change to conserve his energy since Eru curiosity is targeting towards him so that he can give his answer to her due to his good critical thinking skills. With that it goes all through the arcs on Chitanda's uncle disapperance and the School Cultural Festival and all is solved by Oreki of course. With that said, 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the light novel, Kyoto Animation decided to take charge of it. Known for it's well known anime for such Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and K-On, so why not adapt Hyouka? Turns out pretty amazing, fluidity of the animation wasn't bad, no lag, no loopholes, weird or akward animations. One thing i notice is, there aren't any facial expressions like what in K-on and lucky star have, though it may have a little comedy just little. But overall it's a welldone. Character designs is also a well done and the background and everything isn't too saturated. Basically i can almost see a little bit of realism since it has no facial expressions. Pure artwork. With that 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was astonishing, smoothing and relaxing especially the OSTs or better known as background music . The main OST which took the piece from Bach called Cello Suite No. 1 and Orchestral Suite No. 3 are the most amazing OST i have ever listen. Most of the OSTs perfectly match the atmosphere or the situation in most Hyouka scenes through out the series. I'm truly amazed on how they pick the OST perfectly. With that i rate 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nChitanda is super naive and straight forward person and is very smart heroine. Though she maybe annoying with her 'curiosity' she is still entertain able, Satoshi the character whom he called himself as a database person is a person who never reveal his emotions to Chitanda and Mayaki except for Oreki, his way of talking an explaining on the problem is the most compelling in the show, Mayaka is most likely a person who is seconds away from bursting in angerness to anyone and she loves to pretend to hate Houtarou but seemingly they get along pretty well. For Houtarou, he's just a energy conserver. Rate 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i enjoy watching this series, seeing all kinds of arcs solved by Houtarou, pretty relaxing and enjoyable to watch. Well, 22 episodes aren't that bad but the pace is rather slow but it's what they do as long as it's appealing to watch and not boring. If you guys want to watch both mystery and slice of life shows, this is the perfect combination, fair warning: slow paced but still enjoyable. With that i rate 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, overall rate would be 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S If you're looking for fanservice in here, well bad for you.",

My theory of course was incorrect because the anime was segmented into three main story-lines that were not of equal footing. Personally I thought that if the anime ended after the first ten episodes it would have still remained a good anime.\\n\r\nThe first story was so good that anything following it just seemed to fall flat and the character development was very slow. I suppose it's possible to read into it but I expected something more on the character level of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nHowever what really got me into this anime was the feeling I got while watching this anime. A strong sense of strangeness and other-ness wrapped around the existing world, something similar to xxxHolic and Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei, even 24 Club manga, where you have a feeling you will fall on your head any moment. I enjoyed the intelligence of the main character and his interaction with his best friend. How the anime was set up, I expected something more sinister however, something we don't get even with the abundance of jealousy and loneliness present. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is in the same level of disappointment. It's anti-climatic and completely unrelated to the main-plot of the anime, the mystery, as if it was forgotten in favor of the subplot. I can't say that I don't like how love is presented in this anime, rather normally considering other anime with a few exceptions, but exactly because of that it should not have been the main focus. Truly a disappointment to the anime that started very good then kept falling and dragging out until I had to fast-forward a couple of times just to see something happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed many separate aspects of the anime, however nothing can compensate for me being bored by it especially considering it's supposed to be a mystery anime.",

            "content": "I feel compelled to write a review for this anime since it's just what I wanted for the summer! It's not fast paced nor one of those surreal, fantastical, crazy psych-warfare works but its take on realism, deductive reasoning, and emphasis on the importance of culture and self-discovery makes it really worth checking out.\r\nHyouka, to me, is all about finding out the life that one wants while living it. As obscure as that may sound, it talks about a few high school kids transforming from being conservative and self-serving (in their own ways) to proactive and reflective. While on the micro-level it explores the lifeadventures of these students, it subtly touches on greater topics beyond what you see, such as societal pressure, political influence on education, and responsibility of knowledge, etc. How these aforementioned are hinted throughout the show is simply exquisite and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Kyoto Animation, the art is poetic and just right down to every detail to support the plot and establish the atmosphere of the show. The characters design is above average and not too exaggerated to retain its realism. The entire show is as real as daily life can get, which is great in its own way. Great job on Satomi's part to make a slightly-on-the-edge-of-being-annoying character sound cute and almost likable. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I love the most about this show is the subtly in almost everything yet having emphasis at the right place/time like a prose or a song. That being said, there's still a right amount of dissonance in which the characters struggle at one point or another. Well, life doesn't come without its turbulence. Also, I really enjoyed the way it toys around with the audience by not giving too many hints away so there's always a push to finish each episode and no reason to scream \"imbecile\" at the screen. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are so many great things about Hyouka, the way it divides into several mini plots makes the show sometimes really fun to watch yet other times kind of slow and plain. I guess life is sort of like that, which makes this directive layout reasonable, but this takes away the hook factor and renders my rating down a notch. \\n\\n\r\nI would totally recommend this for anyone; it's a great show to go in between heavy psychological and action watch lists. I know that many don't find this type of anime to be their cup of tea (since that's how I started out), but I find this one to be better than some of the other Kyoto works such as Kanon or Clannad. You'll definitely like it (at least most parts of it) so give it a shot.",

            "content": "To tell you the truth when I first heard of Hyouka it didn't interest me in the least. I mean the synopsis made me think it would turn out to be a historical drama or something with a lot of flashback but I was wrong and really happy to be. From the first episode It glued me to my screen. \r\nFirst the Story: 9\r\nThe good part of this story is that it's not to forced for a mystery anime. I mean, you see how conan just walk in the street and encounter a murder case... This one is not exactly like that.\r\n1. The \"case\" arejust minor incident in a high-schooler life. No death, no kidnapicking, etc...\\n\r\n2. The perpetrator always have good reason. And no real evil intention.\\n\r\n3. About all the case have some reality in them. It's possible for all those case to be around you but you're simply not aware of that. And that's because of Chitanda Eru that Houtarou is always obligated to  solve case that he would'nt bother with normaly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art : 9\\n\r\nWell the chara design is alright. I like the expression of all the characters and the colors are good. \\n\r\nThe animation needs special atention as it's really great and fluid. Just watch the opening^^\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's the selling point of this anime. All the characters have their own personality and evolve with the episodes. The way that satoshi is jealous of Houtarou for being special or the way Houtarou try to deny his ability are all really well made. it made me feel closer to the characters and learning about them from the beginig to the end was a great pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really recommend it to all those people who had a bit of hesitation about picking it up. You won't be disapointed.\\n",

            "content": "If you'd rather listen to this review over reading it, theres a video version here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGXZuZBC7fc\r\nHyouka is a 2012 anime by Kyoto animation, it's a school slice of life (WHAT OMG SO ORIGINAL KYOANI HOW U DO DIS MIND=BLOWN) but in all seriousness this show is actually fairly fresh and has a rather unique feel, unlike some of the other SoL Kyoto animation are known for, notably, Kyoukai No Kanata and Haruhi Suzumiya, which both actually have story's where stuff ACTUALLY HAPPENS, this... Doesn't. Literally nothing happens, like, at all. Hell even K-ON had a more serious plot than this show, and that's not abad thing don't get me wrong, cos the story isn't actually the strongest part of the... Story... Yeah, ummm. It's the characters, there's about half a dozen important characters in the show, and of them, 4 of them are even more important and of them, 2 of them are even more important, it starts with the very typical boy joins club in high school, girl is in club at high school, friends join and get involved plot happens kind of story, but about as early as half way through the first episode, you kinda sorta feel like this will be different, you see that the main character Oreki, isn't the stereotypical naive yet lovable and aloof MC, or rather, he's a lazy ass son of a bitch that only does what he absolutely has to do and nothing more, and what he does have to do, he does quickly so that he can get back to \"conserving his energy\" AKA sitting on his ass doing fuck all... And immediately I relate to this character... It's great, he joins the club cos his big sis told him to or something, it's not all to clear but that's pretty much the just of it, when he gets to the club room and walks in, the second MC Chitanda is already there, she recognises him as the lazy Oreki, even though they've never spoken, which immediately reveals how crazy this girl is, THEYVE NEVER SPOKEN, THEYRE IN DIFFERENT CLASSES, HE DIDNT EVEN KNOW WHO SHE WAS... SHE KNEW ALMOST EVERY THING ABOUT HIM, it's serves to strengthen our understanding of both characters, andddddd, if you were paying any attention you would have picked up almost as much information about Chitanda (aside from the fact that she is the generic KyoAni moeblob that we've all come to expect) as you have from Oreki, they're both pretty different characters as apposed to what you'd expect from this genre, and to be honest there's no real romance or connection between them... Well... I mean... There kinda is I guess. It's hinted at that they kinda dig each other, and we can assume that, what 3 years after the series finished, there like 20 now? Yeah they banging... Anyway the other two important notably characters would be Satoshi, Orekis, pretty much only friend by the looks of it, and Mayaka, one of chitandas friends, Satoshis girl friend and all round bitchy bitch... It's makes me wonder actually, since there close friends to both Chitanda and Oreki, and have known them for a long time, and there dating, how come Oreki and Chitanda have never even met... Dafuk, anyway it's unimportant... What IS important is that these two support characters support the main characters (who woulda thunk it) Satoshi likes to think of himself as some kind of \"database\" and somehow has an absurd amount of information on pretty much everything, Mayaka is just a smart girl who's very smart and pushy,  these 2 characters are really my only gripe with the series, and by that I mean, I wish I could see more into there lives too, they're shown to be incredibly relatable and human characters going through an experiencing things many people have been through in the school lives. there are a few episodes throughout this 22 episode long series that are almost entirely focused on them, but aside from that it's mainly centred on Oreki and his overbearing weakness to Chitanda, and mo specifically, the words \"watashi kininanimasu\". It roughly translates to \"I can't stop thinking about it\" and is essentially orekis trigger, when Chitanda leans in blatantly intrudes on his personal space, and shoves her big round... Eyes.... In his face, and then shouts this at him, he can't really do anything aside from helping her, and this is where the \"mystery\" part of the series comes into play, it follows a fairly episodic structure, with mainly 1 or two episode long arcs\u00a0 which normally end with Oreki solving the glorified mystery (more like riddle, or puzzle, or in one case, math equation...) but there is one longer arc that lasts about half the series, and that arc is probably my favourite story arc of any arc I've seen in any anime ever, it brings together all of the characters we've met already, brings them all together to try and solve an actually mystery... Finally something's happening right? Nope. Still the same slice of life stuff, that, if you think about it, doesn't really matter, but that's the beauty of the show, you really care about it, it feels like it does matter, and it makes you wanna find out the answers, even if it's just so you can brag to your friend who you forced to watch the show about how you solved the mystery before the answer was revealed *cough* this is also where two more important characters are fleshed out, they had both been spoken about and introduced previously but only as side characters but here we see more of the student council president who's name I can't fucking remember at all, meh, and Irisu-senpai, aka best grill, she acts as kind of a mentor to Chitanda through out this arc and teaches her ways to get Oreki to do what she wants, aka the basics of seduction.... Nice. Through this, Chitanda becomes aware of Orekis weakness which leads to some of the more humourous scenes in the show, where Chitanda fails and convince him due to her own naivety and innocence, and where Oreki gets all flustered cos a cute girl just jumped up infront of him and tried to act all seductive n stuff without even knowing what she was doing.... Either way the mystery gets solved and it returns to its much more peaceful episodic format for the last few episodes and at this point you really see how all of the characters have changed, Satoshi has become more humble, but also has developed a great deal of both respect\u00a0 and resentment for Oreki who, whilst being incredibly lazy, solves all the mysteries with relative easy whilst he (who likes to think of himself as some kind of detective) could not, Mayaka shows her insecurity throughout, both infront of Satoshi, and during he manga club problems, and at the end, after confronting them all, she has become much more reliable and confident, Chitanda has become a little less naive but pretty much doesn't change, and Oreki, well he doesn't really change at all, he just becomes a little less lazy, which all works out for the better.\\n\\n\r\nIn short it's a great and very interesting series with a unique story in where literally nothing of any importance happens at all, and yet it feels super dramatic thanks to the strength of the characters and the artistic direction (the art is fantastic btw, like even compared to other KyoAni stuff, it's beautiful) there's a reason this is on my favourite anime list on my MAL account...\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Yeah to some people, I kinda see it like marmite, you either think it's a master piece or you absolutely hate it and find it boring as hell, I'm in the first camp, the only difference is, if you like marmite, I might say \"yuck it's disgusting how can u like that stuff\" but if you don't like hyouka I won't even talk to you... Like seriously, get out of my sight right now you fucking WEEB... But in all seriousness, go and watch this series right now, even if your one of the people who would find it boring, it's something I think you should experience either way.\\n\\n\r\nMy score for hyouka is 10/10... Also if this review wasn't enough to persuade you to watch it, hyouka translates to ice cream... Yeah... And if you don't like ice cream, even if you lactose intolerant, there's something wrong with you...",

            "content": "When asked whether or not I'm a KyoAni fan, I'd always say that I'm more or less indifferent towards them. They've got their works which I absolutely adore (Clannad, Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya) and then there are those that I can't say I'm a big fan of (K-On! comes to mind). After enjoying Amagi Brilliant Park immensely, I came to Hyouka as their next work on my to-watch list. And \"color me\" extremely impressed. I don't think I'll have issues with calling myself a KyoAni fan anymore.\r\nHere's one thing Hyouka manages to do right off the bat - get me interested in the shenanigans ofschool-going kids and their curious adventures in the domain of unknown. Usually, it'd take a lot longer for me to get invested in these characters and their adventures, maybe 3-4 episodes into the series or even more, but thanks to the extremely likable characters, things become a lot easier. The main character, a lazy slob with his motto in life being modeled around the law of conservation of energy, is a lead well done due to the fact that he's not exactly a cardboard cutout like a lot of protagonists these days seem to be. His actions, at least initially, are dictated by his energy conservation principle - he weighs in all the alternatives to settle on the one which requires least expenditure of energy. His development as a character is handled pretty well with the catalyst being none other than the female lead - Chitanda Eru, a cute but highly curious character. Her curiosity knows no bounds and she often ends up dragging Oreki, our protag, into matters that he'd rather stay away from. The mysteries that are dealt with in this show are often the product of our lovely Chitanda getting all curious about something that takes place in their everyday life and our gang that comprises of two more characters, who are nicely handled for the most part, going about finding a solution to the said mystery. Now, a \"mystery\" that is a product of curiosity regarding something that can happen in your normal everyday life doesn't exactly seem like an exciting prospect. At least, it didn't to me when I was thinking of getting into this series. But it'll suffice to say that they manage to pull it off somehow - making the mysteries sufficiently interesting so as to make the viewer curious enough to keep them watching -episode after episode. The show definitely does deserve credit for that. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is like a loosely tied bunch of short arcs and standalone episodes. We're dealing with a KyoAni show, you know? But they're well done. The \"arcs\" got me invested and the standalone episodes had some good content. And each episode feels like it amounted to something so you don't come out of any episode feeling like you've just wasted the past twenty or so minutes of your life watching something that doesn't hold any weight. I'd advise against going into it expecting it to be a tightly strung story because it doesn't possess that. But the \"stories\" that it showcases, of our protagonists' lives, are well done and you'd probably have a nice time sitting through 'em. \\n\\n\r\nExtremely appealing to the eyes and extravagantly detailed backgrounds - they've long been KyoAni staples. And it is great to see they do not disappoint in Hyouka, either. Every single frame has been given careful attention and they look exquisitely beautiful. The last episode, or more specifically the closing sequence, was nothing short of stunning as far as visual presentation goes, for instance. Character animation, in particular, is extremely fluid and just fantastic all across the board. They do not disappoint as far as the OST or the music goes, either. Should suffice to say that the OST used is very fitting and compliments each scene very well. Would like to specifically mention the first OP - 'twas catchy as hell.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka isn't groundbreaking. It isn't anything close to being a masterpiece. But it definitely isn't an experience I'd rather miss. A neatly done package with great animation, likable characters, stories that manage to stay intriguing throughout its run and a healthy dose of Chitanda's \"Watashi...kiminarimasu!\" make it a pretty good watch. \\n\\n\r\nRecommended watch. \\n",

            "content": "The title Hyouka is the classified works of the Classics Club that is hinted to be filled with mystery that has filled a ruckus in the school's history and past. Is the main plot worth it? If you have to ask me, I don't even know if this really \"is\" the main genre as the anime's pace was just \"too\" early that the upcoming episodes turned into some random mysteries and really had nothing to do with the title \"Hyouka\".\r\nAn anime that is entitled under the main genre \"Mystery\" -- with a tang of romance and character development. The anime just didn't mixed well.\r\nThe seriesin itself was something I've been anticipating during the Spring of 2012. The summary felt weird and a lot of expectations were growing in my head about the Hyouka Mystery... but then my expectations didn't match up and it turned mandatory to watch the last few episodes. The last episodes didn't felt like a Mysterious anime anymore.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nIs there really a story in Hyouka? The anime's pacing was just too fast that the main climactic plot of Hyouka was soon finished within 5 episodes. Soon after those episodes, the anime's main mystery was just left aside and the Classics Club started to solve more mysteries -- thus losing the importance of the title \"Hyouka\". The next few episodes were just inconsistent as the anime takes the \"mystery\" genre of the anime into a character development by the far end of the series. I also don't get why there is no Romance genre in this anime as I know there is -- for a bit. The whole mystery, character development with a bit of romance just didn't mesh well. It was just all scattered.\\n\\n\r\n\"What is the main agenda of the anime? I don't really know.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nDespite its deformed story, the animation was flawless. Seeing Chitanda Eru's long hair falling gracefully was spectacular. The animation had a resemblance of K-ON! and Kokoro Connect and it definitely didn't disappoint me. What is much better than the animation? The color combination! Truly one of the best color combinations out there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe anime changed it's OPs and EDs during the half of the show -- like every other series. I definitely love the first half OP and ED because of how the upbeat opening song suddenly ends up softly with a good harmonious song. The second half of OP and ED was good but the 1st half was much better. The soundtrack though was something I wouldn't consider a memorable one. The voice actors/actresses have remarkably done well in their positions. The anime picked just the right people for this anime -- most especially Oreki and Chitanda.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nFour different people together in one club. I can't seem to hate anyone in the anime. The surprising act of the anime is that they tried to develop the \"true\" personality of these characters \"only\" at the last few episodes. It was a risk that failed. They could have done this somewhere in the middle of the anime and still continue with the main genre of the anime -- Mystery.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI enjoyed solving mysteries with Oreki but then after every episode I would just ask myself -- where's the main plot? If the anime was just something that would solve random mysteries and not on the most important one -- then why can't they just not title the anime \"Hyouka\" then? It's more mind-bobbling that most of the viewers more highly anticipating about Oreki and Eru's relationship while I was here just waiting for its main idea. What affected me the most about the anime is the drastic change of the mystery anime into a character relationship development that I can't seem to know why they even did that. The ending seems to be perplexed with no mystery at all -- making it look like they ended it into a typical clich\u00e9 ending. Concluding my enjoyment and expectations at a full drop.\\n\\n\r\nOver-all: 6\\n\r\nGiving a title to an anime is important. It gives the viewers an impression or a curious thought. Hyouka just didn't seem feel right to have the title for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf the anime has to live up with the title then they should have named this anime \"The Classics Club and their Mysterious Adventures\". If they titled the anime \"Hyouka\" then they should have used that title as their basis of the story. The mysterious adventures just went bizarre even to the pointless of things -- everybody just felt curious while I was still holding to the feeling of what's the point of it? Hyouka didn't felt right with my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just one of those \"Feel Good\" animes or just for pure enjoyment. Despite the numerous number of flaws in the anime. Hyouka is one of those take a break and just watch this random anime.",

            "content": "About the STORY\r\nTo be honest, the basic layout of the story is very typical; an almost terminated club that becomes the center of the story, a typical laid-back protagonist, a cute and very curious ojou-chan character, a noisy yet brilliant sidekick, and a very chivalrous tsundere-like character. However, the mysteries and how all of it is solved is the thing that separates the story from the others. It\u2019s almost so funny yet amazing that even the simplest and smallest incidents become an interesting mystery to be solved by the characters. It just shows that mysteries don\u2019t necessarily need to have very complicated plots to makeit interesting enough. The details with the investigation or theories are so brilliantly done. It definitely makes anyone anticipate the revelations at the end so bad.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nJust like the story, the line of characters is also very typical. However, each of their character is still made interesting. That would be because they just look typical at first but as the series go by, the depth of each character is still explored. There\u2019s more to them than meets the eye. It\u2019s also noticeable that each character has their individual set of mysteries and issues themselves. And the protagonist is not the only one with a very keen observation because the other main characters are also quite smart on their own way.\\n\\n\r\nAbout OREKI HOUTARO\\n\r\nThe protagonist couldn\u2019t be perfect for the type of story the series has; a lazy and most of expressions are \u201cmendokusai\u201d and \u201cmuri\u201d type of guy yet still incredibly smart. It\u2019s the typical lazy protagonist whose eyes always say, \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d but in truth still goes out of his way to do something for others which can be cute sometimes. It\u2019s almost like a \u201ctsundere\u201d character because of not being honest of what he truly feels. It is given that if it\u2019s a mystery story, the protagonist has a very keen observation; a very important skill of what a mystery protagonist should have.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nIn the line of the 2012 animes, this series is one of the few with very noticeable well-made and very modern animation. Even the characters are so modernly and nicely done particularly Chitanda Eru who can definitely compete with some all-time favorite female characters. The sounds are perfect for the genre of the series. It gives more feeling and anticipation in the mysteries of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nMystery will always be a hit particularly for me. Like others, mysteries always bring the most exciting feeling of storytelling. The thrill of discovery will always consume anyone, either a mystery fan or not. What makes the mysteries of this series different from others is the fact that it\u2019s not the very clich\u00e9 complicated mystery you see every day. It\u2019s just simple incidents on the school but somehow it becomes so exciting and interesting. I believe it\u2019s amazing in itself as we all know that those typical complicated mysteries are always the one that would immediately get anyone\u2019s attention. It\u2019s a whole new and definitely different approach with mystery. Though, it\u2019s really kind of weird that they are Classics Club when they\u2019ve done nothing but investigate. They should have been Investigation Club or Mystery Club.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 10\r\nHyouka is a series within which a lot of things happen while being seemingly uneventful. Each scene is carefully and sensitively crafted to contribute to a bigger picture; at no point is the viewer given less than is needed to solve the mysteries, and the solutions never feel unreasonable or forced. At each interaction, new information and insight is gleaned, giving the viewer a deeper understanding of the people and issues at hand. It really makes you appreciate the importance of little moments and details that help shape the path of a lifetime. At the end of it all, you look back and realisehow far everyone's come. Still, life goes on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nKyoAni outdid itself in designing characters that were distinctive, yet natural in their environment and amongst other characters. In spite of the otherwise generic high school setting, a great deal of visual interest was inserted by way of overactive imaginations, metaphorical explanations, and various distortions as to overwhelm the senses when required. The animation quality was consistently excellent throughout the series, with body language playing a huge part in characterisation and giving insight into mental states.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe mysteries in Hyouka aren't necessarily big or important in the grand scheme of things; it's more about satisfying curiosities, and doing what feels important right now. For that purpose, background tracks are used to great effect in order to amp up tension and anticipation, giving weight to the current situation. Meanwhile, the OPs and EDs set the light-hearted tone of the series and remind us to take a step back.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nWith Oreki Houtarou as our main POV character, his \"grey\"-ness is a sort of extreme that both contrasts against, and complements, the rest of the cast in interesting ways. He and Chitanda Eru are compelling opposites in how their cognitive and affective empathy work in conjunction with personality quirks to produce very different approaches to problem-solving, to say nothing of their actual levels of interest in solving them. With best friend Fukube Satoshi, they both struggle to balance and come to terms with subjectivity and objectivity, from opposite ends of the spectrum. Meanwhile, Ibara Mayaka is a standard-bearer of honest emotional expression and engagement, who rarely tends to extreme behaviours such as controlling and masking, making her clash with Oreki's general disinterest and apathy.\\n\\n\r\nEach character is given depth and their own set of circumstances and motivations for doing what they do, making even secondary characters interesting when they reappear in unrelated situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nEven after learning the tricks to the mysteries, it's still fun to rewatch and see how the clues were hidden. At the same time, Oreki's growth, shift in priorities, and developing awareness of the people around him is truly gratifying to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI love everything about this series, except for the fact there's not more of it.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a slice of life about high school kids, Hyouka is probably a great choice for you. If you saw the mystery tag and thought this might be something to keep you constantly intrigued, searching for details and over analyzing, I would steer you elsewhere, as would I anyone looking for anything other than a high school slice of life. While it is beautifully animated, has some decent(ish) characters, and DOES have mysteries, it lacks anything that will stir up a desire to know what comes next. The mysteries all relate to trivial things, with nothing at stake and nothing to belost if they don't solve it. The romance(s) are borderline non existent, with only a slight acknowledgement to their possibility in one or two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis was the only anime besides season 2 of Haruhi to genuinely put me to sleep, despite an effort to be interested.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Oreki is your average background high schooler. He has little ambition, and tries to coast through life with little to no effort. To paraphrase him \"If I don't have to do it, I wont. If I have to, I'll do it as quick as possible.\" This was more or less my outlook on life in high school, so I found his character to be very relatable and realistic. His graduated sister forces him into a promise to join the Classic Lit Club, her former club, to ensure the clubs history preservers. This is where he is introduced to the ever curious Eru Chitanda, the niece of another former CLC member. Accompanying them are two of Oreki's acquaintances Mayaka and Satoshi, who also juggle membership in other clubs. Over the coarse of the show they solve minor mysteries usually related to school, and Chitandas curious nature slowly brings out a different side of Oreki.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were all fairly likeable and realistic, however none of them stood out as incredible. I found Oreki to be the most relatable, however his lazy attitude was occasionally annoying to me, even as a bit of a slacker myself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The highlight of the show, it was spectacularly animated. Characters were well designed, animation was smooth, and the art utilized very calming and beautiful color schemes.\\n",

            "content": "*Spoiler free*\r\nIt's sad having so cool characters with cool personalities with cool designs and wasting them on such a boring story...\r\nStory-  The anime is about 4 kids that go to the same high school, are in the same club and basically solve mysteries. Although don't imagine anything close to a Sherlock Holmes detective story. Most of the mysteries are everyday things that happen to most of highschool kids but nobody bothers to uncover them. Although it'd be unfair to say that all of them are bad. Some of the mysteries they intend to solve are somewhat interesting and yes they might make you curiousaswell. But the majority are boring mysteries that if anybody told you about them you'd be like ''Who cares?'' although those tend to last about an episode or so. Overall if you're searching for a detective story I'm pretty sure you can find better, if you want a highschool story with romance and comedy you can find better aswell. Yes, there is comedy and romance in ''Hyouka'' but... the comedy is really blunt and won't actually make you laugh you can just acknowledge that there is comedy in this show and about the romance... it's just the fact that there is no development with it just appears a little bit and then fades away. I would never call ''Hyouka'' a bad anime, just a boring one. It is only worth watching if you got time to waste.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -  I'd say 3 out of 4 main characters are really interesting. (I don't wanna get in detail why cause if you're going to watch the show it's better uncovering them on yourself).\\n\\n\r\nArt-  I have to say that the animation in this anime was amazing. They tend to use really warm coloring that really makes you feel comfortable while watching it.. idk it's weird.\\n\\n\r\nSound-  Amazing OSTs and overall music that made even really boring parts somewhat interesting.\\n\\n\\n",

To solved a mystery in regards to What Chitanda's Uncle last word to her that she can't remember.. and that name the series \"HYOUKA\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story and the plot is great, you are growing with the character.The main character is literally my favorite type of characters,the expressionless type,mysterious and cool.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically the music is good, great combination with  all the scenes and moments...though i find strange hearing a classical piece like Bach cello over one or two episodes but i find it great.\\n\\n\r\nWell about the ending ,uhm its not that, im sad or dissapointed in getting here...seriously cant just end an anime like this whyyyy!!  well im hoping there's a Season 2 for Hyouka like Chitanda will always said \"watashi kininarimasu!\"\\n\\n\r\nGreat anime indeed! otsukaresama deshita !\\n",

This isn't to say it isn't worth watching, as i stated above this is a journey anime. If you enjoy character development and interaction between characters in anime, you know what i mean wheni differentiate between \"journey\" animes and \"climax.\" animes. \\n\\n\r\na journey anime is one that may not have the best conclusion, but is still amazing because of the journey it brings you on felt perfect in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\na climax anime builds and builds until the end, and if the end isn't good it could ruin the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, a journey anime relies on making a well rounded \"every episode and arc feels amazing\", while a climax builds for an amazing ending. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my random thoughts on anime in general, and if you got through that rambling, i invite you to take part in this journey.\\n\\n\\n\r\none last question:  What is your rose coloured highschool life?",

            "content": "Ah, Hyouka - a series from KyoAni with a committed fanbase and a committed group of detractors. Both definitely have points, and hopefully I can help those curious about the show to figure out if it's worth their time. I can say I'm definitely glad I watched it now that it's all over, but I can't say that I felt that way the entire time I was watching (enduring at points?) the series. Let me explain: the first few episodes are dull. Just completely and utterly pointless and boring. Some will say that this is to the show's benefit, and I would say these peopleare not necessarily wrong, but the first six episodes will definitely turn away a lot of people. \\n\\n\r\nA note about the major points of contention before I continue with my own views: The movie arc (episodes 8-11) and the immediately succeeding festival arc (12-17) are pretty much the meat of the series, and watching the two is generally recommended. The latter is considered by many who even are ambivalent or dislike the show to be one of the better done school festivals in a slice of life. The rest of the series is very, very hit and miss.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] - 6\\n\r\nIgnoring the early Classics Club \"arc,\" which generally lacked propulsion, and the movie and festival arcs, which had it in spades, the show is made up of self-contained episodes wherein Oreki solves a mystery about some topic that is sometimes forced to be mysterious. These episodes, which make up a good half of the series and bookend it, can either be taken as inertia-filled character development opportunities or completely aimless attempts to show off KyoAni's budget. The conclusions are usually fun, even if the process isn't, and none of the curiosities feel cheap. Sadly, a lot of these episodes are formulaic and their strength comes from the characters, so I can't recommend the stories on their own. The good pacing and general captivation of the multi-episode arcs, however, serve to balance this problem and prevent me from scoring this as lowly as I could.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] and [Sound] - 9\\n\r\nThese two HAVE to be lumped together for this series. KyoAni's impressive atmospheric precision and high quality are here. Even in the more boring mysteries, the animations of Oreki's thought process are nearly breathtaking. Complement these with a varied soundtrack featuring far more than the typical orchestral range of higher-brow anime, and you've got a winner. These are the points that make me wish I liked the series more, because listening to or looking at the series is an absolute joy from start to finish. Seriously immersive, seriously worth the price of admission if you can stomach that they're misused.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] - 7\\n\r\nI can't say I disliked any of the characters, and there was a good swath of side characters to maintain interest, but the central characters were hit and miss in the development department. The slow, very organic progression is executed well for a time, but certain arcs (and, much more frequently, single episodes) throw a large amount of drama into the mix all at once, making the transitions from beginning to end jumpy and leaving me, for one, confused. Romantic tension in the series between two of the characters is rarely referenced until it becomes clear in one of the FINAL EPISODES that it was a defining moment that weighed on both characters' minds throughout. Take also the example of Oreki's self-doubt about midway through and how quickly it comes about and then is resolved (yes, the OVA does a good amount to explain the latter part, but it is not so much as REFERENCED again until, again, the final couple of episodes). This kind of characterization bugs me, especially in light of the fact that in one season of much fewer episodes, a lot of shows are able to create a forward narrative that makes the characters change at a steady, if unrealistically quick, rate. There is a balance here, and Hyouka experiments, but it fails in that it is too jarring when the characters up and change in one rush of emotion.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] - 6\\n\r\nAnd here's the big nail in the coffin for Hyouka: a solid half of the episodes warrant not a single rewatch. They are meaningless, grasping, and silly, misusing characters who really are interesting and an art direction that is virtually peerless. The pacing of the series is all wrong, and the choice to make the climax about five or six episodes before the series is resolved (with only the final two episodes dealing with any resolution at all) is very misguided.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, Hyouka is a boring watch with a couple of solid sets of episodes. Sorry to sound like a broken record, but there's not much more I can dissect. In short, if you are willing to sink into some of the slowest writing ever for big intermittent payoffs, this is your show. If not, I suggest you find something lighter or at least with a single narrative thread that at least appears in each episode to provide unification and that all-important desire to watch another episode after you finish one.",

            "content": "HYOUKA: The Ice Cream Anthology\r\nI learnt about Hyouka when going through the recommendations thread here in MAL and got intrigued due to the combination of High School and detective fiction.  And as a big fan of both genres I decided to give it a chance.\r\nSTORY (9): It is about a boy, Houtarou Oreki being requested by her sister to reestablish the Classics Club in their school and there he joins Eru Chitanda, Satoshi Fukube and Mayaka Ibara. They encounter mysteries that are happening  around the school as well as the events in their outside life in high school. The premise kind of remindsme of Tantei Gakuen Q but still they differ in the execution in combining high school and mystery genres. The opening arc of the series is really interesting and the mysteries are not that hard but not that easy either which can give you a good chance in solving the cases as the episode continues unlike in Detective Conan or Tantei Gakuen Q. Also the mysteries presented are very wholesome.\\n\\n\r\nART (10): Hyouka was produced by Kyoto Animation and they mostly specialize in high school anime. It is very well done in my opinion. The animation is fluid but the colors are kind of limited in my opinion, but it works well with how the anime is shown.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8): Background music for Hyouka is very typical for the high school scenes and for the mysteries, its not much as heart pounding as I have hoped for but they are still reputable. The OPs and EDs used are okay in my book. And if I have to pick my favorite among them, it would be the 1st OP theme.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (9): The four leads have practically have only two types of demeanor: the quiet and the loud one. Two for each type of demeanor. Houtarou is the smart, lazy and silent type. Eru is the demure yet sometimes \"gets in your face\" when she's intrigued by something. While Satoshi and Mayaka are practically the same when it comes to personality. Their personalities might be very common but the chemistry between the four works really well. Their designs are realistic as possible such as hair style and color except in the eye color department.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL (9 and 9): When I was watching Hyouka, I actually felt very happy every time I get to solve the case presented in the show. The depth of the show is enough for all types people with different thinking to enjoy it unlike in Detective Conan and Tantei Gakuen Q where most cases are really hard. It is a good show to practice basic deduction skills as well as observation skills.",

            "content": "\"I'm not lazy, I'm just conserving my energy\" -Oreki Houtarou\r\nHmm, I'm gonna summarize my review, and this is my very first review as well.\r\nThe Pros of the anime, it followed what Oreki's nature is, the energy conserving guy. You won't see either romance in him or being active (even though you may see in other episodes that he is somehow \"curious\" about Chitanda). Still at the end, he stayed in that nature. Next is how his outlook on things changing, from grey to a colored one and that is Chitanda's role. She serves as a trigger to release some of Oreki's energy (do not thinkof this as love in Oreki's POV) to do some stuff like thinking, solving, etc. Next is how he deduce some mysteries and problems. In other detective stories or anime, you can see that they ensure that they come up with a theory that is 100% complete but here you can see that there are instances where he falls short, uses the theory of his fellow friends and etc. Last is how the story is changing Oreki's life to a rose red or whatever you call that little by little that's why this anime deserves a season 2. Art is good, I like it especially those flower effects around Chitanda. Sound is also okay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Cons. First, I don't like how the story skipped some events, activities, time, etc. I know some of you like it but this is my opinion. What if they added a few arc or a twist to make it more thrilling to watch and what Oreki is really capable of. Next is how they make Chitanda too much annoying (I know you may get mad when saying this but please bear with me. It's my opinion). It sometimes get on my nerves on how she interact with others. What I want is for her to be less annoying. Next is Mayaka. I know she is in the Manga Club but don't you want her to contribute more in the Classic's club? Finally, what if they add more members? Like make them 5 or 6 who really wants to be in the club?\\n\\n\r\nThat's what I want, to add more twists and stories that is why I want this anime to have a season 2. Find out Chitanda's personal reasons in the club, Satoshi's goal and true nature, capabilities of Oreki, Mayaka's contribution and the club's secret and how will it grow.\\n\\n\r\nThere you have it, my review. Some of you might hate it but this is what I observed while watching the anime. Thank you for reading it I hope it helps",

            "content": "Hyouka involves an \"energy-conserving\" protagonist in Oreki Houtarou. Put bluntly, he is lazy. He will not do anything unless he has to, and if he has a task to do, he will complete it in a swift, efficient fashion. That is his motto. \"If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick\" This all changes in his joining of the Classics Club.\r\nThe story of Hyouka revolves around the Classics Club and its members--mainly focused around Oreki Houtarou and Chitanda Eru. Chitanda's endless curiosity leads to the demise of his lifestyle, as he is coveted intosolving each and every one of her inquiries. This setup is problematic as it  often leads to the anime being episodic as the it progresses. Often times as I was watching the series, I found myself checking the previous  episode because I felt I had skipped an episode due to the lack of connection between each one. That was only a minor problem, however, and it sometimes was dealt with through multiple-episode arcs such as the Hyouka mystery, or the thief of the Cultural Festival.The mysteries were by far my favorite part of the anime. They exercise your brain by making you think, and it is very entertaining as Houtarou uses his to solve them. That is the premise of Hyouka--Chitanda becoming curious, and Houtarou succumbing to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two members of the Classics Club are Fukube Satoshi and Ibara Mayaka. Satoshi considers himself a \"database\" and limits himself to not drawing conclusions. I found him to be entertaining and likable as he often uses this as an excuse for his incompetence, leaving   Houtarou to finish off the mystery. Mayaka is a hardworking girl, who is strict with herself and sometimes others. I will not say I disliked her, but I felt she had no part in the solving of the mysteries. As a whole, the cast of Hyouka levels out to be exceptional, and they kept me entertained throughout the whole anime.\\n\r\nThe art style of Hyouka is well-done, especially with the character designs. I wouldn't say it's beautiful, but you should have no complaints with the art if you decide to watch the series. It is a relatively new anime, so if high-quality is your cup of tea, Hyouka is for you. The soundtrack was decent. I never skipped the openings, mainly because I never do, but the first opening I enjoyed a lot. The original soundtracks were good, especially when it came to solving mysteries. As a whole, the art and soundtrack is not amazing, but is in no means bad, and was executed properly. If you are planning to watch this show, they should pose no problem at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hyouka is an anime in which you can relax and think at the same time. It combined the genres of mystery and slice-of-life, and executed them perfectly. As for my enjoyment, Hyouka is a great watch. I was never once bored during it. If you're planning to watch it, I would highly recommend it, whether you want to think or relax.\\n",

            "content": "\" I hope you choose this moment and the light that lies before you. We don't know where we might go, so after the sigh, just take another breath. \" - Hyouka\r\nThe tittle itself, Hyouka is described as i-ce cream which is sweet and loved by most and might be bitter and disliked for some. Truth works the same way. Not every truth can lead to a happy ending, and yet people want to know the truth behind everything, anticipated the worst scenario and still crave for it. This unusual phenomenon is known as curiosity.\r\nHyouka has a unique way of portraying it, through the mainfemale character, making it one of her lovable personalities. The story centers around middle school teenagers solving cases revolving around the school, cases that are not that interesting, in fact. I feel the lack of character development for Satoshi and Miyaka, even though they are just side characters and thinking they have the potential to love up to. The character development for Oreki and Chitanda, on the other hand is quite good, especially for Oreki who would go that far and ignore his principle of energy conservation just for her cute smile and one simple thanks.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the mysteries has its own charm. Rather than focusing on detective-solving-cases genre, this anime also includes the romantic yet awkward relationship between its two main characters, matching up a lazy but smart Oreki and a curious yet powerful ( rich ) Chitanda with awkward yet heart-grabbing moments along with their friends. The music used is suitable with each scenario, the suspense, boredom, kawai moments and more. And the art is probably most reviews are giving the scores for, as the art is very detailed with each petals falling from sakura tree can be seen clearly and a change of emotion in split seconds can be captured as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're looking for a more light-hearted detective style ( cuteness  may overloads ) of anime for a change over those intense and gloomy anime, you should stop here and give it a try. Who knows? Maybe you'll be thrilled by it.",

            "content": "I'm going to preface this review by saying I am probably not the sort of person this anime was made for. In terms of the typical male-focused coming-of-age/first love stories, I'm probably pretty far from the demographic that it'll hit home for!\r\nIt's a strange thing to compare it to, but the Disney-Pixar movie Brave likely had a similar effect on its audience - some people just lack the life experiences that make it easier to relate to the story and characters.\r\nSTORY (3/10)\r\nHyouka being a slice of life, it was never going to have a particularly complex story. Even so, I felt that the lack ofconsistent pacing and character development actively prevented me from fully enjoying the series. The story is by far the weakest aspect of Hyouka - it's not quite long enough as an anime to get away with dropping arcs significant to the main characters and coming back to them later, but it does this anyway. Pseudo-'filler' arcs all follow the same theme of Chitanda being impressed by Oreki, and Oreki becoming more interested in Chitanda, with the (not particularly interesting) mysteries serving as a means to that end. Chitanda is curious, Oreki tries to avoid her, Chitanda is a bit dense, Oreki is dragged into the mystery and solves it, Chitanda is impressed and maybe gets up close to his face, they both blush, Oreki is now more interested in Chitanda. The result is a story whose pieces are actually better enjoyed individually than as a whole. Pulling out the arcs with actual character development in them, watching those, and treating the fillers as OVA material might add to the enjoyment factor a little?\\n\\n\\n\r\nART (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs ever, KyoAni knows how to make an absolutely gorgeous show.\\n\r\nThe character designs are simple but distinctive - little details like Chitanda's hair's unmistakeable rounded silhouette and Oreki's morning hair make them memorable. Even side characters benefit from this treatment! the attention to detail is fantastic, moments of relative quiet allow viewers to notice small accessories, fleeting expressions and background animation, and as ever KyoAni has the nostalgic, historic school setting down to a fine art. The second opening and Oreki's theories and daydreams are vividly animated, especially the moments depicting how he is captivated by Chitanda - those had me partially conviced that the series has elements of magical realism woven into it and that Chitanda does in fact wield a sort of bewitching power!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nWonderful music choices throughout, the Bach cello piece especially is used to great effect and helps give the series its nostalgic and somewhat magical feel. Actually, there's quite a bit of Bach in this series.. In terms of original soundtrack, the OPs also align really well with Oreki's character development, with the first being slow (almost lethargic) and the second along with its video tying in with some of those themes of Hyouka's mundanely magical atmosphere. The EDs are fun but a little less good, largely focusing on the girls pining over the guys, being adorable and looking into the camera with huge doe-eyes.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was good quality and fit the characters. All the voices were suitably expressive, though maybe not as distinctive as the characters' visual designs!\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I'm being a little harsh in this section, but I weighted it towards the original soundtrack slightly and the OPs fitted so well with Oreki's character development that I was hoping for something better for the girls, or even anything for poor Fukube.. Regardless, a score of 7 is still really good, and subjectively I definitely go back and listen to the soundtrack sometimes!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nPretty much everything said in the story section applies here. A slice of life's story is only really as good as its handling of the characters, and Hyouka is a fairly weak in this area. the characters were actually likeable, though! the main flaws were in how they were handled throughout the story, and how at times they could become a little tropey. Fukube is pretty interesting and could use more screen time; Oreki is an albeit, more nuanced, look at the standard apathetic male protag; Ibara is a textbook tsundere childhood friend; Chitanda fits neatly into the manic pixie dream girl archetype and takes a good while to develop outside that. I did enjoy seeing Fukube, Oreki and Ibara go about their respective hobbies and excel at them, and I wish Chitanda had had more of her personal interests and hobbies depicted outside of just sort of.. Being Oreki's motivation.\\n\\n\r\nIt's implied and stated throughout that's she's pretty book-smart but lacking in the life-smarts department, but the focus is largely on the cutesy-ditzy aspect of her which sort of makes her stand out a little less as a character for me. And her more serious moments exploring her devotion to her family nearer the end are fascinating and I'd have loved for more of the series to touch on that!\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nEck, sorry Hyouka fans. This just didn't do it for me.. I think if I had picked out the specific episodes to watch that were suggested to me and ignored the others, I would've enjoyed it a lot more. As it is, this series took me literal years to finish because of how generic the fillers felt.. This section is always so so subjective though, so don't take this as an absolute 'I do not recommend this anime'\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhile the visuals and the sound were stunning, Hyouka's stories and characters left me wanting more, in a bad way. The pacing really killed it for me. I think perhaps I'd feel differently towards this in movie format with some of the filler cut out, as I really enjoyed Garden of Words which is also beautiful but slow!",

            "content": "'This anime finds it's strength in quirky but somewhat realistic, and alluring characters. The almost surreal-like talent the protagonist, Oreki, has for solving mysteries keeps the anime interesting and engaging. You might find yourself admiring or even envying his abilities. Many of the characters are very well developed with particularities and purposes that are real but slightly exaggerated. All characters in the anime experience emotions ranging from curiosity, guilt, remorse, jealousy, and repressed resentment. There are lots of characters that re-evaluate their own motives, purposes and actions. For instance, Oreki's best friend, Satoshi, is a very well developed and interesting character who has great innerwisdom and understanding of himself and those around him. But, although he seems mature for his age he has his weaknesses that allow for interesting dynamics between himself and  Oreki. Much of the dialogue in Hyouka focuses on the agendas of the different characters and the interplay between these agendas pertaining to the mystery, or problem, to be solved.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka may be to some, a slice of life anime with sprinkles of classic mystery motifs, and it might be to others a mystery in a setting not too dissimilar to slice of life animes. For me, Hyouka is the former.' -DeeAd \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n+The visuals are spectacular yet simplistic, and the art style allows for development of unique character portrayals. \\n\\n\r\n-The sound and audio of Hyouka is decent. It's not overreaching or exemplary but it works. \\n\\n\r\n+ The character development is superb and realistic. Displaying real emotions and character motives. \\n\\n\r\n-The anime doesn't have a proper conclusion. It's got a few loose ends, and thus may not feel like a completed story.",

            "content": "Hyouka is an excellently redefined air for anime in the detective-mystery genre. With liquid-smooth animations (especially the in-between ones), eargasmic sounds, naturally flowing conversations and strong plot, this title could easily nail a spot in the line of best detective anime.\r\nART\r\nVery detailed. Even the backdrops share as much intiricacies as the characters do. You'd see sleek gradients, delicate textures and exhaustive light-shadow manipulation emanate from the background while still keeping the characters in emphasis. All in all, if I'll relate it to what I've seen before, the intricacy of background art is as great as that of Durarara! (on a side note, one of thecharacters resemble Ryuugamine Mikado).\\n\r\nFurthermore, the ambiance of every setting perfectly adapts to the mood of conversation. When it's gray, then it's perfectly gray. When it's \"rosy\" then it's very vibrant. More or less, the graphics itself do its share of the talking.\\n\r\nAside from that, Hyouka is one of the very few titles that actually know how to make 3D animations blend well with the 2D ones. In fact, their co-occurrence is almost indistinguishable. Now that is really something.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe background music is quite subtle. It's something that shouts the situation but rather gradually whisphers the developing mood of the conversation. Of course, that is just the right kind of BGM for mystery anime where music builds up synchronous with the developing plot.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the seiyuus are another thing to praise in terms of sounds because they deliver clear distinction of their character's voice from the multitude of cliches. This is especially harnessed by the good and smooth flowing dialogue, and distinct embodiment of the characters' persona.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nWhat I love the most in Hyouka is that there is always something that sets every character apart from the multitude of cliches. Well, the characters' distinctive trait is not something that I could just point out in their appearance but rather, it's something more sublime. Something that's equatable to \"charisma\". The characters have this special charisma that makes them shine in their own way of expressing things that other anime have inevitably failed to do so. \\n\\n\r\nDIALOGUE\\n\r\nThe scriptwriter is quite a smooth talker.\\n\r\nBizzare topics open up and develop in the most comprehensible and enjoyable pace. There may be some seiways but nevertheless, the conversation can put itself back on track very smoothly (and cleverly).\\n\r\nIn addition, unlike most SHAFT anime (I'm a SHAFT fanboy so don't feel offended for the following statement), Hyouka does not spill minutes of useless chatters. Very direct to the point of story.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nI'm not really a fan of the detective-mystery genre. However, Hyouka seemed to have really absorbed me into the uncharted waters of ala-private eye mysteries.\\n\r\nThe story kicks off with a very short introduction; not much character introduction nor prologues (but it's not a problem though because you'd still be able to see them develop through their conversations). Despite that, the story manages to create a firm starting point and develop effectively. Mysteries are unveiled one by one and is given a good deal of premises that will really stimulate curiosity. Nevertheless, the best part is that all the mysteries I've seen so far are plausible (yes, plausible because some others detective anime are just far-fatched) and very thouroughly explained. That leaves every mystery completely and satisfyingly resolved.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is definitely one of the highest quality productions for spring 2012. And perhaps, this might be the title that will put me back into believing in Kyoto Animation's helms after quite a boring year of hellish moe.\\n\r\nHyouka nailed it.\\n",

I myself LOVE slice of life. I have enjoyed it thus far, and I have high expectations of it.\r\nIf you enjoyed The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya you would most likely enjoy this, it has a similar sense of mystery and a lot less humour.\r\nStory: 7\r\nArt: 10\r\nSound: 7\r\nCharacter: 6\r\nEnjoyment 9\r\nOverall: 9\r\nStory: I'm not a very plottish person, I don't enjoy plots as most people do, I'm not sure whether I'm hard to impressor whether it just doesn't bother me with my enjoyment. The plot of this anime is not exactly cliche. It's a slice of life, and I like that aspect of it.\\n\r\nAs it's the 3rd episode, the plot has yet to begin. The hints of the plot aren't exactly interesting me a whole lot, but I assume I'll get into it the more I watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I am very appreciative of art in all anime, and I am a HUGE fan of the art style used in K-on and I am sosososoos happy that it's been implimented/used whatever... here. I love the style I love how it's animated. I couldn't ask for anything better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I do find myself enjoying the music a lot, though it's sometimes quite cliche/over used music? It's not fantastic, nor is it terrible. It's kind of overused in the anime itself, and you don't really notice it that much. \\n\r\nThe opening and ending credits are mediocre, but compared to Shirokuma Cafe's opening, I know I'll grow to like it a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Some what cliche.They aren't terrible, but I can't tell whether I like them or not, so far some of them annoy me a little, but I am very sure I'm going to grow to love them - and become obsessed. \\n\r\nThe main male character is a lil Sherlock Holmesy, but without the eccentricness. A toned down male version of Raven. It's okay, however some of the characteristics of the character annoys me, very slightly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Though my ratings seem low, it doesn't effect my enjoyment of the anime. So far I really do love it and anticipate the next episode coming out.\\n\\n\r\nI am sure I will grow to like the story and characters. I would highly reccomend this anime.",

Harem after harem, Then there's this Hyouka a Mystery slice of life. Though solving themystery is only the second most enjoyable thing about this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyable thing about this show is the development of our main characters. \\n\r\nOreki Houtaro a first year in highschool an energy saving student but not the type you might think but rather the motto written above. Don't do anything I don't have to, Do whatever I have to do quickly. A student not looking forward to the joys of a \"rose\" coloured highschool life and rather wants to have a plain \"grey\" one. \\n\\n\r\nThough everything starts to change when he meets Chitanda Eru, The girl who is curious. \\n\r\nThe girl that would ruin Oreki of his plain grey life causing him to use energy in his day to day life.\\n\\n\r\nThe way these characters develop during the season is so well done and is so believable they come to life to the viewers. The reason behind their actions, The way their personality changes. Honestly it's a work of art. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is similar to K-ON, Chuuniyoubi and Beyond the Boundaries all of which are Kyoto Animation works. Though not from the same group of artists a easily recognisable style and quality standard. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is well done, The voices fit their characters (Japanese Dub). Sound effects are up to standard as well, nothing to complain about. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery, personally it was fun to pause and think about my own theories about what happened. Try to find the little hints hidden during the episode.\\n\r\nThe character development, though I'm repeating myself at this point is so well done. The way we learn about the characters and their personality is no cliche anime personality here. \\n\\n\r\n==========================================================\\n\\n\r\nI hope found this review helpful. \\n\r\nOtherwise please feel free to send me a message as to why it wasnt. \\n\r\nAlways looking for ways of improving the way I write my reviews. \\n\\n\r\n==========================================================\\n\\n\r\nLittle extra thought*\\n\r\nOur very plain looking main character would do really well as a SMT Persona main character. Especially when he's paired up with his energetic best friend. \\n\r\nIf we could nominate characters to be a main character. He would definitely fit the role well.",

            "content": "When my friend asked me what genre Hyouka was, it was a bit difficult to answer at first. I ended up telling him it was mystery, but it really is so much more than that. Hyouka is a story about how four friends who, upon entering high school, join the Classics Club and undergo a series of adventures together. During this time, Houtarou and Satoshi will begin to question their own natures, of which they were so confident beforehand.\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nIn essence, Hyouka is a romance veiled by its mystery element. The puzzles that the Classics Club must solve follow a Sherlockian format; all of theclues necessary to solve them are presented before giving the solution. I found these mysteries to be very engaging, and often contained very clever twists. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance element is unlike most; this is not a cheesy story that has the boy/girl swooning all over the place. Instead, Hyouka takes a different approach; there is a certain degree of doubt and fear on top of their feelings that makes the characters so much more human, and caused me (at least) to empathize much more with their drama.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nThe animation is very good quality, and it's obvious a lot of effort went into its production. Hyouka also has it's own unique style whenever Hotarou begins to solve his mysteries. It's not always 100% photogenic, but it was certainly a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the anime well, but it's not the most outstanding I've heard. I adored the first opening song, although I didn't care as much for the other openings/closings. By no means does the music detract from the series though; it's simply no masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nHyouka does something that I'd like to see every single story (let alone anime) do: dynamic, believable characters. As mentioned before, Houtarou and Satoshi were initially quite confident about their own identities, but the events of Hyouka changed them in a way that was subtle enough to not be glaringly obvious, yet just enough to make you believe in their thoughts and actions as though they were human. \\n\\n\r\nIbara and Chitanda were also good characters for different reasons, particularly Chitanda. Since Hyouka is told from Houtarou's perspective, it's not always clear how Chitanda thinks or feels, and Houtarou is often left guessing in this respect. Chitanda unintentionally teases him in such a way that leaves him in doubt of their relationship, and leaves me (personally) shipping the hell out of them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nHyouka's mysteries kept me constantly engaged in the story, whether blowing me away with the ending revelation or smugly satisfied by solving them (albeit only the easy ones). The love developments between the four friends also left me choking up a bit, and I definitely empathized with all of them. I actually ended up rewatching the series a few times, each time noticing the importance of once scene or clue in a mystery and picking up increasingly more cues that lead up to the character's drama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): \\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to literally anyone. I personally enjoyed every bit of this series, and the only thing preventing me from giving it a perfect score is knowing that everyone might not enjoy it's open conclusion. Without giving spoilers, I will say that it's thematically perfect, but for some others it was unsatisfying. Don't let this dissuade you though, Hyouka is a brilliant series that deserves anyone's attention.",

            "content": "This will be my first anime review since 2010. Back then I was still new to anime and reviews, so my reviews were very simple and not very good. I hope to improve them now that I've been watching anime for a few years. This is still my first one since 2010, so I apologize if it isn't very good. Without further ado here is my review of the anime Hyouka.\r\nI can best describe Hyouka as a mystery anime that's usually episodic and involves Oreki (the main character) solving some mystery because Chitanda is curious and when she gets right in Oreki's face and staresat him with her big eyes and uses her catchphrase watashi kininarimasu (I'm curious) how can he say no? The anime revolves around the members of the Classic Literature Club who deal with their daily school lives and get presented with mysteries for Oreki to solve. This anime is sort of a mix between a slice of life, but it becomes more than that when a mystery is added to the episode for Oreki to solve. Although often hesitant to do anything Chitanda eventually convinces him to help. Oreki even though he won't admit it is a very smart person and is able to solve mysteries that an average person would have difficulty solving. The mysteries vary and usually last only one episode, but there are some mini arcs that last a few episodes. Personally I preferred the one episode mysteries. Some of the mysteries that lasted a few episodes would get confusing for me and I couldn't follow what was going on. The one episode mysteries were simpler, but still good. Hyouka sort of reminded me of Detective Conan, but the plots were a little different from those of Detective Conan. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is basically a slice of life anime with mystery added to it to make it more interesting. Each episode involves a mystery that Oreki has to solve. That's about it when it comes to the story. \\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nHyouka had a great soundtrack, but my favorite song would have to be the first OP song Yasashisa no Riyuu by Choucho. It's become one of my favorite anime songs this season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOreki has become probably my favorite anime character this season because he reminds me so much of myself. He has no interest in socializing and is often bored with life and just tries to make each day go by as fast and simple as possible. I swear if it wasn't for the few friends that he has and his school life I can picture him being a hikikomori. The thing that makes him so interesting is his insane talent at solving problems and mysteries. With skills like that he would make the perfect detective. Then you have Chitanda who is always curious about things and luckily for her she has Oreki the genius at solving mysteries. Then you have their two other friends Satoshi and Mayaka. They all get a long great even if Oreki seems annoyed by them sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a great anime if you're a fan of mystery. I admit I was bored with it during some episodes, but the mysteries are so well thought out that it keeps you interested. If you're a fan of mystery animes you'll probably like this anime. If not it's probably not for you then. If you like animes like Detective Conan, or UN-GO you'll probably like Hyouka.",

            "content": "Hello, and welcome to my first review :)\r\nWhat on earth is worth living to your utmost ability? Hell if I know. That is the way Oreki Houtarou views the world and how he lives. He doesn't see much value in expending energy which could otherwise be used more wisely, like studying or reading or sleeping. He is extremely lazy. Is there anything wrong with living a \"colorless\" life? No. Some may not believe me but it is actually way better than having a \"colorful\" life, that is, if you don't have anyone to share your colors with. Well, Hyouka is nothing more than a happyslice of life in which Oreki Houtarou slowly forms bonds with those in the Classics Club. \\n\\n\r\nI am not going to explain what is already said in the synopsis so on with the review.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, first, let me start with the good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is great, I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. The sound is decent as well. At certain points the background music would kinda throw me off, but I got used to hearing it and even kinda liked it. My favorite song is the first OP, it feels very slice of life and has an uplifting tune. The second OP wasn't as good as the first one but it was still okay. The EDs were both okay, the animation in them were both kind of interesting at first but I did end up skipping them after first couple times I heard them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are outstanding and their development throughout the series is done very well. As someone who highly enjoys character development I was really able to enjoy this anime \"Hyouka\" or \"I Scream\" aha. It is simply phenomenal,  the way the characters grow out of their shell, each character gets their own screen time, but the character that developed the most was Oreki Houtarou who starts out as a lazy minimalist who's only wish is to have a \"Colorless\" life. And to be honest, I got the most enjoyment out of his mannerisms and his development.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, this is a mystery type anime, the mysteries themselves aren't very interesting. They aren't the main point of the anime, they just serve to satisfy Eru Chitanda's curiosity who drags the MC Houtarou in, practically forcing him to solve them for her. I found this very enjoyable and you mainly learn about the characters through these mediocre mysteries (there are a couple of the mysteries I found very interesting though). The reactions whenever Houtarou solves an extremely simple case are sometimes very dramatic and this could be distasteful for some viewers. I hardly consider this a deal breaker, though, what matters to me most is the character development.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe most important aspect of this anime is the characters, not the story. This anime mainly rolls on character development and I personally believe that what makes up a good story is not the story itself, it is the characters. And in that sense this anime passes with flying colors!\\n\\n\r\nHope you found this review helpful and, hopefully, if you could submit feedback, whether you found it helpful or not, that would be greatly appreciated especially since this is my first review.",

            "content": "The story is a simple mystery around the school leaving the thrill out of equation. Yes, it is a quite unique blend of mystery infused in a slice of high school life anime. Unlike any other detective series (say, Detective Conan or Kindaichi) this one doesn't involve murder cases and stuff but the simple mystery than happen around the character at school, most of those stuff that normally got overlooked by most people got brought up into a series of hypothesis and prejudice....simply a by sentence \"KI NI NARIMASU!\" \r\nA sentence that have our lazy main character into fulfilling the princess of the series's curiosityover small unimportant things but turns out really interesting when we go through together with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI am simply can't say how many times I literally scratch my head and thinking how logical and fun was him making hypothesis. \\n\\n\r\nI will honestly say that the first two episodes was not standout quite enough among tons of other anime with slice of life genre. I thought was \"Ah this one gonna just another love story slice of high school life just like any other anime\". But in the end I was so WRONG, I tried to be patient with it and I can say it was worth it! Tho it was start slow, but it was keep peeking up until the last episode, as friendship grow slightly stronger.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a sweet series in term of romance. Tho the ending wasn't the want that I wanted but hey...at least he is almost at it. And we can understand that sometime leaving love hanging is a good way to end a series (lol) (I really wish Houtarou did asked 'that' question before the ending of the series, and I really want to know how Chitanda react to that, at least eventho he is not officially in relationship at that moment, we know that the feelings convey) Note: I hope that one is not a spoiler. My bad!\\n\\n\r\nArt is so lovely, it is outstanding right from the beginning. Colouring, character design, environment. All of it!\\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess thats it for me. The only thing I hope for another audience with a hunger of a good anime is to watch this, and if you feel unmotivated to continue during the first few episodes, please be patient with it. It really is worth it. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you have that same kind of curiosity like Chitanda Eru.\\n\\n\r\nAnd maybe I got enchanted also when she says 'Kin ni narimasu!\" that's why I keep on going with the series. Note: I did give up after 2 episodes and turn to another anime for awhile before I give another try to finish the series.\\n\r\n*mould and tide by her hair righaway lol\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u83d3 \u83d3; Hyouka.\r\nLiterally, the meaning of the kanji that compose the title anime means \u201cfruit ice\u201d (\u6c37 = koori, ice; \u83d3 = kudamono, fruit). But, the general meaning is \u201cice cream\u201d.\r\nActually, the words above have non-sense with the storyline of this anime. One thing is for sure, I think this anime is one of my favorite anime with a literary theme.\r\n\u201cWatashi, ki ni narimasu!\u201d (Meaning \u201cI am curious\u201d)\r\nThe catchphrase is likely to be seen in almost every episode, and is always saying by Chitanda with sparkling eyes and a deliberate face to Houtarou. Maybe some of you will be annoyed, but if I honestly reallylike it. If you see a glimpse of the genre, maybe some people think \u201cSlice of Life again, romance again\u201d. But you\u2019re wrong. The element of romance and slice of lifes it is practically very little and maybe 75% just focus on mystery. In this anime, there also some reference novels such as Agatha Christie (Murder On The Orient Express) and Conan Arthur Doyle (Sherlock Holmes).\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is very deserved thumbs up even two thumbs up because the studio that makes this anime Kyoto Animation. Frame rate is very smooth and the frame take second by second. The coloring and quality may be practically equivalent to an anime movie. An abstract animation is in use when Oreki thinks it\u2019s great.\\n\\n\r\nOreki Houtarou can change from a lazy person to a lot better, because often under the same problem with Chitanda. I have to admit Chitanda is so great in terms of \u201cmocking\u201d Oreki. The \u201cI don\u2019t do it quickly. if I have to, I\u2019ll do it quickly\u201d principle that Houtarou holds can crumble instant if you\u2019ve been dealing with \u201cI\u2019m curious\u201d. In addition, Chitanda is able to change Houtarou in an instant without having to bother arguments. For example in arc \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she ask EBA?\u201d (Episode 8-11), Chitanda can change Houtarou\u2019s way of thinking until the incarnate detective produces a different deduction, just because he feels in his heart that \u201cthere is still something strange\u201d. Simple thing? But creatively processed the same story maker. As these things continue, it can be seen that there is a sense of love between the two (who knows who likes first, but I think Houtarou used to be), and the more the shame looks as he goes to the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nFor most people the story may be very slow and boring. I must admit, it is quite slow. But I don\u2019t have a problem with it because the plot should also consider it\u2019s match with it\u2019s genre. For the Slice of Life like Hyouka, slow-paced is perfect. Coupled with a good development, then be a very good storyline.\\n\\n\r\nDo you guys always seen a detective anime with extraordinary analyzes accompanied by a very fascinating and realistic musical background almost impossible in the real world? Not for Hyouka. As a central figure and a fake detective, Houtarou\u2019s analysis capabilities are truly reality-based analysis. Realistic data that is perfect processed by himself, then disclosed in a language that makes sense and not complicated.\\n\\n\r\nBGM, the placement and type of music used in a certain scene is quite beautiful and very suitable with the atmosphere because the song is play by Johann Sebastian Bach. Her first opening theme, Yasashisa no Riyuu performed by ChouCho, is perfect and I often hear for music like this. Ending theme both, Kimi ni Matsuwanu Mystery.\\n\\n\r\nSatomi Satou, the voice actress who cast Chitanda\u2019s voice is worth the thumbs up. Why? Because his voice is very different than when he cast the voice of Tainaka Ritsu in the anime series K-ON!. Although both are very different, I still appreciate this two anime.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is a very good anime in my opinion because Chitanda Eru is amazing both her nature and her seiyuu, Oreki Houtarou which make me amazed by it\u2019s deduction, blend of development and the rate of excellent story, super animation, and the music Charming. Highly recommended for those who like anime slice of life that is relaxed, unfamiliar, plus a bit of non-criminal mild mystery spice.",

At times it had me wondering exactly what I was watching, as the main characters would go from hearing an announcement on the intercoms in their club room, to a full blown detective case about assuming who stole that money or killed that person.\r\nBut letstake a step back. Hyouka tries to be a good mystery anime at times, and fails horribly as a whole. I felt at times that the mystery aspect just got, well, boring. I wasn't connected at all with what was going on, and was only waiting for the next episode to see if maybe it would have gotten better. Now to be honest, Hyouka does get better, but it takes an absurdly long time to see any real development with the characters and story. But if you're willing to put in the time to watch through it, the slice of life aspect really digs it's way through pretty nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the main point in the show. However, I felt as though Oreki was too 'cliched' at times. He starts out as this monotone guy who absolutely hates wasting his time with anything or anyone. But when you have an annoying girl shove herself in your face, you simply cannot ignore it. Basically, I feel like the pacing of Oreki himself was very disjointed, he wanted to keep by his motive of being an \"energy conservative person\" but meanwhile he'll be cracking codes to the pentagon on his lunch break. As for Chitanda, she was something. At first she seemed like a really basic, cliched character with no dynamics, but over time I totally saw different sides of her that really changed the mood of this show. And no, she wasn't annoying aside from the fact that she could get annoying if you hate waiting for good development. The other two characters have a lot to say about them too, but I'll let you decide what to think.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly love it when anime uses classical music scores to express a scene better, it just makes the anime feel so much more alive in my opinion. But the art in this anime was amazing. From the very beginning, I fell in love with how fluid and smooth it was. The animation and art style alone is outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nNow would I recommend this anime? Sure. But you have to be committed to watch the whole thing, or it's not even really worth your time. This anime has some problems with the pacing and the *ahem* lackluster story at times, but as we build closer to the end, the slice of life aspect, along with the mystery aspect meld together greatly. I would recommend this anime only if you have time, and patience! It's a good one!",

            "content": "\"Watashi kininarimasu!\" - Chitanda Eru\r\nIt's probably a sentence that you've read in other reviews, but it's just one of the characteristics of the story.\r\nFirst off, this anime is just awesome. It really is amazing and deserves to be highly rated.\r\nI haven't read the manga, a lot of people say to also look at the manga but since that one isn't translated fully yet, I decided to make review for the anime.\r\nStory:\r\nI'll start with saying that this a character-based anime (which means that the anime is dependent of the characters). The story is very simpel, but since it's character-based it's very enjoyable. To put it downto the essential things, it's about a boy who's school-life looks grey, but takes a sudden turn. However, I gave this a 9 and not a 10 since I think that the story is still a little underdeveloped at the end (BUT that's something you'll see for yourself!)\\n\r\nPS: For those who heard there was romance in this anime, please read the genres again! The romance is really limited, though very fitting)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is truly amazing! It's very detailed, the shadowing is very well done and I couldn't find any flaws. The art fits with the surroundings and the characters are very enjoyable to just look at! The background is just as detailed as the foreground, which didn't make it irritating to watch! I gave this a 9 since I would've liked to see a little more variety in the scenery here and there!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs for the sound, it's not something I often listen to BUT! the OP and the ED were enjoyable and I let them play to their extent every now and then. Also what I think is important to mention when talking about the sound is the voices of the characters. The voices suited the characters very well. The main characters have nice voices which doesn't make it irritating to listen to. The background sounds are also befitting the scenery very nice, so yeah! No complaints there either! I gave this a 10 since it's, to my opinion, flawless!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAs I said, the anime is character-based so the characters are a very fatal subject. It was funny to see how the characters could differ so much, but fit so well together! The characters were very enjoyable throughout the whole anime and didn't irritate me even one bit! There was a lot of character development in my opinion, for such a short anime! (Most of you will be like '22 episodes isn't short! But hey... It kinda feels like it when you watch this)\\n\r\nI gave this a 10, because the characters were just too amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThere's nothing more to say here except: It's a very enjoyable anime and you should definitely watch it! The producers did a very good job and the writer wrote a truly amazing story! (Again if you want to watch this for the romance, just watch this for the romance!)\\n\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful to you! If it was please click on the 'helpful' button down here to show me it was helpful!\\n\r\nI also hope this wasn't too long to read and I hope I will be seeing you in the future! Nyaa~!",

            "content": "I usually get involved with series when i like the music, and even when the big part of it is not original, it still fits perfectly. You can read a synopsis and think \"this is just another school's day anime\", and even when that's true, it is not. \r\nWhy is true? Because it's the story of four young japanese with big colorful eyes, the clubs, the festival, and every etcetera you want to add. But it is also your own story. I think is the development of the characters during the serie what makes Hyouka what it is. The lazy but ridiculously smart guy whosuddenly finds himself involved in the personal issues of a whimsical girl just because she saw him. Never happened to you? I don't think so. \\n\\n\r\nDo you ever find yourself saying yes to anything just because he/she looks at you? Even when you don't need or have to? \\n\r\nHave you ever feel so frustrated because no matter how hard you try you know deeply that you will never be as good as someone? \\n\r\nHow many of us used to sit on our chairs and think \"who am i?\", back in highschool? Or maybe now, too. \\n\r\nIs there any thing that you know you can do better than anyone? What or who makes you realize that? \\n\r\nDo you think that you are here on earth to fulfill your dreams or someone elses? \\n\r\nAre you ready to jump in the vast ocean of knowledge? Or do you just want to smell the surface? \\n\\n\r\nThis was Hyouka for me; a bunch of questions i needed to ask to myself. \\n\r\nAs i said, the character's development is what makes Hyouka what it is. \\n\\n\r\nIn some point of your life you were talking with someone and, in order to explain some feeling or sensation, did you feel the need of puting a song or draw something? Have you ever run out of words? Well, Hyouka gives you what you need. An Oscar to KyoAni for getting that realistic atmosphere.",

            "content": "If I could describe Hyouka in one word, it would be understated. Hyouka is the definition of understated, from the characters (average Japanese high schoolers) to the plot (slice of life/light mystery, anyone?). Heck, even the romance, which a lot of times anime likes to hit us on the head with, is slow to develop. Yet, for all its subtleties--or maybe because of them--Hyouka manages to be an entertaining and profound show that exceeds all my expectations.\r\nThe premise for Hyouka is simple. The protagonist Houtaru Oreki has only one major philosophy that he abides by: energy conservation. More specifically, his mantra is: \"I don't doanything I don't have to. What I have to do, I do quickly.\" Yeah, we got a winner right here. Per his elder sister\u2019s request, he joins the dying Classics Club. There, he and three other students solve the everyday mysteries that plague them. It\u2019s interesting to note that solving mysteries is not the main function of Hyouka. The cases serve as a plot structure, or a device to reveal the characters personalities and bring them closer together.\\n\\n\r\nI chose to watch Hyouka because of Froggy kun's blog post discussing his connection with certain anime characters. Thus, with characterization in mind, I began Hyouka with tepid interest. At first, the main cast of characters all fit the stereotypical anime tropes. Oreki was the boring, aloof protagonist. Satoshi, the joking sidekick. Chitanda was the naive and kind heroine. And Mayaka\u2026 was just there. However, the characters really started to grow on me. After several mystery cases, you begin to see the character dynamic and what each person brings to the case. Although Hotaru often steals the spotlight in managing to solve the mystery, the rest of the cast reflects the viewer\u2019s thought processes and reactions.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that really stood out to me in the very beginning was the animation. Holy cow, it\u2019s freaking gorgeous. Judging from other reviews, this is to be expected considering that it was produced by Kyoto Animation, the powerhouse of beautiful animation. If I hadn\u2019t previously watched another anime by KyoAni, Clannad, this show would\u2019ve stolen the cake for best animation that I\u2019ve seen. The animation has a great attention to detail. We see minute changes in facial expressions, adding to the characterization of the cast. The art basically tells a story of its own.\\n\\n\r\nI think it was during the culture festival arc that I really saw the potential in this series through its characters. Hyouka follows each character\u2019s interaction with one another in such a natural, human way. Some of the animes or even TV shows I\u2019ve seen have had bombastic situations that either change the characters in a life-altering way or not at all. However, in Hyouka the characters develop little by little, episode by episode, in a way that doesn\u2019t make an obvious show about it. At the end of the show, by the way he goes out of his way to understand his best friend, Satoshi, or even his coming to terms with his feelings for Chitanda is proof of Oreki growing up.  Rather than waving his arms and making claims of \u201cHey, see how much I\u2019ve changed!!\u201d (as some anime does), his actions display Oreki\u2019s growth. And that, I think, speaks volumes for the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, there are no flashy robots, killer notebooks, or body length swords. The show is essentially about teenagers growing up. However, the simple premise, the characters, the themes, the animation is so well executed that I can\u2019t help but put Hyouka on my favorites list. And I suspect that it\u2019ll be there for a very long time.\\n\\n",

The fact that they solved little or big mysteries without involving something serious was amazing. When an episode ended I would I always just sit there and try to figure it out myself. I also liked how you would figure out what was going to happen or who the culprit was mid episode sometimes. It did get repetitive at some points. Alot of talking and solving. Definitely something I would not recommend to someone if they hated thatstuff. Add a little more romance here and there and this anime would have been perfect. If you like a good mystery this anime would be great for you.",

            "content": "Well, I guess I'm about to write an essay, but for an anime that hit my taste nearly perfectly, it's worth it. \r\nCharachters:\r\nWhen you first get into this series, you get introduced into an kind of unsympathic main character. Houtarou Oreki is a typical lazy student who seems quite pathetic in the beginning. During the series you slowly see him evolving into somebody completely different due to his friend (if you can call her that), Eru Chitanda. She is his obvious opposite: She is a happy, optimistic and most importantly curious person. The character development is pretty good. There is a small romance between topairs of main characters as well : Oreki and Chitanda and their friends, Satoshi and Mayaka. I'm not going to get too deep into their character development, but it shows some relevance in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThis area of Hyouka can be summed up in 3 words: pretty freakin great. I didn't want to fix myself on this aspect, but during my run I realized, that these 2 things were pretty amazing. The Art Design and the Animation is very detailed and in my view quite beautiful. The Soundtrack underlines the atmosphere very well, but it could've been done better.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nYou could say, that this is one of the weaker aspects of this anime. It's PG-13 what basically tells, that there are NO REAL MURDERS OR SERIOUS CRIMES. For me at least, it was a huge bummer and a waste of potential. I don't intend to say that what the writers did here is bad or anything. But this series could've been much better with actual crimes. As said, the story, as it is, is ok and quite entertaining as well. I also gotta say, that Hyouka had the best School Festival Arc I've seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nHyouka has its flaws, but I cannot deny that I enjoyed the heck out of it. My attention was fixed on Shounen and other anime genres for most of the time, so this Mystery type anime is quite fresh to me. The astethics blew me away and its overall presentation is pretty well done. Charachter development is pretty good.My only problem is the lack of actual crimes which could've lifted it up to one of my favs. In the end I can only say that I hope for an improved 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "Seeing as how this is my first review, I'd like to welcome feedback from anyone who would want to give some. \r\nHyouka is somewhat unique story that follows Houtarou Oreki throughout his very average day-to-day life. He's a simple guy who more than anything hates to waste energy if it's not absolutely necessary. If this is so, then what makes this story interesting? You could say the answer to that question would be a bit of curiosity. No, not the curiosity of the main character himself, but instead, that of the others around him. In particular, the leading lady of this story, Eru Chitanda. Herconsistent thirst for discovering the unknown leads her to \"motivate\" Houtarou into solving all of the mysteries surrounding the main characters no matter how insignificant they may be. Sometimes it's difficult to escape a gaze so alluring, so magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nThe content is presented in a very meticulous manner, as would be expected of a mystery series. However, this is not your conventional mystery series. Hyouka is structured in a way that the author attempts to keep viewers guessing until the very end, but with most of the smaller mysteries, this is not the case. Instead, viewers can easily follow the logic as the characters begin to put together the pieces and come to the correct conclusion almost before the characters themselves. Some have argued that the series is boring because these less significant mysteries are trivial and simple. However, I believe that these mysteries are some of the more interesting aspects of the series because they allow for the characters (and overall themes of the series) to develop. It's a formula used throughout the series. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitely worth a taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe animators and writers deserve even more praise for the characters that they've created. Each is unique in their own way and their personal stories unfold at an appropriate pace as the series progresses. Their personalities complement each other as they all play their own role in the group. One thing this series does well is to keep you guessing about what the main characters' fates will be until the finale. The plot, as previously mentioned, moves at a somewhat slow pace (mirroring the personality of the main character) but each episode's time is used wisely to build the mysteries, the theories behind these mysteries, and most importantly the anticipation felt by the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is well-done and used accordingly with each given scenario. It's exactly the type of score you would expect to hear in an anime that presents itself as a mystery series. The music is very reminiscent of what you would hear in a James Bond movie as Agent Bond is cracking the all-important code and gets down to the bottom of everything. Some of the tracks however are very plain sounding and only detract from the mood that the producers are attempting to set. Finally, I'd like to discuss the amazing art work of this series. As expected of Kyoto Animation, Hyouka is a visual masterpiece which spares no expense when the matter in discussion happens to be the art. It's definitely one of the high points of this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would brand Hyouka as a somewhat unconventional mystery series that incorporates hint of romance and comedy into a uniquely presented plot. While Hyouka might turn away viewers in fear that it's nothing more than a mediocre mystery series, I still would recommend it to all viewers who are looking for something new. In specific a story that focuses less on mysteries of moment and more so on the mysteries surrounding the characters themselves. Hyouka wasn't exactly what I expected it to be by the time I finished the series and that's the main reason why I'd like to recommend this anime to all viewers. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "Hyouka is another in a long line of Kyoto Animation shows that is impeccably animated, and reflects a certain storytelling sensibility that I always have to adjust to. It's a slice of series wherein nothing much happens. There's a school club that meets after school everyday and we spend time hanging out and getting to know them. \r\nBut what sets Hyouka apart is the mystery aspect. You see, what the club actually spends most of its time doing is solving a series of painfully banal and strange little mysteries that pop up around them. Some of the mysteries stretch several episodes, but some are justone-offs. There are long stretches of the show where you sit at the table and listen to their theories about the mystery (this is livened up by incredibly beautiful cutaways to an \"imagined\" space that's more interesting than their club room). \\n\\n\r\nThe longer arcs on the show also lead to pretty nuanced character development (think about Oreki's development during the student film arc, or about Fukube's doubts about himself in the school festival arc). The stories themselves are banal, almost matter of fact, but even though nothing too out of the ordinary, nothing fantastic, ever happens, Hyouka retains a mysterious, elusive quality. I would love to dismiss it as \"nothing happens\" nonsense (and sometimes I felt that way), but it stuck in my mind too much. Something wouldn't let met get away. You can't escape, as it were.\\n\\n\r\nSo although I've sort of complained about the fact that the mysteries and situations of Hyouka are banal to the point of you sort of asking \"what is the point of this? why would anyone exert any intellect on trying to figure this dumb crap out?\" I cannot dismiss it. And here's where I lay out why I think this show is mysterious and elusive and actually kind of special: it's a series that is filled with possibility. Not once during those 22 episodes did I have any idea what kind of show I was watching. It's a show I felt could go anywhere, do anything; that it wasn't tied down to a simple formula (although it may have been). Like Chitanda's character, it possessed an intellectual curiosity (though in Chitanda's case, it may have just been an instinctual one) which then got filtered through a deep knowledge of western mystery novels, slice of life tropes, moe checklists, beautifully detailed animation, etc. Hyouka is a series where the sensibility is key; the mixture of those elements couldl've turned out awful, but because they're done in this particular way (slow, thoughtful, relaxed), they become more than the sum of their parts.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it helps that it's aesthetically perfect; sequences made me tear up just in the way they were conceived and executed (a complete mastery of high school slice of life tropes, and just plain beauty). The final sequence of the final episodes is a master class: the pinks, the swell of the strings in the soundtrack, the precise editing and the knowledge and wisdom to leave us facing an uncertain future. The future's a mystery, too.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Just wanted to point out that the score has no meaning in my eyes. MAL forces you to input a certain score, so I just put in a 10. You may disregard the score. Now, to the review itself.\r\nHyouka is a show that managed to do what most anime simply can't, and the big selling point here is the subtlety. Yes, you might have heard quite a lot of things when it comes to Hyouka's slow pacing , and indeed, the fact that it's so slow paced can be a real bummer for many. The question is, can you appreciate what it has to offer?\r\nIdon't think everyone will enjoy Hyouka, but then again, it's the case with every anime out there. It puts characters over anything else, even the mysteries, and for a mystery show to do such a thing, that's quite a rarity.\\n\\n\r\nThe contrast between Hyouka and most other animes out there, let alone Kyoani's work, is staggering, to the point that I can't find anything else quite like it. It might be the fact that it has such a different approach to character development , and without most of the usual tropes in anime. The soundtrack fits the show really well, with an orchestral score combined with fun J-POP that found its way into my youtube playlist fairly quickly.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to animation, you just can't deny Hyouka's greatness. Say what you will about the slow story and mysteries, but the animation is of the highest caliber. It's also quite varied, as in many cases you'll find that the style changes when investigations take place. The soundtrack and animation are complimenting each other a lot, and I found myself amazed by how everything comes together in certain parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't come to realize how good this anime really is, until the second time I watched it. The first time I was too busy thinking about the mysteries themselves, but when I stopped caring too much about them, I found just how rich it is with subtle facial expressions and interactions that I simply never noticed before. I just fell in love with the characters and their unique personalities.\\n\\n\r\nAs you must have figured out by now, it's a masterpiece in my eyes, but it certainly wasn't love at first sight. It takes time to appreciate just what Kyoani managed to do here, but if you look hard enough, you might find what I found. If not, well, I wouldn't blame you. It tries something different, and for people well versed in anime it might be a little too mundane for their tastes.\\n\\n\r\n Be that as it may, I still recommend it to anyone who wants something a bit more genuine in their anime. Over the top is fun, but Hyouka gives off an aura of something much better. It's realistic, and its characters, with their own interesting life stories, are realistically portrayed throughout the whole show,  all while doing it with subtlety and grace that are so rare these days. You won't find here murder cases, or twists for the sake of adding fake suspense. All the cases make sense, and prove that you don't need murders and blood to create a convincing mystery anime. It trimphs as a mystery anime, but the truth is that the mysteries themselves are not the things that elevate it to greatness. In Hyouka, it's the little things that make it stand out. You just have to notice them.\\n\\n",

It's almost like he should be the Classic's Club's president instead. \r\nEru: 0/10\r\nEru is cute and all but she's a poor example of a club president. First off, she's always trying to have Hotaro solve all the cases. She keeps saying \"I'm curious\" without getting shit on her hands, relying on Hotaro all the time. \r\nSatoshi: 5/10\r\nSatoshi has a great sense ofhumor, but sometimes it gets a little too overboard. \\n\\n\r\nMayaka: 10/10\\n\r\nThe perfect example of a critic and friend, and the ONLY one who actually tries to be romantic herself. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 0/0 \\n\r\nI didn't really care for the music. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 0/0 \\n\r\nDidn't care. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nThe last episode was rather pathetic. Instead of Hotaro attending a party for nothing, why don't the writers have him solve a extremely hard mystery that even the police have considered a \"cold case.\" Oh wait. That'll make Hotaro OPed and it would lower his character rating I have for him to 0?! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIt was ok. The show involved solving mysterious that only a seinen mind can solve. But the fact that these mysterious only last for about an episode or two, really defeats the whole purpose of the show. I mean why not have all the previous mysterious connect into the final episode?\\n\\n\r\nBut I liked the show overall. I probably won't recommended you this show, but it is a good watch.",

Then, about a month later, I started seeing gifs of it (of Oreki), then I said: \"He seems like an interesting character, okay, why don't I give it a chance.\"; then I started watching it in June - fell in love with Oreki from the first episode.\r\nStory: There really isn't a story. After they solved the \"Hyouka\" case, they just solved the mysteries that happen around them. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every minute of it. I really like themystery aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Beautiful. That's the only word I have for it. The scenery, characters, everything. I also liked how stylish the characters were, also, if that's considered \"art.\"\\n\\n\r\nSound: Awesome. I loved both of the openings and endings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All of them were interesting in their own little way. Houtarou is my favorite character though; he's just so relatable and, lets not forget, handsome. Then there's Satoshi - I just love his personality, and he's cute. Mayaka; there isn't anything special about her in particular, but I didn't dislike her. Lets not forget the overbearing, annoyance - Chitanda. Lol, but seriously, in episodes 1 through 5, I think, I found her extremely annoying! But thankfully, she gradually began to ease up, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Looked forward to every episode. Really enjoyed watching how they went about solving the mysteries - it intrigued me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Anime is subjective. Just because I really liked it, doesn't mean you will.",

The enjoyment was ok, sometimes it suffered from repetition but that's a minor detail. No the real problem comes from the last episode. It doesn't bring closure at all, it's  open too open for interpretation, therefore you can't connect properly with the anime. Due to the anticlimactic endingand it's lack of closure i can only give this anime a 7/10 however and i say however it is most likely there will be a 2nd Season. And if there is a 2nd season i will boost the rank from 7 to 8 however there is no second season (yet). The main reason for this is that the first season does a great job of setting the stage but no closure at all.",

            "content": "Hyouka, which clocks in at 22 episodes plus an OVA, is quite simply the best-looking anime I\u2019ve watched, in terms of both animation and art direction.  Indeed, Kyoto Animation raised the TV animation bar so high with this series that it's currently in low-earth orbit.  Episodes are punctuated by moments of jaw-dropping beauty, and the series exhibits an unreal attention to detail with respect to its high school setting.  Hyouka also employs an impressive (and much-appreciated) variety of animation styles when depicting the inner monologue of main character Oreki, ranging from abstract black-and-white imagery to a bizarre scene involving live-action puppets.\r\nIn termsof anime set in high school, Hyouka is one of the most unique in terms of genre.  The show is an odd amalgamation of mystery and slice-of-life, with elements of romance and drama thrown in for good measure.  At its core though, Hyouka is a mystery show, showcasing the adventures of the Classic Literature Club over the course of three major mystery arcs and a smattering of single-episode, standalone mysteries.  While some of these one-shot mysteries are enjoyable, none of them are as interesting or well-thought-out as those in the major arcs.  As someone who finds most mystery scenarios to be either contrived or predictable (or both), I was impressed with how clever yet down-to-earth the mysteries in Hyouka turned out to be, nicely complementing the realism of the show\u2019s setting while also providing plenty of room for character growth.\\n\\n\r\nThe four main characters in Hyouka are all likeable and well-developed: in addition to the laid-back Oreki (whose primary philosophy in life is one of \u201cenergy conservation\u201d), there is the inquisitive Chitanda (who uses her \u201cI\u2019m curious\u201d catchphrase throughout the series to spur Oreki to action), the hyperactive Satoshi (the self-proclaimed \u201cdatabase\u201d of the group), and the sarcastic Mayaka (whose main role is to give Oreki a hard time for being such a lazy bum).  While there are some good side characters as well, the chemistry among the main characters is what makes each episode of Hyouka such a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOf special mention, the final major mystery arc in the series (the \u201cOrder of Kudryavka\u201d arc) is the most comprehensive and realistic depiction of a high school cultural festival I\u2019ve seen so far in anime.  The arc is particularly notable for brilliantly balancing screentime among the main characters, something the anime does quite well throughout its run.  However, while each character is dealing with their own issues\u2014Chitanda struggling to fulfill her role as president of the Classic Literature Club, Mayaka being bullied by her fellow members of the Manga Club, etc.\u2014 the show also makes sure that their experiences occasionally overlap; for example, when all four of them (even Oreki) rally together during the cooking competition.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I mostly enjoyed Hyouka\u2019s relaxed pacing, at times it moved at such a leisurely pace that it strayed dangerously close to \u201cboring\u201d territory.  On the other hand, the OST is fantastic, with the plethora of rich orchestral pieces perfectly matching the show\u2019s balancing act between whimsy and mystery.  The second OP has a sick baseline and some creative visuals, as well as a humorous stand-alone end sequence (it instantly reminded me of the beehive misadventures in The Pet Girl of Sakurasou\u2019s first OP).  Also, the second ED might be my favorite ED in any anime due to its high-energy presentation and its multiple (and adorable) references to Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n\r\nI do have complaints with the finale, however.  While some people love the finale, I found it severely unsatisfying, meandering to the finish line and providing no clear resolution for the characters.  It almost seems like Hyouka didn\u2019t know how to wrap itself up after the cultural festival, and as a result the show left quite a few loose ends unresolved.  There is no indication that KyoAni plans to make a Season 2 or follow-up film, so the mystery of where the main characters end up will unfortunately remain a \u201ccold case\u201d (sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist).  \\n\\n\r\nDespite my issues with the show's conclusion, I give Hyouka an 8/10 and a strong recommendation to check it out.  While the slow pacing might not be for everyone, most viewers should be able to find something to enjoy about the series.  I should also mention, however, that at the time of this review the show remains difficult to stream legally in the US, with none of the major legal streaming sites (Crunchyroll, Hulu, FUNimation) offering it in their catalogs.  Hopefully, one of these sites will rectify this oversight in the future, giving more Western viewers the chance to experience this beautiful show.",

            "content": "Sometimes when I\u2019m feeling sad or stressed, I like to sit down to a cutesy shoujo romance to lift my spirits. That was my intention when siting down to Hyouka.  Unfortunately, I found it difficult to get into this one.  The first half of the show is episodic and formulaic with very little variation. The characters are cute; but, it does very little to help a monotonous storyline. I like a good mystery story; but, something about this fell flat. \r\nHowever, I stuck around because something caught my attention.\r\nThere are little moments of surrealism in certain episodes where a character\u2019s thoughts and feelingsare visually represented in an interesting way.  For instance, the first time Houtarou is ensnared by his cute companion\u2019s curiosity, the audience gets a view of his perspective through an imaginative lens where he is literally ensnared by her hair and surrounded by flowers (there to represent her overwhelming cuteness). These moments come off as artistic and deliberate rather than just part of the cute fest.\\n\r\nBecause I allowed myself to continue to watch this anime despite my relative boredom, I managed to make it to the second half of Hyouka.  The second half managed to capture my attention as the story became more intricate and focused on character development.  The second half of this anime had everything that the first half lacked and more.  As it came to a close, I found myself saddened by how soon it ended. The story just started! I had just gotten to know these interesting characters and I wanted to know more about them!\\n\r\nOverall, I think this show had a lot of potential for an interesting plot but was sidetracked by its formulaic mini mysteries.  There isn't anything particularly terrible about it; but, I cannot whole heartedly recommend it unless you\u2019re really just looking for something kind of cute and without a ton of depth.",

            "content": "* It's so realistic i can tell you its in the top 5 most realistic School/SoL anime. It's a pretty strong show but also a gamble*\r\n*If I don't have to do it, i won't. If i have to do it, i will do it quick!*\r\nThat is the main quote of our MC and i gotta say, we all had that as our main moto when we were teenagers! \r\nTo begin the sounds. The sounds were very good. They were befitting its theme and inviting us in. Also notable is that it had many Classic pieces like \"Moonlight Sonata,The Air on G String\" which were mainlyused as a rip off since they didn't play any specific role. But that's not so bad.\\n\r\n This one has 2 openings and 2 endings with additional some wonderful but i would also call cliche OSTs. The OPs and EDs tho are just too well executed. Demonstrating our characters nature and situations they will face and also using great symbolism of how they interact and how they view the world. Brilliant work at both.\\n\r\nContinuing With the visual which were astonishing. Literally flawless. There wasn't something weird or bothersome (Except of the over Cute and extremely inviting KyoAni Style).The cloths were depicted perfectly and they were smooth. Another thing about the visual is how it presented some situation and mysteries by showing great depiction of reality via a series of pictures. I mean it explains 1 \"situation\" by pretty simple means and not in a way to mock the viewer but to simplify it. Their use was just well above an average show.\\n\r\nStory wise its as it states. We have our MC which literally is an unmotivated,low spirited,Teenager(appealing to the bone),with no attraction towards anything in life and high observation abilities and His company. As they go on into their lives they get to unravel some big and small mysteries. Tho the mysteries come out of normal everyday routine(but that's the whole shows meaning, that every mystery in our daily routine isn't caused without someone behind it). Also,they aren't always something big, but they are made in such a way to be interesting and exploiting some of the characters or used for their development. And its done great compared to other show before Hyouka.Also it handles great symbolism and realistic is on of its strongest elements. Also except Music rip off, the plot also mentions the 7 deadly sins and Tarot Cards at some point but its connection is extremely relevant to the plot and genuinely connected to the plot.(That just makes me think that the author actually put some effort on it and didn't wanna just rip off) This show knows how to work your brain while being all simple. Why? Because the possibilities are endless.It isn't playing fair since it doesn't give attention to any clue until that clue becomes relevant to the plot. But it does mention it as something unnecessary at the moment and as something that might never be of a use to us.\\n\r\nJust, Well played!\\n\r\nLast but not least, it messages are deep and realistic about how reality works and The most important part of the show is that its able to build some characters while making unbelievable realistic egos for them. So realistic that \"It could literally happen in an everyday school\" and also adding the fact of its magnificent presentation of things this is just divine.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------Personal opinion and weaknesses--------------------------------\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the overly cute and catering style of KyoAni might be this show greatest weakness. Although it can get pretty deep, its extremely hard to take it seriously. It's like running playing water fights in the summer and while running with your loaded weapon you will shout \"I WILL KILL YOU ALL\" but that's just terrific because you are just throwing water around... Secondly, from premise you already read about Chitanda and her bottomless \"Curiousness\". I will just say that you will either \"Love her\" or MOST LIKELY \"Despise her\". I can say pretty confident she is as annoying and useless as \"Sakura\" from Naruto. But to be honest as even Sakura has a big role to play , same goes to Chitanda,but also her  role is abusing and bothering our MC who actually don't wanna do anything with it. That's a bad interaction and unless there was a big \"Romantic feeling\" so it could explain why the MC do her biding  all that seems \"Highly unlikely\". But also many consider that fact minor. Also, as i said, it rip offs  Classic music which is something bad here cause it doesn't do it right imo. Also, it has some scenes when its just way too hard to add depth to a simple mystery which is just Pretentious. It has many reference but they are well placed and seems natural.\\n\r\nLast and also a great shortcome is the fact that it lacks attractiveness. The only thing keeping you from leaving its the affection you must create for the characters and a small curiosity about the future events. Those 2~3 reasons to continue watching the show are actually pretty small for me and there were times i almost dropped it out of boredom and disinterest. \\n\\n\r\nWell. In the end, Hyouka is one of those shows you will either love it or hate it. Just because of its nature. Either you will find it appealing and interesting or boring and unrealistic. For me it was the first one and it was a pretty good ride. But not sure if worth the time given, since there is literally only hints of romance and i can assure you if it had romance it would have been Top material.\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-Man, the marvelous and educative idea of explaining the viewers about the Narrative trick and actually using it! (that irony was in another level)\\n\r\n-Excellent presentation, flawless art and astonishing music and symbolism throughout the show.\\n\r\n-I see that the author did a good research about Seven Deadly Sins,Taro Cards and many other stuff.That hints about the effort the author actually put into its work because the usage of those elements wasn't only superficial.\\n\r\n-The whole shows meaning is lying deep beneath the surface!",

I like how the theory is explained carefully and how the they connect the clue.The characters are interesting as they have their own unique personality...There is also a bit of romance in the anime between the characters.The graphic is good and it is very nice when they actually uses graphic to explain the theories and not by just talking. This for sure one of the BEST anime i have watched. You should totally watch this if you are a fan of mystery....(p/s this is my first time writing reviews so please don't judge me...still newto this stuff but i really hope this will help)",

            "content": "Life can be pretty boring most of the time. So boring in fact, that we desperately want something odd. Something out of the ordinary. Something that really piques our curiosity and challenges what we know as possible. When we see some odd occurrence, our mind likes to run wild and paint a picture of what strange otherworldly force could be responsible. Unfortunately, the answer to these occurrences is usually as mundane as life itself. But, hey, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being curious like the humans we are, is there?\r\nLife can really wear you out and take a lot of your energy away. Some people mayrelax or do something similar to recharge that energy. Or maybe it\u2019s better not to spend it at all. Hotaro Oreki lives his life by those words. Rather than giving anything his all, like the true energy conservationist he is, Hotaro believes it\u2019s far better not to use energy in the first place. He believes it\u2019s best to go through life with the minimum amount of effort possible. A wrench is thrown into His plan when his sister, Tomoe, sends him a letter \u201csuggesting\u201d he should join his school\u2019s Classic Literature Club, as she once did. The club currently has no members, so Hotaro may be the club's only hope. Unable to resist his sister, Hotaro reluctantly signs up for the Classic Lit Club. Upon arriving in the club room, he is shocked to see Eru Chitanda, another student at his school. This is odd since the club room door was locked and Hotaro should have had the only key. Eru mentions that the door was unlocked when she walked in and that it should be impossible to lock or unlock the door without a key. Hotaro has always been very perceptive and has a knack for putting information together, but it\u2019s always too tiring for him. Eru asks Hotaro to help her solve the mystery of the door and satisfy her curiosity. Unable to resist Eru\u2019s gaze, he agrees to help and manages to solve the mystery. It turns out Eru was there because she also wanted to join the club. Hotaro resists but ultimately ends up joining as well. This old club went from 0 members to 2 just like that, but that 2 soon turns into 4 when Hotaro\u2019s friend, the always cheerful, Satoshi Fukube, along with the steadfast, Mayaka Iraba visit the club and end up joining too. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, as this is a mystery anime the plot unfolds with many mysteries along the way. These mysteries are usually pretty interesting, most taking 1 episode, some taking more, and it\u2019s fun to play detective alongside the characters like any mystery plot. These mysteries usually border the line between being real and being supernatural. Hyouka likes to show you that little mysteries, such as a mysteriously locked door, or a strange haunted shadow can happen every day. Watching Hyouka honestly made me feel like finding the nearest gum wrapper and use my detective skills to find out the truth of who could have possibly have left it. Now you could go on the opposite side of the spectrum and say this makes Hyouka boring. While I do not agree with that, I will admit that the conclusions to some of Hyouka\u2019s mysteries are pretty underwhelming and leave a lot to be desired. It ultimately comes down to what you want from Hyouka. If you want grandiose mysteries spanning many episodes with mind-blowing conclusions, you should look elsewhere. If you want intriguing everyday mysteries that will have you scratching your head, you\u2019re in the right place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Hyouka are good, but leave me a little mixed. Each character in Hyouka does a good job of filling their role in the story. Hotaro acts as our detective who\u2019s always one step ahead of the audience. Eru drives the story and Hotaro forward with her curiosity. She also plays a similar role to the audience, acting as a kind of catalyst for Hotaro to drop his exposition on. Satoshi is the self-proclaimed \u201cdatabase\u201d that provides Hotaro with the random necessary information to solve the mysteries.  And Mayaka honestly doesn\u2019t have a set role in the story outside of being the kind of bossy one who helps with the mysteries occasionally. That in no way means she\u2019s a bad character. She gets quite a bit of development outside of the classic lit club and their hijinks. I honestly wish every character was like her and stepped out of their role every now and then. What I mean by that is Eru outside of being the curious one, really doesn\u2019t get much development. She\u2019s the one character that I think her role consumes her in a way. I feel like the character are so stuck in their roles at times that they don\u2019t have the chance to develop outside of those roles. This is a mystery anime, so I understand that the main focus should be on the mysteries, but it would\u2019ve been nice to let the characters step out of their shoes for a little bit. In no way does this mean I dislike the characters, they just feel pretty one tone at times. Despite my faults with them, I do still really like these characters. They aren\u2019t perfect and feel real because of that. They\u2019re the type of characters that I\u2019m happy when they\u2019re happy, and get mad at them when they do something stupid. That\u2019s probably why I\u2019m a little hard on them. It\u2019s because I truly care, and want to see the best of them. Most of the episodes in Hyouka involve the characters just sitting down talking to each other. Heck, episode 19 is just Hotaro and Eru sitting in a room for over 20 minutes. When something like that is still interesting to watch, you know must have done something right. Whether it\u2019s interesting because of the characters, the story, the mysteries, or a culmination of everything. You have to admit it\u2019s impressive to make an episode that is essentially an extended conversation interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I even begin? I have one word for the art: stunning. The art in Hyouka is absolutely gorgeous, I can\u2019t think of anything I don\u2019t like about it, or even find average for that matter. Hyouka is colorful, fluid, and outstandingly beautiful as I\u2019ve come to expect from Kyoto Animation. Something that\u2019s completely unnecessary, but is very welcomed is how Hyouka changes up its art. Usually when the gang is putting together a timeline for a mystery or other situations the art will change to a completely different style. One style could look like ancient etchings, while another one uses a lot of pastel colors. Some styles super simple, some more complex than the usual art. There\u2019s a lot of variety that isn\u2019t easy to explain, but it helps make each mystery and episode feel different. Hyouka art is simply timeless. It\u2019s honestly hard to believe something in 2012 looks better than a lot of stuff coming out today. It looks great 7 years after and I\u2019m sure it will look great many more years to come.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven with Hyouka\u2019s minor faults, it\u2019s just one of those anime that really touched me. It left me with that empty feeling when you finish something good and makes you want more. As far as I know, there still isn\u2019t enough material for a season 2. And while it would definitely be nice, I honestly don\u2019t mind. The ending of Hyouka definitely won\u2019t satisfy everyone, as every ending wouldn\u2019t, but it wraps things up in a nice little bow that leaves me fulfilled. Sometimes it\u2019s best for things to just end. Not everything needs to last forever, nor should they. Hyouka is a beautifully crafted series from beginning to end. The intriguing mysteries of the classic lit club, lovable characters, and breathtaking art formed an experience that I believe is worth a watch. Season 2 or not, I won\u2019t soon forget Hyouka.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, this was just my opinion and isn\u2019t any more or less valid than anyone else\u2019s. As always, I highly recommend you watch it for yourself and form your own opinions. Seriously, though, watch it. It\u2019s good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Hyouka 9 pen spins out of 10.\\n\r\n(I actually spent time learning how to do that. And no, I don't regret it.)\\n\\n",

            "content": "My experience with Hyouka was a good, but decrescent one. It started off great but as i got closer to the end, my disappointment kept rising. There were a few problems with the story, specially the extreme attention on not getting it out of the slice of life genre, which ended up making the whole plot pointless (if there was even one).\r\nStory. As mentioned, it had the potential to be good. There was no need for a solid storyline and big revelations, Hyouka definitely could have worked its way to perfection with only the main genre. \r\nSince the first episode, they kept rising the tensionand expectations on the characters and their relationship, or even the main\u2019s mysterious way of solving puzzles. But as i kept watching it, it got dull, boring. The whole story so far was pointless for the ending, there was no conclusion. The whole building up of expectations was destroyed and the unexpected romance felt more like a try to make it end in a better way. \\n\\n\r\nArt. What can i say? Kyoto Animation never disappoints. The style is on point and the playing with focus and brightness to create depth was perfectly used.\\n\\n\r\nSound. As well as the animation, the sounds were a great add to the mystery and depth of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. The relationships and bounding between them were nicely developed, but i feel like there could be a little more background to each one. Specially the boys\u2019 friendship, it would be interesting to know how they met and also the girl, where did she even come from?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i\u2019m a fan of slice of life, so regardless of the boring stretch, i really enjoyed it and the mysterious stories. One of the big reasons i didn\u2019t give up on it was that awesome pilot and the animation itself.",

            "content": "High school genre is a bit stagnant with sub-par romance shows and fat booty fappin comedies. Here is some good news though. Hyouka doesn't really follow any traditional path of \"romance\" or \"rom-com\" style, so if you have had it up to the teeth with that shit then this could be a good change of pace.\r\nHyouka introduces a main character who i think most can relate to. (or at least appreciate his realistic views) In a world where each high school protagonist is basically some spray on sheet of a guy we are given a slacker who gets his rocks off on doing absolutely nothingif possible. The rest of the cast is mostly gimmicky but they are fairly well developed and likable at the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEasy on the eyes is a bit of an understatement. If you don't enjoy the plot of discovering mildly convoluted teenage mysteries then you could watch this for the art alone. Maybe just a tad cutesy for some peoples taste (a lot like Kyoukai no kanata) but so pretty i couldn't complain in anyway. The way classical music is mixed into the episodes is nice as well, adds a more sophisticated and laid back feel. \\n\\n\r\nDont go into this hopping for a thicc ass romance. That shit really don't matter much in this one. Your are just along for the mystery solving. That insnt to say there is no romance at all. Its just not the main focal point by any means. Now i could see second season really cracking into that (which i would thoroughly enjoy) but that still might not even be the case. Tbh i dont even know if a second season will happen, i dont really research shit i kinda just think and type at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nFor you who enjoy a laid back, slice of life-ish feel with mystery solving overtones then look no further. Pretty solid. Not the best thing ever but defiantly worth some time if you have it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: Don't expect the conclusions to be like rape or something. At first i couldn't tell how heavy it would be then found out it was going a little more family friendly than Law and Order SVU.",

            "content": "Hyouka is a slow-paced but realistic school-life anime that revolves around little, everyday mysteries.\r\nThe anime features Sherlock Holmes-esque problem solving on an everyday scale. Themes include logic puzzles, slice-of-life, and high-school romance. There is little action but the illustrators do a great job of spicing up the dialogue. None of the mysteries are morbid, and the overall atmosphere is very positive and happy.\r\nThe magic of this anime is its ability to make inconsequential mysteries into riveting narratives. The male and female protagonists are opposites, but have amazing chemistry together (and can be quite funny). The romantic subplots are treated in a believable way, and neverseem to be forced. Viewers find themselves wanting to join in and hang out with the gang.\\n\\n\r\nOne concern is that some of the mysteries are slightly too drawn-out. Although I enjoyed the characters, by the end of the anime their quirks are perhaps overly defined, and they lack a little nuance.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to viewers who like school-life settings, slice-of-life, romance, and---most importantly---logic puzzles. This anime is suitable for teenagers and early 20's adults.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are not a fan of slow-paced anime, look elsewhere.",

If you want to see a really Good mystery anime..watch it!\r\nAbsolutely Loved the Main Character \"Hotaro Oreki\", He looks Kinda Lazy but is a Genius inside. His ability to solve mysteries is awesome.\r\nThe other characters Mayaka Ebara, Satoshi Fukube , and Eru Chitanda also played important role, especially Chitanda as she and her curiousity convinced Oreki to solve Mysteries Almost evrytime..XD.\r\nI was a little dissapointed for the lack of Story at some points but the overall story is good.\r\nSound is Okey. i did not watched the Japanese verstion but The English Voice-Cats was good.\r\nThe Animations Are reallygood\\n\r\nOverall its a very enjoyable anime and worth watching\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I first watched this about 7 years ago, although recently i rewatched it and it made me write this review...\r\n[SPOILER REVIEW AHEAD]\r\nWell this anime is quite good from its characters to its art. Looking at our cast of characters specifically Oreki is depicted as someone who is lazy to the core. He is good at solving riddles and through out the show Hyouka exudes mystery tone than a slice of life. Anyway coming back to Oreki, he is a fine character and has his quirks. I particularly like how he can turn anything climatic into anticlimactic just by saying he's tired and too lazy todo it. His character is the one that develops the most across the show. Although he is still the same guy and not much has changed about him at the end, rather i think a change mustn't be a requirement for character building in general. His character is developed without changing any of his views, like how at the end he is not changed into being energetic or anything, he still desires to be lazy just like how he has always been. \\n\r\nAnyways its the decision Oreki takes through course of this show which fascinates me, like when at the start he realizes Chitanda would lead him to ruin so he makes the plan of presenting a mystery to her, a mystery that he created himself so that it wouldnt be tedious in finding a solution. Much of the time you as audience will be given clues to the mystery as it unravels.  Any good mystery show should give you all clues to solve a puzzle and not hold out on any of them to make an ass pull at the end and this show has alot of good mystery. I could go on talking about other characters, its OST, etc etc but i think the elements i reviewed covers the heart of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI don't usually write reviews but i recently started rewatching some classic shows most of which i have forgotten since i first watched and this has helped me to view it in a different light.\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\r\nSo Hyouka is one of those mystery shows... interesting.\r\nStory 7/10:\r\nSo the story has a repeated throughout the entire show and it goes like this:\r\n1) Something happens\r\n2) Chitanda goes \"I'm curious\"\r\n3) Houtarou resists\r\n4) Houtarou helps\r\n5) Investigation time\r\n6) Houtarou figures it out\r\nNow sometimes this 6 step plot spans over 2 or 3 episodes, but most of the time it is one episode. The main problem I have with the story is that in some episodes, it feels awfully forced. In episode 11 or 12 I forget, the mystery was \"why was Chitanda mad??\" If that isn't forced then I don't know whatis. Another problem with this plot is that it leaves no room for character development except for \"investigation time\". I believe and I could be wrong, there was only 1 episode without a mystery in the entire show. Those are my problems and here are my praises: First, this plot can leave to some imagination of the viewer. This is needed in mystery as without the viewer's participation, entertainment is not had. Second, This plot gives way to rewatchability. One can pickup an episode at the beginning of a mystery, and watch it all the way through, without having to watch all 22 mysteries. Another thing, these mysteries are very detailed for the amount of time they have to sink in. Definitely the best mystery was the first \"Sengoku Jun\" (I believe that's his name) mystery in my opinion. Because of these reasons story gets a 7/10. Edit: Also the ending was really weak and forgettable. A disappointing end to a great show.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nNow this is of course shorter because holy shit is the art good in this show. All characters look beautiful, all backgrounds stunning, and it's all great. There is nothing to complain about except a few things here and there. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nOk... now the first op and the second ed were good, and the first ed and the second op were eh. That's all I have to say about the ops and eds. Now in terms of ost, the background tracks are very good at what they do. They have a mystery track, where when it plays you know it is mystery time, and other tracks are very good. Now in terms of VAs, all are good except for Chitanda. She was alright at first, but got real annoying real fast. For these reasons, sound gets a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nSo here is probably my most controversial of them all. Let's go through the main four and my problems, then I'll go through my praises of the characters as a whole.\\n\r\nChitanda: Why is she curious all the time? At first, it made sense because Jun is part of her family, but later on, \"Why was I mad?\" \"I'm curious!!\" It made no sense as to why she cares about every little thing. Another thing that I will be addressing as a whole later on, how she treats houtarou in the middle of the season.\\n\r\nSatoshi: This character seems like a comic relief character at first, and I still can't really put my finger on why he is there in the first place. This character is trying to be a bunch of things at once (in the show and metaphorically), such as: love interest, childhood friend, jealous rival, comic relief, source of useless info to help the mystery, the list goes on.\\n\r\nMayaka: This character I probably have the least problems with, (except houtarou of course) and she is the most relatable character. She doesn't live a perfect life, she gets into friendship struggles, she has love issues. She gets mad easily, but for some odd reason, it works for her.\\n\r\nHoutarou: Ah the smart boy. This guy is so much fun to watch as he evolves from a shut in to helping others. No problems here.\\n\\n\r\nProblems as a whole: They expect Houtarou to figure out a mystery, he \"doesn't do it right\" and they get all pissed at him. I am of course referencing the movie arc, and those episodes annoyed the fuck out of me. Houtarou is forced. Not asked. Forced, to help the gang with a movie that has an incomplete end. He figures out a good ending that is satisfying and good, while no one else helps, but then they all come to him saying \"It doesn't seem right\" \"I didn't like it\". This is a gripe that seriously deducted points from the score, and I can't get over those reactions.\\n\\n\r\nPraises as a whole: These characters work together and bounce off of each other very nicely, and are all very enjoyable to watch. The side characters are unique and most appear in one, maybe two mystery plots, while others are a mainstay. Like the sister. The sister is never revealed, her face anyway, but yet somehow she gets to be one of the more enjoyable characters to watch on screen. I don't really have anything else to say on the characters.. so 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this show, as it brought me to the joy of mystery. I very much enjoy trying to create a theory along side the characters, as well as seeing them grow. While at some points the characters are annoying, or at others the mysteries get bland, it is still a fine choice for a show to sit down and binge. If one were to watch the show at different times, please watch the longer, 2-3 episode long mysteries. These are overall better and do not feel as forced. A good ending is not episode 22, but 20 or 21 is fine. Enjoyment is relative, and I enjoyed this show, very much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

            "content": "Hyouka was a really fascinating anime for me, if only in a very meta way. To explain, I'll start with some background: When I watched it, I'd been knowingly watching anime for about 19 years - now as a pretty casual fan who catches certain shows that stand out - but I know the culture very very well and was more fanatical long ago. I'm not really into Kyoani overall, but I've seen shows I've loved (Lucky Star), absolutely couldn't watch (K-On), and even both extremes (Haruhi) so when Hyouka came up in an informal anime club, I thought I'd give it a fair shakewith no expectations.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka redefined what I knew about anime, in the most anticlimactic way possible: In my decades of watching hundreds of anime, I never realized it was possible to feel so utterly ambivalent about a show. The first arc raised an interesting question that I'd have happily watched a show about... and did nothing with it. The rest of it was poised right on the edge of a million possible anime cliches - the setting, the characters, the events, all staring into cliche hell... but it remained original, which is an incredibly impressive feat. Nonetheless, it was powerfully uninteresting and entirely believable, almost as if I were just watching a webcam somewhere. Academically they pulled off something amazing by avoiding the cliches, but while it's original, I can't say it was fresh. It was just... there. Not mind numbingly boring, but sort of hitting a perfect balance between \"if someone wants me to watch it, I'll watch it\" and \"if at any time the episode cut off and I couldn't get any more, I'd be ok.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were similar: while Kyoani characters are usually very likeable, these ones were just there. I didn't hate any of them. I didn't like any of them. They were just people, with a slight bias toward irritating.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was ok. That is, fantastic for a bit older anime, and unremarkable compared to some newer works from other studios. Detailed and lifelike. The sound made no impression on me, but suited the show fine and voice acting was always solid.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all, I have never felt so strongly neutral about something. Usually if a show is \"meh\" that means it's bad, and Hyouka is not bad. Usually if a show is \"passable\" it leans toward good, and I also wouldn't say it was good. So it made a strong impression on me with how much any part of it failed to make a strong impression on me. It's like the anime equivalent of drinking tap water.",

            "content": "Curious right? You can't stop thinking about it can you? Why in goodness name should you watch this anime? It makes your eyes glimmer right? Well hold of your frustation of me pulling that lame pun and let me begin my review of Hyouka!\r\nStory: Hotaru Oreki is a dull and unenthusized Teen entering his first year of high school. Not giving a crap about studies or clubs his motto is \"If I don't have to do it I won't, If I do, I'll make it quick\" and believes to conserve as much energy as possible. At the request (almost borderlining demmand) of her sister toJoin the classics club to save it from disbanding due to low members and there meets a girl who hadn't realized that she was in a locked clubroom. After the minor mystery is solved Oreki finds that this girl, Chitanda Eru is quite the curious type and for whatever reason he can't quite say no to her. Its from there, that a series of curious cases begin. Notice I didn't say mysteries because to be honest the mysteries are quite mundane. to quote the movie other guys, its not miami vice where its Drugs and Murder scandals, it's quite small scale only increasing slightly and no one's life is at risk, its the simple cases one gets during their highschool year. Now why did I give this an 8? Well its not only a character driven thing, but fact of the matter is that these cases really are the more likely thing one will encounter in high school and the writing is done in such a way that you realize these characters are taking it seriously to the point where you want them to chill out. But as one character put it, they're high schoolers and their sense of importance is overblown. Staying true to its setting it can be a negitive for mystery pursuists while for slice of life enthusists it could be a plus, where I stand, is that it does its job to move along the next section-\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I always tell myself that characters are just as heavy as plot in a series and either one can carry a series over. In this case the Characters are definetly the stronger piece, because there are no other characters better for this story than Houtarou, Eru, Sotashi and Mayaka. These four that make the classics club are very entertaining to watch, not only to bounce off of each other but in their own right as well. Houtarou is the most likely to connect with the lazy in all of us (me especially) and even though the cases he goes through are small, he's a BEAST at solving them and is just smart in general *he even works his way through a few bribes for good mesure*. Eru can be either really cute or really annoying to the viewer, either way though its undeniable she's important as she's the trigger for Houtarou to get involved in these cases (and the recent onspring of curiosity memes online) and later in the series you can see subtle ways in how they connect with each other and its always a pleasure to see people blushing. Stoashi appears to be the comic relief but he's harboring quite the odd colors of emotions, not that he's two faced, but you can't quite view him the same once the series is over. Mayaka becomes important later in the series but her squabbles with Satoshi are amusing and what she goes through in the third portion of the story is likely to draw intrest. Through the series these characters change very subtly and its not through speeches or puffing on about friendship but almost like acctual people, the writing for them is done so well and subtly its amazing and it gets to the point where you find out that this is the main strength of this show...and speaking of strengths...\\n\\n\r\nArt: Now, I've only cared about two shows from Kyoani, and one of those shows had a little movie called 'the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya'. Its simple, take the art and animation from there, put it here and add much more well done lighting, some great and sometimes surreal art style changes and thats pretty much what you've got for Hyouka in terms of art and animation, simply outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Music here is very fitting, its classical, a bit bouncy when need be but not to the point of annoyance and is sort of soothing. Its the kind of music that really makes you think and at other times its really soothing and fitting of the normal setting. The Opening and Endings are also easy on the ears though you may be more distracted by the visuals they present. The Seiyuus here do a fantastic job at portraying their characters to the point that the stories I hear of Kyoanim getting bigname actors to play these roles isn't surprising in the slightest to me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: with amazing technical values and the enjoyable yet interesting cast of characters I never regretted watching a single episode, even when the case at hand was just too mundane. It makes for a great viewing experience and at the end you'll really grow t like the cast and their relation towards each other. The cases on the otherhand can be either really mundane or easy to solve (I couldn't solve a mystery to save my life, but I was close to solving a handful of them) and the points in which the characters play up certian cases to be bigger than they are (oh second portion) while realistic given the setting can be a tad annoying. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Focus on the mysteries, you'll really dislike this show, but come here for character and by damn it you'll have a show. Once you realize what the show is truly going for with its characters you'll really come to enjoy the ride and the writing put into it. May not be a perfect show but its definitly worth your time.",

            "content": "Mystery, romance and drama in a mature anime? Hyouka is one of the most aggressively pleasant and enjoyable \"grown up\" animes I've had the pleasure of watching. It's not profound, it doesn't take itself too seriously; it's just smart enough and wholly enjoyable. The episodes are fun to watch and the series as a whole has a nice progression and character development to it, it's the sort of series that leaves you feeling completely full inside (but hoping for the same thing tomorrow). \r\nThe basic premise is that four kids join their school's floundering Classics club but keep getting drawn into solving quite trivial, yetintricate, mysteries. Houtarou, the reluctant detective, is an \"energy conservationist\" or to put it bluntly, a slacker. The mystery genre works so well with an unlikely detective, and Houtarou's deep commitment to exerting as little effort as possible fits the bill quite well.  He is usually conscripted into detective work by Chitanda, who really is the perfect counterpart. Not only do her pleas of curiosity move the plot along, the slow-building relationship between her and Houtarou is quite delightful. \\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries range from historical trivia to absurdly minor problems, but it's all in the presentation and I personally was on the edge of my seat. In a world where so many mystery series feel that one dead body just isn't entertaining enough, it's refreshing to watch one that feels less is more. It also adds to the realism, you can really get into the characters and their progression because they seem so human and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nIf you need explosions and dead bodies and all of that, this probably isn't the anime for you. I for one was riveted though, this is really anime drama at its best.",

(as always, might be some spelling mistakes )\r\nYou never know if you are going to watch something that you like or not, the only thing that might help you know are the ratings or the reviews from other people. When i was going to watch Hyouka i thought that i were going to watch something average and not so good, well i was wrong.\r\nHyouka is an anime that will surprise you, it takes everyday mysteries and makes it to something interesting. It's actually quite cleaver and after a while you wont be ableto stop watch it. By the ratings from other animes i think that Hyouka is underrated, one of the few animes that i think deserves more points that it has. Well, i would rather see that pretty much 90% of the animes that are higher rated than Hyouka would have less points, because it should mean something to have a high rating. And i also think that NOTHING deserves a perfect 10 in a review.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is about the boy Oreki who is really bored and hates to do stuff, and then he meets the girl chitanda, and when chitanda has something on her mind she NEEDS to know about it. Oreki will solve some basics mysteries for her and after that some more complicated ones. Oreki got his BFF Fukube who is a nice side character, and the you have the fourth and last main character Ibara that's inlove with Fukube. All of them will gather in the literature club, they will talk a lot and solve some mysteries. If you are not sold about anime yet, trust me it will actually be quite good.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Hyouka is looking quite good, the scenes when chitanda transforms in orekis mind are done great. The background is really nice and characters are done very well, only thing that's bad about the animation is that it has some quality drops were everything about the animation gets worse. But the openings... if you just would have counted animation quality in openings then Hyouka would be at the top!\\n\\n\r\nSound: Here is the part where Hyouka shines, it has one of the best (probably the best) soundtracks from anime. The classical music is just wonderful and it fits so well, the openings (first one is better than the second) are really good and you get a great feeling from watching them. I don't know if i can write anymore about the sound, because you can't complain about it, it's just so good.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Every anime got something that's not so good about it, and the story department is \"that\" thing in Hyouka. They don't follow a main storyline in Hyouka, they have 3+ small mysteries that they solve. There is no \"red line\" that they will follow, they are not focusing about a big mystery. And that may be fine but one mystery will drag on to much (festival). One more is that they don't have a goal, the mysteries just come to their club room and they will try to solve them.\\n\\n\r\nValue: There is no real life lesson in Hyouka, you may find that the characters will say that you should not be shy if you are good at something. You may also find that you will try to think diffrently, you will try to think like oreki do when he solves mysteries. For me i will remember this anime for a long time, it's one of the animes where i have no problem remembering everyones name, i might not see it again for a while because it had no real plot, but i almost never see the same serie twice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I don't know if everyone will agree but i really think that atleast two of the character in Hyouka are really well made and fitting, and the rest are just well made. Oreki is one of the best main characters in any anime that i've seen, it may be because i'm lazy and hates to use my mind as well. Oreki is really smart and can solve mysteries by using logic, and the way how he is acting is really well made. Chitanda is a character that has great dialogues with Oreki, she is very forward and when she has something on her mind she wants to know it NOW. They compliment eachother REALLY well and the best moments in the anime are when Oreki and Chitanda are together. Fukube is Orekis best friend, he also has some great moments when he and Oreki talks to each other. He might not be as smart as Oreki but he has his moments, he adds some quality to the show and you need a character like him, he is not as well made as Chitanda or Orkeki but still quite good. The last one is Ibara, she is just someone who is there, i don't feel that she adds to much to the show, she is the reason why the characters wont have a higher score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I can't write to much here, i can either write that i enjoyed the anime to some degree, i may also write that i loved it/hated it, i might also write that i thought that it was average. The closest thing that i get is that i loved it, it may just be that i was in the mood to watch an anime like Hyouka, but it may also be that i love animes with great characters and sound. And Hyouka got just that, great characters, great animation and great sound. I fully recommend this anime to everyone, if you don't like the genre just try some episodes, i know i did and i loved it.",

            "content": "Kyoto animation has produced some very popular series in the past majority of which are slice of life. Now, after watching the famous Haruhi series and the movie, I was like no way can they come up with anything slightly better or in the same level as that in terms of being a slice of life anime. Well, that was until I came across a certain high school anime that altered my perspective on slice of life and school anime.  So, without further ado I am gonna start my review of Hyouka\r\nAfter seeing clips of this anime in basically every single AMV out there,I got \u2018 curious \u2018 to finally check out this anime. *pun was shameless intended*. And little did I know that anime that deals with curiosity, which caused me to watch it because of my own goddamn curiosity. Of course, I did hear about Hyouka prior to watching those AMVs but a high school mystery anime was just not enough to peak my interest despite the fact I overdose myself with Veronica Mars episodes even when I do Math for my upcoming exams. Not a good habit my friends!\\n\\n\r\nSo, I finally sat down on my ass and I watched the show and boy it was one interesting experience watching Hyouka. In case, you are unaware of the plot of Hyouka, let me give you a synopsis of it. Hyouka is a mystery anime about a young high school boy name Hotarou Oreki who just doesn\u2019t have the time and energy to give a single fuck. He doesn\u2019t feel like doing anything and doesn\u2019t see the point of living a rose coloured life unlike his peers. His motto is that he should always conserve energy and not do anything and if he has to do something, he will do it quickly. Which I guess means he is trying to be like the Flash in bed!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, his life takes a turn for the best when his sister requests him to join the Classics club to keep it alive, over there he meets Chitanda Eru. This little girl over here is curious to the point she must intimidate Oreki with her kawaiiness and luminous purple eyes to help her solve the tiniest and pointless of all mysteries. Add Oreki\u2019s best friend Satoshi and a girl named Mayako who has a crush on said best friend, and you have got Hyouka.\\n\r\nHowever, my friends, that is not even close to what Hyouka is actually all about!\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is in my opinion a slice of life anime with a grand twist. That is mainly due to the fact, how this show presents itself to the audience. Because, if you ask me slice of anime, are very challenging to make them interesting. The other interesting slice of life anime that is interesting that I can think of from the top of my head is Fruits Basket, but Hyouka unlike Fruits Basket still takes place in your average Japanese school.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the characters, and the way they interpret certain situations and the way they look at certain aspects is what makes Hyouka worth watching. From the eyes of our male protagonist Oreki, we began empathizing with his situation and we actually buy into his insane logic that it\u2019s okay being lazy and that there is no point in being active in contrast with his best friend. But, it\u2019s Chitanda Eru\u2019s character that challenges his outlook on life, and gives him a purpose and a meaning to actually live life. Sure, being a detective solving ridiculous mysteries may not seem enough, but due to her and these mysteries you see our main protagonist slowly and subtly evolve into a character that seems different from the one we were originally introduced to. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s this way of developing a monotonous and sarcastic like Oreki is one of the show\u2019s biggest triumphs. Many might disagree saying that he is still the same character, but if you look closely, Oreki hands down changed on the inside even though he might still seem like his usual self on the outside. It\u2019s thanks to Chitanda Eru, that Oreki became as interesting and memorable as the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nChitanda Eru on the other hand is a plot device if you ask me. Mainly, due to the fact before she stepped in Oreki life\u2019s was as boring as a learning watching paint dry. It\u2019s her perkiness and of course curiosity that give depth to Oreki\u2019s character. Now, Chitanda on the other hand, is a girl who can be annoying but in a good way if you ask me. She might not be that interesting or worth remembering but I have to give her credit for making the show entertaining. If it wasn\u2019t for her involvement this show wouldn\u2019t have been so wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the interaction with her and Oreki is one of the highlights of the show. The two have amazing chemistry and if the show lasted longer it could have been a great romance too. But, despite all of that seeing the two on screen together discussing possible theories in order to reach some conclusion is what gets the audience excited. The ship starts to sail and like Chitanda you are curious to see whether is will continue sailing to reach its final destination or will it sink to the depths of the ocean. That my friends is something for you to find out by watching this show!\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting and recurring characters are nothing that worth mentioning, but they do manage to do just enough in order to contribute to show this show. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the majority of the mysteries of the show are ridiculous, but that\u2019s what makes them so great. Because, despite not knowing the exact answer it all depends on Oreki\u2019s perspective of the situation to come to such a conclusion that will make you go, \u2018Huh, I could never ever think of something like that!\u2019. The show has the audience on their toes and keeps them guessing things like why a teacher forgot the lesson plan or what Chitanda\u2019s grandfather told her when she was younger that made her cry. It\u2019s these small and yet vague situations that deconstructs the mystery genre.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show did get boring when dealing with the Cultural Festival arc. Sure, there were moments that I loved, but since it dragged on for like 6 or 7 episodes and reached to a conclusion in a messy way is what prevented Hyouka from being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Many of you might disagree with me, which is expected but that particular arc was my least favourite in the entire show but it was not necessarily a bad arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc that really defines Hyouka in the most literal way possible is the one about Chitanda\u2019s missing uncle. By the end of the arc, I was convinced that Hyouka was indeed an original and epic anime. The final conclusion that our main character reached and the way it was all displayed is what made this show so good. And I salute the show for making me drop my jaw to the floor in a metaphorical way of course.\\n\\n\r\nNow,the animation on the other hand is hands down one of Kyota Animation\u2019s best work. I can\u2019t believe I am saying this but Hyouka\u2019s animation was better than the one they did for the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, and that comment alone says a lot about the animation. But, the only thing I can criticize about it is that it kind of reduced in quality during the Cultural Festival arc, and during which the animation seemed average at best. But, for the rest of the episodes it was just absolutely flawless!\\n\\n\r\nThe visual representations of what the characters are thinking or saying about a certain mystery helped Hyouka reach greatness. Every single one of them were truly outstanding, and it was sad that I didn\u2019t see many of them again during the cultural festival arc. I can go on and on praising the animation, but we would be here all day if I did that!\\n\\n\r\nNow, the background music of the show again has got to be the best I have ever heard. And it is amazing how perfectly is blends with the tone of the show. It helps build tension, but is also there for the humorous moments. It even helps disguise the bland moments and make them worth giving attention to. That\u2019s how wonderful the music was!\\n\\n\r\nI originally prefer the first opening and ending themes of the show compared to the latter ones, as they were the only ones I never skipped. The opening song is something I never want my brain to get rid of like ever, and listening to it feels like getting welcomed into heaven if you ask me. The second opening song was not bad per se, but it\u2019s just overshadowed by the first one. However, the second opening and ending themes are wonderfully animated though, the songs that accompanied them just didn\u2019t suit my taste.\\n\\n\r\n The Japanese voice actors also do an outstanding job and I love them to death for making Hyouka even better than it needed to be!\\n\\n\r\n So, now that I have finally after much thought and discussion have come to my own conclusion and have decided to award Hyouka with an 9,, and that you should definitely check this show out, especially if you want a different type of slice of life or mystery anime to watch. Hyouka, is one of a kind and it deserves all the praise it gets and it is one of those shows that I desperately want a second season for!\\n",

            "content": "Story: 7\r\nYou can say that Hyouka isn't trying to do anything super groundbreaking, but that's quite okay. What essentially happens in the anime is the main characters solve quite a few mysteries, while working to uphold the Classics Club at their school. However, these mysteries aren't uber-horrific or dark in any particular way, in fact, they are quite everyday-life type problem solving chains. Typically in each episode a mystery is presented, such as \"Why are things disappearing during the cultural festival?\" and the group tries to solve the problem. The character the story focuses on is Oreki, who has a knack for solving these mysterieswhen the others are stumped. He typically doesn't want to do anything, because he has a minimalistic personality, he doesnt like putting effort into anything unless he must, but Chitanda always manages to convince him to do it. There are undertones of a blossoming relationship between both couples in the four main characters, which is cute to see, but nothing huge happens in terms of romance. I was really disappointed about this fact, and its one of the reasons i only gave a 7. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nReally, it's kyoto animation, they have great animation in every series. Always 10-worthy or at least 9.\\n\\n\r\nParticularly, within the openings, there is some quite outstanding animation. Check it out. \\n\\n\r\nDiscounting movies, kyoto animation has typically the best animation out of any anime company. Thus, it gets the 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhen I initially started watching this anime, I was impressed by the animation and the choice of characters. Each character within the story (Chitanda, Oreki, Satoshi, and Mayaka) each have their own distinct personality traits, along with specific ways of thinking and acting, in a subtle way. They aren't so blown in a single direction (tsundere, klutz, etc.) that it seems like they aren't acting as a normal person would. It makes for really interesting episodes, just because of how the characters react and converse. They aren't perfect, and they each have things to learn about them that aren't super clear from the beginning, for example, Satoshi calls himself a \"database\", because he knows quite a lot of facts and memorizes a lot of information, but he says he isn't great at drawing conclusions based on the knowledge he holds. The sense of limitations each character feels throughout the series is interesting, and makes interactions even better. This was one of the best parts of the anime. Seeing how each main character attempted to solve the mysteries in the story was cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nFrom Kyoto Animation, OPs and soundtracks are always good quality. The first opening was pretty good. I don't really like the second one that much, but it wasn't horrible or anything. The soundtrack in the background itself is very fitting, but not super memorable. I think soundtracks have to stick in your mind to be considered outstanding, but if they have a great composition even if they dont stick, they are still at least good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nDon't take this personally if you liked the anime a lot, or hated it. I always enjoy school life animes to an extent, simply because they are my style. However, I need romance in there, or drama, to make the anime really enjoyable. I enjoyed the mysteries quite a bit, yes, but when there aren't many consequences for the characters at any points, or the \"struggle\" most characters experience (the conflict if you will) through most non-comedy animes, it makes the anime a bit less enjoyable. There wasn't any huge moral from the anime itself, but the mysteries they solved were very well planned out. For that, I think a 7 is reasonable. My enjoyment was good, but not huge.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 8. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself had great points in art style and characters. However, the plot itself didn't have anything that would make me rewatch the series, and the sound wasn't a holy grail or anything. Others may have really enjoyed the anime, and thus rated it higher for enjoyment, but for me, just a good.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I hate long and novel-like reviews so this will be a brief one...\r\nSTRENGTHS IN...\r\nStory:\r\nThe strength in the story is that it had proven that mysteries don't always have to be dark and serious.\r\nThe show also vividly presendted a significant character development plot throughtheir daily interaction\\n\r\nand ofcourse their mystery-solving theme of bonding together.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisual Art:\\n\\n\r\nOne word... CLASSY!!!\\n\r\nThe strength is obviously the great and consistent proportionality in the character design, bright background and superb simultaneous animation. Personally, this is one of the elements that really carried the show all the way!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nnot much to say but I personally adore the second half's ending song, the one with the lyrics...\"you are a mystery, detective I'll try to be\" :D\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the show's visual art, this element had hard-carried the show to its glory.\\n\r\nThe great stuffs about this is first, the colorful personalities of the characters which blended perfectly creating a rainbow like combination and charming chemistry that makes you want to go in their world and bond with them. Second, like what I have stated in the story element, the character development which was significantly presented\\n\r\nthrough the main protagonist's transformation from a dull gray character into a more active and rosy romantic one.\\n\r\nLastly is the show's ULTIMATE EYECANDY... ERU CHITANDA :\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\non the other hand...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWEAKNESSES IN...\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if it's just me but I find some of the episode heavily text barricaded, what I mean is you have to really\\n\r\nfocus on EVERY WORD on the subtitles or on what they say to somehow flow along with their thoughts. Sometimes, you even have to hit the pause and\\n\r\nrewind button to absorb some of the details presented especially when the MC is doing the deductions. I also noticed some gaps in the story line that made me have a lot of \"SAY WHAT!!??\" and \"WHAT THE FVCK JUST HAPPENED\" moments while watching. Lastly, I had a hard time going along with the deduction of some of the mysteries involving the use of Japanese characters and hiraganas. I just hope that the author would lessen those kinds of mysteries in the future volumes for the non-jap fans! :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisual Art:\\n\\n\r\nThis is unfortunately FLAWLESS!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI had no problem with this either :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIf there's any lack on this field, it would be a significant romantic interactions between the main characters which is fairly understandable :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEND ;)\\n\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to Kyoto Animation, I just get super excited because I love the other shows I've seen them do.  So you can imagine my sadness when Hyouka failed to invoke that same love.\r\nThe story: 6/10\r\nI don't mind the mystery genre, but the way Hyouka chained the characters to their high school really limited what mysteries they could take on.  I had a lot of trouble keeping my attention focused because the issues they were solving just weren't that interesting.  The most interesting mystery is done fairly early in the series, and that left me with stuff like \"who stole thecooking utensil from the cooking club?\" sort of deals.  I know this show was more about it's characters than it's \"events\" but boy there is a lot of mundane talking that you have to sit through for what the show gives you.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Art:  8/10\\n\r\nI love Kyoto's art style, especially with their character designs and creative fantasy-like stylistic look they often delve into.  Hyouka was no exception, and if there's anywhere the series shines it's here.  I especially love how vibrantly color is used in the backdrops and within the character's eyes.  At one point Chitanda's hair grows out and sprouts a garden of flowers and vines.  Forget realistic, that kind of artistic vision is what guaranteed I'd finish the show. Those instances were few throughout the rest of the show however, and the art remained only pleasant and respectably enjoyable compared to the other works I've seen animated by the studio. \\n\\n\r\nThe character: 5/10\\n\r\nA large part of what made this anime difficult to give my full attention was that it's characters were uninteresting.  Chitanda was adorable and at times hilarious as she clumsily attempted to be a successful president but her character never developed much beyond her one-sided \"I'm curious!\" role.  Likewise the other characters were pretty simplistic, and when character development finally happens it feels rushed and somewhat forced.  For a story that relies on it's characters so heavily it was hard for me to get attached to what was going on when the characters were so static and one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound:  7/10\\n\r\nA couple of soundtrack songs really stood out and helped bring out an emotional side to this anime.  I enjoyed the first opening too, it set a level of emotional impact that the rest of the anime rarely rose up to.  I wish the story of Hyouka delved deeper into the character's struggles or set some type of serious problem that the viewer could get carried away by because the music was good enough that it would have relieved the proper kick for a more emotional ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I didn't regret seeing Hyouka but it felt rather empty when I compare it to the other projects Kyoto has worked on.  Still I applaud them for trying a  mystery anime, it shows they think outside the box and will take risks to be truly unique.  If you seriously love Kyoto's art and character style then go for it but otherwise I think a synopsis will do nicely.\\n",

            "content": "This show was great! If you or anyone you know is a fan of mystery or slice of life shows, this is a great show to watch. \r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe story focuses around four characters in an afterschool club, called the Classics Club. Small mysteries pop up in their club activites and they all set out to solve them. Some of the mysteries are simple, while others are not. Some of them are also based around famous mystery adventures, like those of Sherlock Holmes. In addition, each little mystery is engaging in its own way. You'll have to watch the show for yourself to seehow.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nWow, Kyoto Ani. You guys really outdid yourselves. I've see some of your other shows, but the art and animation for Hyouka was just amazing. The art is very beautiful to look at and the animation is very fluent. Once again, great job, Kyoto Ani. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nThe music for the show does set the proper tone for each of the episodes. In addition, the openings and endings were very good. I, however, prefer opening one to opening two, but either way, both had very good songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\r\nThe four main characters are very interesting. Each of them have their own distinct personalities. Houtarou is like a mini Sherlock Holmes, Satoshi is literally like a database, Mayaka is kinda like a tsundere (not 100% sure on that), and Chitanda is the calm and curious one. They all feel different and to an extent relatable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nI loved Hyouka! It was engaging and very interesting. It is one of those shows that you really don't see every day. It's different in that it has its own energy and the way that it uses that energy makes the show different from other slice of life shows. The mystery aspect of the show helps in doing that. It gives the show an interesting twist, one that is very rare for slice of life shows.\\n\\n\r\nOverall  - 9/10\\n\r\nLike I said, I loved Hyouka. It was fun and has something that any mystery fan would enjoy. Go watch it whenever you can. I can tell you now, it will be well worth it.",

            "content": "Ahh Hyouka.. I don't even know what the mystery tag doing on this anime. It was perfect all the way up until the last few episodes. I have a couple of reasons to why I am giving this a 8/10, and here they are : \r\nStory : 8/10\r\nThe story can me resumed to \"Pink eyed girl gets curious and makes Houtarou do stuff.\" The story is simple, but very well executed. Instead of a being a \"badass anime with MC being the most clever being on earth\", the anime is centered around 4 1st year highschool kids. Now there are a couple of problems withthe story too, for being a 22 episode anime I felt that it lacked a few episodes. The last 4 episodes were rushed as hell. All the anime after episode 14 felt like it change genres suddenly, first part being Mystery, second being RomCom. [SPOILERS] I feel like the anime would be better of with a couple more episodes with the love story between Houtarou actually becoming full blown.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually beautiful. This is one of the pretties looking anime I have ever seen. The characters are well designed and I think Oreki Houtarou inspired Hachiman from Oregairu,\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is well done. The openings are ok and they are what they are for a SoL Mystery RomCom\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are very well made. The only maybe not so good one that should have been explored is Houtarou's sister. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed this a lot appart from the last 4 episodes, kinda ruined it for me. I would recommend this to people who like RomCom or SoL\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nHyouka is a good anime that that you will enjoy a lot. Just the last 4 episodes are not so good.",

            "content": "Reviewing another KyoAni series....*sigh* This better be good. What am I talking about?! This is a great KyoAni series. One of their best series to date. This anime is basically \"Sherlock Homes: High School Version\". \r\n[Story]: (9/10)\r\nOreki Hotaro is a high school boy, who always acts passively. One day, he enters a \"Classic Literature Club\" as recommended by his older sister. There he meets Eru Chitanda, Satoshi Fukube and Mayaka Ibara. They begin to investigate a case that occurred 33 years ago. Hints of the mystery are buried in an old collection of works of the former members of the club. The collection is titled\"Hyouka\". \\n\\n\r\nThat synopsis alone is the main reason why I started watching the series. I thought that some dark f*cked up shit occurred on the club and they have to investigate it. I even thought that was going to be the main focus of the show but it only lasted for about 3-4 episodes. I do love how Oreki managed to solve the mystery and he even showed hints that lead him to his conclusion. I even felt stupid after he solved it. \\n\\n\r\nAs you know, Chitanda's curiosity is what drives the series' plot. If she's not curious then Oreki goes back to being a lazy ass. Every time Oreki and his friends solves a mystery, a new one pops out. Chitanda grows curious and Oreki tries to solve it again. That's basically it. What's makes the mystery worth watching? It's the fact that they're very well thought out, uses attention to details and actually uses logic. I sometimes wonder if the author of the series is a professor himself. I'm not saying that every mystery in Hyouka is smart because some of the mysteries are just plain dumb. It's mostly the \"one-episode mystery\" that are dumb. Enjoyable to watch but dumb if you think about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery that I love the most is the arc where the characters were trying to solve the unfinished ending for the movie. It is the best arc I've seen in Hyouka. It's full of mysteries, twists and the conclusion is awesome. It even gave me a reason to use my brain and try to solve it myself. Sadly, my conclusion was different from Oreki's true answer (Was his answer truly right though?). \\n\\n\r\nThe series is also filled with slice-of-life moments, some comedy moments and hints of romance. I'm glad they balanced it out because watching mysteries all day can get boring sometimes. There are times though where the series will have one full episode of mystery that isn't really that hard to solve. It's just 2 characters in a conversation and somehow ending up trying to solve a puzzle. In other words, a \"hypothetical situation\" puzzles. One of my favorite easy puzzles and it's one of the dumb mysteries that I stated above.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing, the series' pacing is slow and it can get boring. Especially the first half of the show. What the show does is it slowly builds up the mystery that its trying to tell. This can last for 2 episodes. Some people may find this a problem because of how slow it is. Fortunately, I can handle the slow pacing but some people can't. \\n\\n\r\nOh right, I forgot about the ending. Some people found it unsatisfactory. I thought it was pretty decent but like other people out there, I didn't find it great. How do I say it without spoiling the ending?.....It felt incomplete. Like there's more story to be told but it ended just like (*snaps finger*) that. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nKyotoAnimation at their best when it comes to animation. The animation looks great, the visual looks great and the character design also looks great. The animation felt smooth and I didn't see any choppiness. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the series is simply outstanding. From phenomenal background theme to music, the show did a great job\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"Yasashisa no Riyuu \" by ChouCho and \"Mikansei Stride\" by Saori Kodama. The ED theme songs are \"Madoromi no Yakusoku\" by Satomi Satou & Ai Kayano and \"Kimi ni Matsuwaru Mystery\" by Satomi Satou & Ai Kayano. The 1st OP theme song is great. It has that awesome instrumental piece and a great voice by ChouCho. I also found the 2nd OP theme song beautiful. It has the beat that makes you want to nod your head every second. I like the 1st ED theme song but not the animation. It looks like a none-explicit hentai. The 2nd ED theme song is miles better than the 1st ED. In short, they're all great. \\n\\n\r\nThe VA's did a terrific job with their characters. Even the side characters has a great VA and that really surprised me. The VA that I love the most is Chitanda's VA. I just love her voice and the way she says \"I'm curious\" is too cute!\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe series focuses on 4 main characters. Hotarou Oreki is a lazy high school teenager who prefers to conserve his energy. His motto is If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick. Eru Chitanda is a calm and cute high school teenage girl who has a great amount of curiosity and this often drags Oreki into her curiosity. Fukube Satoshi is a smart high school teenage boy and he's the \"database\" for the club. He went to the same middle school as Houtarou and Mayaka. Ibara Mayaka is an active and strict high school teenage girl. She has known Oreki since they were in first grade. \\n\\n\r\nAt the start, I thought Oreki was going to be an unlikable generic lazy ass main protagonist that we mostly see these days but as the show moved on, you see Oreki grow and develop from being a lazy ass to a sociable guy. This isn't because the plot demanded him to change just for the sake of character development but it's because of Chitanda. Chitanda's constant curiosity and her views made Oreki realize that life isn't as boring as he think it is and he needs to stop taking it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nChitanda is by far one of the cutest female character I have ever seen and one of the best female character. Her personality is great and every time she says \"I'm curious\", I somehow feel Oreki's pain. Not in a bad way though. I also love it when she's drunk. She's just too cute, especially the way she said \"daijoubu\" or \"I'm o-kay\" in English. Her cuteness aside, Chitanda is a complex character. As you watch the show, you'll understand Chitanda as a person and she's just not in the show solely as a cutesy moe character. Don't simply think of her as a plot device because she's not. It's hard to explain why but you'll understand if you watch the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining 2 main characters aren't left on the dust either. They got the same amount of screentime as Chitanda and Oreki meaning they're as fleshed out as those main 2 characters. There are also times where you get a backstory of them and you learn about them and why they're acting the way they are. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as I would have want to see Oreki and Chitanda get together, note that the anime is not focused on Romance. The anime doesn't even have a Romance Tag. There are a hint of romance between the two so I understand why some fans were shipping them. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7/10)\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong..I love the anime, I think it's great but it's one of those great animes where you simply can't marathon because of how boring it is. It's not too boring but compared to other shows out there, it's boring. If the show were to have an English Dub (I highly doubt it), I would probably not watch it again or if I do end up watching it again, I'll skip some episodes or scenes\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\r\n\"Hyouka\" is one of the best \"mystery\" animes I have seen. It has a well thought out and sophisticated mysteries, a fleshed out and likable main characters who grows over time. If you have a brain of a 5 year old retard or you have a serious case of short attention span then this anime is not for you. If you like the \"Mystery\" genre then this is a show for you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\n+Great Story\\n\r\n+Great Animation and Great Visuals\\n\r\n+Smooth Animation\\n\r\n+Outstanding Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Great Characters\\n\r\n+Well-Thought out Mysteries\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Some melodrama moments\\n\r\n-Show can get boring sometimes\\n\r\n-Ending may not appeal to everyone",

            "content": "A fictional, supernatural mystery can be exciting and thrilling, but what about the ones that may occur in our daily lives?  Hyouka decides to take a spin on the general mystery anime by having our main cast go through more minor mysteries, that sprout from simple questions.  This creates a completely different feel and atmosphere that the anime portrays.  How does this impact the quality of the anime? \r\nStory: 7.4/10\r\nAlthough this take on the genre of mystery was fresh and exciting, eventually, the charm of the mundane mysteries wore off a bit.  A small portion of the problems presented became slightlypredictable; however, what was appealing was the initial satisfaction that I felt after solving them.  The vulnerability of the mysteries being solved by the anime viewer is a mix of pros and cons and its enjoyment factor will vary among the person.  Not only is there mystery in this anime though.  There are slice of life and slight romance elements present in Hyouka.  This allows the show to potentially appeal to a wider audience and those slight additions from other genres are welcome as flavours to add to this bizarre dish of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is definitely one of the best animes I have seen.  The characters are gorgeous, especially Chitanda :D The backgrounds have a certain crisp and detail that are awe-inspiring.  The colours are very kind to the eyes, as they have a certain subtlety and earthly style.  I have nothing bad to say about the art.  It is just phenomenal because it is KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\r\n1 great OP, 2 pretty good EDs, and 1 average OP.  The first opening definitely was the best song out of the four.  The melody is very good and the singer does a solid job of portraying the feelings of the protagonist (wonder, potential, lost).  The two EDs are both pretty decent, providing contrasting satisfactions at the end of an episode.  The OST is great.  Many songs are so \"slice of life ish\" that I really begin to appreciate the soundtrack later throughout the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.4/10\\n\r\nThe characters are very good.  Our protagonist is very likeable and his character traits are very consistent.  I have not encountered a character quite like Oreki, which is a refreshing taste for the anime.  The main female, Chitanda, is controversial for many viewers.  Her energetic personality means she can be very likable or annoying depending on the person's point of view.  Satoshi and Mayaka also are solid characters because they had more depth than I initially expected from what seemed like a simple mystery slice-of-life anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nMost of the mysteries are very enjoyable because of the feeling of almost getting to it.  Oreki's solutions are incredibly realistic and in the reach of almost any viewer.  It is when he reveals why this happens that creates an amazing feeling inside the viewer.  However, some arcs kinda drag out in the middle or end of the anime, which kinda distracts and lowers my potential enjoyment overall.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.75/10",

            "content": "\"Watashi wa himei o ageru\"\r\n\"Hyouka\" (lit. Frozen desert/icescream) is anime adaptation of Honobu Yonezawa's light novel series \"Ko-tenbu\" (Classic literature Club) which covers the story line of the series first 4 novels. \r\nHyouka is a mystery story. It heavily relies on mystery element for each episode yet doesn't differ majorly from other slice-of-life series in sense. Every story has it's carrying elements, after all. In Hyouka's case many of the events follow pattern of inspecting abnormalities or \"interesting\" factors and then using \"logical\" (quoted because of the certain aspects which I'd rather not regard logical but you will be able to make your own conclusionon that after watching the series) deduction to explain the case. \\n\\n\r\nHyouka revolves around the group of four: Houtarou Oreki, Satoshi Fukube, Eru Chitanda and Mayaka Ibara. These four first years join the Ko-tenbu (classics Club) that would otherwise be cancelled due to lack of members. The kotenbu itself is already a huge mystery: in addition to having no meaning to its existence it also has some peculiar links to people outside the school. Other point setting the kotenbu apart from other clubs is that, in what I could tell, it is the only club with no \"senpai\".\\n\\n\r\nStory wise the series wasn't that good. On micro scale the individual mysteries/arcs were entertaining and the puzzles were rather enjoyable. It didn't feel forced or like the narrator was playing it dirty. Even though the mysteries themselves feel rather \"out of place\" time to time the execution feels good. That being said the there was little continuum in the actual story and after ten hours I didn't feel like there had been any particular development from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nCertainly the characters had grown and changed. There had been emotional turmoil. But in larger scale it didn't feel like miles had been traveled. Rather the end scene was more of a cliffhanger telling that everything is just about to start, which, considering there is no promise of the last book being turned into anime, was rather disappointing. \\n\r\nLack of development isn't necessarily bad thing. Every story doesn't necessarily have to have plot that has definite beginning state and conclusion. However, Hyouka definitely feels like series that lives and dies by its development and it did feel like more should have happened. By this I don't mean that I wish the series to have flashy confessions, dokidoki-cuteness or anything of the sorts. I simply wish that the glimpses of characters exploring themselves had been more frequent. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and art wise Hyouka might as well be called masterpiece. The animation couldn't technically be better. There could be some arm-wrestling regarding whether or not the big eyed anime style was suited for the series, but there is very little room for improvement on the path the crew choose. Characters are beautiful, scenes are refined and appealing and various effects used in illustrating the mysteries are interesting. Music wise there isn't much I can say: beautiful, inspiring, moody and suiting. Part of good sound design is combining certain feeling with tune and making it work. When certain tune starts to play you know the case is going to be solved; when certain song plays you know it's play time. One thing I keep encountering more and more in new anime I come across is the heavily western sounds. But hell if I'd argue that as a bad thing I might as well blame all anime for being animated in low frame rates. I'm not going to be that picky. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Hyouka is interesting package of mystery, slice-of-life and character interaction. If you can find enjoyment in viewing everyday life from another perspective, enjoying conversations between (Guy who was too busy to conserve energy to ever get to know himself) (Girl who pretty much finds everything mysterious) (Happy-go-around guy who has self-esteem problems) and (tsundere cosplayer librarian) and getting outsmarted Hyouka might be just the thing for you. \\n\\n\r\nAs a warning though: be ready for some cliche and SERIOUS repetitive carry elements.",

            "content": "I know it seems lame to give something 10's across the board, but Hyouka left that kind of feeling with me. The anime summary was a deterrent for me at first as it makes it seem as though the entire anime is set with the one goal in mind. This only lasted a few episodes in though. If you enjoyed the Detective Conan series I would recommend this for a more casual \"slice of life + Mysteries\" feel. It kept me going throughout the series and the own downside is learning that the anime covered 4 out of 5 of the books covering the series.\\n\\n\r\nPros: Artwork was crisp and clean. I understood what was what when and where. Unlike shows that skimp on things such as backgrounds and particular parts of characters during different scenes, I was in awe for this work. To be honest, I fell for Chitanda the first time she said \"I'm curious\" The artists put so much work into those eyes that it shook my core. Character design was great and I enjoyed the \"Happy ends\" to all of the mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nCons: Story seems to drift off of the \"Mystery\" subject near the end of the show. It truly became a \"Slice of life\". Since spoilers are not allowed I can't delve too much into it, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I for one would have preferred to end the series with a BANG! A big mystery that left room for a second season. (Though as previously stated this is not possible.) Some of the side characters are not given enough background, but again this is personal preference. If someone is going to show on screen for more than a single episode then the audience needs to feel as though everything is connected properly. I did not count this against the show since it was done so infrequently, but I still feel that it should be mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this just sums up the major points for me. Even though the Cons exist, I want to keep my rating 10/10. It has been many years since a show had me this hooked and it was over all too soon. I look forward to more work from this particular group and would happily recommend this to anyone.\\n\\n\r\n(Reviews are based solely on personal opinion. While I may praise it as the epitome of creation for myself, others views may vary. Time changes all opinions. What I praise today may lower itself on my list of favorites tomorrow. Please take this small post as nothing more and nothing less.)",

To put it simply: I'd say it's about a lazy, pessimistic guy finding himself wanting to do better because he's met a girl that MAKES him want to do better. There's a lot of detective work involved in this series, usually lead by the male main character who is 'not good at anything, but surprisingly great at this kind of thing'.\r\nArt: Art's just fine. I never saw anything that was that lazy and was most impressed the whole way through.\r\nSound: Voice acting was awesome, same as the music - especially whenthe mystery is there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great cast of characters - the main male character is awesome. If you know who Hachiman Hikigaya is, and have been looking for an anime with a similar main character, then Hyouka is definitely for you. And Chitanda... She is just bloody adorable. Definitely one of my favorite female characters in anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show. Hope someday something like it will come along.",

            "content": "I honestly didn't even know this anime was even suppose to be a detective anime, all I heard from others was that was a drama/romance anime and had really good visual's, (Like most Kyoto-ani productions do.) So the \"detective\" aspect came as a surprise to me, a good surprise nonetheless as I do love mystery and detective games, however unlike the other detective games and anime I've watched and loved (Such as Danganronpa) it didn't have as nearly as heavy of a tone with it's mysteries. \r\nUnlike something like Danganronpa that chooses crazy characters and extreme-over-the-top murders to be it's \"selling point.\" Hyouka takes amore laid-back set of characters approach and more believable crimes and mysteries they have to solve. Nothing they solve is extremely unbelievable and i'd go as far as saying the first mystery they solve is the craziest they will get. It's something normal high school students might actually solve within their daily lives. It was nice seeing this more laid back tone within a detective/mystery style show as most detective works, (Such as Ace Attorney or Danganronpa) go for a more over-the-top approach. There's nothing wrong with over the top, it's just enjoyable to see some more believable mysteries every once and a while.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated at the beginning of the review, the anime has the \"gorgeous artwork\" Kyoto-ani is known for with a fun cast of memorable characters. While all these characters stand out in their own right I really wanted to highlight the main \"detective\" Hotaro Oreki. Typically I don't find myself loving the main character however I gotta say this is one of my all time favorite protagonists. His \"laid-back energy conservation lifestyle\" is one of the best main character traits I've seen, really embodies most anime viewers personalities. I never once really found myself yelling \"HOW CAN YOU BE SO DENSE\" well watching him like most \"in love\" main characters and I actually quite enjoyed most of the scenes he was in, even when any of the other \"more interesting\" main characters aren't supporting him on screen, he was still interesting to watch and had some good comedic moments. I don't highlight the main character a whole lot in reviews however I did feel some importance in highlighting Oreki, as he's one of my favorite main protagonists of all time.\\n\\n\r\nA little side note, the music was absolutely one of my favorites parts of the anime. I don't know much about music so i'm not gonna go into it, but when they started working on a mystery and that soundtrack kicked in, god was I hooked.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I loved this anime, it got boring at certain times and a few of the mysteries were extremely hollow or just dragged out for too long and stuffed with filler but I still managed to enjoyed my timel watching this anime, even if you're not a huge fan of the mystery genre, the characters and animation and even comedy are enough to be worth giving it a watch.\\n",

As someone who usually watches things like Naruto, High school dxd, Charlotte, and the occasional Clannad, i am completely new to any form of mystery anime or otherwise. So, when i watched this a story with suspense and immersion without any fighting i was shocked. But, this show took it a step further when it added likable characters and an interesting story, so needless to say i was mind-fucked when i watched this show. The art style and sound were great, i even enjoyed the dub, ( even though the kanji references wereconfusing af, i learned to play along), which i almost never the case in shows that i haven't been hearing about for years. The ONLY reason i didn't give this a 10 was because the NO GODDAMN CONCLUSION WHAT SO FUCKING EVER, and when i mean none i mean they ended the game right before the final boss battle. AND I SCREAMED, AT 2 AM, IN MY HOUSE OF 5 PEOPLE, \" WHAT, THE, FUUUUUUUCCCCCCCK\". overall as long as you don't wait 20 episodes for the mcs to hook up you'll love this thing. It is also the most mundane highschool anime i have ever seen (except for maybe chill camp). \\n\\n\r\nP.S.- Where was the rope??",

            "content": "I watched this because KyoAni (Euphonium and Free! hadn't aired at the time). I expected great visuals, a good soundtrack/credits songs, and a good character-driven show, which I did get. What I didn't expect was the mystery theme (researching anime beforehand wasn't a thing for me, and websites tend to be cryptic anyway), and not Conan-style mysteries where a murder is solved, but mysteries about things that might seem insanely mundane, but are a matter of life or death to Eru at the time.\r\nThere are 3 major arcs and a handful of side stories in this production. Arc 1 was fantastic, arc 2 was... ehh,and arc 3 was a little long in the tooth but otherwise good. Not terribly thrilled with how arc 2 ended, but the aftermath scenes took the bad aftertaste clean off. Bless you, Hotaro's sister. Other light novel authors can take lessons. In fact I was all right with not having a \"recovery\" episode (that ended up being the bonus OVA), but that was a nice touch from the author.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was well written, directed, and performed, but the decision to cast 3 familiar voices from past KyoAni shows (Yuichi Nakamura and Daisuke Sakaguchi from the Clannad series, and Satomi Sato from K-On!) made me feel at times like this was an odd reunion of Tomoya, Sunohara, and Ritsu with a heavy dose of amnesia. But ultimately the decision to cast them was the right one-- Nakamura got to play someone who isn't a whiny emo, and Sakaguchi and Sato weren't relegated to pure comic relief roles for once. This is probably the first time I've heard Ai Kayano in a starring role, and she delivered a convincing performance. Aside from a bit player or two who are about as deep as a puddle, many of the guest characters are well-written and nuanced, so that's a big credit to the light novel author.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's a literary weakness I could point to, it's probably the character of Hotaro. I'm generally not a huge fan of an anime putting unusual quirks into a main character and then going \"Deal. With. It.\" You know, you could at least try to hint towards why, especially in slice-of-life anime. Similarly with his conflict with Mayaka. To be fair, these are in fact addressed in later light novel chapters, which beggars the question, \"Uh, sequel pls?\"\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, if I may be so bold, might I suggest a movie or OVA based on volume 5 plus the additional prequel chapters? I feel like I could write the scenario, even.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately that decision is up to the producers and publisher, and if memory serves, disc sales weren't that strong, and this was an expensive production (star-studded cast, heavy use of CG/effects and hand-drawn animation, and a studio orchestra soundtrack). I wouldn't be surprised if they're reluctant to follow a bad investment with more money.",

The mystery that you can found in here is something that you can found and made anytime anywhere in our normal life. \r\n Hyouka takes setting in a school with a main character named Houtarou Oreki, a energy conserving guy who happens to be pretty intelligent. He joined in Classic club and since that he got into a lot of mysteries. Witha comedy vibes given, they solved the mysteries. Most of the mysteries in Hyouka are necessary. With those mysteries that he solved along with other classic club members, the story progresses on. It's not just they are getting closer while solving those mysteries, they also got into another mysteries because of it. Even so, some of Arc(s) in Hyouka are fillers with unnecessary mysteries. Well, It's because it's a Slice of life anime. It's like they went into something normal, like going to hotsprings, going to shrine but they added mystery on it. Well, i really cant complain about that though. It's a mystery anime afterall.\\n\\n\r\n Overall, i seriously enjoyed the story. The mystery occurs really got my head confused, but its still made sense so no problem.\\n\\n\r\n As for characters, i saw no problem. It's balanced. There are lazy-but-intellegent-guy, a tryhard-cheerful-informer-guy, a hardheaded-mysterynmanga-fan-girl, and a supercurious-reckless-topstudent. They are getting closer each moment, but there are only little bit of romantic moment. But again, i saw no problem there.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka's Animations and Sound are Undeniably perfect. Why? First, the shadings on the anime are realistic i really can feel how good KyoAni on animation works. The character design is balanced with it's personality. And the presentation is my favorite. They are giving us a presentation on each mystery rather than only characters talking, making it interesting and more easier to understand. The Soundtracks are well-done. They are using some classic and classy pieces on the anime, making it more classic than only \"classic club\". The timing on the soundtracks are perfect, giving me goosebumps everytime i watched it.\\n\\n\r\n As a conclusion, Hyouka is a Slice of Life Mystery anime with a bit of comedy, almost every mystery on it is interesting and necessary. The Characters are well balanced, the Animations and Sountracks are amazing and classy just like how classic stuffs are.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it.",

            "content": "For a show where nothing world-shatteringly important happens Hyouka is surprisingly addictive. Maybe because it has a heart and well-written characters instead of gimmicks at its core. \r\nStory: Deadbeat teenager with a knack for logical deductions is forced to solve non-mysteries by a bouncy genki moe girl and their two friends. Slice of life ensues.\r\nThe show is a string of loosely tied events where the members of the sos brigade...er, literature club find strange little occurrences and force the main character to do the math, so to speak. With every little incident we get a peek into the character\u2019s minds and this carefully crafted buildupcontinues in a lovely way all the way to the final episodes where it comes to its sweetly inevitable endpoint. Now this all sounds much more exciting than it is but if you appreciate the little curiosities in life and well\u2026real life itself you will love this show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nOreki is our main character: a logical deduction ace and a professional lazybones\u2014or energy conservation expert, heh. At first I really disliked him for his passive nature but throughout the series he actually grew surprisingly well, if predictably so. By a certain poignant episode his character shone the best out of all four.\\n\r\nChitanda is of course the catalyst for everything that happens and she is a bouncy genki girl, as anime would have it she is also a princess (not really, but a wealthy daughter of an old family. Do these girls grow on trees in Japan? Every anime seems to have one\u2026) a top student and generally has every moe virtue under the sun. At times the moe made me cringe but surprisingly, she evolves beyond that. So now we have two characters who have pushed themselves beyond the stereotypes. Lucky day for you, there\u2019s more!\\n\r\nFukube is Oreki\u2019s best friend and a genki guy this time. Praise the goddess no moe, the only thing I hate more than moe-turd girls is moe-turd guys. Anyhoo, I liked his character a lot because there is always the subtle tension between his frustration with playing second fiddle to his best friend and the depth of the friendship itself. \\n\r\nIbara is the other girl (didn\u2019t expect that didya now? Yeah, right\u2026) and she veers towards tsundere territory without ever becoming Haruhi levels of annoying. In the end I liked her most of all for her level-headed attitude and sheer determination. \\n\r\nIn general, all characters first appear as your basic stereotypes that anime land is littered with but it only takes an episode for them to start growing beyond that. And it is done while you are busy watching them solve their non-mysteries. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nCan\u2019t get more beautiful than this. Fluid, smooth and with tons of background it is Hanasaku Iroha level of scenery porn. In fact, they look very much alike. The character design is attractive and pleasing, movement is natural and there are lots of imaginative little sequences playing out as the non-mysteries are explained. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nTypical. This is not the kind of anime that needs an elaborate soundtrack and that\u2019s just fine.\\n\r\nOP1&2: Dat perky jpop you know so well. \\n\r\nED1: uhh, this was a total miss. It is creepy pedobear stuff and has the two girls crawling around in their underwear for no reason except to appeal to creepy viewers. Thumbs down for whatever creepster producer greenlit this. \\n\r\nED2: my favourite ending theme of the season! This fits the show perfectly, is ultra cute and has a totally catchy song to match! \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nWhile I loved this show, it is not for everyone. I heard many complain that it was too slow, too uneventful and unexciting. I would like to point out that this was never about the mysteries, it was always about the characters\u2019 development and the incidents were always filters through which we\u2019d see them grow. Sure, they could have gone the shonen route and had Oreki solve murders or other crime stuff but that would cheapen the mellow, coming-of-age slice-of-life this show has in its heart. \\n",

It is about sacrastic bored high schooler Oreki who wants just to have his peace (Hachiman?) , but sadly he is super intelligent and so his days of energy savings are done, when he meets main heroine Eru.\r\nThe show contains short stories of mystery solving, the pattern goes pretty same every time. Something happen, Eru gets currious, Oreki solves the mystery in a way Sherlock Holmes would be jelous and thats it. One would think that its not that interesting, but it IS. The waythe mysteries and the progress of the story is written is so catching you will finish the anime in one day. Oreki is one hell of the badass and in my opinion on of the best high school MC in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEvery mystery they solve is focused on different topic, but mostly daily business, nothing supernatural. F.E. what happened 45 years age to this guy that he was expelled from the school, who has stolen the ladle from the cooking contest etc. But that does not lower the overall tension. Everything fits together and creates wonderfull experience.\\n\\n\r\nOther two Senpai from the main cast are much of a filler, they mostly act as a funny element or a bonus to Oreki and Eru. But it works pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main story does not progress as much as you would thought. Basically the only bigger change we can see is in change of MC personallity.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its great show that deserves attention from everyone who does like something untraditional.",

            "content": "It's going to be tough reviewing this, since I didn't exactly love the show, nor did I hate it. The reason why I'm saying that is because each episode felt pretty long, meaning it lost my interest multiple times. Oddly enough, even though each episode dragged on and felt boring I couldn't help but to click on the next episode. That being said I didn't drop the show, I didn't hate it nor did I love it. Before I get into the breakdown of the show I want to say that this show might be a hit or miss, and I feel like this showmight be for a younger audience. I'm not saying it's a kid show, but for the mystery genre, the 'cases' they solve might seem uninteresting to someone who has seen better mystery shows.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe show takes place at school, where one student is told by his sister to continue the spirit of a dying club. After excepting the role of being the potential only member of the club he meets a girl who changes the way he lives his daily school life. As a few more members join the club together they solve mysteries ranging from school events to rumors. \\n\\n\r\nSo the show is basically about a group of friends who get together to solve mysteries mainly involving their school. There are a few episodes where they do things out of school, but other than that it's mainly school related. So if you're a fan of anime that usually don't go outside the realm of school this might be a cool show for you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMy main issue with this is that the characters were there, the characters were fun, but they didn't do anything that interesting. \\n\r\nThe main character Oreki has this outlook on life that he absolutely needs to be lazy, anything involving work is a hassle to him. Although he is lazy he is actually pretty clever and can solve most mysteries easily. solving the mysteries contradicts his outlook of being absolutely lazy, so sometimes his character is a bit witty and fun.\\n\r\nThe other main character Chitanda is the one who motivates Oreki to solve cases. She's not much other than that in the show, I mean she helps with the cases as much as the other two characters.\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the characters were fun and interesting, I would have really liked to see them solving other cases besides pointless school cases.\\n\r\nOther than the main characters there are side characters who you actually see appear from time to time, which is something that I really like. It was a nice touch having characters who go to the same school making reappearances because you know, they do go to the same school after all.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis one is odd, cause some shots in the show are very artistic with things like a beautiful sunset, then there are other scenes where they just look like a normal show. Then the art gets a little too crazy when they start to talk about there mysteries. When they talk about their cases the show goes to a completely different style of art. These little scenes are nice, I like them a lot. Also the music was good, they reused songs too much but they weren't bad songs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nNot the greatest mystery show, yet it wasn't exactly a waste of time. I do want to say though the second half of the show was a lot better than the first half. So if you decide to watch this one just keep in mind that it does get more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nPros: Fun characters\\n\r\nCons: Boring at times",

            "content": "Hyouka in my opinion, is a very unique' mystery genre' anime. Audience nowadays often directly associate mystery with crime, horror etc; so much that sometimes I come across anime like those that doesn't even seem to be 'mystery' to me. Hyouka is nothing of those sort. When I first came across Hyouka, I couldn't imagine mystery with comedy, slice of life, I thought that this anime would be bs. But I was wrong. Personally, this anime revolutionised my perception on 'mystery'.\r\nStory: 9.5/10\r\nIf you're a fan of Detective Conan, this is not the 'mystery' anime for you. Like Detective Conan, Hyouka is broken up into manysmall stories (cases), where Oreki Houtaru and his fellow Classic Club friends attempts to solve mysteries within the school. In Hyouka, 'mystery' does not circulate around horror, thriller, psychological or any 'dark' themes. Compare to other mystery anime such as Detective Conan, in terms of executing mystery, I prefer Hyouka. Why? Simply because Hyouka is more realistic (Detective Conan's cases are way to superficial eg. Hey someone died!, let's use puzzles and word riddles to solve the case! (I call that 'mystery storytelling' not 'mystery story')...). I cannot emphasise more on the magnificence of the pacing in Hyouka. Hyouka also very successfully put forward evidence for the audience to solve each case and the timing of it is perfectly executed to give me enough time to think, I love it because I was able to solve some cases beforehand whilst Hyouka did not decrease the quality of the mystery. Whereas Detective Conan's clues/evidence seems to appear out of nowhere when Conan is giving his deduction most of the time. Why did I give it a 9.5? I love Hyouka, but there are unnecessary stuff, and personally I ended up expecting more as the anime progresses.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is superb, it brings out the vibe of mystery while keeping a peaceful feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is just my personal opinion. Well, the voices of the characters expectedly matches the face of the characters...  Hyouka also adds in background music to cue us certain clues, drives me to think and concentrate; eventually helps me to solve it. Sometimes I prefer \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters are very diverse and unique. Especially Oreki Houtaru: his renowned motto of \"If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick\", believes that he is \"conserving energy\" instead of being lazy. I actually find this really interesting. I hate anime where the main character comes out confident, intelligently perfect and solve every mystery perfectly and quickly with a smile/smirk on their face. And I also hate whimpy characters, cry-babies whom just pisses me off. So Oreki Houtaru is perfect for this particular anime. He makes mistakes, he makes wrong assumptions, he struggles, it is ideal to make me dwell into the case instead of just taking his answers for granted. Ultimately increases my enjoyment and involvement in the anime.\\n\r\nI also like the characterisation of Fukube Satoshi, a very likeable, carefree character. He's like the clown of the anime, who provides comedies to lighten up the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI love how I was able to get involved, given the enough time and clues in attempt to personally solve their cases. If you're the type of person who likes to think, you'd find this enjoyable, otherwise you'd be the person who prefer things like battle anime, where you don't really have to think much. But given I'm the type of person who likes anime that involves solving problems, thinking, philosophy, etc, I found this an exceptional enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.7/10\\n\r\nIt really all comes down to personal preference of what you prefer and expect in a 'mystery' genre. Hyouka is no way a dark/brutal/psychological anime, as most people would associate mystery with those. However, it should not be dismissed as a crappy anime, not fit to bear the holy genre of 'mystery'. Put mystery aside, it'd still be an interesting anime to watch too.\\n",

Convincing with a superb art style, an interesting setting with sophisticated and special subplots and great character development, this is a must watch for everyone who isn't scared by a different approach at psychological aspects in anime and generally likes calm slice of life shows.\r\nThe shows follows high school boy Oreki and what happens to him following his joining the Classics Club on request of his sister. While there is no major plotline or a goal, the various miniarcs take a focus on the relationships between the main characters and various mysteries thatappear throughout the show. While keeping faith to the classic SoL plot tropes, the show still manages to shed light on the lovely interactions of the characters, well done overall.\\n\\n\r\nI already said it and I'll repeat it: this is a work by Kyoto Animation, which has done works like K-ON, Clannad and Free! in the past. The great art quality is also seen in hyouka, which surprises with extreme attention to details and a great animation style. I'd almost say that the art is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nI sometimes had the feeling that they went a bit overboard with the voices. Especially as the series progresses, the voices more or less remain the same, which kind of disappoints me. I liked the first OP and the 2nd ED, fitting works for a slice of life show.\\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned it, the characters are a big part of the show. We really get a good insight into the emotions and the thought process of Oreki and how he makes his conclusions. We also see many hints of romance, also seen between Satoshi and Mayaka. One big theme of Hyouka is growing up and what it means, especially to the people around you. The characters are confronted with a changed reality and a different perspective on life. Hyouka provides some great thinking material on this topic, really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime a lot, especially it being a very different approach at slice of life shows. This coupled with the development going along with the story surprised me a lot in a positive way. The only critic I had is the complete lack of romance between the two main MC. You cant bring this many small hints of love and then leave the viewers disappointed. However, it doesnt ruin the show it would've just made it better. Just goes to show how much more emphasis the producers put into the story and the characters.\\n\\n\r\n I suggest every lover of Slice of Life and overall calm shows who are open to something new and interesting to take a look at this show. Also it has a really good pacing and manages to keep the show interesting even after focusing so much on those seemingly increasingly uninteresting mysteries. Props to the producers, I loved this series.",

            "content": "If we're talking about 'mystery' genre, people often confused or lumped it together with horrors, angst, thriller, murder and anything which goes along with deep/edgy/grimdark sentences. Thus, we forgot of what 'mystery' actually mean. Which is being pointed out by this show in an episode.\r\nSo yeah, Hyouka did us a favor by adding an actual problem solving (or mystery solving or riddle/puzzle solving) done by a highschooler in a way which almost similar to an actual investigation. But of course, the cases were so mundane that you might find it uninteresting. Well, that was fine since they're just a small highscholl clique, not an awesome-super-highschool-detective-solving-a-murder-case.But the most interesting aspect of this show is not the mystery itself but rather the process of solving it. Also, the main premise of this show is not the mystery at all. If I recall correctly, what KyoAni did promise is a youth drama of being a highschooler. It keeps being hinted throughout the show. How our MC, Oreki Houtarou longing to be a just another not-so-standout students living his peaceful days in course of energy perseverance mindset. Which being turned another way around by... well, none other than our Heroine, Chitanda Eru. The case was being built up one step at a time. Until it climaxed by the end of the show. Well, the final execution wasn't that contrast actually. Because, Houtarou would be very out-of-character otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast with Houtarou, Chitanda Eru symbolize the very essence of youth spirit (Subs: Rose-colored). You might thinking about someone who will be way more hyperactive so that in a matter, Eru will be looks like a bland bipolar character. Well, I can't blame that since she is being designed to be 'like that'. But it can be understandable, considering her social status and her role in her family, but have very big appetite for digesting anything 'curiously-interesting' including some mundane mysteries which littered throughout the show. She was described as a well-mannered and well-spoken oujou who act in an impulse to the point that she doesn't aware if she was being rude, especially towards Houtarou obviously. But of course, no matter what, she is still a daughter of a well-perceived family. So she did has her own 'shining' time which was so natural it almost didn't contrast to her 'seems-like' airhead nature.\\n\\n\r\nIn solving the mysteries, Holmes didn't act alone. Yep, Fukube Satoshi, a fake gentleman of the world. If anything, he just looks like a relevant comedic relieve character. But funnily enough, He gained considerable amount of 'development' from the first episode to episode 21. Which leaving a lingering question to Houtarou.  Which it doesn't take too long for him to get the answer. But well, he does has really unique features which being brought to life in this anime. You know, his quirk and interaction never tires me out. On another note, after Juumonji incident, it almost feels like he is more like a flamboyant type. Especially if it has anything to do with Ibara Mayaka... or was he always like that?\\n\\n\r\nWho? Someone who had a crush on Satoshi... since middleschool. At first glance, she just looks like a grumpy runt who'll just blast all school windows if someone ever called her 'chibi'. But seriously, it seems she had a permanent pms or something. Whats the deal with that grumpy attitude? Given her critical approach in seeing things (especially, arguments) and never wanted to lose, you can expect a heated discussion on whatever matter you're discussing with her. Well, you can thanks Satoshi for that, maybe she is just romantically frustrated? If you get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime revolves around those four members of 'kotenbu' (Classic Club/Classic Literature Club) playing and solving mysteries around their daily lives. In a sense, that was just pointlessly wasting time, but so does watching anime. So, why did you keep doing it anyway? Actually, the original author (Honobu Yonezawa) always hinted that matter in this show. Humble it might be, but still impressive in bringing that reason of why they do this deductive activities. There was always a message behind it and also it helps understanding each character and improving them or in some cases, improving their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about relationship, it did changed or developed. I don't know about Satoshi and Mayaka (seriously, they just like usual until the end) but the relation between another two (plus Houtarou and Satoshi) did changed/developed. There are also other characters as well and interaction with them. Interesting enough, almost all of these side characters are already highlighted since episode 1. Just family name I see, but look at these (Sorry for the crappy romanji): Juumonji, Sarusuberi, Chitanda, Manninbashi. See? No? Well, that was fine too, I didn't get it at first either. Each of those first letter of family names translated as: (\u5341) ten, (\u767e) hundred, (\u5343) thousand and, (\u4e07) ten thousand respectively (thus explain why Satoshi pretty worked up in bringing rumors about those four families). I don't know if it piqued your interest, but this kind of trivia are littered in this show (Like in Kanya Sai name). And not just about everything written on the subtitle, but also anything else which would just lost if you didn't pay attention on it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about detail, the production quality for this title is just magnificent. Even more so, considering this is a TV show, not a movie. Even more impressive since all this show is about people talking for the whole 20 minutes or so. Saying this never bores me would be a blatant lie. But, at least the crew which made this show working to their death in making boring conversation/discussion ala novel actually acceptable/watchable in the audiovisual media. The result is really. They paid a lot of attention on detail, whether it was a animation detail or something else (like, idea or symbolism). You can tell how those characters thinking or feels just by looking at the screen. For example: You can tell that Houtarou's heart was beating like crazy just by showing a heart-shaped pendulum swaying side to side while accompanied by a steady loud ticking clock rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I mentioned rhythm. The music (or BGM) in this show is really engaging. Especially, it was being arranged to match the shows atmosphere which it has somewhat nostalgic feels around it. The direction of the sound is also perfect, I didn't talk about the nature of each track, but the audio direction. They know what goes where for how long. A bit nitpick if I may say, but a show where the sound director/enginer is so broken does exist. Well, lets say, this aspect also helps cracking up nuance score even higher. And also being supported by powerful cast to help the characters comes to life.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the atmosphere and nuance doesn't came from the sound alone. The nature of key animation,  the high value of in-between animation and creativity of misc really helps for this show to be more 'easier' to watch. Comparing to any other detective stories which just leave the talking into a mediocre media plus a crappy outline. Well, different MBTI have different impression anyway. Thus why this show is not for anyone. Well, at least, the animation movements are smooth and fluid that it is relatively 'easier' to watch. ANd actually it doesn't stop there. Hyouka team really puts a lot of thought in animating scenes, dialogue, monologue, even silent scene. For example: How many different angle shots from where Houtarou meets Eru in the cafe? And that was just for a 7 minutes worth of talking.\\n\\n\r\nFinal words, Hyouka makes us changed our perspective, Hyouka changed our habit, Hyouka changed the standard for Slice-of-Life anime. It can be deep, it can be engaging. But it will all comes down on how deep you actually wants to swim on it? How far will you walk alongside with it? And how curious you are in exploring all contents provided in this show that you can get from watching all episodes? And of course, how well did you receive all the messages in those episodic parts?

            "content": "Hyouka, a show which blends mystery with an interesting slice of life story, and manages to do it really, really well. Coming from Kyoto Animation you could argue that it was always headed towards big things, but this is different from what we normally see from Kyoto, this is more interesting and holds more depth, and makes for a far more interesting and intriguing series.\r\nThe plot focuses around Hotaro Oreki who lives by the motto of \"If I don't have to do something, I won't, but if I have to I'll do it quickly.\" This motto goes for every aspect of his life, leaving himwith very little drive or interest in actually doing anything with his life until he joins his schools Classics Club, after some encouragement from his older sister, and meets Eru Chitanda. Eru is, without a doubt, a very interesting character who shines throughout the series; she's the type of character who is forever curious about every little thing, and it just so happens that Hotaro finds himself unable to refuse Eru when she looks into his eyes and states she's curious about something. Hotaro and Eru aren't the only members of the Classics Club, we also have Satoshi Fukube who is a close and childhood friend of Hotaro and claims himself to be a \"database\" of, sometimes useless, knowledge. We also have Mayaka Ibara who is also a childhood friend of Hotaro and Satoshi. It makes for an interesting group of characters and considering they all get a fair amount of character development throughout the series and a chance to stand in the spotlight, they feel like characters you can really grow close to and enjoy watching. The series is mostly a slice of life, but because of Eru being endlessly curious, the group end up solving a lot of mysteries, which is a refreshing idea for the slice of life genre. Fair enough, none of the mysteries are over the top and most are simple things, but this is where the characters really shine and bring out the best in the show, plus simple sometimes isn't a bad thing. Hotaro is a gruff and lazy character to begin with, but as you watch him get dragged into things by Eru and co and watch how he grows as a person you really come to like him and realise he is by no means a bad person, and the same can be said for the rest of the cast. While you may not start off being very fond of them, that can quickly change over time because there is far more to them than meets the eye and each has far more depth to them than you'd likely expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is done rather well, most mysteries are solved within an episode or two with the biggest exception being the Cultural Festival which is spread out over five or six episodes, which actually makes for a very interesting arc. Again though, not being stuck on the same mysteries does help the show because it keeps it fresh and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the animation comes into things the series is always very pleasing on the end, with some especially pretty animation near the end. Character designs aren't amazing, but they are different from the normal designs Kyoto Animation throw out, and are all interesting in their own right. The series also has a nice way of working us through the mysteries as Hotaro is explaining things with some rather interesting animation, which is always refreshing to see and really helps you understand the mystery at hand and just what has gone on.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the shows soundtrack goes, it doesn't actually have a large amount of music because it chooses to reuse a lot of it over and over, however maybe more music would have hindered the show and the music we do have works perfectly fine. The fact the show reuses a lot of its tracks isn't noticeable enough to become a bother, and the tracks are generally nice enough where you're happy to be hearing them again. It's also worth noting that the series has two very impressive opening themes, which are very catchy and will have you tipping along to them after the first couple of listens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a strong show and certainly one of my favourites. Any fan of mystery stores and the slice of life genre will enjoy the series, either for the mysteries it presents to the viewer, or because of our loveable cast of characters. A solid show which is well worth your time.",

            "content": "Being a fan of the mystery genre, Hyouka is one series which I liked watching.\r\nThe series focuses on the Classics Literature Club of Kamiyama High School where a curious girl, Eru Chitanda drags the rest of the classics club into certain situations which generally involve some kind of mystery. And the protagonist, Houtarou Oreki, who is a low-energy boy and also a part of the classics club, solves these 'mysteries'.\r\nAlthough Hyouka deals with mysteries, they aren't very serious ones, that is, they dont involve any murders or any big crimes like the normal mystery genre animes do. It deals with the mysteries one may acrossin daily life. \\n\r\nSecondly, the way the protagonist solves the mysteries, using nothing more than his awesome deducing skills is what makes the anime worth watching. That is because, you are given the same information that he is given and yet the protagonist will always be a step ahead of you. \\n\r\nAlso, thankfully, it did not have as much of romance as other animes dealing with high school life did. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason why Hyouka wasn't a complete 10 for me was because it did not end well. The story started quite well and after every episode ended, I was left with questions like, \"What might be the reason for that? Who might have done it after all?\" and so on. However, the end wasn't as satisfying. Or at least, I did not like the way it ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is awesome(except the last one or two episodes) and the art is quite good too. The characters Houtarou Oreki and Eru Chitanda were also great. It was absolutely enjoyable and something which I wont forget for long. Overall, this is one anime which is a 'must watch' if you like mystery/slice of life.",

            "content": "Story: 8 - An engrossing and well-told character piece, but the episodic mystery format may fall flat for some.\r\nCharacters: 10 - A likable, dynamic, and nuanced cast with understandable personalities and emotional hang-ups.\r\nArt: 10 - Gorgeously animated and directed, with expressive characters and vibrant backgrounds. \r\nSound: 7 - Strong first OP and seiyuu performances. Serviceable and appropriate, but largely unremarkable OST. No English Dub(as of this review).\r\nEnjoyment: 9 - A compelling take on the mystery genre with striking technical merits and impressive character-writing. \r\nFull Review:\r\nUnderstanding people, even yourself, is pretty hard. So it's rather brilliant that Hyouka frames this conflict through the lens of classic-eradetective novels. As Oreki, Chitanda, and the others go about solving the somewhat necessarily contrived mysteries that crop up around them, they also begin to grow as people and understand each other. Though Hyouka ultimately admits that people aren't a mystery you can just solve. People are complex and constantly changing, and true understanding is something that not even Holmes or Poirot could hope to achieve. So what chance do our young sleuths ever have to accomplish that? Well, they don't, unsurprisingly. There is certainly plenty of understanding and self-reflection to be had, but the mystery of the human condition can never really be solved no matter how brilliant of a detective you are.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this serves as the foundation for Hyouka's poignant insight. Hyouka is a story that totally understands its own characters. Every aspect of the main cast, from seemingly innocuous gestures to their respective character arcs, are all reflective of their idiosyncrasies and their personal faults. I can't even count how many little moments just made me chuckle at the screen thinking \"Ohoho that is so Chitanda!\" Supported, certainly, by KyoAni's gorgeous technical work. KyoAni once again demonstrates the merit of fluid, detailed animation in a genre that rarely sees the budget of its more frenetic counterparts. As I said, even the slightest of gestures and expressions speak volumes about the characters' emotions and personalities. The \"solution\" to one mystery towards the end of the story is made so glaringly obvious by the culprit's mannerisms that the ensuing witch-hunt is actually a little uncomfortable to watch. The entire situation is earnestly reflective of the characters involved. Hyouka is a story built upon, and driven by, dynamic and likable characters that are also deeply flawed and troubled people in the midst of adolescent growing pains.\\n\\n\r\nThough the mysteries are generally fun and interesting on their own, Hyouka is a truly character-driven story, and the main cast's emotions and group dynamic fuel most of the central plot. Hyouka is actually structured much like a typical 4-koma anime, with the episodic gags replaced with detective novel mysteries. Thankfully, the individual capers themselves serve as a surprisingly strong platform for characterization and development. Simultaneously a way to flesh out the characters' identities and air their emotional baggage as they work through the various conundrums. Said emotional baggage mostly coming in the form of personal insecurities and unspoken romantic tension. Enjoyment of Hyouka is going to come down largely to how invested the viewer is in emotional struggles of the characters more than investment in the snooping and investigating, but if you really need an overarching narrative to get invested in a story, you may find that the show just isn't going to work for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hyouka is a beautifully animated and passionate character study. The story of a few endlessly likable characters and their search for love, understanding, and personal truth. Like all good mysteries, the satisfaction lies not in the solution, but the journey. As is the nature of all truths, though, sometimes the answer you're looking for isn't the answer you want to find. People, like mysteries, are sometimes best left unsolved.",

            "content": "Mysteries are something that I will almost always be captivated by when framed in the proper way. For me, they have to give you enough information that you feel you can come to your own \"mini-conclusion\" (an understanding that might not be a full answer to the mystery, but make you feel that you have made progress or have enough information to come to an answer soon) yet they can't outright give you the obvious answer every time. Hyouka does this exceptionally well almost every time, however I'd like to start off with what I'm disappointed with first.\r\nI use \"disappointing\" because there was almost nothingI felt was \"bad\" with this series, more like there were missed opportunities that I felt the series failed to capitalize on. First of all, this series only adapts the first 4 volumes of this work, and only 2 have been released since then. From all the synopsis I've read, really only one of the two main \"burning questions\" have been answered, and one of those is in this series of anime. Unfortunately, this means with 22 episodes the show still feels \"incomplete\" in an unsatisfying way, knowing that more material is out there yet not adapted currently. If you're looking to watch this for a decent feeling of closure, I would probably not recommend this anime. Additionally, I felt like many of the characters that we meet outside of the club are very interesting and curious. However, we rarely interact with them past this. This is probably the main missed opportunity that was actually the shows fault, and not the result of a lack of source material.\\n\\n\r\nAll this being said, what this show lacks in satisfaction it makes up for in substance. This show is probably closest compared to popcorn: you can go through 22 whole episodes chowing down with great pleasure yet still feel hungry at the end. I actually had very similar vibes to the Monogatari series throughout, as their explanations were often supplemented by visually appealing and artistic representations of their theories to solve mysteries. Past this, most of the mysteries have good hints at what they're trying to go for. Some borderline on ridiculous, but often they gave you plenty of tools to allow someone to come to a similar answer. In fact, the only episode I can recall where they make a pretty large leap of logic is one episode where Houtarou is trying to prove that it's easy to make a crazy theory that seems plausible. The only mystery I felt was \"easy\" to solve wasn't in the main series, but actually the OVA (considered episode 11.5) which I'll write a review for out of sheer spite. Overall, the show doesn't seem to treat the viewer as \"dumb\" for not getting the answer, rather it presents each mystery as just working out the clues for a logical answer.\\n\\n\r\nWriting this all out, I've been going back and forth between a 7 or an 8 for an overall rating (I tend to like shows in general, so my bias is usually higher towards that range). Even with the unsatisfying abrupt ending, I think I'll stick with an 8 out of sheer reverence for what it does well for the mystery genre. So many seem to rely on gimmicks of information that they don't give you, and others try to rely on the shock value of a crime such as murder to keep you drawn in. Hyouka, in comparison, can give you an episode about writing a project for your semester which evolves into an enthralling 4-5 episode mystery about the history of a civil disobedience movement.",

That's all the anime needs to be a good story.  \r\nOff course, isn't just about it, have a little dose of comedy and a good romance.\r\nThe way certain scenes were directed enhance the work, for example when Chitanda and Houtarou met for the first time. The four mainly characters have their own charisma, and the relations between them are whats makes theanime works.\\n\r\nThe mysteries and how they are solved is very cool, the way then Houtarou arrives at his conclusions make the work something more intellectual than just a slice of life.\\n\r\nThe enjoyment walks slowly and this follow the story. \\n\r\nIt's a cool anime.\\n\r\nMy final note is 8 (7.8) and why is a \"low note\" for something I said so wel.........\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILERS ARRIVED!!!]l\\n\\n\r\nThe end is broaching. Sorry, this is the only word to describe what I feel about the end of Hoyuka. You watch all the anime and see how Houtarou is falling in love with Chitanda and the minimum you deserve is a declaration of love. And you see that, but it's just him dreaming and he chooses not to do this, Chitanda and Houtarou is the couple that I twisted the most to happen, it's absolutelly my favorite. The anime don't have a close end and if had probably should be my favorite romance and anime, but still a good work, so I recommend to watch",

(sorry just write like this, because i dont care about story)\r\nArt:\r\nKyoto Animation is always praised for it's good art and animation. Hyouka is by far one of the most beautiful animes I've ever seen. The characters design is designed so well and fit with their personality almost perfectly. The backgrounds were created with such detail that it felt like I was watching an anime movie instead of a tv show. Movements are also fluid and small details like the wind blowing the character's hair is alsogreatly done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the anime perfectly. From comedy to drama to the start of the mystery the soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and only brings more enjoyment to the viewer. The first and second openings are also great songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nNow the true reason this anime is so enjoyable is all about character.Oreki character very suited to my personality, the way he think, act, and feel incredibly real and just like what i feel and think. I also liked that they draw chacater very detailed. If i see this anime not about mystery, mystery just a tool, its not important. But hey, thats the point. This show is all about character. More and more we know about this character and personality, feel dragged inside oreki's world. Even with mystery genre, after about character this show tell us more about romance than mystery. This show have best romance for me, it took long and detailed progress for just realize it. not like 'hate then love' or 'love for stupid reason' like others, this show describe that feeling into much deeper and detailed progress of experience and understanding. So you now know why my profile picture is oreki. that showing identity of my character.\\n\\n\r\nI'll just say it right now. Hyouka is one of the best character depth animes for me. The mysteries are enjoyable and light. The character interaction was great.The animation phenomenal. Whats more there to say. I would definitely recommend this to people who love romance and mysteries. No, scratch that. If you like anime.Then definitely give this anime a try.\\n\r\nAnd remember, this show not about mystery, its all about character.",

            "content": "This was such a disappointment. Seriously, I had SUCH huge expectations about this anime and then...2 episodes in I was either yawning or twitching because of many reasons. \r\nI'll keep this review short, simple and spoiler free: my beef with Hyouka is all about the plot and a single character. \r\nLet's talk about the plot first: an apathetic student is good at solving useless mysteries. This poor dude is  unexplicably forced to show off his skills because a girl is \"curious\" about those mysteries and he can't resist her pretty face (and pushyness).\r\nThat same girl also asks him a favor, and I won't gointo details, but she asks something completely unreasonable (he's a teenager, not a policeman!) and personal. Let's not forget that this all happens in the first two episodes: they're basically strangers. She has no reason to trust him and his skills and he -someone who is CONSTANTLY saying that doesn't like to waste energy- doesn't really have a reason to say yes. \\n\\n\r\nSo, now I think it's kinda obvious which character irritated me so much: Chitanda. This useless, needy girl who's apparently incapable of solving the mysteries she likes so much by her own. During the first two episodes she bats her eyes, drags the dude around and keeps forcing him to observe clues and never gives two shits about what HE wants, even when he's vocal about it and clearly states that he's not fucking interested. \\n\r\nBy the way, these characters are all in a club. A LITERATURE CLUB. Not a \"let's play detectives!\" club. So her requests are even more preposterous and rude. Ugh.  \\n\\n\r\nI get it: she's supposed to be the one who makes him do something, since he's the main character, but that's not the way to go about it, at least in my opinion. \\n",

            "content": "Have you solved a mystery recently? Or create a theory? Then you're exactly like the Classics Club. \r\nWell...that sounds weird. But still. \r\nHyouka is an anime about mysteries. It follows the four teenagers that make up the Classics Club. A club that is not about classics. At all. The four of them solve mundane mysteries about life and school and family.\r\nPlot\r\nThe show is focused on short arcs that follow a larger mystery. It's mildly episodic, and the show doesn't follow a larger arc. (Unless you count the main point in time: the cultural festival.) The mysteries are highly dramatized. But they are interesting. Houtarou themain character of the show follows not many clues to figure it out. He uses good deduction skills and a heck of a lot of common sense. \\n\r\nThere are many filler episodes with one or two mini-mysteries in the episode. (For example, the doll episode at the end. Or the locked room mystery.)\\n\r\nMy favorite mystery was got to be the mystery about Hyouka. It's the first major mystery. And this contains my favorite scene. The \"I scream scene.\" It is the most bloodcurdling scene I've ever seen in my life. I shiver even thinking about it. But more on that later.\\n\r\nThere is also the mystery movie arc which is okay. It's interesting, and I actually figured it out. Haha.\\n\r\nThe other main arc is the cultural festival one. It goes across a lot of episodes. It's interesting, but without knowing \"The ABC Murders\", you really are left out.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of the plot is the awful ending. You're left with a cliffhanger and the hope for love. I want more. This show deserves a second season. We need more mysteries and romance! Chitanda x Houtarou! Mayaka x Satoshi!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters really drew me in. I liked the characters a lot. At first, they seemed bland, but you got really  invested in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nHoutarou Oreki is the main character. His motto is all about 'energy conservation'. Aka he's a lazy butt. But he's smart. I know a lot about lazy smart people. You really get interested in his life and how he solves things. He felt a bit shallow too. Which isn't a great characteristic. He's not my favorite character, but he's really interesting. \\n\r\nChitanda Eru is a curious fool. If we're following stereotypes, she's the manic pixie dream girl. She's hyper and adorable. She's curious about everything and a great cook. She's smart too, but Houtarou's genius seems to hide hers. She's smart too. (Top of her class.) I like her. But not a lot. I wanted more depth to her.\\n\r\nSatoshi Fukube is the happy go lucky database. He seems to be the roll with the punches sort of guy. But he's really complex. He feels likes he's hiding in the shadows. He doesn't want to care because he likes not caring. This makes him interesting. I really like his character. \\n\r\nIbara Mayaka is library assistant turned Classics Club member. She's pretty brash but can be calm. She likes Satoshi. For some reason. (We've never told why. The romance seems way too forced.) But she's tsundere AF. I think tsunderes are cute, so Mayaka is awesome to me. But she doesn't have enough screen time, so we don't feel a deep connection to her.\\n\\n\r\nThere are four people. You know what that means...romance!\\n\r\nThe Chitanda x Houtarou romance is adorable. But seemingly unnecessary.  As is both romances really. I do root for both of them. But Mayaka's reason for liking Satoshi is unknown. And we really get their emotions. One Valentine's Day episode isn't enough!\\n\\n\r\nOP\\n\r\nWow. This OP really seems to fit the show. The song and the art. The song is all about finding light which goes with the 'rose colored' lifestyle Houtarou seems to abhor. The colors appear as if ripples in a pond. Which works with the \"I'm Curious!\" thing. The ghostly images of Houtarou are really gorgeous. There's imagery within that. He seems like a ghost to everyone else. He's not really there and not really living. He's just passing through. \\n\r\nThe ED is cute and sweet like Chitanda and Mayaka. We get the female leads falling asleep. It seems more intimate. And feels like they're just being used for sex appeal. The song is cute, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP is a bit more upbeat than the last. Which could mean a change in Houtarou's emotions and outlook on life. He's becoming more happy and rose-colored. He's also seen through a glass. Which could mean he is still separated from the rest of the world and the Classics Club. Until Chitanda brings him through to reality.\\n\r\nThe second ED is so cute! I love the Sherlock analogy. It's upbeat, and we get all of the Classics Club members. What I think is weird is that the girls are the detectives, but the boys are the criminals. It seems better suited for Satoshi who is all coy and sly and cocky. But Houtarou seems annoyed with the situation more than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThese are good OPs and EDs.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is amazing. It's the best thing about this show. \\n\r\nIt's the style I like. It's more realistic. Reminds me of Nagi no Asukara. It seems normal on the outside. But certain scenes are gorgeous works of art. You see things in watercolors or with a certain supernatural lens.\\n\r\nBack to my favorite scene. The \"I Scream\" scene. It's Chitanda's uncle being turned into the scapegoat, the person who'll shoulder all the problems. He's the rabbit being bitten by the teachers. And the other students watch. This scene comes from the Hyouka arc where you figure out why it's called Hyouka and why the cover is so. The name thing was pretty easy for me, a native English speaker, to figure out. The rabbit scene is so heartwrenching. It's the most bloodcurdling scene ever. It sends shivers down my spine. I can't handle it. It's a gorgeous piece of work and imagery. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\nIt's not mystery that I love Hyouka. Hyuk hyuk hyuk.",

            "content": "This truly is a beautiful anime and is probably the best Slice of Life series I've seen up until this point. Its artwork especially with regards to certain scenes is phenomenal and like most other potential masterpieces they utilize music to accompany the series really well. The character designs are also top notch with most characters changing meaningfully by the time the series comes to an end. With that being said, there are slight problems that prevent it from being a true masterpiece. The series seems to skip several months at a time between episodes to show character interaction during special events which have themost impact to the relationships between the characters. This seems like a good strategy, but a lot of the time it leads to a lot of loose ends between main characters and side characters that may have been resolved during the timeskip, but there is no way to know for sure. On top of that, there are a lot of questionable relationships/interactions between characters like Houtarou's sister for example where they know someone and it impacts the story in a way but you don't know how they know them or why the interaction took place other than it led to an event in the story happening. The final problem with the series is that you just don't want it to end when it does. Wanting to watch a lot more of it can be viewed as a good thing, but I think it's slightly detrimental in this case. The series ended 6 years ago and the manga isn't in production anymore, so that means that the series is pretty much over at this point. If a series is over, you don't want the viewer to have a sense of longing to watch more of it because that means they weren't really satisfied with some of the outcomes. In this case, I would say the unsatisfactory part is probably the romance factor in the show. Throughout the series, multiple potential relationships were developed and seemed to progress albeit at a really slow rate, but by the end of the series, it seems like almost no progress has been made in any of them and they are at the same stages where they were towards the beginning of the show. It just kind of leaves the viewer wanting more and honestly I wish that they would release an OVA showing the characters years later wrapping up this aspect of anime. This series really is a potential masterpiece, but it's just plagued by loose ends concerning character interactions, conflicts, and relationships that slightly hold it back. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: Just found out the manga has started up production again. Hopefully that leads to the resolution of my final problem with the series not wanting it to end, but even so I still feel like the series is a 9 considering its other problems.",

It will send your mind to their world to be a member of their club to see them in solving the mysteries. \r\nThe characters are well developed. Story is a masterpiece. Art is great and of courseit's enjoyment. The author is a legend in making this amazing work of art. \\n\\n\r\nToo bad there's no continuation.

            "content": "\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059(kininarimasu)! If you intend to watch hyouka, be prepared to watch a series littered with its favorite catchphrase: kininarimasu! Every single episode has it at least once, such that it has begun to irk me as much as it irks the mc, Oreki. Are you curious about what the phrase means? Hints to the answer can be found written twice in this review. Once in the sentence before the previous and the other in the third paragraph\u2026 Let\u2019s see if you can deduce the answer!\r\nStory:\r\nHyouka is about a classics club consisting of 4 friends who don\u2019t partake in club activities (what does a classic clubdo anyway?) but solve mysteries. And by mysteries, I don\u2019t really mean crime-related issues but the mysteries you can find as a typical high school student. That is not to say the plot isn\u2019t interesting, but I can relate to those who drop the series out of boredom. Hyouka doesn\u2019t engage the viewer much (at least not for me), the viewer is going to have to engage himself/herself. Confused? By engaging yourself, I mean trying to solve the mystery presented before the answer is shown at the end. Each mystery will present you all the necessary jigsaw pieces and in a test of your logical reasoning, challenge yourself to see if you can complete the puzzle before the solution is given. It\u2019s quite fun. There is a certain feeling of satisfaction when you deduce the correct answer, especially when you are ahead of Oreki. Give it a try!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main characters of hyouka are pretty decently explored, save for Ibara. Her character isn\u2019t really expressed as well as the others. After 22 episodes, all I remember of her is that she likes satoshi, kinda dislikes Oreki and reads manga. She just doesn\u2019t really stand out among the others. Oreki is the lazy, unmotivated mc with the sharpest mind among the four. He is responsible for solving the mysteries. Basically, the brains of the group with an interesting motto: \u201cIf I don\u2019t have to do it, I wont. If I have to, make it quick.\u201d Satoshi is the walking database of trivia of the group. He knows a lot, but cant really put the knowledge to good use. There will be interesting drama between him and Oreki later on, with an inferiority complex involved. Chitanda is the well-mannered and bubbly girl whose motto is \u201cI am curious!\u201d She drags Oreki from his comfortable cave of reclusiveness to solve the mysteries that piques her interest. She is the driving force of character development of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\r\nThe visuals were pretty decent, especially the cherry blossom scene of the last episode. Simply stunning. As for sound, nothing really struck me as unique enough to latch itself in my memory,  its decent but not anything special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the show. Solving mysteries is the very core of the series, so if you don\u2019t enjoy wracking your brain for a solution to a question, then don\u2019t bother with hyouka. You\u2019d probably be bored with the slice-of-life premise. But if you are the kind that enjoys the occasional brain teaser, pick up hyouka. Its pretty decent. Flaws of the show would probably be its slow pace and some flaws in Oreki\u2019s logic. Other than that, enjoy playing Sherlock Holmes!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nHyouka is a pretty decent series for wannabe detectives. If you fancy yourself a sharp and rational thinker, test your claim against hyouka's mysteries. All the clues have already been found for you, all that\u2019s left is to piece them together. If not, steer clear of this series. Without its mysteries, it\u2019s utter boredom. Hyouka is not for the thrill-seekers and adventurers. Only enter is you believe yourself patient and rational. Adrenaline junkies you have been warned\u2026\\n\\n\r\nNote:  Kininarimasu is the driving force of the plot. Without it, hyouka wouldn\u2019t exist. The phrase literally means: I am curious! If you managed to deduce it, good job. Now try your hand at hyouka's mysteries. I promise you that they are much more interesting and challenging.\\n",

            "content": "I will start by saying that it's a real shame that people write this anime off as disappointing because the mystery element of the series was not enough to satisfy their expectations. This is actually hinted in the show, where it is said that for the average guy with not much genre knowledge, Horror is usually lumped together with Mystery, when in this case they are very apart. Many have arrived at this anime under the assumption that it is strict-mystery (kind of like Sherlock or Death Note or similar works), when Hyouka is mainly a Slice-of-Life anime show which uses mundane mysteries as ameans to make the characters interact and develop in a distinctive way. There's also the element of comedy present in the story as well as a tiny bit of romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the main protagonist, Oreki Houtarou, and it is told from his seemingly gray and dull perspective, so we can see his inner thoughts along with the flow of the episodes. In the first episode, we see his situation is changed by the arrival of a letter sent by his sister, Tomoe, which tells him to join the Classics Club in his high school so that it won't be abolished because of a lack of members, and the fact that he joins a club greatly surprises his closest friend, Satoshi. In this club, he meets Chitanda Eru, a girl who acts as the driving force that puts Oreki in a variety of situations that involve different mysteries (which are for the most part very mundane).\\n\\n\r\nThe story is structured in three longer arcs which are adapted from the first three volumes of the novel (which is the source material) with some side stories here and there, which are adapted from the 4th volume (and one of them from the 6th). As most adaptations, this anime has some little script issues because of the time constraints but in the end it works out well. For most of the mysteries, the clues used to solve them are subtly shown so we can see that the reasonings made from them and the conclusions are not being pulled out of nowhere. The initially light-hearted atmosphere established in the beginning turns into something more serious and more dramatic as we get deeper into the longer arcs, which provides us with some necessary contrast that prevents the show from becoming boring. This change, however, brings with it some exaggerations or over-dramatizations, which are not done all that badly, but that still stand out given that the show is very well crafted overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe place where Hyouka falls a little bit short would be the mysteries themselves. While this is not my personal opinion, one could say some of them are just boring because they feel trivial and are more akin to a simple question than the notion of a mystery and they are not deep enough to really feel engaging and get you hooked. None of the mysteries are what I'd call bad, though, you just need to know how to give value to the ordinary. I think it's very positive that the show's mysteries focus more on the reasons and motivations behind them than in how they happened. One could also say that the ending was a bit of a shortcoming as well, but that is because Hyouka is not a finished work as of yet. The strong point of the anime is definitely its characters and the relationships between them (particularly the relationships between Oreki and the others), which are captivating and realistic, and it is where the show greatly compensates for its shortcomings. There is also no infallible mystery solver in the show (except perhaps Tomoe, but nobody really knows since she's shown to be capable but very mysterious as well), which makes you feel somewhat included in the mystery solving process rather than making you feel like a spectator of an unrealistic detective.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the cast is one of the things that shines the most about this show and it is what truly makes it unique. The four main characters seem to have very distinct and defined personalities and specific roles in the club: Chitanda is usually the one that incited the mystery due to her innocence and curiosity, Satoshi and Mayaka provide information and different points of view and Oreki takes the information together and wraps up by making deductions. However, while the show advances, the characters break this seemingly formulaic structure and do things that would be usually considered unlike them, such as Oreki being the one that is curious and instigating a mystery or Satoshi trying to solve a mystery himself.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of time, the characters develop through the various incidents that happen in the story. Most of the development is shown in Oreki. At the start he doesn't want to do anything that isn't absolutely necessary, which causes him to search for the quickest method to satisfy Chitanda's requests and to try to avoid them if he can because he thinks they're just troublesome, but as a result of the time he spends with the Classics Club (among other things) he starts to realize that maybe getting involved in these situations might not be all that bad after all. Later on, he even acts of his own accord without the need for others to get him to act, and of course, for someone so focused on saving energy to start doing that, it's obvious that those close to him would notice the change in the way he behaves. Other characters go through their own changes as well, like Satoshi, who can't help getting a bit obsessive about mystery solving at one point in the story and starts feeling like he's more of a Watson than a Sherlock and that he's in Oreki's shadow, so he starts feeling inferior and jealous, which is a big contrast to his usual happy and carefree self that is even used for comic relief earlier in the story; and Mayaka, who gets more screentime later on, in which her place in the Manga Society and her relationships with its different members are shown to instill change in her. That being said, Chitanda actually doesn't change all that much throughout the plot of the anime, but I wouldn't say she really needs to, since she serves as foil for Oreki.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound in Hyouka are absolutely outstanding. It is KyoAni after all. The atmosphere of the show is very well set by the use of colors, lighting and shading and different camera angles. The use of subtlety and symbolism makes it so that every time you watch you can find out something you didn't notice in your last watch; this show has a lot more to tell than it would initially seem and one can really see its depth when one knows how to analyze and read into things. The quality of the animation and the designs truly make you feel like the characters are alive. Some scenes are just visually stunning, and a particular example of something I enjoyed a lot would be the scene when Chitanda's hair seems to grow and trap Oreki to show how he's captivated or even bewitched by her, which is rather abstract and dream-like; this contrasts well with the scene earlier in the same episode when Oreki meets Chitanda for the first time, which is one of my favourite first time meeting scenes of all time, it's just wonderfully done. What stands out the most is the attention to detail that KyoAni put in the anime, like the subtle hints that are shown for the mysteries or the small, yet important body language such as eye contact, facial expressions and movement of the characters, including secondary ones like the class 2-F students and even those you could call irrelevant background characters are well done and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka's soundtrack fits the show perfectly, boasting with different tunes ranging from bright classical music pieces to dark and intriguing melodies that boost the sense of mystery, make the designs and animation shine and stress the different emotions shown throughout the whole show. When the soundtrack is heard, be it in a tense, solemn or light-hearted moment, it is never out of place.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka is an anime that shows you how one can find value in the mundane and the ordinary, and it is one of the most enjoyable shows I've come across, so much so that I binged it and even read the novels, all of them (which I highly recommend).\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a fresh, well made series, I can assure you that Hyouka is worth and deserves your attention.",

            "content": "Hyouka is an anime that features mystery with a tad bit of romance and comedy plus a good deal of slice of life. I myself, watch and read enough mysteries to say that Hyouka is one of the best mystery anime you can come across to. But, unlike the usual mystery stuff, Hyouka is unique and definitely better than most mystery anime ( I actually consider it the best mystery anime ) and to explain that i have to expose, of course a little spoilers to get my points understood.\r\nStory\r\nFirst of all, the usual anime mysteries will involve murders, thefts, kidnappings, etc and Hyouka isclearly not one of those, that is why this anime will disappoint you if you come looking for those plots. Although you shouldn't be too quick to judge it, because it is certainly amusing in many different ways. For example: most detective stories focuses on main character as detectives on gathering clues  about the ongoing mystery enthusiastically as possible , but in Hyouka's case the MC(Oreki Houtaro) is a lazy bum that will avoid any unnecessary actions that will put efforts and waste his so called \"energy reserves\" and on top of that, if he does investigate he doesn't come looking for clues rather, the clues goes to him with the help of his club mates known as Classic's Club and sometimes unexpected lucks.\\n\\n\r\nHyouka moves on with the story because of the adventurous heroine that keeps dragging the lazy mc into mysteries she can't unravel herself. There are some parts that features a heavy slice of life feel, you should look forward to it. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound Effects\\n\\n\r\nI am speechless on how the animation and sound effects are greatly compatible with the anime itself. There is only one flaw i see in art which is the character design of Ibara Mayaka and Fukube Satoshi. For me both have the same face patterns.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Sound Effects, i don't see any flaw not even slight mistakes that would degrade the anime. Both openings and endings are great music that you will find relaxing to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the character development is the poorest category of the anime but certainly not bad. There are times where the characters overreact to situations and gives off an unusual behavior that most people will find weird or inappropriate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Hyouka's uniqueness, bit of romance, funny moments, relaxing atmosphere yet sometimes full of exciting adventures/mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nI will rate this anime as 9/10. Definitely an anime you should watch.",

            "content": "Hyouka, which for some reason is translated as \"You Can't escape\" as the english title on this website, is about a High School freshmen by the name of Oreki Houtarou, who is a genius when it comes to solving problems and mysteries and such. Its a basic there is a problem so lets solve it kind of deal. \r\nStory: 7\r\nNow the story of this anime isnt as grand and amazing as others but there are times where the story feels compelling such as the first arc and the school festival arc. The rest of the arcs are just random things like why did Chitanda getmad at the teacher or who stole the cookie from the cookie jar (No, this was not one of them it was just a joke among my friends). But overall i think it averages out to maybe about a 7 as a score for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nITS KYOANI BABY!\\n\r\nSame animators as K-On and Clannad, everyone knows of KyoAni's amazing animation works so not much is needed to be said here. ITS SO DAMN SHINNY!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nOne thing that i really liked about this anime was the sound, the music, the OST. Because this is a mystery solving anime, they find the most perfect type of music to go with it. What i mean is when it's mystery solving time, they would play a song that accompanies the character as they attempt to go at solving the mystery. It is hard to put it in words or i am just simply bad at expressing it. Lets just go with that the music fits the moment really well and most of the OST of this anime is seriously really peaceful and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nNow this!! THISSSSS is where i think this show shines the most, other than the animation being incredibly shiny already. The character development is just simply amazing, this is the sole thing that got me seriously hooked on this show. The changes you see from Houtarou or seeing how Satoshi really feels about everything around him is seriously really interesting and i really liked it.\\n\\n\r\nHoutarou started as a person who did not give a damn about anything and would not put in any effort into anything and his motto was to put as less effort into anything as possible and he ended up actually doing a lot more than he would've before meeting Chitanda and what not. Watching him chance slowly was satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5\\n\r\nI would say this anime was really enjoyable to watch, especially if you like to watch characters slowly develop, emphasis on slowly. But i do wish that there was a little more hint of romance in it for i love romance in all anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nDefinitely pick up this anime if you want something that is relaxing and has great character development.\\n\\n\r\nWATASHI KINNINARIMASU!!!!!",

About this anime, it has some good points, music, directing and the art style is outstanding but the biggest problem is the its story. On ep 4-5 they manage to pull it up but after that what's next. It felt like the story is finish on that point but whatever the story continuous. As for myself, ican't pin point the ending as of now but i think kyoani is trying to prove something it this adaptation. For now i will watch this till the end and see on it.",

Joining a club and uncovering secrets seems a rather fun activity and it was interesting to watch 4 people with very different characters put their minds together to solve something and in the end, Oreki would just come up with the result and stunt everyone.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art in the first episode got me hooked right away on this anime.\r\nSound: \r\nFirst opening was bad in my opinion, the second was ok, the animation was great but the song was meh.\r\nCharacters:\r\nSo much difference in all of the characters, and honestly I can say this is myfavorite anime as far as character personalities goes. They all have different personalities that would generally not come together in a group. Taking our two protagonists, Chitanda and Oreki. One is hyperactive (Chi-chan) while the other is just lazy and unwilling to do anything(Oreki). \\n\\n\r\nMy Thoughts:\\n\r\nThis anime is worth watching that's for sure, there is a lack of Romance for my taste, but I still enjoyed it fully. The way Oreki thinks has fascinated me and I can say I loved this anime. The only bad thing about it is this tension that you get from the characters getting closer to each other and than, nothing happens.\\n\r\nFor a more detailed review(with spoilers) check out my blog post on my profile.\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "Hyouka was an anime that I had heard opinions from opposite ends of the spectrum. Some people loved it and praised it as a masterpiece while others said they dropped it a few episodes in due to a lack of overall story. Unlike my friends who were polarized about the anime, I found it to be entertaining and well worth watching - albeit not a masterpiece.\r\n{STORY} - Ultimately the lack of an overarching story was my biggest frustration with Hyouka. There was no real linear progression of story between much of the anime other than references back to things that had previously happened. In a22 episode anime, there was like 5 different mini-arcs that really could have happened in almost any order. With that said, the anime was a true slice-of-life anime in the sense that you really felt like the anime gave a window into a true daily life scenario of a group of friends who were entertained with ordinary mysteries. \\n\\n\r\n{Art} - Art was quite excellent through the anime but really came to the forefront in the final episode. Beautiful colors and excellent animation of the characters' eyes in particular really makes the art stick out as a feature of Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\n{Sound} - The music choices in Hyouka were superb. The mixture of famous classical pieces along with their mysterious interlude pieces really helped the flow of episodes and will stick with the viewer for a long time. \\n\\n\r\n{Characters} - Character development was very good throughout the anime. Over a 22 episode anime there are very noticeable changes in the characters as well as the relationships between characters. Unlike some anime that rush relationships and force character development, Hyouka was very natural and never felt like it was being rushed. \\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment} - Overall the enjoyment was very good. Every episode brought an entertaining mystery and character development that kept you glued to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n{Overall} - Overall I gave this anime an 8/10. The lack of a true overarching story or theme dropped it from a 9/10 for me. While it did fit the slice-of-life theme excellently and it could be argued that it was the natural development of a group of friends that was the over-arching story, it just felt like it could have been better served with a mystery that lasted from episode 1 and was solved in episode 22 and was slowly unpacked over the entire anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Not intended to spoil the fun for others.\r\nFor detailed review, please visit: https://theidlerinrapture.wordpress.com/2016/04/18/hyouka/\r\n\u201cHyouka\u201d is an anime that marginally melts the features of simple mysteries in the deeper layers of dramatic high school lives. If it was only about the drama, I would have dropped it out of boredom. Because too much of anything makes everything seem very much unnatural. That goes with the mystery too. If it was only dealing with murders or thefts or any vulgar crimes, then it could have easily been classified under a common heading and I wouldn\u2019t have come acrossit so soon. But to my surprise, it wasn\u2019t any of that. \u201cHyouka\u201d beautifully portrays the mysteries in the backdrop of normal and natural high school incidents, something any average school-goer could relate to with their own small experiences. That is what differentiates this anime from normal mystery productions. It\u2019s not about the complexities of the mysteries itself. Sometimes they are so trivial, that you would have hardly stopped to ponder over them had it not been taken to your focus. And, that, in my opinion, the best thing about it. \u201cHyouka\u201d never tried for once, to create another Holmes or Christie. It just continued to elaborate some random details of school; finding mysteries of its own, and trying to solve that; and that too, without the perfection of Conan Doyle or Agatha. There are no real murders or complex puzzles here. The best that you could expect is the daily mysteries that we normally overlook in our own lives. That is something that definitely impressed me, the ideas.",

            "content": "***TL;DR VERSION AT THE END OF THE REVIEW***\r\nThere are many different factors that make something great, and Hyouka's strength isn't the story. Hyouka isn't for everyone; if you're looking for something with a solid, engaging plot, search elsewhere. If you're looking for something a little more unusual, you might want to give it a try. Hyouka is definitely unique. It doesn't try to be overly bold and exciting; the show's pacing is relaxed and will subtly pique your interest. Nothing is excessive in Hyouka, which is something that makes it interesting. Hyouka's strength isn't the story or characters; its strengh is the way it's executed.\r\nStory(6/10)- The story is average at best and is the weakest part of Hyouka. There isn't anything out of the ordinary here. The setting is an average Japanese high school, and most of the events that occur could very well happen in real life. Though interesting things can happen in real life as well, the events that go on in Hyouka are ordinary. When you take every other factor away and look at the story itself, nothing stands out. Think, would the things that happen in Hyouka be as interesting if they were executed in a different way? They would definitely become boring if the execution was poor. Overall, Hyouka's weakest point is definitely its plot. If you're looking for something with a strong storyline, HYOUKA IS NOT FOR YOU.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)- I think anyone who has seen the art will understand that it's absolutely gorgeous. I very rarely use this word, but I would consider Hyouka's artwork to be flawless. I don't recall seeing ANY mistakes or errors when watching the show, the art style suits the characters, and it matches the overall mood of the show. There's not much else I can say; Hyouka's art is definitely one of the best jobs I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)- The sound is very good. It's not perfect, but it comes close. Personally, none of the individual tracks were very memorable for me, but I DO remember that the music made the ordinary events in Hyouka exciting. The music tied everything together and even added suspense to something that would normally not be exciting at all. The openings and endings weren't anything special to me, but if I had to choose a favorite, I would probably choose the second ending. I think it suits the series well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)- Hyouka's characters are definitely one of its strengths. One of the things I like about them is that you can see them grow as the story progresses. Each one has their own problems, which makes them relatable; all the characters are realistically human, which makes them great. Oreki changes so much during the course of the show; he slowly gets pulled into Chitanda's world, and eventually discovers that he actually doesn't mind using energy once in a while. Chitanda, to me, is one of the more interesting characters. Though at first she seems static, even she eventually changes and deals with problems of her own. Personally, I think Fukube is the most interesting character. He has a lot of depth. At first, he comes off as someone who is cheerful, but he is actually quite dark. He struggles with himself, but, towards the end of the story, finally sorts out his problems. Finally, Mayaka also has problems to deal with. She has a lot of strengh, especially when she stayed friends with Fukube after he rejected her in middle school. Overall, the characters are one of Hyouka's strengths and make the show interesting.\\n\\n\r\nExecution (10/10)- Though MAL doesn't have a specific section for execution, I think it's a very important category to consider, so in my future reviews, I will add it. Execution is what makes Hyouka watchable. If the execution was done poorly, Hyouka would be a failure of a show. I can say with confidence that execution is Hyouka's strongest point. Without it, the events that occur would be dull. The events in Hyouka are the very definition of ordinary. At one point, Oreki even investigated why Chitanda would get angry at certain things. This sounds boring, doesn't it? But, because of the execution, this scene was actually interesting. What makes these scenes interesting is how Oreki analyzes things, how Chitanda always becomes curious about things, how Fukube rattles off details, and how Mayaka keeps a level head. All of these things make Hyouka interesting and even suspenseful at times. The pacing is also perfect; it's not too fast but not too slow. There is some romance, but none of it is tasteless fanservice; the romance in Hyouka is mostly pure and innocent, which suits the mood and enhances it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)- I personally gave Hyouka an 8/10, but I can't really review my enjoyment since it's my own opinion.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR VERSION:\\n\r\nStory- 6/10\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\r\nSound- 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10\\n\r\nExecution- 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n---Execution is wonderful\\n\r\n---Art is flawless\\n\r\n---Unique; something you wouldn't find every day\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n---Story is mediocre\\n\r\n---Will only interest a certain audience\\n\r\n---Not for everyone\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hyouka isn't the best, but it's unique and artistic. If you want to try something that strays from the normal path, Hyouka might be a good anime to watch. The story isn't great, but everything else ties together nicely to create an interesting slice-of-life anime.",
