            "content": "Kiznaiver is so stylish and colourful that it is almost blinding. But behind Trigger's beautiful visuals, there just isn't a whole lot else besides an extraordinarily average, if somewhat enjoyable anime-- one that is certainly a noticeable step down from their previous work, Kill la Kill.\r\nThis should not be taken as an insinuation that all Kiznaiver has to offer is style without substance. There is value here, and Trigger has evidently tried to capitalise upon some of Kill la Kill's prior successes, particularly with regards to its characters. Kiznaiver tries-- it tries ever so hard-- but in the end crumbles under its own ambition. Itis an excellent premise that unfortunately never really finds its footing. Were it a full two-cours of content rather than the mere twelve episodes it actually is, the result might have been different.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver's characters are likely the first thing to catch one's attention. They are rich with personality, visually distinct from other characters in anime. There is no one that feels particularly bland (aside from maybe Sonozaki), but a number of them never go much beyond simply looking cool or being weird. Nico is a cute airhead suffering from a variety of mental illnesses (and quite possibly low IQ), while Yoshihara is an extreme masochist who orgasms at the very idea of pain, and exists largely as fuel for shounen-ai fanfiction and doujinshi. The protagonist, Katsuhira, is also a mopey emo kid who lets people beat him up without a care. This is about all that characterises them for the entire show. They are as one-dimensional as can be. It is bit of a waste, given how unique their character designs are. (And I do not only say that because I like twintailed girls named Nico.)\\n\\n\r\nSome characters are more compelling than others. Tenga's dialogue in the original Japanese, for example, is fairly natural and feels like something that could come from an actual teenager's mouth. Chidori, as annoying as her scream-fests tend to be, is also pretty representative of how the average teenage girl handles their emotions. The writers of Kiznaiver know what they are doing and are capable of doing it well, but the problem is that the short episode count prevents these characters from ever realising their full potential. It throws a lot at the viewer, but never gives them time to digest it or room for the characters to breathe and relax. It is, almost invariably, the quiet moments that stand out the most in a story. There are no quiet moments in Kiznaiver.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose it makes sense for something like Kiznaiver to be as short as it is, as Trigger puts a great deal of work and effort into each episode. It obviously shows. But that still does not excuse them creating a story and a cast of characters bigger than they could handle within the allotted time. For something like this, a more briskly-paced movie, perhaps a duology, would have been a better way to compress the story without sacrificing visual quality. But I suppose a movie or two doesn't make quite as much money as five or six over-priced BluRays would. Anime is expensive to make, and Trigger needs to pay its animators so they can eat and have a roof over their head. I get it, but it is still a bit disappointing to see business prioritised over artistic quality in this case. If Trigger saved up extra money for a year or two through smaller projects, and used that to fund an extra cour of Kiznaiver, we would undoubtedly have had a much more exciting product.\\n\\n\r\nSome aspects of Kiznaiver, however, are less the result of its short episode count, and more related to lacklustre writing. Most of Kiznaiver's drama involves angsty, spoiled teenagers overreacting. Being rejected by someone you like is a sucky thing, there is no doubt about that, but it is not the end of the world like Kiznaiver tries to paint it. There are things far worse going on out there, and yet they're traumatised because someone they had a crush on couldn't reciprocate those feelings? Big deal. Give it a couple months and it will barely even cross their mind again. It would be one thing if these feelings were long-term, but for everyone excluding Chidori, they have had these crushes for a few weeks, tops. \\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver tries to create an absurdly complex set of romances. Every character is attracted to someone else, and often the one they love is interested in someone else entirely. With eight main characters and only twelve episodes, you can have a pretty good guess of how well these romances are handled. They get angry, scream and beat each other up when they find out the one they love is being treated poorly by one of the other Kiznaivers, only for another person to get upset in return, and another and another, it raining and dramatic music blasting all the while like the world is on fire and ready to explode. It is extremely difficult to care about their feelings for one another when most of these feelings (particularly surrounding Tenga) have been seldom explored and revealed only one episode beforehand, without so much as an explanation-- or heck, even a hint-- for why they like each other in the first place. Considering the experiment within the show is also manipulating these characters' feelings, the romance doesn't just feel lacklustre-- it feels artificial. Chidori and Katsuhira are about the only couple that make any sense. Everything else is just a big mess that the show could and should have done without.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also quite silly and cloying how emotional 'pain' is shared and hurts them all as well. One of the Kiznaivers is heart-broken, so, hey, that means everyone else must succumb to the feels and suffer from heart-break, too, because emotion is equivalent to physical pain and not at all psychological, or something. There are other scenes, like Chidori confessing to Katsuhira in the middle of a storm (weather in anime being the convenient device that it is), or Yuta and the rest screaming at the top of their lungs and jumping into the river (because that's how you deal with your anger?), that make it quite clear that Kiznaiver is not all too interested in appealing to adults. I can totally understand why someone who is around fourteen-years-old may enjoy and empathise with that sort of thing, but being twenty-three myself, it doesn't warrant much more than a sigh and some head-shaking. For how believable Tenga's and Chidori's characterisation can be, it is a bit disappointing to see the show stray so heavily into melodrama territory. At least Kill la Kill was aware of how blatantly over-the-top it was; Kiznaiver takes itself seriously all the time, and it wants you to take it seriously, too. It forgets how to have fun with itself, and that is perhaps the most disappointing thing of all. \\n\\n\r\nI'll still give Kiznaiver credit for trying. Most of these issues could be resolved simply by the show having more episodes to develop its characters and their feelings in a more meaningful way. It would still not be an anime without significant flaws, as the copious amounts of melodrama make clear, but there certainly was the potential to, if not match Kill la Kill, at least come close to its quality. Kiznaiver looks and sounds so nice that it is easy to forgive some of its issues and enjoy the ride regardless, but, in reflection, there just is not much else to praise aside from that. I really, truly wanted to give Trigger's big new project a glowing review, but I just can't do it. It's not there, and it never gets there. \\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, not everyone is looking for the next greatest thing. Having charm and style alone can please most people, and merely being a standout title within its respective season is enough to warrant a viewing. And, you know, that's perfectly fine. I wouldn't hesitate to give Kiznaiver a recommendation if all the person wants is a few hours of fun and something a little bit different. Because, make no mistake, Kiznaiver is not a bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just an immensely disappointing one.",

Have you ever had an original thought? What if, despite your thought that your idea was original, someone across the globe, someone with whom you have never and will never have contact with had your same idea and yet, weren't able toact on it. Is it still original?\\n\\n\r\nNo matter your definition of original- Trigger continues to pump out quality writing and both new, heretofore unseen content, and new ways of presenting old ideas. This season, they pulled the trigger on a double barrel shotgun of new for the anime viewing populace with the zany Space Patrol Luluco, and the much more subdued Kiznaiver- and what a season it's been.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is what I would describe as a new twist on an old classic. One of the interwoven themes is referenced in both my opening and ending quotes- the power of friendship. Had Trigger just stopped there, they would have produced a trite, unimaginative, and unfulfilling series much like those that crop up each season. Kiznaiver is not content to merely focus on the power that friends hold over you, but also delve into deeper concepts of pain and loss, the stages of grievance, and the ties that bind.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the multifaceted Kill La Kill before it, Kiznaiver tackles these themes with depth and sophistication. Conversations that outwardly appear to be simple exchanges between friends often reveal much more about the characters and their mentalities. The characters themselves also outwardly seem to represent the kind of one note stereotype- Katsuhira the unfeeling, dull, mophaired main character. Chidori the tsun tsun. Nico the genki girl, etc. However simply the characters are presented in the beginning, throughout the course of the show, we watch them grow as people, friends, and characters. In the early episodes, we see the group forced together as part of some sick social experiement- a disparate group of persons from different cliques, if you will, thrown together and told to \"become friends\" (whether through traumatic shared experiences, which has been proven to form bonds between people who might not otherwise associate- such as in fraternity hazing, gang initiation, etc. or the typical socialization process that people go through.) \\n\\n\r\nWe get to know the person of the characters, what drives them, their insecurities, wishes, and failures. Each has their turn in the spotlight, and as the viewer, I felt like most of these characters, even though many had larger than life personalities, could have been real people. They don't have superpowers. They aren't infallible, neither are they perfect. They don't win every time, and the certainly don't all get along perfectly, kiss and make up after every little thing. Like real friends with disparate interests, they get on each other's nerves, hurt each other (in more ways than one) fall in love, fall out, make each other cry, and experience life together. Trigger, in all their savviness, also recognized the potential for relationships in the show, and makes moves for different character romances to happen, fall apart, and change. It's not your typical ensemble where the bland, self insert protagonist has color coded dereotype ladies throwing themselves at him for no reason. No, Kiznaiver takes a more nuanced approach, and the characters have viable, believable reasons (some are not pretty, just like life) for being interested in each other like mutual interests, pure pity, opposites attracting, and finding kinship. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the show takes a backseat to characterization in what's known as a \"character driven story\", which is also something of a rarity in anime these days. It's not all about some grand scheme or hero's journey, but about the interaction of the characters themselves that matter. As mentioned above, I think that the characters experience the five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) throughout the show, as a theme. As part of the Kizna experiment (linking people through sharing pain), these kids in the story, through their own relationships and getting to know themselves and the people around them, experience these stages as part of their characterization. Each is in denial over some reason or another, whether it's \"how could my friend have died?\" or \"this person loves me, they just don't know it\", etc. This progresses as the story heats up- they're angry over their inner demons, and it spills out onto each other- until the voices of reason, Hisomu and Nico bring them all to their senses (bargaining). After the climax of the show, they all decidedly experience a strong depressive episode, where the characters decide what they're going to do with themselves, and about each other- having made themselves vulnerable and revealing their secrets to each other. Eventually they come to accept each other, and the story takes its final twist, which would be criminal of me to reveal. Suffice to say, it's certainly worth watching to find out. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Kiznaiver is also excellent, with the flair Trigger has for small details, and making their characters look fresh and interesting. There are a lot of stylings of Little Witch Academia, especially the hair, but still very within the modern style. It's crisp, clean, and flows well, but the lighting is really something. Reflections, eyes, and anything lit look really great, drawing attention to details and adding depth to the shot composition. I applaud the casting director at Trigger, whoever they are- for they have done it again. Similarly to Kill La Kill, Kiznaiver is impeccably cast. The nuance and emotion (or required lack thereof) that was put into the performances really sells the drama and characters. The larger than life Tenga, fragile Maki, zany Nico, wacky Hisomu, hot and cold Chidori, stiff Katsuhira, and mysterious Noriko (and some nice performances from the supporting cast as well) all add up to a very well produced product. \\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr for my lazy folk\\n\\n\r\n+ great characterization\\n\r\n+ fantastic art\\n\r\n+ a human drama, one that you can get behind, that doesn't descend in to pointless melodrama\\n\r\n+/- your favorite characters might not get together\\n\\n\\n\r\nFriends are soy sauce!

            "content": "Forced drama, what does it entail? Is it the act of searching for genuine emotion in a place that never offered it? Is it not understanding the limitations of your screenplay? Perhaps it comes from honest attempts to create something organic. Whatever the reason may be, when it happens, it doesn't leave a good aftertaste. \r\nSo which is it for Kiznaiver? Is it truly trying to craft something memorable? Is it seeking poignancy in the anguish of others? Is it studio Trigger trying to branch out into unfamiliar territory; a leap of faith, hoping their dedicated followers would comfort them when they fall on theirfaces? And really, should I care, even if they did attempt something out of a place of honest effort? Well, short answer, fuck no. \\n\r\nI don't need to babysit a half-baked effort. I don't need to try to empathize with a failed project that slipped out of the creators' hands. As harsh as that mentality may be, it's the honest truth. I'm the consumer. The only thing required of me is to be entertained and engrossed by the project they put forward. And guess what? I wasn't. In fact, I was mentally drained by this synthetic try-hard and its relentless efforts to pull at my heartstrings; operating with as much subtlety as a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade trying to sneak down Central Park West. A good concept doesn't make a good anime and Kiznaiver embodies that very notion. The message it chose to convey was fine, but the way it went about delivering it was the problem.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sickeningly idealistic attempt to bring forth \"world peace\" and a greater level of understanding among humanity, the Kiznaiver project was created to combine the shared pain of its placeholders by linking their sensory output together. The more these placeholders are made to open up to each other, the deeper their connection becomes; experiencing everything from the surface-level physical pain, to more emotional-based pain, as the walls that separate them dissipates. \\n\\n\r\nIf the premise wasn't made explicit enough already, it's essentially one big character study and self-examination of human relationships. And it should go without saying, but whenever topics like these are made your primary focus, there are some prerequisites expected of it in order for it to function with any semblance of validity. You can't go swimming without a pool of water, and in the same light, you can't have a character study without characters. Notice I wrote \"characters\" NOT \"caricatures,\" a distinction that Kiznaiver can't seem to make. \\n\\n\r\nIf Kiznaiver had an extended title, it would go something along the lines of:\\n\r\n\"Kiznaiver: Forcing Archetypes to have Da Feels\" \\n\\n\r\nThese color-coordinated caricatures are so cookie-cutter by storytelling standards that you could sum them all up with one-liners. They're basically human smurfs, each feeding into pre-assigned roles with little in the way of diversifying their default archetypes. Instead of swimming in a pool of water, Kiznaiver attempts to achieve the same feat with a pit full of dirt. A task that's not only nigh impossible but also painful to watch play out as well. Archetypes are meant to serve as default personalities to further build upon. To simply present them as is without building on who they are as characters is not only conceited, it's borderline delusional when taking into consideration the importance that the characters hold in the confines of this material. This isn't an action adventure where the world being trekked is the star attraction, it's a character study, a CHARACTER study. If there's one aspect of your screenplay that you want to shine the most, it's in this department. And yet, redhead tsunderes are pre-packaged in this anime in the same way every live-action movie and TV drama depiction of high school has the popular blonde cheerleader and varsity-jacket-wearing jock. \\n\\n\r\nSo when these non-entities are placed in a situation where they're forced to open up to each other, there's very little that could be done to divert the audience's attention from the obvious truth. That truth being that there's nothing to truly pull from these \"characters\" since there was nothing there from the beginning. The show desperately attempts to squeeze a modicum of emotion from this dirt pit, and when that plan fails, we're brought back to my original inquiry. This anime is strong-armed into producing something it never had to begin with; genuine emotion. \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, there are transient glimpses of decent writing in this dirt pit of a cast, that coming in the form of one character, Honoka Maki. If there was ever a character in this show that Kiznaiver didn't butcher with its ineptitude, Honoka was it. With the introduction of her backstory, as well as the time dedicated to exploring her psyche, she stands out like a sore thumb, especially when placed in her vapid surroundings. Had the show handled its cast with the same amount of effort and care as it did with her, I would have been singing a different tune. But this sadly isn't the case, and just as quickly as Honoka's character focus brought hope to the show, it's immediately snuffed out as the artificial angst surrounding every other facet of the screenplay further plunges the material back to the subpar levels that it was constructed out of. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to offer any other appraisal outside of this temporary moment of decent writing, it would be that of the art and animation department. Unlike the rest of the show, this area demonstrated the talent found at Trigger that they accumulated from their time spent at Gainax. The color palette used was radiant and immediately draws the viewer's attention. With storyboarding that kept a sense of flow in mind and a decent amount of consideration made in its use of color theory, there was clearly more effort here than what's usually expected out of typical studio projects. The same could be said (for the most part) about the character designs. While some were painfully by-the-numbers, others were quite expressive and easily identifiable. At the end of the day, these designs are wasted on cookie-cutter archetypes, but they're still appealing nonetheless. \\n\r\nOne a side-note, for readers who've already seen Kizanaiver, the designs of the gomorin outfits take clear inspiration from the Maromi doll in Paranoia Agent. Perhaps this was done so as a tribute to Satoshi Kon, given his extensive work in the field that the show is trying to dive into. Whatever the case may be, it was a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nAnother detail that, while not innovative, still deserves mentioning was the color of the characters' hair. Katsuhira's hair\u2014which was supposed to show someone close to complete apathy\u2014was represented with pure white hair overlapped with some brown, with the white representing an absence of emotion and the brown being the faint presence of it still left within him. The same could be said about Niko's hair, which obviously denotes to the flamboyancy of her personality given the diverse, bright colors. Again, pretty simple in how the hair color denotes their traits, but still worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, there isn't much to say. The only thing that sticks out is the opening theme \"LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME\" by BOOM BOOM SATELLITES, and rightfully so, given the infectious nature of it in accompaniment with the visuals presented. This could be attributed to the fact that sonically it has much in common with one of pop's more recognizable tunes \"Take on Me\" by a-ha. At the time of this writing, a quick youtube search of \"Kiznaiver take on me\" would bring you to a video that exploits this, merging the song with Kiznaiver's opening, demonstrating just how interchangeable it really is. That being said, BOOM BOO SATELLITES certainly delivered. Everything else in the sound department is forgettable by comparison. The only other thing worth taking note of is the sound effects used at times; like the glitchy noise made whenever the Kiznaiver device was activated, or the added sound effects given for objects when motioned. It was minor inclusions but still did something for the show than had it been excluded. \\n\\n\r\nNow, what should have been excluded but ultimately made the final cut was a love heptagon. Not a regular one-way love, not a love triangle, but a full-blown love heptagon! And what happens when you involve a bunch of dimensionless smurfs in an ouroboros-like relationship? You get an embarrassing display of cardboard cutouts inserts pleading to each other. A potpourri of ill-advised confessionals that transformed itself into a deformed, blubbering mess. There's very little in the way of actual characterization for these mouthpieces with legs, so expecting them to divulge genuine feelings for each other just comes across as half-assed. Some characters don't even have much in the way of one-on-one interaction prior to these events either, and those that do get that time barely share any semblance of chemistry. This made what was suppose to be emotional climaxes in the story, into an over-bloated cringe-filled sob-fest. This was midday soap opera levels of awful. \\n\\n\r\nThe show steamrolls through all of this melodrama and artificial angst in order to deliver a message that no one needed help figuring out in the first place; getting closer to others runs the risk of eventually being hurt by them. This isn't exactly an eye-opening revelation, this is just common sense. But what's possibly worse than off of this is the fact that what Kiznaiver struggles to deliver in 12 episodes, is easily understood with just 1. This 1 episode I speak of is the TV pilot of Kino's Journey. Watch those 20 minutes and save yourself hours of seeing a show drown in the kiddie pool section. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI told myself, as well as a few colleagues, that I wasn't going to review this, due in large part to the fact that just talking about it made me feel mentally exhausted. But then I thought about what it would mean for those people that share my stance but can't quite articulate the reason for why they feel the way they do. I thought about our perspective going unheard in the frenzy of hype and unchecked evaluations. Letting Kiznaiver get off scot-free to gain unwarranted appraisal became far bigger of a burden than simply ignoring it to comfortably go about my way. And so, here I am, writing this review for all those, who like me, are tired of these empty vessels being filled with accolades it doesn't deserve. The only emotional response that Kiznaiver got right was that of frustration, as that's precisely what I felt while watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is fine until it gets into the character drama, and seeing that the whole show revolves around character drama, you could see how that leaves very little in the way of value. Had the characters been handled better, had the concept not been bare-bones, had the writers tried a bit harder, then maybe, just maybe, there would have been something here worth talking about. But that wasn't the case, and Trigger, once again, \"saves anime!\"\\n\\n\r\n\"The show wasn't that good, but the opening was so nice though!\" How many more times do we have to make this statement before we let insufferable titles like these crash and burn? How many more times would we equate trying with being good enough? The only good that Kiznaiver can offer is serving as a future example of what forced melodrama looks like. With that being said, ignore this one if you haven't already, it's a practice in tolerance-control that would only serve as a distraction from watching something else that's truly worth your invested time.",

            "content": "Have you ever wondering how it must feel when one of your friends or loved ones are in despair? When they\u2019re having a despondent day? Well, look no further because Kiznaiver portrays this theme, and I mean literally.  \r\nKiznaiver is an anime revolving around bonds through pain and sentiment. The story circulates around that of our main protagonist, Katsuhira Agata, a modest, slow teenage boy that grasps no emotions within his hands, accordingly making himself a bullying target. However, the bullying that consistently approaches him from every direction is beyond his concerns and most notably, his pain.  Him, alongside with 5 other teenagers\u2019wounds are connected through the Kizna system and are obligated to bond for the sake of creating \u201cWorld peace\u201d. And so, their journey begins. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I must say, Kiznaiver is an anime I saw one of the brightest potential in, however, was abstracted by various divisions. Whenever it was character development or drama, the manner Kiznaiver executed this is what made itself abstracted from a rather good conception. Many like to say this is a character-based show so they are going to get more profound of the characters than any other department in the show, but even then, Kiznaiver fails abominably at this. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe the characters using three adjectives, they would be \u201cmild, archetypal, and caricatured\u201d The characters were first given archetypical roles, initially seen as symbolism, which I had no concerns for, however, the characters just started to use that as their foremost individualities, never actually getting in-depth of the traits and explaining why they maintain such. Alternatively, this started to define the characters themselves and the purpose they bring to the plot. Niko and Tenga, for most of the series existed, only to slap in some eccentric yet cartoonish comedy in there, but only came irksome and unnecessary, leaving room for its incompatible tonal dissonance. Kiznaiver genuinely knew what they were doing, thus far were oblivious about the fact that it\u2019s never going to work. Kiznaiver knew that it wanted to be witty at times, whilst simultaneously being serious, yet merely making the story paradoxical. The way serious scenes would modify itself into comedic ones was awkward and off. Kiznaiver couldn\u2019t handle both, therefore making the tonal shifts cringeworthy.\\n\\n\r\nThe only characterized really are Honoka, Katsuhira (fairly) and Sononaki, yet they still don\u2019t possess strong characterization. Katsuhira and Sonozaki were the only crucial characters of the show and would have still been proficient of creating a story with just the two of them. The rest of the cast didn\u2019t live up to their significance, let alone nearly, and that\u2019s what I found dissatisfying about Kiznaiver. If every single character were presented exactly like how Honoka was, this series would have left me with a different impression, potentially increasing its score from me. Hisomu was a random guy in the background educating a few life lessons to these youngsters but served no purpose whatsoever.  The finale of Kiznaiver entirely explained the significance of our cast; A bunch of kids that just added their two cents to Katsuhira and Sonozaki\u2019s association without it actually making that much of an impact, and additionally their personal issues being irrelevant, which brings me to explain the execution of drama in this series. \\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver must be an anime that secondly enthrals and is reliant on drama for its series, considering the fact that it\u2019s a character-based show, however, even its drama was horribly done. Albeit, I can comprehend the fact that they\u2019re just average teenagers so they are bound to create conflicts; it\u2019s only natural for them to do so, however, not one speck of maturity was balanced with the juvenility of the quarrels. Example would be Chidori\u2019s issues. Instead of it being a bunch of sixteen years olds arguing about their love interests, it was something that a bunch of twelve years old would be arguing about.  Moreover, the love interests were either absurd, lacking or arbitral.  Nico liking Tenga had to be the most illogical, a relationship that was barely transparent and developed. Kacchon and Chidori was a relationship that was hard to care for because they\u2019ve barely exposed their relationship before the Kizna system. Instead, we\u2019re just left to imagine and presume how strong their relationship must be. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization and the character interaction within the show were born out of compulsion as a way to move the plot forward, merely making the characters plot devices. A great example of this is episode two, where the characters were forced to reveal a secret of theirs, which I found quite rough. Kiznaiver wanted to impatiently force development out of our characters and rapidly reach the good part of the story, thus giving a reason to these \u201crequired missions\u201d or \u201cserved punishments if something is not achieved\u201d As much as this made the story engaging, it just came redundant. The same results would have still been created if the characters were simply left to unravel their way out of the system or getting profound of each other. The secrets and authentic identities were proficient of unfolding itself but Kiznaiver were too impatient.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver already has an implausible conception, yet is very questionable. They\u2019re already aware of the failure the experiment has brought prior to other children that initially were a part of the research, so why do they revive it again on other kids? Initially, the experiment became extremely hazardous and was nowhere near creating \u201cworld peace\u201d from the looks of it, so why would it be smart to do it again? Moreover, Kiznaiver never gets in-depth of how connecting pain equates to world peace, but rather they just state it will. Kiznaiver doesn\u2019t try to bring coherence to an already puzzling idea. I am very aware of the fact that the whole point of the show was to show the faults of the idea, but they never really try to fully clarify the agenda from the very beginning. \\n\\n\r\nThe effort put into Kiznaiver is very transparent and I support it for doing that. The distinctive turn they wanted to add to their story with the connecting pain and all boasted Kiznaiver up, however, ever so slightly failed itself from the inconsistencies. Kiznaiver prioritised the artistic merits in contrast to all the existing departments, just like what any average modern anime would do really. Not that it\u2019s a problem with bring bigger significant to the visuals of the show, but to not show as much importance to the characters and story is what Kiznaiver performed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was very satisfying yet aspiring. It had a very crispy and sharp design to it. The backdrops basically go by what I\u2019m saying, very distinguishing and never felt boring. The character designs were fine, and I mean, really fine. Very distinguishable and was very defining. Each character has an exhilarating look to them and was pleasing to the human eyes. They looked exactly by their characteristics and their personalities were easy to presume. The colour palette was very strong and bright and the animation ran smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nWell done BOOM BOOM SATELLITES and Sangatsu no Phantasia by genuinely going by your intended purpose. They rightfully went by what it means to create an opening and an ending, thus making it very appropriate.  An opening is to grip you into the series and places a significant role by entertaining your audience into watching more; the Kiznaiver opening ideally went by that. An ending is meant to relax the viewer and conclude them that the episode was nicely completed; the Kiznaiver ending also ideally went by that. However, the only trouble I have with the opening is how unmemorable it is. As Zeph stated, the only unforgettable line in the opening is \u201cLAY YOUR HANDS ON ME\u201d Other than that, it\u2019s fine.\\n\\n\r\nKaji Yuki, you shady monkey.  His performance was not particularly extraordinary, but most definitely stood out than the rest. I absolutely love how Kaji Yuki can just adjust his voice in order to fit the character, completely making him distinguishable from his most popular roles. Kaji Yuki is like a person that can just hide behind characters without knowing it\u2019s him. His voice was perfect for Agata and convinced me into liking it, a lot.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to expect and personal enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nBut the real question is, did I enjoy this?\\n\\n\r\nNot necessarily. It has to do with the fact that Kiznaiver vaguely touched upon its default genres, hence why I couldn\u2019t get profound of it. It was hard for me to articulate the message that Kiznaiver was trying to depict because so many things distracted it. There were nothing for me to get in-depth with really, but rather I just started watching the show with enjoyment in my mind. Kiznaiver is fairly a dumb watch. If you want an anime for its exhilaration and fun, Kiznaiver is for you. If you\u2019re looking for any perception of our characters and story, you\u2019re not going to find that here\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver should have been a 24 episode long series and more considerate with where it story and point goes. This show only wears the name of it being character-based and dramatic but it poorly conveys that. This show technically done what death parade done; a poor story in which its opening saves itself from hate and is seen as good in the majorities\u2019 eyes. Kiznaiver is yet another anime that had potential, however just didn\u2019t go by it. \\n\\n\r\n Negatives\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tincompatible yet irritating tone dissonance \\n\r\n\u2022\tImplausible and vague conception. \\n\r\n\u2022\tObligated character interaction and characterization \\n\r\n\u2022\tPurposeless or one-dimensional cast \\n\r\n\u2022\tMelodramatic, no maturity balanced with childishness \\n\\n\r\nPositives\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tEffort \\n\r\n\u2022\tSatisfying art and animation \\n\r\n\u2022\tAppropriate music\\n\r\n\u2022\tKaji Yuki \\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver = Overall 4/10",

            "content": "Why do we hurt each other? Have you ever walked by a couple on the street, bickering and arguing, and suddenly wondered why people are so keen on making each other suffer? Why is it that we feel so frustrated seeing someone get viciously angry in an argument, yet when we\u2019re actually a part of the argument, we feel justified to do so? Why is it that when we witness conflicts revolving around things we deem insignificant, we think people are ultimately petty, yet we have arguments equally as petty all the time? Why is it that we feel so frustrated when someone talks behindour backs, yet we tend to do the same to others? These are the common hypocrisies which are the unfortunate circumstance of not being able to truly understand each other. Everyone thinks differently, feels differently, loves different, and hates differently. You can\u2019t expect to know everything that\u2019s going on in someones head, and trying to base your friendships, conflicts, and discussions on assumptions like this will no doubt cause trouble.\\n\\n\r\nBut\u2026 what if we could? What if we could understand everything that someone thinks and feels? If we could get so impossibly close to someone, would we ever argue? Would we ever hate each other? I mean, how could we? If someone is basing their arguments on certain emotions that we can ALSO feel, how could we disagree? We can\u2019t really agree, either, but when we manage to understand them on such a fundamental level, it\u2019s hard to know what exactly would happen between us.\\n\\n\r\nHow about we take this a step further: What if everyone in the world could feel every bit of physical and emotional pain together. Would there be no wars? No conflicts? World peace? This may seem a bit ridiculous, but it\u2019s the main idea of Kiznaiver.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, this idea is only cool on paper. What could have been an excellent character study turned out to be no more than a melodramatic trainwreck with very few redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nTerrible Execution\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe thought of what Kiznaiver was trying to accomplish and the original ideas it had are still intriguing. It's incredibly interesting to think about what would happen if a group of people did share their pains, and if done with better direction, it could have been a fantastic anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, the show takes itself in the most boring direction possible. It's got a stupidly complex love story, it focuses on certain characters and leaves others in the dust, and some have nice arcs while others don't even get arcs. Maki got a very long arc yet Niko got absolutely nothing, and not only did Niko get absolutely nothing, she got development that was based around her unexplained love for another character. It can't help but feel like Kiznaiver would have done much better if it were longer. It's hard to develop that many characters in 12 episodes and that was the biggest problem I had. However, it does a pretty okay job of developing the characters it favors. Maki's and Katsuhira's backstories are the best parts of the show. It's sad to think that we could have gotten an interesting backstory on five of the other characters if the creators thought to lengthen the series. Disregarding the mini-arcs, the plot itself is unsatisfactory as a whole. The direction of the series towards the end wasn't as interesting as I had hoped, and the way they executed the final minutes feels like a cop out compared to what could have been.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStereotypical Characters\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nA friend of mine praised Kiznaiver's \"colorful\" cast of characters and claimed they loved how different they are from one another and how much variety the creators put into them to make them stand out from each other.\\n\\n\r\nSure, I can agree.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is full of contrasting characters, I didn't find a moment where I thought any character was similar and that's a very important part of the story. All seven are supposed to be incompatible or else this experiment wouldn't work the way the scientists hoped. However, them being different from one another does not make them good.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is full of tropes. They may be different from each other and they may vary in personalities but they never stray outside of their tropes. They're trapped inside of their stereotypes and almost all of their actions are unsurprisingly predictable. Some characters got developed but even then a majority of the characters were never touched upon. Trigger plays favorites with their cast and anyone who watched the show would understand that. Specific episodes were made developing Maki and Katsuhira, yet not a single second was spent developing Hisomu. He was comedy relief and poor comedy relief at that. To make matters worse, the romance between the characters was the most frustrating aspect. The creators just forced every character to fall in love with each other in an attempt to create drama. There's absolutely no basis to these feelings and the characters seem to think \"it was obvious that they were in love with you\" yet none of it is noticeable besides from Chidori's love for Katsuhira. The characters have their moments and they're entertaining to watch, but as soon as the drama starts it all hits the fan.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nForced Drama\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver displays copious amounts of drama that originates from nothing logically sound. Characters will do things for no obvious reason, which creates problems that favors the writers ongoing story. Similar to what I said early, the forced romance induces forced drama which in turn makes everything unbearable. There are a lot of moments where a character will start a conflict because of their \"love\" for someone which in most cases, makes no sense. Tenga hated Katsuhira because of what he \"did\" to Chidori and at first it made sense but even after hearing all about Katsuhira's backstory, he was still pissed off for no obvious reason. There's also how Niko was so sad about Tenga loving Chidori even though there's is absolutely no reason for Niko to love Tenga. It is never explained and Niko went so far as to take drastic actions based on something that was never developed. How does that make sense? One episode Niko wasn't in love with anyone, next episode she was full blown in love with Tenga. The only parts of the romance that felt justified was Chidori loving Katsuhira, and Katsuhira loving Noriko. I would also count Yuta's fixation with Maki but that seemed more like lust than love in my eyes. It feels like Trigger really wanted every character to have a romantic interest so they just forced the romance onto everyone else. It was baffling and without a doubt one of the most annoying parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou're probably thinking, \"people do overly-dramatic shit for stupid reasons all the time\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is true, however, if you ask any of these people they will always give you a reason. If you ask anyone in love, they will always give you a reason. Even if it's a stupid reason or over simplified, it's still what drives them. Kiznaiver makes absolutely no attempt to show or tell us why certain characters do the things they do, or why certain characters love the people they love. For some characters, you can deduce reasoning behind their actions, but for others you might as well guess.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAesthetic\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is beautifully illustrated and the soundtrack is likable, as expected of Trigger. Character designs look much different from your typical anime and the art-style itself feels much different than typical Trigger titles (which is what a lot of anime studios struggle accomplishing)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the opening is fucking fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nRidiculous Inconsistencies\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver felt like it was doomed from the start. When you look at a studio like Trigger and consider the idea of them making a science fiction drama, it seems a bit insane. If you've ever seen a Trigger anime, you would know that they're usually full of the most ridiculously goofy content in the industry. The titles that come out of Trigger are usually never meant to be taken seriously with the exception of shows like Kill la Kill, but even that wasn't serious most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver tries it's best to retain those goofy elements that made me like Kill la Kill, but it just doesn't work out well. It's hard to sit through a really dramatic scene and then half a minute later something unbelievably silly happens. It's seriously risky to mix drama with over the top goofiness and expect it to work out well. Some anime like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann do this very well, but it's a rare occurrence. In the end it feels like the creators of this show clashed with creative differences and had no idea what they wanted it to be. It often made me wonder if I should laugh at something or if it should be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThere are specific scenes that seriously stand out from the rest, though. A few parts made my skin crawl and I felt goosebumps all over my body. Unfortunately, the immersion quickly breaks when something stupid happens.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver shines every once in a while but for the most part watching it was frustrating. It had moments where it seemed like it could be great but in the end it disappointed me beyond belief. The stupid drama, nonsensical romance, and underdeveloped characters took away any semblance of enjoyment that was present. For the most part, it's still worth a watch simply because the parts that shine happen to shine very brightly. The comedy is enjoyable and the characters spasms are always fun to watch, but once it gets to the drama it's usually unbearable. Kiznaiver would have worked better as a goofy slice of life rather than the melodramatic train wreck it became. Either that, or the writers at least trying to fix their mistakes especially since this show had an insane amount of potential.\\n",

            "content": "Something something, anime is saved. Except that\u2019s for Luluco.\r\nWelcome to Keeeeeeeeeznaiver, the new full-length anime series from the meme machine known as Studio Trigger, where we come together and cut our pain into pieces. You might be thinking that this show is edgy. And it totally is. But then you watch red-headed Kamina punch someone in the face with his ass and then teabag him, and it\u2019s reassuring that this is gonna be much more light-hearted than you\u2019d expect.\r\nGoing more into detail about what this madness is about, it\u2019s easily one of the lamest concepts presented in a while. It\u2019s about seven weirdos who getlinked together through pain; as in, when one of them receives physical pain, it gets distributed to the other six. And then they\u2019re tasked to live their summer vacations while getting thrust into some weird challenges and relationships. \\n\\n\r\nOh, but don\u2019t cringe just yet, it gets even better! The Kizna system (which is the thingy that does the pain thingy) is deeper and more complicated, as the Kiznaivers (the weirdos with the pain thingy) eventually start to share emotional pain, or more specifically, heartache.\\n\\n\r\nAs terrible as this sounds, it\u2019s presented and written pretty well. First off is that the characters and their interactions with each other are Kiznaiver\u2019s bread and butter, not so much the system thing. While it certainly has an impact on them and the plot itself, I was undoubtedly watching Kiznaiver for the people, not the ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that I respect is how the KeezNuts system is presented to the audience. A lot of series tend to sell you on concept alone, they\u2019ll just throw their \u201cbrilliant\u201d idea in your face and then spend the next eleven episodes on the different ways they can make it work. Kiznaiver gives us the idea in portions, acclimating the audience to reduce the amount of groans in the first episode as little as possible. I guarantee you that, if the \u201cvoice of the heart\u201d thing was displayed in the first three episodes, this show wouldn\u2019t have been as big of a deal as it is. (Unless you\u2019re in Japan. Nice 600 sales rip trigger) But since the story spends time getting you hooked on the characters instead, they raise the bar when the time is right and make seem like it\u2019s not as silly as it is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, the series will more-or-less live or die by your opinions on the trope-y characters. The MC Katsuhira is probably the least amusing, being a walking bag of nothing. Literally. His personality is that he has no personality. Aren\u2019t we off to a great start?\\n\r\nHe actually isn\u2019t some sort of self-insert light novel fuckboy, and there are good reasons for him to act the way he\u2026 well he doesn\u2019t really act like anything, but you get the point. But it\u2019s pretty easy to get bored of him, and even his bigger, more emotional moments rarely come through unless he does a full 180, unlike Nico.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, Nico\u2019s the super-peppy girl with the candy-colored-hair that will probably come off as annoying to others, but for me I\u2026 actually found her to be the best. While she is one of those characters that apparently needs to say something at every waking moment, I\u2019m surprised by how not excessive she was. And being the clumsy, ditzy, idiot character that she is, her big emotional moments DO come through, and in a very big way. \\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t go into detail about everyone, but almost every character was a lot of fun in some way. While they don\u2019t have much of a personality beyond their basic tropes, watching them do shit together was a blast. It actually makes me wish I was part of their group in some way, which is something I rarely feel. And it makes me remind myself that, oh no, I don\u2019t actually have friends. Sasuga, Trigger. Perhaps if we were given more than twelve episodes, a lot more could\u2019ve been done with the characters, but it is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nBut here\u2019s the part that\u2019s undeniably true: the production of this anime is fucking fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs have a lot of\u2026 well, character. They\u2019re colorful, they\u2019re unique, and they have that \u201canime\u201d feel without being over-the-top. Just look at the Gomorins. How can anyone hate these fuckers? Sometimes it feels that the models are a little off; dimensions are slightly distorted, hair is more like a twisty piece of metal than hair, but I more-or-less ignored that, as it adds to the overall nature of both the designs and the show. Not only that, but Kiznaiver takes place in a rather beautiful city, and so background art doesn\u2019t lack any inspiration either. Good direction makes the visuals rather telling, with effective shot compositions and great body language and visible motions. On top of that, the animation, actual movement, is very smooth despite the complex aesthetics. All in all, it\u2019s safe to say that Kiznaiver has a lot of ambition with its art.\\n\\n\r\nBut the underdog of Kiznaiver is its FUCKING AMAZING soundtrack. Holy shit. Much of it is electronic, whether at a driving pace or quietly lingering in the background, but the orchestral scores hit hard. VERY hard. And one of the most interesting things is how some parts will be reversed, as to compliment a dissonant scene where the emotions aren\u2019t at a great place and relationships are breaking apart. No insert songs are found in here, just a beautiful composition that sounds perfect at every moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are no slouches, either. In fact, I daresay that A-ha\u2019s \u2018Take On Me\u2019 is the best OP of the season.\\n\r\nAlright, it\u2019s actually Boom Boom Satellites and the song is called \u2018Lay Your Hands On Me\u2019, I\u2019ll respect them since this is their last work. But lemme just say that I\u2019ve never been a fan of these guys. They\u2019re kinda out of my comfort zone, and I just think they sound like crap most of the time. But this one song here actually clicks; it puts you in a sweet, yet subtly melancholic trance as dizzying lights and incredibly smooth character animation arrests you visually. Put them together and you have an OP that feels unlike any other, whether you appreciate it or not. \\n\r\nAnd to close each episode off, a pleasant alt-rock song by Sangatsu no Phantasia, whoever the fuck that is, leaves a bit of a hopeful atmosphere right before the next episode\u2019s preview, as we get more shots of the beautiful characters holding flowers. Because, why not. It has a bright tone with its crystal-clear vocals and vibrant piano and violins playing over the band. Yet, it doesn\u2019t feel overpowering or generic, it strikes a nice balance.\\n\\n\r\nSo, uh. I bet a lot of people aren\u2019t gonna agree with a lot of this, and I\u2019m completely willing to admit that Kiznaiver is a flawed show and a lot of people will/do hate it, but I greatly appreciate what Kiznaiver set out to do and accomplished. This isn\u2019t Monogatari or anything, but I\u2019ll take it over most of the other shows that came out this season.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nShipping - Teamblueallday/10\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 5\\n\r\nFavorite character - Nico\\n\r\nRecommendation level - High",

            "content": "SPOILERS! (RE-UPLOAD)\r\nHave you ever planned to watch an anime with no expectation then it impressed you so much? For me, Kiznaiver is the first anime in that situation.\r\nI read the synopsis of it and found it interesting but thought it would probably be really bad. When I watched the first episode I was impressed and it was interesting. Then I continued and ''Now, this is really good.''\r\nThe thing that I liked most about the anime is everything fits the anime nearly perfectly. The art, the music, the characters, everything... Just give the director his award already!\r\nEvery episode I get sad because I think ''This probablywill be the best episode, I don't think they are able to make better episodes.'' then next episode I live the same situation. Seriously how can an anime  get so much better in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I have to mention about Kizuna System. So, if I understood correctly, The main purpose of the system is ensuring peace. If people connect to each other and share their pains they will understand each other's feelings too. As a result, there will be peace. Am I right?\\n\r\nSo a group of teenagers are connected to each other, and they share the pain and emotions under the name of ''Kizuna System''. I have to say the story is really interesting. The dominant part is the mystery, ''What is this system?'' ''What is the purpose?'' ''What happened to Sonozaki?''. These questions were the ones I was mostly curious about and I'm really happy they all solved. It is kinda slow pacing, most of the questions are answered at the end of the anime (I mean last 3 episodes) and before those episodes, the anime was full of character developments, comedy and drama. This anime is actually based on the characters and all episodes are plotting the characters and their feelings so about story being interesting is enough. And it's getting more and more interesting every episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't imagine a better art style for this anime. It could be just good for another anime but it gives you the feel like it is created just for this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, the first thing impressed me in the anime is the opening. When I first watched it, the animation and its style made me feel like I was reborning. So, did the music. I wanted the opening to last forever, I wanted it to never end. The ending is awesome, too. For me, they are the second best opening and ending this season. And the insert musics are also really good. Especially the final episode, you can feel the all thrilling and sad moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9-10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the most important thing to me (when watching anime), maybe even more important than story and I become so happy when I see the characters are developing. This anime has 8 important characters. They all are seriously MAIN characters. They all have feelings and past, and the anime is based on those. All characters are original and have so different qualities. One of them is even masochist. I said the main question was ''What happened to Sonozaki (and between Katsuhira)?''. So she was the key character. First episodes she was like an emotionless annoying character and people didn't like her, but last episodes (especially last scene of the 10th episode) she won our hearts. Nico was the most friendly and funny one, Chidori suffered a lot because of her feeling to Katsuhira, and Katsuhira was always brave. But still I think the most developed character is Maki (or maybe Sonozaki). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n*Starts episode, the opening begins* - 10 second later - *The ending starts*\\n\r\nSeriously I can't figure out how fast it pasts. This anime can be so boring for some people (especially who don't like slow pacing, character-based animes and who like action) but I'm enjoying it a lot. And melodrama is strong in this one. I never thought teenagers drama could be sad. I think the tags should've been like ''Drama, Comedy, Psychological, Thriller, Sci-Fi''\\n\\n\r\nNegative Sides:\\n\\n\r\n- Too short. Some characters developed enough and well but we don't know much things about the others. Especially Yuta.\\n\r\n- We don't know Chidori's final thoughts clearly. So did she get over Katsuhira and decide to be with Tenga or not?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, here is my thoughts about it. This is not kind of anime that most of the people can like, but I'm in the team of lovers. Some people think these flaws are enough to ruin an anime, but still I think it is amazing. Even I'm surprised that this anime became the top in this season for me :)",

            "content": "Ah Kiznaiver. From the studio that bought forth the crazy battle-centric Kill la Kill and supernatural battle school theme series When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace emerges this series. As an original title, I had some doubts about the show at first. Because quite honestly, the show\u2019s premise invites a lot of questions. These may include what exactly is the \u201cKizuna system\u201d, what\u2019s its purpose, and why does it exist? \r\nComing into this series, I was a little intimidated at first. The idea of the Kizuna system brings a connection between characters (whom become known as \u201cKiznaiver\u201d) through human emotions by sharing wounds and pain. Theseemotions ranges from sorrow, regret, pain, and even love. As part of the story, we also get a deeper insight about the origins of the system. Apparently, the system was designed to explore human feelings and making characters more aware of them for world peace. The characters begins to realize these inner feelings and learns about their close peers and even themselves. From a story point of view, it opens up a lot of possibilities for characterization. In addition, Kiznaiver also does a neat job at crafting a thrilling theater that builds more and more as each episode progresses. Emotions also emerge throughout the series and there\u2019s definitely to worry about. Considering that Mari Okada is directing the series, you should be prepared for some sort of emotional delivery. At times, I feel like the show is trying way too hard to get across the point. While other times, I think it comes out more naturally between the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor what\u2019s worth though, Kiznaiver take advantage of its premise quite a bit. From the first few episodes, we have a mysterious girl named Noriko who immediately takes interest in the main protagonists in particular Katsuhira. Their relationship can be described as strange but also familiar. This is because the two already seem to have history judging by the flashbacks and segments. And despite Katsuhira not knowing it, he feels a strange connection to Noriko. This also links a connection to the Kizuna system as we\u2019ll discover a darker side of science. From an experimental point of view, the show makes it clear that the system is far from perfect. The kids who underwent experimentation are more like their former selves, kind of like a shell. In the meantime, the show will also explore how the Kizuna system influences relationships in the present.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to be quite honest, relationship dynamics is an important aspect in the show. The main male protagonist Katsuhira has some obvious chemistry with Tenga and Chidori. So much in fact, there\u2019s hints of romance that formulates into a generic love triangle. On the other hand, there\u2019s a general melancholic-like mood throughout the show about relationships. Take a look at Maki for instance. Remember, the series likes to express emotions and sorrow is definitely one of those as well. Maki\u2019s guilt (based on her background story with another classmate) shows a fragile side of her personality. One thing I do praise on Kiznaiver is the heavy writing to get the audience to understand more about the characters. From a personal view, it makes the characters more believable. Even Noriko, the most mysterious character in the show can be understood better once we see a deeper side of her story. Unfortunately, the series still relies a lot on its relationship angles especially when it comes to romance. In the latter half of the show, there\u2019s some particular segments that makes you really roll your eyes about Katsuhira\u2019s role. \\n\\n\r\nAs with most series from studio Trigger, they often tend to go overboard with its gimmicks. Kiznaiver isn\u2019t an exception to that either especially with such a thrilling premise. But for what it advertises, the show itself falls between the lines of silliness, intimate, and emotional. In essence, the comedy is a hit or miss because generally, the jokes are often outstretched than what they should be. The emotional segments tries way too hard on many occasions in particular one climatic episode when the Kizuna system affects the characters at its peak. And finally, the show\u2019s narrative often pushes the story in ways that becomes predictable or repetitive. The over-saturated exposition about the Kizuna system doesn\u2019t really make strong impressions. In fact, the plot device is probably the least interesting part of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, Kiznaiver gives off a vibrant feeling. The characters look colorful with some generic traits to match their personalities. The setting itself has the feel of a futuristic world with more advanced technology. However, not everything looks very solid in terms of design. From a personal point of view, the characters looks rather cartoonish. From the various character expressions to their clothing designs, it seems that Trigger designed them to reflect their outer image. It\u2019s important to also realize that feelings expressed in the show needs to be portrayed accurately and thankfully, Kiznaiver handles that well. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack is generally moderate, there\u2019s more depth to the character voice mannerisms. Remember, the show is about expressing human feelings so the voice of the characters is a necessity to match their roles. While it gives off a decent first impression, there\u2019s not much more that it improves on. However, I would like to praise Nico\u2019s performance as a girl that can express both strong emotions such as sorrow and happiness. While she is childish on many occasions, the VA brings the best out of her as a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line is, Kiznaiver is generally a show that overhyped itself. This thoughtful and intriguing premise in the end turned into a mixed bag of sour storytelling. Although taking a closer glance, the characterization is fairly well done with what it has to offer. For Trigger, this show\u2019s comedy doesn\u2019t cross the line compared to some of its other works. However, it still takes you on a ride of electrifying shenanigans. And in the end, it will make your eyes roll.\\n",

            "content": "Kiznaiver was the latest anime production by Studio Trigger, a studio who I really like and the one I am most anticipating whenever a new anime is announced from this studio. However, Kiznaiver, while not a bad show, was one with a lot of forced drama and it's characters felt more so like plot devices than actual people.\r\nThe main problem I had with this anime was the narrative and the characters. Now, on their own, I found the characters to be fun and likeable, and the interactions and comedy between them felt natural and genuinely funny. The only problem with the comedy was the timing.Often, they'd combine the comedy with the more serious, dramatic scenes and it just didn't work, thus dragging me out of some scenes and made me lose immersion. As the show progressed every week, the narrative became weaker and weaker to the point that some scenes were too stupid and too silly to take seriously and as a result made some of the drama feel weak. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of forced drama and character development in the series. None of the actions the characters take or their decisions felt natural and progressed in such a way that felt rushed and kind of tacked on. Many characters made stupid decisions just for the sake of pushing this drama and a lot of the characters felt more so like plot devices, written for a convenient way to push the story forward whenever necessary. Some development came too little too late and by this time I didn't care about the character since the show never gave me any reason to in the first place. Some of the character development (such as with Honoka) was handled pretty well and by the end, I actually liked this character but others were either forced or lacked any in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the themes and ideas in the anime are far too apparent and pretty much are spoon fed to the audience, as if we're unable to interpret anything ourselves. It has themes, but doesn't really do anything with them and presents them in such a way as to insult the intelligence of its audience.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there were many things I did enjoy about this anime. For starters, despite the characters having forced drama, they're at least fun and entertaining to watch and the characterisation for most of the characters is pretty good. Also, the animation and character designs was also very well done, and the general look and feel of Kiznaiver was great. The sound, shot composition and music was all great especially in the climax of the ninth episode, which I felt was very well directed. It's just a shame that the story and character development doesn't hold up the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver does try hard to develop its own characters and themes, while having a legitimately interesting premise but it seems to fall short of its true potential, which is a shame. There were many things I loved about the show but it would have been better if the script and characters were more fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, not a bad show, but far from perfect. Nico best waifu.\\n\r\nAnyone else looking forward to the TV series of Little Witch Acadamia?\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What does it mean to hurt? What does it mean to love? What does it mean to be a friend? Kiznaiver, a Drama/SciFi manga adaptation from Studio Trigger (Spring 2016), takes a stab at a heavily character driven story and completely succeeds. The show uses it\u2019s beautiful animation + soundtrack, objectively unique and strong characterization, and deep philosophical questioning of human connection to deliver a new twist on the plot of Rebirth and a meaningful re-imagination of anime\u2019s friendship clich\u00e9. \r\nLove or hate the show, there\u2019s no denying Studio Trigger \u2018showed up\u2019 for the art of Kiznaiver. Each character has an identity, their looks reflectingtheir personalities brilliantly, not to mention their body language. Simply watching the intro, we are given a grand spectacle which imprints an understanding of the characters early on, before we have even met most of cast (but I\u2019ll be going more in depth on Kiznaiver\u2019s OP on my blog at a later time). Each character is visually appealing and expressive, giving the audience little reason to turn away from the screen for a majority of the series. Even those with little emotion in the show are extremely interesting to look at, allowing the director (Hiroshi Kobayashi) to set up some genuinely funny and serious moments as a result. On top of that, the animation itself is phenomenal, making use of fluid dynamic camera angles and the works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs far as audio goes for the show, it is great. The music rises and falls in a perfect flow for the narrative, and knows when to go completely silence to let powerful lines of dialogue hit hard. Yuuki Hayashi (previous works including: Haikyuu!, Death Parade, and Boku no Hero Academia) was in charge of music for this series, and did a terrific job. The music for the opening and endings are fantastic (the op being the thing that drew me in to watch the series in the first place), and the ed following up was a great touch to every episode (the ed being another thing I\u2019d like to go in depth on at a later date). Going past the music, the sound effects were spot on. The fictional sound effects that was generated for group\u2019s connected pain was intuitive and, for how often its heard, never gets distracting or feel out of place. Well done over all.\\n\\n\r\n(Plot Summary will be kept to a minimum for MAL review guidelines)\\n\\n\r\nGetting into the story, the plot revolves around seven main characters, the most prominent being: Katsuhira Agata (or Kacchon). Katsuhira is completely unable to feel pain, and is emotionally distant from the world. A glimpse into his past in the first minute of the pilot shows him at a young age chasing after a girl standing on a roof. While trying to talk her down, she grins and jumps. He cries out, reaches down to his chest in pain and his hair turns white (see: Marie Antoinette syndrome). This scene sets up a potent understanding of, and connection to, our protagonist as we view his behavior and hear his first few words. In this scene he is holding conversation with Chidori Takashiro, a close friend growing up. He asks why a cicada bothered coming to the surface: its safer underground and it won\u2019t live very long anyways. Chidori replies, \u201cMaybe it wanted friends, or something?\u201d It is the brilliance of these lines, that expose us to the main ideas of the plot while giving an introduction to these character\u2019s personalities and already starts to build a connection with these characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, Katsuharia meets a strange girl who we later find out to be Noriko Sonozaki. She tells him that people bully him because he doesn\u2019t get scared, and doesn\u2019t feel pain, meaning others \u201ccannot find themselves within him\u201d. As he processes these words, she suddenly throws him down a flight of stairs, knocking him out. Upon waking up he is in a hospital with 5 other individuals. They are informed they are a part of the \u201cKiznaivers experiment\u201d and they are now connected by their wounds. If one individual experiences pain it will be divided equally between everyone connected, in an attempt to create true human connections. The others who are chosen for the experiment were selected under the criteria that they would have never met normally or got along with each other, as well as loosely fitting the definition of the seven deadly sins (or an updated version for modern japan). These differences in characters truly play into the strength of the show\u2019s characterization as each one is unique. From their designs, to body language, to behavior; but it doesn\u2019t stop there. Each character has very human flaws, insecurities, and desires; so when the characters get time on screen you to truly begin to understand them and connect. No character can simply fill an archetype, as they are all diverse and feel deeply human, and in their doing so: Trigger has made a colorful cast of individuals who you want to know more about. This creates an environment where every line and decision made feel purposeful and impactful to the group as they learn how to get along.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the show taps into a deeper philisophical question, of how do humans connect? Human inherently are not perfect, and as a result of this connection with others is not always simple. Especially in our age of internet its easy to keep to ourselves. In context of Katsuhira\u2019s cicada, why bother going outside where you have to open up and can get hurt? We die too soon anyways. We can see an argument formed through the show\u2019s use of the Kiznaiver experiment, This creates a literal empathy between the characters, and over the course of the show we see these individuals grow, connect and change. They will never be the same people they were at the start. They\u2019ve opened up slowly and they will get hurt along the way. The guy doesn\u2019t always get the girl, others don\u2019t always return their feelings, tragic events can completely destroy friendships, but as humans we keep on moving. The show doesn\u2019t sugar coat the hardships, but it shows us the joy in making the connections, to being a friend to some body. Characters may not end up with who you want them to, and while this has been known to piss some viewers off, we should really see it as beautiful thing. That\u2019s not how real life works, why should it in the show? Getting to know these people so well, you want these relationships to blossom as much as the characters themselves, so it can hurt when we get the truth, but in the end they come to terms with things and learn to live on. This is the re-imagination of the \u2018friendship\u2019 trope; we aren\u2019t forcefed a \u201cfriendship concquers all\u201d scenario, but instead are eased into a more human and compelling arguement of: \u201cconnection with others gives meaning to life\u201d. The main theme the show is presenting is: people need to open up. It\u2019s not easy, you will get hurt, and need to share that pain with those closest to you. But goddamn is it ever worth it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\n+ Beautifully Animated\\n\r\n+ Deeper Themes to make you think\\n\r\n+ Strong connection with the cast makes dialogue feel purposeful, and decisions feel impactful\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Plot lags in the interest of character development\\n\r\n\u2013 It had to End\\n\\n\r\nIf I have to put a number to it:\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "Human emotions is a topic that has always proved to be challenging to present in any form of media. It is something very vast and the understanding of which completely varies from person to person, thus often leads people to having different perspectives towards the work in question. Kiznaiver stood as one of the shows to take this challenge upon itself but like most, was unable to deliver in a way that could be deemed worthwhile.\r\nStory:\r\nThe concept and setting of the show is fairly interesting. It\u2019s sure to grab anyone\u2019s attention as the nature of the show holds a lot of potential for deep storytellingand emotional scenarios. Unfortunately, the show does not manage to fully utilize whatever it had at hand, and how is that? Well, to make things simple, let\u2019s consider both halves of the show separately.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half, right of the bat was off to a pretty poor start as most of the earlier episodes revolve around scenarios that could be considered as pointless time wasting. While it can be seen that these scenarios were meant to serve as development for both the characters and story, it still feels as if they were put out just to fill in for something that was necessary for the buildup of the series and would provide as a foundation for the events to come later. Because of which, they come out as generic slice-of-life events that you\u2019d see in any other show but without having any unique appeal for itself. While some viewers might be able to find value within the enjoyment of these scenarios, others could very well end up considering them as something meaningless altogether. But even then there\u2019s no heart put into them and just feel as if they were added to get the job done quickly so that the writers could start focusing on the other half of the story. Which was seemingly the main part of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half offers more backstory to some of the characters and some nice development while also offering a deeper take on the entire series\u2026 Or at least it tries to. The thing is, while the idea might seem very nice, the same can\u2019t be said about the way it\u2019s carried out. It feels rather vague and just doesn\u2019t provide the proper kind of development that you\u2019d need in order to truly feel for the more emotional situations that come later on. The progression feels very off and the pace by which the show goes barely even gives you the chance to care about any of the events. You can tell that it tries to be dramatic, but just doesn't manage to get anywhere with it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nStudio Trigger managed to do well in this regard as it mostly has in the past. The art direction is really well done and the sharp, bright visuals are very eye catching. The brightly colored backgrounds also added more depth to the overall surroundings and was altogether something nice to look at. The animation is also smooth for the most part but it can get rather inconsistent at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack within the show is fairly nice but it\u2019s still not something I would particularly praise. There were moments when the soundtrack fit with the show\u2019s mood really well though and do stand as some nice pieces on their own but they don\u2019t really effect the atmosphere all that much. At the very least, the right tracks were played at the right time and nothing in particular ever felt out of place in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nI did however, enjoy the Opening sequence quite a bit. It\u2019s nicely presented and has some very eye catching visuals and screenplay along with good music. Just a good opening overall. Really did impress me the first time I saw it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nQuite sadly, the character department was one of Kiznaiver\u2019s weakest areas as not only did the cast feel bland to begin with, but also felt neglected for the most part. While the show does provide a reasonable amount of character development for a few characters, at the same time it disregards the others. Being a show with a main group of eight characters, it felt as if only a few in the group actually mattered and the others were there just to fill in space, a couple of \u2018extras\u2019. What also stems from this is that the chemistry between said characters felt extremely unnatural and forced. The characters do present themselves in a fun way and were entertaining at times with their quirky personas but felt limited to those personas and didn\u2019t manage to go much further with their character (except for a very few). They felt extremely flat and whatever supposed 'depth' that was provided to us could barely be considerable, because of which these characters just end up becoming another generic cast that's easily forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show lacks the most. One of the biggest issues that Kiznaiver had was with its dramatics. Most of the time, the more emotional scenes aren\u2019t carried out as well as they could\u2019ve been and also due to the progression of the show and the nature of the characters, very rarely would the viewer feel any sentiments with the drama. The scenario execution is poor, which is sad, considering that there were a few moments for which I truly felt that they could\u2019ve came out as something beautiful if portrayed properly but rather what we were presented with was an abundance of melodrama and forced romance. Also, because of this, nothing ever feels as important as it should. It lacks the qualities which makes a viewer care, whether that be for the characters or for the entire show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion and Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nEven though Kiznaiver offered a good concept, the lackluster presentation and writing held it back from achieving anything noteworthy. If you can look past the flaws and enjoy the show for its nice visuals or just manage to appreciate it for the concept itself then you just might be able to find something in it. Otherwise if you\u2019re expecting a dramatic experience with solid writing then there are far better options within the medium.",

            "content": "What better way to make friends is there than making them feel your pain?...Is most likely an accurate way to describe what this anime is about.\r\nStory(7/10)\r\nKiznaiver is an anime that focuses more on the characters and their development rather than the story.Because of that,there is the imminent confusion to where the plot intends to go.\r\nIt starts with Katsuhira and his dream of a blue haired girl telling him that ''he'll definitely get his pain back''.Because of his lack of feelings,Kacchon is bullied and extorted money from.One day he meets a mysterious girl who pushes him off the stairs.The protagonist wakes up in what seems tobe an surgery room and the earlier figure who introduces herself as Sonozaki explains to him that he's been ''chosen'' to participate in an experiment with 5(later 6) of his classmates in which their pain is divided and felt between each other.They are put to make all kinds of tests to reveal their most embarassing secrets and missions to help each other whenever one is in torment.It mostly is that but then it's revealed that the experiment is not as safe as they thought and some were affected by it and while at it,the reason for Kacchon's lack of feel.And as the MC gains his feelings,he demonstrates a few things to Sonozaki too.\\n\r\nIt's quite cute and it has an interesting sense of humour.I also like the bonds they formed between them and there are some ships to sail too.Felt quite heartwarming at times to me so that's why it gets a passing grade.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI dig colorful art like chocolates as presents.The characters are soo rainbow inspired(as most MCs in anime intended for younger audiences).I don't have anything to complain but it still didn't leave my mouth gaping,most likely because the only interactions it focused on was talking.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op gave me a hypnotic high kind of feel and while I liked the ed,it didn't attract me especially.None of my favorite seiyuus but Nico's voice is too cute to ignore.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWe have an emotionless MC and his emotionless love interest,an childhood friend,the macho guy,the narcissist,the energetic weirdo,the masochist and the girl who has a sad past so she doesn't want to have anything to do with anyone.They are characterised by Sonozaki as ''the seven deadly sins'' because of their obvious flaws that prevent them from making friends.All in all,the characters are lovable,even if they are not the most unique.Of course,that should be a given,as this focuses on the characters more.I could recommend watching this if only for the masochist's weird moans and reactions and Honoka's acidic remarks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI strangely enjoyed seeing those teenagers going through their angst and misunderstandings,and the weird love octagon formed between them.This most likely is a representation of one of the questions which humans always asked themselves:how do you understand other people and the feelings they have?\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the mixed reviews this anime has,I liked it.Not most try do something besides the normal friendship formula so this was an intriguing take on what it means to be connected and have bonds.I would recommend watching this for the lols,the colorful characters and maybe if you want a bit of a change from what you usually watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nThis anime had an original idea, amazing potential, and good art, but it went downhill very quickly after about the fourth episode. Honestly I normally wouldn't rate an anime with a 1 unless I really, really disliked it, but this was definitely one of the most disappointing anime I have watched. A large part of the reason for that was all the unnecessary, forced shipping.\r\nI know that a lot of people hated Chidori, but I actually liked her. She had a lot of passion for Katsuhira, and loved him deeply. Not to mention she was friends with him for many years, and eventried helping him to the best of her ability. I felt like this anime basically spit on her feelings, and made them out to be completely unimportant. What ticked me off the most (I'm using nice language right now because God knows how much I want to curse), was when they force shipped her with Tenga. Uhm... excuse me? What? She's been in love with Katsuhira for how many years, gets her heart basically ripped out by him, and then goes along so easily with someone else? Makes absolutely no sense. I would have preferred her to end up with alone. Besides, Nico also liked Tenga, and I think she would have been good with him. Their personalities matched much better. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now let's talk about Nori for a second. Besides the fact that she is a completely clich\u00e9 character with absolutely no personality, AT ALL... she's just annoying in general. She tries to act all mysterious and such, but in reality she's just... boring. And the ending made absolutely NO SENSE. Nori has just been holding all their pain by herself for all of this time? Yeah, how convenient--honestly it was just a cop-out for them to not have to kill her. The plot would have made MUCH more sense if she had died, and I'm seriously not the type to want characters to die in anime--almost ever. If she had died, then of course their own pain could be returned to them. But no, they instead allowed her to live and somehow to even get with Katsuhira? It just makes very little sense. And that joke at the end about \"We haven't gotten there yet\"... way to completely step all over Chidori's feelings. It's been two years since I've seen this anime and it STILL ticks me off to think about this.\\n\\n\r\nAlso some of the plot was confusing in general and not relayed properly--I'm still not entirely sure what was going on towards the end there. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, in case you didn't see what I said up there, it's been TWO YEARS since I've seen this anime. Literally two years. And it still irks me to no end any time that I think about it. Like it literally puts me in a bad mood, which is rather rare for me. So I felt it only fair to vent out my feelings here. I literally created an account for this reason.\\n\\n\r\nChidori should have gotten with Katsuhira, but really, there shouldn't have even been any romance added into this anime. There are two things about anime that I hate the most: first few episodes are good, with a great idea, and the delivery is awful (I'm looking at you SAO and Code:Breaker), and when there are forced ships that make no sense and that really weren't necessary for the plot to progress but which just serve as an easy way to further it. Anyway, over all this anime was a huuuge disappointment, which is pretty sad because it had great potential. Honestly they should re-do it with a lot less shipping, and a lot more focus on other emotions. Perhaps I'm also hyper-critical due to my being a psychology student and knowing that there's a lot more to emotions than romance, but there's my take on it and I doubt anyone will be able to change my mind.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver's is a mess  that devolves from a show with an interesting premise and wacky trigger-esq characters into a melodramatic, boring waste of time that fails to deliver any real depth and ultimately leaves you regretting giving it the time of day.\r\nMy biggest problem with Kiznaiver situates from its dialogue; the writing in this show is absolutely atrocious and towards the end of the show becomes downright cringy in its directness. Few of the conversations between the characters feel legitimate as the characters are screaming the situation at you and telling you how to feel. Dialogue is meant to be utilised to give theaudience a sense of the character's personalities, their feelings and their goals. However, in Kiznaiver's case the characters just downright tell the audience what to think and it leaves you unaffected as there is nothing to care about as the character interactions feel so forced. For a show that is meant to be about friendship and the importance of communication, the show does a horrible job of developing actual friendships as all the characters and their supposed friendship feels disingenuous. \\n\\n\r\nThe Kizna system itself, what is meant to be the entire focal point of the show, eventually disintegrates and simply becomes a gimmicky tool to advance the story rather than tell the story. This really annoyed me as the system, though pretty ridiculous as a concept, introduced some really interesting themes that the show could of discussed and developed. The  show alludes to some of these themes but are ultimately overlooked in favour of furthering the idea of \"friendship can overcome anything\" motif. By the end of the show every bit of dialogue is just repeating and repeating this same fucking point until it begins to drive you insane. I FUCKING GET IT ALREADY- FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC! The show ends with the characters having some big \"we're all so close\" scene which is splashed in unearned pathos as I felt nothing for any of these characters since the show has used its time to simply tell us what to think and feel rather than develop the fucking characters and their relationships.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of character development: there is almost none. Most of the characters in this show don't development beyond their cliche's and those that do like Honoka end up just reverting right back into their cliche outside of the forced sentimental moments. I don't buy that the characters screaming \"We are good friends now, just accept it\" makes them friends, characters need to actually develop in order for that to be the chase which simply doesn't happen. That being said the show does have its genuine moments. Honoka's arc is the best bit about the show and I feel some of the conversations between Honoka, Nico and Yuta display moments of  genuine growth and investment. However, once this arc finishes it almost just reverts back to normal and the characters don't act like they've developed at all unless the show calls for it but overall it just comes off unconvincing. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing about the show I can be assed mentioning is the soundtrack as the OP and ED are both good and the soundtrack is pretty solid throughout the course of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show has moments of greatness but falls victim to bad writing, horrible pacing and pathos that ultimately leave the characters \"friendship\" feeling major league unconvincing and unmemorable.",

            "content": "There are so many things wrong with this anime and its setting.  The Kizna system in the end is just a plot device as a cheap explanation to have things make sense and fails at that.  The warning signs were right there from the first and second episode.  The protagonist gets pushed down some stairs, he's saved by having his pain shared among six other people (how the heck that works is anyone's guess), yet he and the six others right afterwards look and react totally fine, when the protagonist should at least have a couple broken bones and that pain shouldhave been distributed to the other six.  However, only six of the seven are summoned together and have this explained to them.  The seventh was purposefully left out to be another episode of the others finding him, which overall was just for episode count, because there was no underlying purpose to having him separated from the others in the main narrative.  Of course, everyone had this change done to them without consent and were abducted by a horde of mascots that roam the city for some reason.  The mascots continuously act as railroading personified throughout the series, and move the characters to where they need to be and dance to whatever narrative the plot needs them to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main characters are forced into this experiment with a threat of a \"bad end\" if they don't.  Their first task is completely nonsensical where they have to \"introduce themselves\", but really it's to share your most highly kept secret, and not telling will result in several traps bordering on death being activated to force it out of you.  Yet in the midst of this highly controlled environment they were placed in, one of main characters manages to get separated from the others somehow in order to give a hint of her dark and troubled past, and later appears in a mascot costume for some reason once the task is finally cleared.  Also, she gives her secret after their abductor already said they cleared their first task.  Oh, and one character's most valued secret is that she loves the protagonist.  She's also the childhood friend and next door neighbor.  Yep, a huge guarded secret there, and the first hint at one of many of the forced romances this anime will later try to shove in the audience's face in the second half.  So yeah, after that cluster of nonsense, this anime started out in the negative and future episodes would have to work to bring it up, which it never does.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fault is in half due to it's worldbuilding. Few things make sense and that's due to vagueness and inconsistency.  From what was told, this experiment was done once before, the city was constructed for that very purpose, with one third of the citizenry in on it, and ended in a huge failure.  As a result, 19 kids that were the subjects were robbed of their sensory system; some can't even go out into society.  That an experiment like this happened and not one mention of it was on the news or any social media not even as a rumor is ridiculous.  I imagine parents would be outraged and/or distraught for what happened, especially the parents to the kids that were experimented on.  But that's the issue isn't it?  While parents are mentioned, rarely any of them are shown.  The protagonist was a subject of the first experiments, yet he still gets the same cliche that his parents work overseas, when any caring parent after seeing what happened to their child would be with him no matter what.  The only parents that do appear aren't even any of the main characters', but for a side character, and they only appear for a few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nOnce learning the protagonist was part of the first experiment, you ask the question \"why was he chosen again?\".  It is never made clear.  It may have been to get his pain back, which is necessary for him to start emoting again (but it's really not), but later we learn that another subject is willingly keeping his and all the other kids' pain in her, which is ridiculous and a contradiction to previous info (which I'll get to later), and the other subject's goal in the end was never for him to get his pain back despite earlier hints that's what she wanted, and starts off what is one of the most sorry excuses of a plot twist and final confrontation.  It's all just a mess.\\n\\n\r\nI look at the the two experiments done for the Kizna system, and they only have a few similarities.  The first experiment as a whole is even more ludicrous than than one we find our main characters in.  It started with a mistake that resulted in one kid out of nineteen was solely getting the pain out of 5 kids (jumps to all of them later for no reason).  Gradually, the kids that were having their pain transferred became desensitized, not just physically but emotionally as well that carried over to the present.  The current subjects didn't have these problems.  For one, the current subjects' pain was distributed equally.  Second, theirs had a time limit and were freed after summer vacation, contrasting the original that continues to the current time.  If the researchers made improvements, how the heck did they test the modifications before the story starts?  Did they just administer it to the current subjects, and it worked?  But if they were able to fix the previous problems, wouldn't they be able to cure the first subjects?  You're left wondering because it is never explained!  It's instead used to set up one of the project members as some tragic character, because that person is the same kid that all the pain was transferred to.  The girl's circumstances get contradicted too, making the attempt at sympathy ineffective.  During certain moments the protagonist somehow is able to feel the pain of the girl through their Kizna link when from what was explained is impossible, even emotional pain in the last episode, when only the current subjects were able to advance to that level.  In addition, as I mentioned before, she's also willingly keeping the pain of the other previous subjects, which in no instance beforehand was ever hinted to be possible.  Her entire condition was because of a botch, and was something she had no control over.  However, in the final episode, we're told she does have control over it.\\n\\n\r\nSome may argue that the lack of consistency in the setting and it's rules is okay, because it would take away from the character interactions.  However, if your setting is crap, why would the characters be treated any better.  The answer is they aren't.  Late in the story, the focus shifts mainly on the girl from the first experiment and the protagonist's forced romance to her, and away from the six other main characters.  The seven are still in the midst of working out their drama, making this change in direction absurd.  The anime is supposedly about theses seven characters' issues and how they bond through overcoming those problems.  However, their friendship is mostly told, not shown.  The times they are all together are limited, and when they split into smaller groups, it's always with the same people.  There's no diversity.  The reason is for the other forced romances that are again mostly told and not shown.  How forced is it?  They have to have side characters make a character sheet on who likes who, along with expressing how \"obvious\" it was.  The romance is also the main source of drama, as if it needed it.  Seven people are linked to their pain.  They have no clue if these people that forced them into it will keep their word and release them after summer vacation, and constantly have to worry about each others' safety, especially when one of the seven is a masochist.  However, none of these very reasonable issues are utilized.  After their initial abduction and forced cooperation, the main characters just walk off what's happened to them and go home for the day.  The next day, they continue on normally, which is not normal!   They act as if they haven't become lab rats and had their human rights violated. Even when they find out their teacher and counselor are part of the project, they don't act realistically.  Only one of them gets angry; the others are far more subdued and calm.  What's worse is these two characters are only here to give exposition and act like giant scumbags.  It becomes more inconsistent when the counselor suddenly has a change of heart late in the series and believes what they're doing is inhumane and immoral, when she was shown to be able to cross that line well before and not show an ounce of remorse.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver constantly tried to have it's cake and eat it too, even at the cost of situations and reactions being portrayed consistently.  It wants this SoL drama along with an over the top setting and situations, but in attempting to do both, does neither one of them well.  Seriously, in the end, why were none of the committee members arrested!?",

            "content": "So what happens when 7 people, who knows almost nothing much about each other, are forced into a situation where they have to work together, know about each other's past, feeling each other's pain together (both physically and emotionally) and etc.? Well, Kiznaiver shows us how and they did a pretty good job presenting us how\r\n[Story]: (7/10)\r\nOne day Katsuhira, Chidori, and four other teenagers are abducted and forced to join the Kizuna System as official \"Kiznaivers.\" Those taking part are connected through pain: if one member is injured, the others will feel an equal amount of agony. These individuals must become the lab rats andscapegoats of an incomplete system designed with world peace in mind. With their fates literally intertwined, the Kiznaivers must expose their true selves to each other, or risk failing much more than just the Kizuna System.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kiznaiver is nothing new. High school students are forced to be together and they eventually learn about each other and all that crap. I've seen another anime that did pretty much the same thing called \"Kokoro Connect\". The only difference is they literally feel each other's pain and this is just an experiment while Kokoro Connect is some mysterious entity forcing high school friends to work together or else they suffer the \"consequences\".\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the show is decent and much of the show is focused on developing each and every main character in the series. I guess you can say that Kiznaiver has a \"Forced Character Development\". While that may be a bad move for most series, for Kiznaiver, it's not. That's the whole point of the series and it magically works. \\n\\n\r\nMy review for this section will be short since I'll be focusing much of my review on the characters itself. Meaning most of my review will be on the \"Characters\" section. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nI don't know what it is about Trigger's animation that I find so appealing and unique. Maybe it's because the way they draw their characters or how weird the visuals and some of the character designs look. Whatever, it doesn't matter because I weirdly love it for whatever reason. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (8/10)\\n\r\nSome of the OST's stood out like the theme that plays during the action scenes or scenes that has no action but is super intense but for the most part, the soundtrack is just average and not really worth mentioning. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME by Boom Boom Satellites\". The ED theme song is Hajimari no Sokudo\" by Sangatsu no Phantasia\\n\r\n I'm sorry guys but I'm going to be on the minority here and I will say that I hate the OP theme song. It's boring and I don't know what it is about the OP that people find appealing. On the other hand, I love the ED theme song. The singer has a nice voice and there are actual lyrics playing on the song instead of \"Woahhh Layyyy Youuurrrr Haaaaands On Meeee!\" which to me is not an actual song and more like a theme to something. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\n\"Character Development: The Animation\"\\n\r\n^^\\n\r\nIn my opinion, that title fits perfectly on what the show portrayed. When I first watched the series, I knew the character development would be amazing like Kokoro Connect and after 12 episodes, the show proved me right. Literally every single main characters here gets a screentime of their own and they will get a character development. It's like the Kizna Experiment is (not literally) stripping them down and exposing their main flaws and weakness that made them who they are today. Funny because I said the same thing when I wrote a review of Kokoro Connect. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, at first, the characters may come out as either super-cliche or just plain boring but as the series goes on, you'll understand why they're like that and you'll love these characters for who they are. Well, I did anyways. An example is Katsuhira Agata. When I first saw his character in episode 1, I thought he was going to be one of those silent and bland protagonists that we have seen a million times before. I don't know what it is about the silent types in anime that Japanese audiences find appealing but I'm tired of it. Except, he's not your typical silent dude. There's a reason why he's an insensitive and emotionless freak who doesn't feel any pain. They explained in the last 2-3 episodes and to be honest, those episodes were very emotional for me. To think how much kids have suffered just because of the Kizna experiment. \\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver has one -- if not -- the best character introductions I have ever seen in my entire f*cking life. If you check Chibi's episode 2 reaction to Kiznaiver, you can see that I left a comment saying the same thing and apparently, a lot of people agreed with me. Why the hell would I say that though? I'm going to explain. In my 1 year of watching anime, the way they introduced their characters is super boring and filled with expositions that makes it very hard for me to watch the first couple of episodes when I want to watch a new series. Kiznaiver is an exception. It's either introducing yourself to the party or you suffer the consequences. There's an exciting twist that makes Kiznaiver's character introduction so thrilling. Plus, during those character introductions..the experiment exposes that they may seem like your usual cliche characters that fits into one of the character stereotypes but there's a reason why they're even that way in the first place. The writers intended them to be that way and they have a reason why they're like that. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to character drama, not everyone will like it and it is evident (based on what I've read from people's opinions) that the community is split in half when it comes Kiznaivers character drama moments. 50% will like/love it and 50% will not like it because it's too melodramatic for them. If you ask me, I'm kind of on both sides. While I agree that the show's drama is so over the top, like the love triangles and how everyone in the groups loves someone in the group, I also disagree with the fact that Kiznaiver's drama as a whole is melodramatic. Besides the love triangle or pentagram or whatever , the show did a good job with its drama. The dramatic story that I want to use is Maki and her friend Ruru and their relationship. In my opinion, it was very well done. When Ruru showed her feelings to Maki, Maki didn't give her back the same feelings. Even though Maki is in love with Ruru, she didn't want their relationship to go any more further because Maki knows her fate. If she responded to Ruru's feelings, it would have hurt her more emotionally once she dies so she decided to just ignore her. This is actually one of those \"Pick your poison\" moments. If she responded to her feelings then she'd have to endure a more emotional pain once she dies while ignoring her would have caused her emotional pains too but not as hard or as painful as the first one. Their relationship also f*cking hit me right in the center of my heart which still hurts for whatever reason. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nI don't follow Trigger nor do I follow any anime news. So my expectations were at 1% when I first watched the series but after watching the first couple of episodes, I was very surprised. It exceeded my every expectations and after watching Kiznaiver, I expect every author/writer to write an exciting character introduction instead of our usual boring-ass character introduction. In other words, I'm expecting changes. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nKiznaiver was an exciting series to watch and it's a series that I didn't even plan to watch for Spring 2016. It exceeded my every expectations. While the show's plot may be weak, which is the reason why the show's overall score for me is an 8.5, the character development, on the other hand, is amazing. I never expected I would get emotionally invested in most of the main characters, especially Maki and her relationship with Ruru. In my opinion, the show's weakest plot point is its love triangle and some melodramatic scenes. After being disappointed with Trigger's Kill La Kill, Kiznaiver is currently the best show from Trigger. This makes me gain hope for Trigger and makes me excited for their future works. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)  \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Amazing Character Development\\n\r\n+Kiznaiver currently has one of the best character introductions\\n\r\n+Trigger's Unique Animation\\n\r\n+Most Character Dramatic moments are well done\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Weak Plot\\n\r\n-The Love Triangle Plot is completely melodramatic. \\n",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is a show with a fairly interesting premise and some actually quite good art and sound design, which is largely let down by a somewhat flat and rushed plot. To start with, the opening is a trippy experience with some slick visuals and a catchy song and the most memorable part of the show for sure, and I should note it has a pretty nice ED too. The character designs are for the most part pretty good and only Sonozaki is notably generic, and even then it actually works fairly well with her characters. The introduction makes her come off as rather crazy andmenacing and is actually pretty tense for what it is, basically just about revealing a secret about yourself, with characters getting decent starts: Tenga is the loudmouthed, fighting type who wants to live an exciting life and is a nice guy despite being a delinquent, Nico is the crazy girl living in a world of fantasy but is actually lashing out for attention, Chidori the girl with a crush who can't speak out, and so on. Our main hero, Katsuhira, has lost most of his ability to feel pain and so has difficult emphasizing with other people and has become dull of heart. Our heroes are made into Kiznaivers quickly: People who, through science, are bound together to experience each other's pain in order to develope a deeper connection.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary problem the show suffers is simply that the show does not really explore these characters in any depth for the most part, with only Sonozaki, Katsuhira and Maki getting any notable screen time. I feel like this is the fault of the episode length: Only Maki gets a true arc to her and she is notably the best character in the show for this, even if Tenga is pretty fun. Katsuhira and Sonozaki come off as incredibly obnoxious for the first 1/4th of the show, with Sonozaki in particular coming off as extremely evil, but they have backstory that does explain their actions: Katushira frankly still comes off as unlikeable and is my second least favorite character in the show, but Sonozaki's backstory is very reasonable for her actions and frankly it would be weird if she DIDN'T come off as crazy given what it entails, I kind of vaguely liked her in the end aside from some pretty conflicted feelings of parts.\\n\\n\r\nMaki is notable for the fact she gets an actual character arc, which nobody else in the show does, and it is DEFINITELY the high point of the show, with a reasonably done backstory that for the most part does not feel overly melodramatic, is fairly logical and works into the themes of the show. I feel like if the show was about twice as long and had character arcs like this for all of the main characters, it would probably be actually pretty good. Well, maybe not everyone, since Katsuhira and to a lesser extent Chidori's are baked into the plot, but for characters like Nico, Yuta and Hisomu it would have been especially good. Hisomu I particularly feel the need to point out, as he feels quite out of place and pretty much a gag character with his masochistic shtick when he doesn't get any personal developement. Nico also is practically begging for a character arc that could have done wonders for the characters, but she is instead left a one noter. I also applaud Maki's backstory for having a tension/break between two same sex characters not surrounded around gay angst, but instead actual issues between the two, and in fact the show not even bringing attention to it.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, the show isn't amazing, but it does follow logical progression and avoids making too many major mishaps...except in a way the ending. I won't get into it as it would be a lot of spoilers, but the latter 1/4th of the show I am very conflicted on and I feel like it was definitely not the BEST direction to take it, if nothing else it was definitely rushed. I do wish to give the story some props for doing some logical things that many other, better constructed stories I feel don't despite being good ideas: For example, the secret shadowy organization getting their government funding pulled due to being too conspicuous for their results and the resulting actions. Artistically, the show looks quite nicely drawn and rarely suffers off model moments, and I do want to give some sound design props for the cool noises of Kiznaiver effects activating and the like.\\n\\n\r\nIf you see more into the show's characters, then you will likely come to like it more: My personal issue was a lack of character developement and attachment to the characters in a series where such things are VERY important, the crux of it even, and some divided issues about parts of the plot. At 12 episodes, it is certainly worth a watch to decide for yourself, as it is if nothing else technically competent. If the concept was expanded on or redone, I can see something great comint out of it too, so that's a plus.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is a show that has an absurd premise yet fails to deliver because it tries to take itself way too seriously with the melodrama. The main cast are a bunch of eccentrics, some stand out and some feel underwhelming. The stylistic visuals are nice to look at but any other show can uphold that characteristic. The Kizna System is an interesting concept that could have been used as a subversion of \u201cthe bonds of friendship\u201d clich\u00e9, yet it tries to reinforce that very own clich\u00e9 and even wander into romance territory. \r\nThe \u201csharing of pain\u201d is not properly grounded. What if the other persongets sick? Will everyone get sick as well? The limits are not really set yet the show tries to venture towards the emotional territory later on which gets really complicated.  While it does try to promote empathy over sympathy, literally feeling another person\u2019s pain or feeling is not a good way to demonstrate it. The main point of empathy is to understand what someone else\u2019s feeling. This show just forces the character to feel something without really understanding why. Though they try to know the answer of the \u201cWhy do you feel that way\u201d question, they don\u2019t really achieve mutual understanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe show should have just focused on one type of pain and further explore that through frequent character interaction. The background of some characters is pretty good, but the story fails to transform that into good character development. The romance could have been done well if not for the very complicated love web the story presented. All in all, the show had potential if not for the bad direction of the story and the weak foundation of the premise. I could have given it a lower score, but the aspect of enjoyment is still there. There are some good standalone episodes and the show itself is a decent time-waster. I just really believed that the show could have been something greater",

            "content": "As an anime established around people and how those people interact with one another, Kiznaiver\u2019s cast should be memorable and fleshed out. However, for over half the characters, this just doesn\u2019t seem to be the case as they fall short when compared to other anime with similar goals such as Hibike Euphonium and Zankyou no Terror. \r\nIn fact, Kiznaiver flounders in almost every aspect aside from it\u2019s stunning visuals and decent soundtrack. These strengths are made apparent in the anime\u2019s opening theme which pairs a decent and memorable song with flashy visuals that catch the viewer's attention. I think this opening is also full ofmeaning, focusing mainly on the eyes and reflections of the characters showing that the anime itself is about seeing eye to eye. However, after this fabulous opening, the show almost immediately becomes sour.  \\n\\n\r\nWe are introduced to our cast of walking tropes from the airhead loli to the guy who is extremely cold because of some dark event that happened in his past and, like most anime that feature similar tropes, these characters (excluding Maki, which we\u2019ll get to later) barely change from their original state. When we leave off, Niko is still as much an airhead as she was episode 1 and Yoshiharu is still as masochistic as ever. \\n\\n\r\nThough some might fawn over \u201chow unique this anime is making all these different tropes interact\u201d there are actually many other anime that have something similar. This list, though extremely short, includes almost every generic harem that\u2019s come out. It\u2019s no stretch to say that, these interactions are in no way unique and a varied cast can be found in almost any anime made in recent years. \\n\\n\r\nNot only can varied casts be found easily, but so can relationships that are deeper than the ones found in Kiznaiver. Many anime breath life into the relationships the characters have with one another and try to make them as human as possible to best connect the characters to their audience. Kiznaiver, on the other hand, creates empty relationships between its cast. These platonic bonds that were forced upon them through the Kiznaiver system quickly turn into romantic interests. Literally every character is romantically attracted to another, creating a confusing web of love. Though I don\u2019t think a show doing this is necessarily bad, I do believe doing this in a fashion where there is no clear reasoning for said attraction is. Kiznaiver, though an anime about relationships, falls into the latter of the two categories, making this simple, yet devastating mistake. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, these bonds are not the only problem this trainwreck of a cast has. The characters themselves undergoes little to no change throughout the series, the primary exception being Maki who has an entire arc dedicated to her. I found this arc to be the best part of the anime as it fleshed out and gave life to one of the it\u2019s 8 main characters. If the anime had had arcs similar to this one for its diverse cast, I think it would have been much better. Unfortunately, Kiznaiver, most likely due to funding issues which only allowed them a meager 12 episodes, does not do this. It fleshes out Maki in her arc and gives Katsuhira a deep backstory throughout the course of the anime, changing the audience's perspective on him but leaving him relatively unchanged as a whole. However, the rest of the cast is left a mere reflection of their respective tropes. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, the one thing that does remain constant throughout this anime (besides the characters personalities) is it\u2019s art style, bringing us beautiful characters and scenery which are by far some of my favorites. Not only does the art style and animation breath some life into is rather dull cast, but it also remains constant throughout the show. From the fast paced scenes such as when the characters first meet to the slower ones where they\u2019re sitting on a train, I found the images before me to be as stunning and catchy as those presented in the opening. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals alone are no reason to watch a show, however, and Kiznaiver fails to accomplish anything it was aiming for. It had poor writing, poor directing, poor relationships and most of all, poor characters and because it lacked these essentials, I have to say that Kiznaiver is in no way an outstanding show. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

But behind Trigger's beautiful visuals, there just isn't a whole lot else besides an extraordinarily average, if somewhat enjoyable anime-- one that is certainly a noticeable step down from their previous work, Kill la Kill.\r\nThis should not be taken as an insinuation that all Kiznaiver has to offer is style without substance. There is value here, and Trigger has evidently tried to capitalise upon some of Kill la Kill's prior successes, particularly with regards to its characters. Kiznaiver tries-- it tries ever so hard-- but in the end crumbles under its own ambition. Itis an excellent premise that unfortunately never really finds its footing. Were it a full two-cours of content rather than the mere twelve episodes it actually is, the result might have been different.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver's characters are likely the first thing to catch one's attention. They are rich with personality, visually distinct from other characters in anime. There is no one that feels particularly bland (aside from maybe Sonozaki), but a number of them never go much beyond simply looking cool or being weird. Nico is a cute airhead suffering from a variety of mental illnesses (and quite possibly low IQ), while Yoshihara is an extreme masochist who orgasms at the very idea of pain, and exists largely as fuel for shounen-ai fanfiction and doujinshi. The protagonist, Katsuhira, is also a mopey emo kid who lets people beat him up without a care. This is about all that characterises them for the entire show. They are as one-dimensional as can be. It is bit of a waste, given how unique their character designs are. (And I do not only say that because I like twintailed girls named Nico.)\\n\\n\r\nSome characters are more compelling than others. Tenga's dialogue in the original Japanese, for example, is fairly natural and feels like something that could come from an actual teenager's mouth. Chidori, as annoying as her scream-fests tend to be, is also pretty representative of how the average teenage girl handles their emotions. The writers of Kiznaiver know what they are doing and are capable of doing it well, but the problem is that the short episode count prevents these characters from ever realising their full potential. It throws a lot at the viewer, but never gives them time to digest it or room for the characters to breathe and relax. It is, almost invariably, the quiet moments that stand out the most in a story. There are no quiet moments in Kiznaiver.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose it makes sense for something like Kiznaiver to be as short as it is, as Trigger puts a great deal of work and effort into each episode. It obviously shows. But that still does not excuse them creating a story and a cast of characters bigger than they could handle within the allotted time. For something like this, a more briskly-paced movie, perhaps a duology, would have been a better way to compress the story without sacrificing visual quality. But I suppose a movie or two doesn't make quite as much money as five or six over-priced BluRays would. Anime is expensive to make, and Trigger needs to pay its animators so they can eat and have a roof over their head. I get it, but it is still a bit disappointing to see business prioritised over artistic quality in this case. If Trigger saved up extra money for a year or two through smaller projects, and used that to fund an extra cour of Kiznaiver, we would undoubtedly have had a much more exciting product.\\n\\n\r\nSome aspects of Kiznaiver, however, are less the result of its short episode count, and more related to lacklustre writing. Most of Kiznaiver's drama involves angsty, spoiled teenagers overreacting. Being rejected by someone you like is a sucky thing, there is no doubt about that, but it is not the end of the world like Kiznaiver tries to paint it. There are things far worse going on out there, and yet they're traumatised because someone they had a crush on couldn't reciprocate those feelings? Big deal. Give it a couple months and it will barely even cross their mind again. It would be one thing if these feelings were long-term, but for everyone excluding Chidori, they have had these crushes for a few weeks, tops. \\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver tries to create an absurdly complex set of romances. Every character is attracted to someone else, and often the one they love is interested in someone else entirely. With eight main characters and only twelve episodes, you can have a pretty good guess of how well these romances are handled. They get angry, scream and beat each other up when they find out the one they love is being treated poorly by one of the other Kiznaivers, only for another person to get upset in return, and another and another, it raining and dramatic music blasting all the while like the world is on fire and ready to explode. It is extremely difficult to care about their feelings for one another when most of these feelings (particularly surrounding Tenga) have been seldom explored and revealed only one episode beforehand, without so much as an explanation-- or heck, even a hint-- for why they like each other in the first place. Considering the experiment within the show is also manipulating these characters' feelings, the romance doesn't just feel lacklustre-- it feels artificial. Chidori and Katsuhira are about the only couple that make any sense. Everything else is just a big mess that the show could and should have done without.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also quite silly and cloying how emotional 'pain' is shared and hurts them all as well. One of the Kiznaivers is heart-broken, so, hey, that means everyone else must succumb to the feels and suffer from heart-break, too, because emotion is equivalent to physical pain and not at all psychological, or something. There are other scenes, like Chidori confessing to Katsuhira in the middle of a storm (weather in anime being the convenient device that it is), or Yuta and the rest screaming at the top of their lungs and jumping into the river (because that's how you deal with your anger?), that make it quite clear that Kiznaiver is not all too interested in appealing to adults. I can totally understand why someone who is around fourteen-years-old may enjoy and empathise with that sort of thing, but being twenty-three myself, it doesn't warrant much more than a sigh and some head-shaking. For how believable Tenga's and Chidori's characterisation can be, it is a bit disappointing to see the show stray so heavily into melodrama territory. At least Kill la Kill was aware of how blatantly over-the-top it was; Kiznaiver takes itself seriously all the time, and it wants you to take it seriously, too. It forgets how to have fun with itself, and that is perhaps the most disappointing thing of all. \\n\\n\r\nI'll still give Kiznaiver credit for trying. Most of these issues could be resolved simply by the show having more episodes to develop its characters and their feelings in a more meaningful way. It would still not be an anime without significant flaws, as the copious amounts of melodrama make clear, but there certainly was the potential to, if not match Kill la Kill, at least come close to its quality. Kiznaiver looks and sounds so nice that it is easy to forgive some of its issues and enjoy the ride regardless, but, in reflection, there just is not much else to praise aside from that. I really, truly wanted to give Trigger's big new project a glowing review, but I just can't do it. It's not there, and it never gets there. \\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, not everyone is looking for the next greatest thing. Having charm and style alone can please most people, and merely being a standout title within its respective season is enough to warrant a viewing. And, you know, that's perfectly fine. I wouldn't hesitate to give Kiznaiver a recommendation if all the person wants is a few hours of fun and something a little bit different. Because, make no mistake, Kiznaiver is not a bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just an immensely disappointing one.",

Have you ever had an original thought? What if, despite your thought that your idea was original, someone across the globe, someone with whom you have never and will never have contact with had your same idea and yet, weren't able toact on it. Is it still original?\\n\\n\r\nNo matter your definition of original- Trigger continues to pump out quality writing and both new, heretofore unseen content, and new ways of presenting old ideas. This season, they pulled the trigger on a double barrel shotgun of new for the anime viewing populace with the zany Space Patrol Luluco, and the much more subdued Kiznaiver- and what a season it's been.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is what I would describe as a new twist on an old classic. One of the interwoven themes is referenced in both my opening and ending quotes- the power of friendship. Had Trigger just stopped there, they would have produced a trite, unimaginative, and unfulfilling series much like those that crop up each season. Kiznaiver is not content to merely focus on the power that friends hold over you, but also delve into deeper concepts of pain and loss, the stages of grievance, and the ties that bind.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the multifaceted Kill La Kill before it, Kiznaiver tackles these themes with depth and sophistication. Conversations that outwardly appear to be simple exchanges between friends often reveal much more about the characters and their mentalities. The characters themselves also outwardly seem to represent the kind of one note stereotype- Katsuhira the unfeeling, dull, mophaired main character. Chidori the tsun tsun. Nico the genki girl, etc. However simply the characters are presented in the beginning, throughout the course of the show, we watch them grow as people, friends, and characters. In the early episodes, we see the group forced together as part of some sick social experiement- a disparate group of persons from different cliques, if you will, thrown together and told to \"become friends\" (whether through traumatic shared experiences, which has been proven to form bonds between people who might not otherwise associate- such as in fraternity hazing, gang initiation, etc. or the typical socialization process that people go through.) \\n\\n\r\nWe get to know the person of the characters, what drives them, their insecurities, wishes, and failures. Each has their turn in the spotlight, and as the viewer, I felt like most of these characters, even though many had larger than life personalities, could have been real people. They don't have superpowers. They aren't infallible, neither are they perfect. They don't win every time, and the certainly don't all get along perfectly, kiss and make up after every little thing. Like real friends with disparate interests, they get on each other's nerves, hurt each other (in more ways than one) fall in love, fall out, make each other cry, and experience life together. Trigger, in all their savviness, also recognized the potential for relationships in the show, and makes moves for different character romances to happen, fall apart, and change. It's not your typical ensemble where the bland, self insert protagonist has color coded dereotype ladies throwing themselves at him for no reason. No, Kiznaiver takes a more nuanced approach, and the characters have viable, believable reasons (some are not pretty, just like life) for being interested in each other like mutual interests, pure pity, opposites attracting, and finding kinship. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the show takes a backseat to characterization in what's known as a \"character driven story\", which is also something of a rarity in anime these days. It's not all about some grand scheme or hero's journey, but about the interaction of the characters themselves that matter. As mentioned above, I think that the characters experience the five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) throughout the show, as a theme. As part of the Kizna experiment (linking people through sharing pain), these kids in the story, through their own relationships and getting to know themselves and the people around them, experience these stages as part of their characterization. Each is in denial over some reason or another, whether it's \"how could my friend have died?\" or \"this person loves me, they just don't know it\", etc. This progresses as the story heats up- they're angry over their inner demons, and it spills out onto each other- until the voices of reason, Hisomu and Nico bring them all to their senses (bargaining). After the climax of the show, they all decidedly experience a strong depressive episode, where the characters decide what they're going to do with themselves, and about each other- having made themselves vulnerable and revealing their secrets to each other. Eventually they come to accept each other, and the story takes its final twist, which would be criminal of me to reveal. Suffice to say, it's certainly worth watching to find out. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Kiznaiver is also excellent, with the flair Trigger has for small details, and making their characters look fresh and interesting. There are a lot of stylings of Little Witch Academia, especially the hair, but still very within the modern style. It's crisp, clean, and flows well, but the lighting is really something. Reflections, eyes, and anything lit look really great, drawing attention to details and adding depth to the shot composition. I applaud the casting director at Trigger, whoever they are- for they have done it again. Similarly to Kill La Kill, Kiznaiver is impeccably cast. The nuance and emotion (or required lack thereof) that was put into the performances really sells the drama and characters. The larger than life Tenga, fragile Maki, zany Nico, wacky Hisomu, hot and cold Chidori, stiff Katsuhira, and mysterious Noriko (and some nice performances from the supporting cast as well) all add up to a very well produced product. \\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr for my lazy folk\\n\\n\r\n+ great characterization\\n\r\n+ fantastic art\\n\r\n+ a human drama, one that you can get behind, that doesn't descend in to pointless melodrama\\n\r\n+/- your favorite characters might not get together\\n\\n\\n\r\nFriends are soy sauce!

            "content": "Forced drama, what does it entail? Is it the act of searching for genuine emotion in a place that never offered it? Is it not understanding the limitations of your screenplay? Perhaps it comes from honest attempts to create something organic. Whatever the reason may be, when it happens, it doesn't leave a good aftertaste. \r\nSo which is it for Kiznaiver? Is it truly trying to craft something memorable? Is it seeking poignancy in the anguish of others? Is it studio Trigger trying to branch out into unfamiliar territory; a leap of faith, hoping their dedicated followers would comfort them when they fall on theirfaces? And really, should I care, even if they did attempt something out of a place of honest effort? Well, short answer, fuck no. \\n\r\nI don't need to babysit a half-baked effort. I don't need to try to empathize with a failed project that slipped out of the creators' hands. As harsh as that mentality may be, it's the honest truth. I'm the consumer. The only thing required of me is to be entertained and engrossed by the project they put forward. And guess what? I wasn't. In fact, I was mentally drained by this synthetic try-hard and its relentless efforts to pull at my heartstrings; operating with as much subtlety as a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade trying to sneak down Central Park West. A good concept doesn't make a good anime and Kiznaiver embodies that very notion. The message it chose to convey was fine, but the way it went about delivering it was the problem.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sickeningly idealistic attempt to bring forth \"world peace\" and a greater level of understanding among humanity, the Kiznaiver project was created to combine the shared pain of its placeholders by linking their sensory output together. The more these placeholders are made to open up to each other, the deeper their connection becomes; experiencing everything from the surface-level physical pain, to more emotional-based pain, as the walls that separate them dissipates. \\n\\n\r\nIf the premise wasn't made explicit enough already, it's essentially one big character study and self-examination of human relationships. And it should go without saying, but whenever topics like these are made your primary focus, there are some prerequisites expected of it in order for it to function with any semblance of validity. You can't go swimming without a pool of water, and in the same light, you can't have a character study without characters. Notice I wrote \"characters\" NOT \"caricatures,\" a distinction that Kiznaiver can't seem to make. \\n\\n\r\nIf Kiznaiver had an extended title, it would go something along the lines of:\\n\r\n\"Kiznaiver: Forcing Archetypes to have Da Feels\" \\n\\n\r\nThese color-coordinated caricatures are so cookie-cutter by storytelling standards that you could sum them all up with one-liners. They're basically human smurfs, each feeding into pre-assigned roles with little in the way of diversifying their default archetypes. Instead of swimming in a pool of water, Kiznaiver attempts to achieve the same feat with a pit full of dirt. A task that's not only nigh impossible but also painful to watch play out as well. Archetypes are meant to serve as default personalities to further build upon. To simply present them as is without building on who they are as characters is not only conceited, it's borderline delusional when taking into consideration the importance that the characters hold in the confines of this material. This isn't an action adventure where the world being trekked is the star attraction, it's a character study, a CHARACTER study. If there's one aspect of your screenplay that you want to shine the most, it's in this department. And yet, redhead tsunderes are pre-packaged in this anime in the same way every live-action movie and TV drama depiction of high school has the popular blonde cheerleader and varsity-jacket-wearing jock. \\n\\n\r\nSo when these non-entities are placed in a situation where they're forced to open up to each other, there's very little that could be done to divert the audience's attention from the obvious truth. That truth being that there's nothing to truly pull from these \"characters\" since there was nothing there from the beginning. The show desperately attempts to squeeze a modicum of emotion from this dirt pit, and when that plan fails, we're brought back to my original inquiry. This anime is strong-armed into producing something it never had to begin with; genuine emotion. \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, there are transient glimpses of decent writing in this dirt pit of a cast, that coming in the form of one character, Honoka Maki. If there was ever a character in this show that Kiznaiver didn't butcher with its ineptitude, Honoka was it. With the introduction of her backstory, as well as the time dedicated to exploring her psyche, she stands out like a sore thumb, especially when placed in her vapid surroundings. Had the show handled its cast with the same amount of effort and care as it did with her, I would have been singing a different tune. But this sadly isn't the case, and just as quickly as Honoka's character focus brought hope to the show, it's immediately snuffed out as the artificial angst surrounding every other facet of the screenplay further plunges the material back to the subpar levels that it was constructed out of. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to offer any other appraisal outside of this temporary moment of decent writing, it would be that of the art and animation department. Unlike the rest of the show, this area demonstrated the talent found at Trigger that they accumulated from their time spent at Gainax. The color palette used was radiant and immediately draws the viewer's attention. With storyboarding that kept a sense of flow in mind and a decent amount of consideration made in its use of color theory, there was clearly more effort here than what's usually expected out of typical studio projects. The same could be said (for the most part) about the character designs. While some were painfully by-the-numbers, others were quite expressive and easily identifiable. At the end of the day, these designs are wasted on cookie-cutter archetypes, but they're still appealing nonetheless. \\n\r\nOne a side-note, for readers who've already seen Kizanaiver, the designs of the gomorin outfits take clear inspiration from the Maromi doll in Paranoia Agent. Perhaps this was done so as a tribute to Satoshi Kon, given his extensive work in the field that the show is trying to dive into. Whatever the case may be, it was a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nAnother detail that, while not innovative, still deserves mentioning was the color of the characters' hair. Katsuhira's hair\u2014which was supposed to show someone close to complete apathy\u2014was represented with pure white hair overlapped with some brown, with the white representing an absence of emotion and the brown being the faint presence of it still left within him. The same could be said about Niko's hair, which obviously denotes to the flamboyancy of her personality given the diverse, bright colors. Again, pretty simple in how the hair color denotes their traits, but still worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, there isn't much to say. The only thing that sticks out is the opening theme \"LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME\" by BOOM BOOM SATELLITES, and rightfully so, given the infectious nature of it in accompaniment with the visuals presented. This could be attributed to the fact that sonically it has much in common with one of pop's more recognizable tunes \"Take on Me\" by a-ha. At the time of this writing, a quick youtube search of \"Kiznaiver take on me\" would bring you to a video that exploits this, merging the song with Kiznaiver's opening, demonstrating just how interchangeable it really is. That being said, BOOM BOO SATELLITES certainly delivered. Everything else in the sound department is forgettable by comparison. The only other thing worth taking note of is the sound effects used at times; like the glitchy noise made whenever the Kiznaiver device was activated, or the added sound effects given for objects when motioned. It was minor inclusions but still did something for the show than had it been excluded. \\n\\n\r\nNow, what should have been excluded but ultimately made the final cut was a love heptagon. Not a regular one-way love, not a love triangle, but a full-blown love heptagon! And what happens when you involve a bunch of dimensionless smurfs in an ouroboros-like relationship? You get an embarrassing display of cardboard cutouts inserts pleading to each other. A potpourri of ill-advised confessionals that transformed itself into a deformed, blubbering mess. There's very little in the way of actual characterization for these mouthpieces with legs, so expecting them to divulge genuine feelings for each other just comes across as half-assed. Some characters don't even have much in the way of one-on-one interaction prior to these events either, and those that do get that time barely share any semblance of chemistry. This made what was suppose to be emotional climaxes in the story, into an over-bloated cringe-filled sob-fest. This was midday soap opera levels of awful. \\n\\n\r\nThe show steamrolls through all of this melodrama and artificial angst in order to deliver a message that no one needed help figuring out in the first place; getting closer to others runs the risk of eventually being hurt by them. This isn't exactly an eye-opening revelation, this is just common sense. But what's possibly worse than off of this is the fact that what Kiznaiver struggles to deliver in 12 episodes, is easily understood with just 1. This 1 episode I speak of is the TV pilot of Kino's Journey. Watch those 20 minutes and save yourself hours of seeing a show drown in the kiddie pool section. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI told myself, as well as a few colleagues, that I wasn't going to review this, due in large part to the fact that just talking about it made me feel mentally exhausted. But then I thought about what it would mean for those people that share my stance but can't quite articulate the reason for why they feel the way they do. I thought about our perspective going unheard in the frenzy of hype and unchecked evaluations. Letting Kiznaiver get off scot-free to gain unwarranted appraisal became far bigger of a burden than simply ignoring it to comfortably go about my way. And so, here I am, writing this review for all those, who like me, are tired of these empty vessels being filled with accolades it doesn't deserve. The only emotional response that Kiznaiver got right was that of frustration, as that's precisely what I felt while watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is fine until it gets into the character drama, and seeing that the whole show revolves around character drama, you could see how that leaves very little in the way of value. Had the characters been handled better, had the concept not been bare-bones, had the writers tried a bit harder, then maybe, just maybe, there would have been something here worth talking about. But that wasn't the case, and Trigger, once again, \"saves anime!\"\\n\\n\r\n\"The show wasn't that good, but the opening was so nice though!\" How many more times do we have to make this statement before we let insufferable titles like these crash and burn? How many more times would we equate trying with being good enough? The only good that Kiznaiver can offer is serving as a future example of what forced melodrama looks like. With that being said, ignore this one if you haven't already, it's a practice in tolerance-control that would only serve as a distraction from watching something else that's truly worth your invested time.",

            "content": "Have you ever wondering how it must feel when one of your friends or loved ones are in despair? When they\u2019re having a despondent day? Well, look no further because Kiznaiver portrays this theme, and I mean literally.  \r\nKiznaiver is an anime revolving around bonds through pain and sentiment. The story circulates around that of our main protagonist, Katsuhira Agata, a modest, slow teenage boy that grasps no emotions within his hands, accordingly making himself a bullying target. However, the bullying that consistently approaches him from every direction is beyond his concerns and most notably, his pain.  Him, alongside with 5 other teenagers\u2019wounds are connected through the Kizna system and are obligated to bond for the sake of creating \u201cWorld peace\u201d. And so, their journey begins. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I must say, Kiznaiver is an anime I saw one of the brightest potential in, however, was abstracted by various divisions. Whenever it was character development or drama, the manner Kiznaiver executed this is what made itself abstracted from a rather good conception. Many like to say this is a character-based show so they are going to get more profound of the characters than any other department in the show, but even then, Kiznaiver fails abominably at this. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe the characters using three adjectives, they would be \u201cmild, archetypal, and caricatured\u201d The characters were first given archetypical roles, initially seen as symbolism, which I had no concerns for, however, the characters just started to use that as their foremost individualities, never actually getting in-depth of the traits and explaining why they maintain such. Alternatively, this started to define the characters themselves and the purpose they bring to the plot. Niko and Tenga, for most of the series existed, only to slap in some eccentric yet cartoonish comedy in there, but only came irksome and unnecessary, leaving room for its incompatible tonal dissonance. Kiznaiver genuinely knew what they were doing, thus far were oblivious about the fact that it\u2019s never going to work. Kiznaiver knew that it wanted to be witty at times, whilst simultaneously being serious, yet merely making the story paradoxical. The way serious scenes would modify itself into comedic ones was awkward and off. Kiznaiver couldn\u2019t handle both, therefore making the tonal shifts cringeworthy.\\n\\n\r\nThe only characterized really are Honoka, Katsuhira (fairly) and Sononaki, yet they still don\u2019t possess strong characterization. Katsuhira and Sonozaki were the only crucial characters of the show and would have still been proficient of creating a story with just the two of them. The rest of the cast didn\u2019t live up to their significance, let alone nearly, and that\u2019s what I found dissatisfying about Kiznaiver. If every single character were presented exactly like how Honoka was, this series would have left me with a different impression, potentially increasing its score from me. Hisomu was a random guy in the background educating a few life lessons to these youngsters but served no purpose whatsoever.  The finale of Kiznaiver entirely explained the significance of our cast; A bunch of kids that just added their two cents to Katsuhira and Sonozaki\u2019s association without it actually making that much of an impact, and additionally their personal issues being irrelevant, which brings me to explain the execution of drama in this series. \\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver must be an anime that secondly enthrals and is reliant on drama for its series, considering the fact that it\u2019s a character-based show, however, even its drama was horribly done. Albeit, I can comprehend the fact that they\u2019re just average teenagers so they are bound to create conflicts; it\u2019s only natural for them to do so, however, not one speck of maturity was balanced with the juvenility of the quarrels. Example would be Chidori\u2019s issues. Instead of it being a bunch of sixteen years olds arguing about their love interests, it was something that a bunch of twelve years old would be arguing about.  Moreover, the love interests were either absurd, lacking or arbitral.  Nico liking Tenga had to be the most illogical, a relationship that was barely transparent and developed. Kacchon and Chidori was a relationship that was hard to care for because they\u2019ve barely exposed their relationship before the Kizna system. Instead, we\u2019re just left to imagine and presume how strong their relationship must be. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization and the character interaction within the show were born out of compulsion as a way to move the plot forward, merely making the characters plot devices. A great example of this is episode two, where the characters were forced to reveal a secret of theirs, which I found quite rough. Kiznaiver wanted to impatiently force development out of our characters and rapidly reach the good part of the story, thus giving a reason to these \u201crequired missions\u201d or \u201cserved punishments if something is not achieved\u201d As much as this made the story engaging, it just came redundant. The same results would have still been created if the characters were simply left to unravel their way out of the system or getting profound of each other. The secrets and authentic identities were proficient of unfolding itself but Kiznaiver were too impatient.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver already has an implausible conception, yet is very questionable. They\u2019re already aware of the failure the experiment has brought prior to other children that initially were a part of the research, so why do they revive it again on other kids? Initially, the experiment became extremely hazardous and was nowhere near creating \u201cworld peace\u201d from the looks of it, so why would it be smart to do it again? Moreover, Kiznaiver never gets in-depth of how connecting pain equates to world peace, but rather they just state it will. Kiznaiver doesn\u2019t try to bring coherence to an already puzzling idea. I am very aware of the fact that the whole point of the show was to show the faults of the idea, but they never really try to fully clarify the agenda from the very beginning. \\n\\n\r\nThe effort put into Kiznaiver is very transparent and I support it for doing that. The distinctive turn they wanted to add to their story with the connecting pain and all boasted Kiznaiver up, however, ever so slightly failed itself from the inconsistencies. Kiznaiver prioritised the artistic merits in contrast to all the existing departments, just like what any average modern anime would do really. Not that it\u2019s a problem with bring bigger significant to the visuals of the show, but to not show as much importance to the characters and story is what Kiznaiver performed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was very satisfying yet aspiring. It had a very crispy and sharp design to it. The backdrops basically go by what I\u2019m saying, very distinguishing and never felt boring. The character designs were fine, and I mean, really fine. Very distinguishable and was very defining. Each character has an exhilarating look to them and was pleasing to the human eyes. They looked exactly by their characteristics and their personalities were easy to presume. The colour palette was very strong and bright and the animation ran smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nWell done BOOM BOOM SATELLITES and Sangatsu no Phantasia by genuinely going by your intended purpose. They rightfully went by what it means to create an opening and an ending, thus making it very appropriate.  An opening is to grip you into the series and places a significant role by entertaining your audience into watching more; the Kiznaiver opening ideally went by that. An ending is meant to relax the viewer and conclude them that the episode was nicely completed; the Kiznaiver ending also ideally went by that. However, the only trouble I have with the opening is how unmemorable it is. As Zeph stated, the only unforgettable line in the opening is \u201cLAY YOUR HANDS ON ME\u201d Other than that, it\u2019s fine.\\n\\n\r\nKaji Yuki, you shady monkey.  His performance was not particularly extraordinary, but most definitely stood out than the rest. I absolutely love how Kaji Yuki can just adjust his voice in order to fit the character, completely making him distinguishable from his most popular roles. Kaji Yuki is like a person that can just hide behind characters without knowing it\u2019s him. His voice was perfect for Agata and convinced me into liking it, a lot.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to expect and personal enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nBut the real question is, did I enjoy this?\\n\\n\r\nNot necessarily. It has to do with the fact that Kiznaiver vaguely touched upon its default genres, hence why I couldn\u2019t get profound of it. It was hard for me to articulate the message that Kiznaiver was trying to depict because so many things distracted it. There were nothing for me to get in-depth with really, but rather I just started watching the show with enjoyment in my mind. Kiznaiver is fairly a dumb watch. If you want an anime for its exhilaration and fun, Kiznaiver is for you. If you\u2019re looking for any perception of our characters and story, you\u2019re not going to find that here\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver should have been a 24 episode long series and more considerate with where it story and point goes. This show only wears the name of it being character-based and dramatic but it poorly conveys that. This show technically done what death parade done; a poor story in which its opening saves itself from hate and is seen as good in the majorities\u2019 eyes. Kiznaiver is yet another anime that had potential, however just didn\u2019t go by it. \\n\\n\r\n Negatives\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tincompatible yet irritating tone dissonance \\n\r\n\u2022\tImplausible and vague conception. \\n\r\n\u2022\tObligated character interaction and characterization \\n\r\n\u2022\tPurposeless or one-dimensional cast \\n\r\n\u2022\tMelodramatic, no maturity balanced with childishness \\n\\n\r\nPositives\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tEffort \\n\r\n\u2022\tSatisfying art and animation \\n\r\n\u2022\tAppropriate music\\n\r\n\u2022\tKaji Yuki \\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver = Overall 4/10",

            "content": "Why do we hurt each other? Have you ever walked by a couple on the street, bickering and arguing, and suddenly wondered why people are so keen on making each other suffer? Why is it that we feel so frustrated seeing someone get viciously angry in an argument, yet when we\u2019re actually a part of the argument, we feel justified to do so? Why is it that when we witness conflicts revolving around things we deem insignificant, we think people are ultimately petty, yet we have arguments equally as petty all the time? Why is it that we feel so frustrated when someone talks behindour backs, yet we tend to do the same to others? These are the common hypocrisies which are the unfortunate circumstance of not being able to truly understand each other. Everyone thinks differently, feels differently, loves different, and hates differently. You can\u2019t expect to know everything that\u2019s going on in someones head, and trying to base your friendships, conflicts, and discussions on assumptions like this will no doubt cause trouble.\\n\\n\r\nBut\u2026 what if we could? What if we could understand everything that someone thinks and feels? If we could get so impossibly close to someone, would we ever argue? Would we ever hate each other? I mean, how could we? If someone is basing their arguments on certain emotions that we can ALSO feel, how could we disagree? We can\u2019t really agree, either, but when we manage to understand them on such a fundamental level, it\u2019s hard to know what exactly would happen between us.\\n\\n\r\nHow about we take this a step further: What if everyone in the world could feel every bit of physical and emotional pain together. Would there be no wars? No conflicts? World peace? This may seem a bit ridiculous, but it\u2019s the main idea of Kiznaiver.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, this idea is only cool on paper. What could have been an excellent character study turned out to be no more than a melodramatic trainwreck with very few redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nTerrible Execution\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe thought of what Kiznaiver was trying to accomplish and the original ideas it had are still intriguing. It's incredibly interesting to think about what would happen if a group of people did share their pains, and if done with better direction, it could have been a fantastic anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, the show takes itself in the most boring direction possible. It's got a stupidly complex love story, it focuses on certain characters and leaves others in the dust, and some have nice arcs while others don't even get arcs. Maki got a very long arc yet Niko got absolutely nothing, and not only did Niko get absolutely nothing, she got development that was based around her unexplained love for another character. It can't help but feel like Kiznaiver would have done much better if it were longer. It's hard to develop that many characters in 12 episodes and that was the biggest problem I had. However, it does a pretty okay job of developing the characters it favors. Maki's and Katsuhira's backstories are the best parts of the show. It's sad to think that we could have gotten an interesting backstory on five of the other characters if the creators thought to lengthen the series. Disregarding the mini-arcs, the plot itself is unsatisfactory as a whole. The direction of the series towards the end wasn't as interesting as I had hoped, and the way they executed the final minutes feels like a cop out compared to what could have been.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStereotypical Characters\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nA friend of mine praised Kiznaiver's \"colorful\" cast of characters and claimed they loved how different they are from one another and how much variety the creators put into them to make them stand out from each other.\\n\\n\r\nSure, I can agree.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is full of contrasting characters, I didn't find a moment where I thought any character was similar and that's a very important part of the story. All seven are supposed to be incompatible or else this experiment wouldn't work the way the scientists hoped. However, them being different from one another does not make them good.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is full of tropes. They may be different from each other and they may vary in personalities but they never stray outside of their tropes. They're trapped inside of their stereotypes and almost all of their actions are unsurprisingly predictable. Some characters got developed but even then a majority of the characters were never touched upon. Trigger plays favorites with their cast and anyone who watched the show would understand that. Specific episodes were made developing Maki and Katsuhira, yet not a single second was spent developing Hisomu. He was comedy relief and poor comedy relief at that. To make matters worse, the romance between the characters was the most frustrating aspect. The creators just forced every character to fall in love with each other in an attempt to create drama. There's absolutely no basis to these feelings and the characters seem to think \"it was obvious that they were in love with you\" yet none of it is noticeable besides from Chidori's love for Katsuhira. The characters have their moments and they're entertaining to watch, but as soon as the drama starts it all hits the fan.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nForced Drama\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver displays copious amounts of drama that originates from nothing logically sound. Characters will do things for no obvious reason, which creates problems that favors the writers ongoing story. Similar to what I said early, the forced romance induces forced drama which in turn makes everything unbearable. There are a lot of moments where a character will start a conflict because of their \"love\" for someone which in most cases, makes no sense. Tenga hated Katsuhira because of what he \"did\" to Chidori and at first it made sense but even after hearing all about Katsuhira's backstory, he was still pissed off for no obvious reason. There's also how Niko was so sad about Tenga loving Chidori even though there's is absolutely no reason for Niko to love Tenga. It is never explained and Niko went so far as to take drastic actions based on something that was never developed. How does that make sense? One episode Niko wasn't in love with anyone, next episode she was full blown in love with Tenga. The only parts of the romance that felt justified was Chidori loving Katsuhira, and Katsuhira loving Noriko. I would also count Yuta's fixation with Maki but that seemed more like lust than love in my eyes. It feels like Trigger really wanted every character to have a romantic interest so they just forced the romance onto everyone else. It was baffling and without a doubt one of the most annoying parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou're probably thinking, \"people do overly-dramatic shit for stupid reasons all the time\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is true, however, if you ask any of these people they will always give you a reason. If you ask anyone in love, they will always give you a reason. Even if it's a stupid reason or over simplified, it's still what drives them. Kiznaiver makes absolutely no attempt to show or tell us why certain characters do the things they do, or why certain characters love the people they love. For some characters, you can deduce reasoning behind their actions, but for others you might as well guess.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAesthetic\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is beautifully illustrated and the soundtrack is likable, as expected of Trigger. Character designs look much different from your typical anime and the art-style itself feels much different than typical Trigger titles (which is what a lot of anime studios struggle accomplishing)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the opening is fucking fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nRidiculous Inconsistencies\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver felt like it was doomed from the start. When you look at a studio like Trigger and consider the idea of them making a science fiction drama, it seems a bit insane. If you've ever seen a Trigger anime, you would know that they're usually full of the most ridiculously goofy content in the industry. The titles that come out of Trigger are usually never meant to be taken seriously with the exception of shows like Kill la Kill, but even that wasn't serious most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver tries it's best to retain those goofy elements that made me like Kill la Kill, but it just doesn't work out well. It's hard to sit through a really dramatic scene and then half a minute later something unbelievably silly happens. It's seriously risky to mix drama with over the top goofiness and expect it to work out well. Some anime like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann do this very well, but it's a rare occurrence. In the end it feels like the creators of this show clashed with creative differences and had no idea what they wanted it to be. It often made me wonder if I should laugh at something or if it should be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThere are specific scenes that seriously stand out from the rest, though. A few parts made my skin crawl and I felt goosebumps all over my body. Unfortunately, the immersion quickly breaks when something stupid happens.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver shines every once in a while but for the most part watching it was frustrating. It had moments where it seemed like it could be great but in the end it disappointed me beyond belief. The stupid drama, nonsensical romance, and underdeveloped characters took away any semblance of enjoyment that was present. For the most part, it's still worth a watch simply because the parts that shine happen to shine very brightly. The comedy is enjoyable and the characters spasms are always fun to watch, but once it gets to the drama it's usually unbearable. Kiznaiver would have worked better as a goofy slice of life rather than the melodramatic train wreck it became. Either that, or the writers at least trying to fix their mistakes especially since this show had an insane amount of potential.\\n",

            "content": "Something something, anime is saved. Except that\u2019s for Luluco.\r\nWelcome to Keeeeeeeeeznaiver, the new full-length anime series from the meme machine known as Studio Trigger, where we come together and cut our pain into pieces. You might be thinking that this show is edgy. And it totally is. But then you watch red-headed Kamina punch someone in the face with his ass and then teabag him, and it\u2019s reassuring that this is gonna be much more light-hearted than you\u2019d expect.\r\nGoing more into detail about what this madness is about, it\u2019s easily one of the lamest concepts presented in a while. It\u2019s about seven weirdos who getlinked together through pain; as in, when one of them receives physical pain, it gets distributed to the other six. And then they\u2019re tasked to live their summer vacations while getting thrust into some weird challenges and relationships. \\n\\n\r\nOh, but don\u2019t cringe just yet, it gets even better! The Kizna system (which is the thingy that does the pain thingy) is deeper and more complicated, as the Kiznaivers (the weirdos with the pain thingy) eventually start to share emotional pain, or more specifically, heartache.\\n\\n\r\nAs terrible as this sounds, it\u2019s presented and written pretty well. First off is that the characters and their interactions with each other are Kiznaiver\u2019s bread and butter, not so much the system thing. While it certainly has an impact on them and the plot itself, I was undoubtedly watching Kiznaiver for the people, not the ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that I respect is how the KeezNuts system is presented to the audience. A lot of series tend to sell you on concept alone, they\u2019ll just throw their \u201cbrilliant\u201d idea in your face and then spend the next eleven episodes on the different ways they can make it work. Kiznaiver gives us the idea in portions, acclimating the audience to reduce the amount of groans in the first episode as little as possible. I guarantee you that, if the \u201cvoice of the heart\u201d thing was displayed in the first three episodes, this show wouldn\u2019t have been as big of a deal as it is. (Unless you\u2019re in Japan. Nice 600 sales rip trigger) But since the story spends time getting you hooked on the characters instead, they raise the bar when the time is right and make seem like it\u2019s not as silly as it is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, the series will more-or-less live or die by your opinions on the trope-y characters. The MC Katsuhira is probably the least amusing, being a walking bag of nothing. Literally. His personality is that he has no personality. Aren\u2019t we off to a great start?\\n\r\nHe actually isn\u2019t some sort of self-insert light novel fuckboy, and there are good reasons for him to act the way he\u2026 well he doesn\u2019t really act like anything, but you get the point. But it\u2019s pretty easy to get bored of him, and even his bigger, more emotional moments rarely come through unless he does a full 180, unlike Nico.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, Nico\u2019s the super-peppy girl with the candy-colored-hair that will probably come off as annoying to others, but for me I\u2026 actually found her to be the best. While she is one of those characters that apparently needs to say something at every waking moment, I\u2019m surprised by how not excessive she was. And being the clumsy, ditzy, idiot character that she is, her big emotional moments DO come through, and in a very big way. \\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t go into detail about everyone, but almost every character was a lot of fun in some way. While they don\u2019t have much of a personality beyond their basic tropes, watching them do shit together was a blast. It actually makes me wish I was part of their group in some way, which is something I rarely feel. And it makes me remind myself that, oh no, I don\u2019t actually have friends. Sasuga, Trigger. Perhaps if we were given more than twelve episodes, a lot more could\u2019ve been done with the characters, but it is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nBut here\u2019s the part that\u2019s undeniably true: the production of this anime is fucking fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs have a lot of\u2026 well, character. They\u2019re colorful, they\u2019re unique, and they have that \u201canime\u201d feel without being over-the-top. Just look at the Gomorins. How can anyone hate these fuckers? Sometimes it feels that the models are a little off; dimensions are slightly distorted, hair is more like a twisty piece of metal than hair, but I more-or-less ignored that, as it adds to the overall nature of both the designs and the show. Not only that, but Kiznaiver takes place in a rather beautiful city, and so background art doesn\u2019t lack any inspiration either. Good direction makes the visuals rather telling, with effective shot compositions and great body language and visible motions. On top of that, the animation, actual movement, is very smooth despite the complex aesthetics. All in all, it\u2019s safe to say that Kiznaiver has a lot of ambition with its art.\\n\\n\r\nBut the underdog of Kiznaiver is its FUCKING AMAZING soundtrack. Holy shit. Much of it is electronic, whether at a driving pace or quietly lingering in the background, but the orchestral scores hit hard. VERY hard. And one of the most interesting things is how some parts will be reversed, as to compliment a dissonant scene where the emotions aren\u2019t at a great place and relationships are breaking apart. No insert songs are found in here, just a beautiful composition that sounds perfect at every moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are no slouches, either. In fact, I daresay that A-ha\u2019s \u2018Take On Me\u2019 is the best OP of the season.\\n\r\nAlright, it\u2019s actually Boom Boom Satellites and the song is called \u2018Lay Your Hands On Me\u2019, I\u2019ll respect them since this is their last work. But lemme just say that I\u2019ve never been a fan of these guys. They\u2019re kinda out of my comfort zone, and I just think they sound like crap most of the time. But this one song here actually clicks; it puts you in a sweet, yet subtly melancholic trance as dizzying lights and incredibly smooth character animation arrests you visually. Put them together and you have an OP that feels unlike any other, whether you appreciate it or not. \\n\r\nAnd to close each episode off, a pleasant alt-rock song by Sangatsu no Phantasia, whoever the fuck that is, leaves a bit of a hopeful atmosphere right before the next episode\u2019s preview, as we get more shots of the beautiful characters holding flowers. Because, why not. It has a bright tone with its crystal-clear vocals and vibrant piano and violins playing over the band. Yet, it doesn\u2019t feel overpowering or generic, it strikes a nice balance.\\n\\n\r\nSo, uh. I bet a lot of people aren\u2019t gonna agree with a lot of this, and I\u2019m completely willing to admit that Kiznaiver is a flawed show and a lot of people will/do hate it, but I greatly appreciate what Kiznaiver set out to do and accomplished. This isn\u2019t Monogatari or anything, but I\u2019ll take it over most of the other shows that came out this season.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nShipping - Teamblueallday/10\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 5\\n\r\nFavorite character - Nico\\n\r\nRecommendation level - High",

            "content": "SPOILERS! (RE-UPLOAD)\r\nHave you ever planned to watch an anime with no expectation then it impressed you so much? For me, Kiznaiver is the first anime in that situation.\r\nI read the synopsis of it and found it interesting but thought it would probably be really bad. When I watched the first episode I was impressed and it was interesting. Then I continued and ''Now, this is really good.''\r\nThe thing that I liked most about the anime is everything fits the anime nearly perfectly. The art, the music, the characters, everything... Just give the director his award already!\r\nEvery episode I get sad because I think ''This probablywill be the best episode, I don't think they are able to make better episodes.'' then next episode I live the same situation. Seriously how can an anime  get so much better in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I have to mention about Kizuna System. So, if I understood correctly, The main purpose of the system is ensuring peace. If people connect to each other and share their pains they will understand each other's feelings too. As a result, there will be peace. Am I right?\\n\r\nSo a group of teenagers are connected to each other, and they share the pain and emotions under the name of ''Kizuna System''. I have to say the story is really interesting. The dominant part is the mystery, ''What is this system?'' ''What is the purpose?'' ''What happened to Sonozaki?''. These questions were the ones I was mostly curious about and I'm really happy they all solved. It is kinda slow pacing, most of the questions are answered at the end of the anime (I mean last 3 episodes) and before those episodes, the anime was full of character developments, comedy and drama. This anime is actually based on the characters and all episodes are plotting the characters and their feelings so about story being interesting is enough. And it's getting more and more interesting every episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't imagine a better art style for this anime. It could be just good for another anime but it gives you the feel like it is created just for this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, the first thing impressed me in the anime is the opening. When I first watched it, the animation and its style made me feel like I was reborning. So, did the music. I wanted the opening to last forever, I wanted it to never end. The ending is awesome, too. For me, they are the second best opening and ending this season. And the insert musics are also really good. Especially the final episode, you can feel the all thrilling and sad moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9-10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the most important thing to me (when watching anime), maybe even more important than story and I become so happy when I see the characters are developing. This anime has 8 important characters. They all are seriously MAIN characters. They all have feelings and past, and the anime is based on those. All characters are original and have so different qualities. One of them is even masochist. I said the main question was ''What happened to Sonozaki (and between Katsuhira)?''. So she was the key character. First episodes she was like an emotionless annoying character and people didn't like her, but last episodes (especially last scene of the 10th episode) she won our hearts. Nico was the most friendly and funny one, Chidori suffered a lot because of her feeling to Katsuhira, and Katsuhira was always brave. But still I think the most developed character is Maki (or maybe Sonozaki). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n*Starts episode, the opening begins* - 10 second later - *The ending starts*\\n\r\nSeriously I can't figure out how fast it pasts. This anime can be so boring for some people (especially who don't like slow pacing, character-based animes and who like action) but I'm enjoying it a lot. And melodrama is strong in this one. I never thought teenagers drama could be sad. I think the tags should've been like ''Drama, Comedy, Psychological, Thriller, Sci-Fi''\\n\\n\r\nNegative Sides:\\n\\n\r\n- Too short. Some characters developed enough and well but we don't know much things about the others. Especially Yuta.\\n\r\n- We don't know Chidori's final thoughts clearly. So did she get over Katsuhira and decide to be with Tenga or not?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, here is my thoughts about it. This is not kind of anime that most of the people can like, but I'm in the team of lovers. Some people think these flaws are enough to ruin an anime, but still I think it is amazing. Even I'm surprised that this anime became the top in this season for me :)",

            "content": "Ah Kiznaiver. From the studio that bought forth the crazy battle-centric Kill la Kill and supernatural battle school theme series When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace emerges this series. As an original title, I had some doubts about the show at first. Because quite honestly, the show\u2019s premise invites a lot of questions. These may include what exactly is the \u201cKizuna system\u201d, what\u2019s its purpose, and why does it exist? \r\nComing into this series, I was a little intimidated at first. The idea of the Kizuna system brings a connection between characters (whom become known as \u201cKiznaiver\u201d) through human emotions by sharing wounds and pain. Theseemotions ranges from sorrow, regret, pain, and even love. As part of the story, we also get a deeper insight about the origins of the system. Apparently, the system was designed to explore human feelings and making characters more aware of them for world peace. The characters begins to realize these inner feelings and learns about their close peers and even themselves. From a story point of view, it opens up a lot of possibilities for characterization. In addition, Kiznaiver also does a neat job at crafting a thrilling theater that builds more and more as each episode progresses. Emotions also emerge throughout the series and there\u2019s definitely to worry about. Considering that Mari Okada is directing the series, you should be prepared for some sort of emotional delivery. At times, I feel like the show is trying way too hard to get across the point. While other times, I think it comes out more naturally between the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor what\u2019s worth though, Kiznaiver take advantage of its premise quite a bit. From the first few episodes, we have a mysterious girl named Noriko who immediately takes interest in the main protagonists in particular Katsuhira. Their relationship can be described as strange but also familiar. This is because the two already seem to have history judging by the flashbacks and segments. And despite Katsuhira not knowing it, he feels a strange connection to Noriko. This also links a connection to the Kizuna system as we\u2019ll discover a darker side of science. From an experimental point of view, the show makes it clear that the system is far from perfect. The kids who underwent experimentation are more like their former selves, kind of like a shell. In the meantime, the show will also explore how the Kizuna system influences relationships in the present.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to be quite honest, relationship dynamics is an important aspect in the show. The main male protagonist Katsuhira has some obvious chemistry with Tenga and Chidori. So much in fact, there\u2019s hints of romance that formulates into a generic love triangle. On the other hand, there\u2019s a general melancholic-like mood throughout the show about relationships. Take a look at Maki for instance. Remember, the series likes to express emotions and sorrow is definitely one of those as well. Maki\u2019s guilt (based on her background story with another classmate) shows a fragile side of her personality. One thing I do praise on Kiznaiver is the heavy writing to get the audience to understand more about the characters. From a personal view, it makes the characters more believable. Even Noriko, the most mysterious character in the show can be understood better once we see a deeper side of her story. Unfortunately, the series still relies a lot on its relationship angles especially when it comes to romance. In the latter half of the show, there\u2019s some particular segments that makes you really roll your eyes about Katsuhira\u2019s role. \\n\\n\r\nAs with most series from studio Trigger, they often tend to go overboard with its gimmicks. Kiznaiver isn\u2019t an exception to that either especially with such a thrilling premise. But for what it advertises, the show itself falls between the lines of silliness, intimate, and emotional. In essence, the comedy is a hit or miss because generally, the jokes are often outstretched than what they should be. The emotional segments tries way too hard on many occasions in particular one climatic episode when the Kizuna system affects the characters at its peak. And finally, the show\u2019s narrative often pushes the story in ways that becomes predictable or repetitive. The over-saturated exposition about the Kizuna system doesn\u2019t really make strong impressions. In fact, the plot device is probably the least interesting part of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, Kiznaiver gives off a vibrant feeling. The characters look colorful with some generic traits to match their personalities. The setting itself has the feel of a futuristic world with more advanced technology. However, not everything looks very solid in terms of design. From a personal point of view, the characters looks rather cartoonish. From the various character expressions to their clothing designs, it seems that Trigger designed them to reflect their outer image. It\u2019s important to also realize that feelings expressed in the show needs to be portrayed accurately and thankfully, Kiznaiver handles that well. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack is generally moderate, there\u2019s more depth to the character voice mannerisms. Remember, the show is about expressing human feelings so the voice of the characters is a necessity to match their roles. While it gives off a decent first impression, there\u2019s not much more that it improves on. However, I would like to praise Nico\u2019s performance as a girl that can express both strong emotions such as sorrow and happiness. While she is childish on many occasions, the VA brings the best out of her as a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line is, Kiznaiver is generally a show that overhyped itself. This thoughtful and intriguing premise in the end turned into a mixed bag of sour storytelling. Although taking a closer glance, the characterization is fairly well done with what it has to offer. For Trigger, this show\u2019s comedy doesn\u2019t cross the line compared to some of its other works. However, it still takes you on a ride of electrifying shenanigans. And in the end, it will make your eyes roll.\\n",

            "content": "Kiznaiver was the latest anime production by Studio Trigger, a studio who I really like and the one I am most anticipating whenever a new anime is announced from this studio. However, Kiznaiver, while not a bad show, was one with a lot of forced drama and it's characters felt more so like plot devices than actual people.\r\nThe main problem I had with this anime was the narrative and the characters. Now, on their own, I found the characters to be fun and likeable, and the interactions and comedy between them felt natural and genuinely funny. The only problem with the comedy was the timing.Often, they'd combine the comedy with the more serious, dramatic scenes and it just didn't work, thus dragging me out of some scenes and made me lose immersion. As the show progressed every week, the narrative became weaker and weaker to the point that some scenes were too stupid and too silly to take seriously and as a result made some of the drama feel weak. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of forced drama and character development in the series. None of the actions the characters take or their decisions felt natural and progressed in such a way that felt rushed and kind of tacked on. Many characters made stupid decisions just for the sake of pushing this drama and a lot of the characters felt more so like plot devices, written for a convenient way to push the story forward whenever necessary. Some development came too little too late and by this time I didn't care about the character since the show never gave me any reason to in the first place. Some of the character development (such as with Honoka) was handled pretty well and by the end, I actually liked this character but others were either forced or lacked any in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the themes and ideas in the anime are far too apparent and pretty much are spoon fed to the audience, as if we're unable to interpret anything ourselves. It has themes, but doesn't really do anything with them and presents them in such a way as to insult the intelligence of its audience.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there were many things I did enjoy about this anime. For starters, despite the characters having forced drama, they're at least fun and entertaining to watch and the characterisation for most of the characters is pretty good. Also, the animation and character designs was also very well done, and the general look and feel of Kiznaiver was great. The sound, shot composition and music was all great especially in the climax of the ninth episode, which I felt was very well directed. It's just a shame that the story and character development doesn't hold up the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver does try hard to develop its own characters and themes, while having a legitimately interesting premise but it seems to fall short of its true potential, which is a shame. There were many things I loved about the show but it would have been better if the script and characters were more fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, not a bad show, but far from perfect. Nico best waifu.\\n\r\nAnyone else looking forward to the TV series of Little Witch Acadamia?\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What does it mean to hurt? What does it mean to love? What does it mean to be a friend? Kiznaiver, a Drama/SciFi manga adaptation from Studio Trigger (Spring 2016), takes a stab at a heavily character driven story and completely succeeds. The show uses it\u2019s beautiful animation + soundtrack, objectively unique and strong characterization, and deep philosophical questioning of human connection to deliver a new twist on the plot of Rebirth and a meaningful re-imagination of anime\u2019s friendship clich\u00e9. \r\nLove or hate the show, there\u2019s no denying Studio Trigger \u2018showed up\u2019 for the art of Kiznaiver. Each character has an identity, their looks reflectingtheir personalities brilliantly, not to mention their body language. Simply watching the intro, we are given a grand spectacle which imprints an understanding of the characters early on, before we have even met most of cast (but I\u2019ll be going more in depth on Kiznaiver\u2019s OP on my blog at a later time). Each character is visually appealing and expressive, giving the audience little reason to turn away from the screen for a majority of the series. Even those with little emotion in the show are extremely interesting to look at, allowing the director (Hiroshi Kobayashi) to set up some genuinely funny and serious moments as a result. On top of that, the animation itself is phenomenal, making use of fluid dynamic camera angles and the works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs far as audio goes for the show, it is great. The music rises and falls in a perfect flow for the narrative, and knows when to go completely silence to let powerful lines of dialogue hit hard. Yuuki Hayashi (previous works including: Haikyuu!, Death Parade, and Boku no Hero Academia) was in charge of music for this series, and did a terrific job. The music for the opening and endings are fantastic (the op being the thing that drew me in to watch the series in the first place), and the ed following up was a great touch to every episode (the ed being another thing I\u2019d like to go in depth on at a later date). Going past the music, the sound effects were spot on. The fictional sound effects that was generated for group\u2019s connected pain was intuitive and, for how often its heard, never gets distracting or feel out of place. Well done over all.\\n\\n\r\n(Plot Summary will be kept to a minimum for MAL review guidelines)\\n\\n\r\nGetting into the story, the plot revolves around seven main characters, the most prominent being: Katsuhira Agata (or Kacchon). Katsuhira is completely unable to feel pain, and is emotionally distant from the world. A glimpse into his past in the first minute of the pilot shows him at a young age chasing after a girl standing on a roof. While trying to talk her down, she grins and jumps. He cries out, reaches down to his chest in pain and his hair turns white (see: Marie Antoinette syndrome). This scene sets up a potent understanding of, and connection to, our protagonist as we view his behavior and hear his first few words. In this scene he is holding conversation with Chidori Takashiro, a close friend growing up. He asks why a cicada bothered coming to the surface: its safer underground and it won\u2019t live very long anyways. Chidori replies, \u201cMaybe it wanted friends, or something?\u201d It is the brilliance of these lines, that expose us to the main ideas of the plot while giving an introduction to these character\u2019s personalities and already starts to build a connection with these characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, Katsuharia meets a strange girl who we later find out to be Noriko Sonozaki. She tells him that people bully him because he doesn\u2019t get scared, and doesn\u2019t feel pain, meaning others \u201ccannot find themselves within him\u201d. As he processes these words, she suddenly throws him down a flight of stairs, knocking him out. Upon waking up he is in a hospital with 5 other individuals. They are informed they are a part of the \u201cKiznaivers experiment\u201d and they are now connected by their wounds. If one individual experiences pain it will be divided equally between everyone connected, in an attempt to create true human connections. The others who are chosen for the experiment were selected under the criteria that they would have never met normally or got along with each other, as well as loosely fitting the definition of the seven deadly sins (or an updated version for modern japan). These differences in characters truly play into the strength of the show\u2019s characterization as each one is unique. From their designs, to body language, to behavior; but it doesn\u2019t stop there. Each character has very human flaws, insecurities, and desires; so when the characters get time on screen you to truly begin to understand them and connect. No character can simply fill an archetype, as they are all diverse and feel deeply human, and in their doing so: Trigger has made a colorful cast of individuals who you want to know more about. This creates an environment where every line and decision made feel purposeful and impactful to the group as they learn how to get along.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the show taps into a deeper philisophical question, of how do humans connect? Human inherently are not perfect, and as a result of this connection with others is not always simple. Especially in our age of internet its easy to keep to ourselves. In context of Katsuhira\u2019s cicada, why bother going outside where you have to open up and can get hurt? We die too soon anyways. We can see an argument formed through the show\u2019s use of the Kiznaiver experiment, This creates a literal empathy between the characters, and over the course of the show we see these individuals grow, connect and change. They will never be the same people they were at the start. They\u2019ve opened up slowly and they will get hurt along the way. The guy doesn\u2019t always get the girl, others don\u2019t always return their feelings, tragic events can completely destroy friendships, but as humans we keep on moving. The show doesn\u2019t sugar coat the hardships, but it shows us the joy in making the connections, to being a friend to some body. Characters may not end up with who you want them to, and while this has been known to piss some viewers off, we should really see it as beautiful thing. That\u2019s not how real life works, why should it in the show? Getting to know these people so well, you want these relationships to blossom as much as the characters themselves, so it can hurt when we get the truth, but in the end they come to terms with things and learn to live on. This is the re-imagination of the \u2018friendship\u2019 trope; we aren\u2019t forcefed a \u201cfriendship concquers all\u201d scenario, but instead are eased into a more human and compelling arguement of: \u201cconnection with others gives meaning to life\u201d. The main theme the show is presenting is: people need to open up. It\u2019s not easy, you will get hurt, and need to share that pain with those closest to you. But goddamn is it ever worth it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\n+ Beautifully Animated\\n\r\n+ Deeper Themes to make you think\\n\r\n+ Strong connection with the cast makes dialogue feel purposeful, and decisions feel impactful\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Plot lags in the interest of character development\\n\r\n\u2013 It had to End\\n\\n\r\nIf I have to put a number to it:\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "Human emotions is a topic that has always proved to be challenging to present in any form of media. It is something very vast and the understanding of which completely varies from person to person, thus often leads people to having different perspectives towards the work in question. Kiznaiver stood as one of the shows to take this challenge upon itself but like most, was unable to deliver in a way that could be deemed worthwhile.\r\nStory:\r\nThe concept and setting of the show is fairly interesting. It\u2019s sure to grab anyone\u2019s attention as the nature of the show holds a lot of potential for deep storytellingand emotional scenarios. Unfortunately, the show does not manage to fully utilize whatever it had at hand, and how is that? Well, to make things simple, let\u2019s consider both halves of the show separately.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half, right of the bat was off to a pretty poor start as most of the earlier episodes revolve around scenarios that could be considered as pointless time wasting. While it can be seen that these scenarios were meant to serve as development for both the characters and story, it still feels as if they were put out just to fill in for something that was necessary for the buildup of the series and would provide as a foundation for the events to come later. Because of which, they come out as generic slice-of-life events that you\u2019d see in any other show but without having any unique appeal for itself. While some viewers might be able to find value within the enjoyment of these scenarios, others could very well end up considering them as something meaningless altogether. But even then there\u2019s no heart put into them and just feel as if they were added to get the job done quickly so that the writers could start focusing on the other half of the story. Which was seemingly the main part of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half offers more backstory to some of the characters and some nice development while also offering a deeper take on the entire series\u2026 Or at least it tries to. The thing is, while the idea might seem very nice, the same can\u2019t be said about the way it\u2019s carried out. It feels rather vague and just doesn\u2019t provide the proper kind of development that you\u2019d need in order to truly feel for the more emotional situations that come later on. The progression feels very off and the pace by which the show goes barely even gives you the chance to care about any of the events. You can tell that it tries to be dramatic, but just doesn't manage to get anywhere with it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nStudio Trigger managed to do well in this regard as it mostly has in the past. The art direction is really well done and the sharp, bright visuals are very eye catching. The brightly colored backgrounds also added more depth to the overall surroundings and was altogether something nice to look at. The animation is also smooth for the most part but it can get rather inconsistent at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack within the show is fairly nice but it\u2019s still not something I would particularly praise. There were moments when the soundtrack fit with the show\u2019s mood really well though and do stand as some nice pieces on their own but they don\u2019t really effect the atmosphere all that much. At the very least, the right tracks were played at the right time and nothing in particular ever felt out of place in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nI did however, enjoy the Opening sequence quite a bit. It\u2019s nicely presented and has some very eye catching visuals and screenplay along with good music. Just a good opening overall. Really did impress me the first time I saw it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nQuite sadly, the character department was one of Kiznaiver\u2019s weakest areas as not only did the cast feel bland to begin with, but also felt neglected for the most part. While the show does provide a reasonable amount of character development for a few characters, at the same time it disregards the others. Being a show with a main group of eight characters, it felt as if only a few in the group actually mattered and the others were there just to fill in space, a couple of \u2018extras\u2019. What also stems from this is that the chemistry between said characters felt extremely unnatural and forced. The characters do present themselves in a fun way and were entertaining at times with their quirky personas but felt limited to those personas and didn\u2019t manage to go much further with their character (except for a very few). They felt extremely flat and whatever supposed 'depth' that was provided to us could barely be considerable, because of which these characters just end up becoming another generic cast that's easily forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show lacks the most. One of the biggest issues that Kiznaiver had was with its dramatics. Most of the time, the more emotional scenes aren\u2019t carried out as well as they could\u2019ve been and also due to the progression of the show and the nature of the characters, very rarely would the viewer feel any sentiments with the drama. The scenario execution is poor, which is sad, considering that there were a few moments for which I truly felt that they could\u2019ve came out as something beautiful if portrayed properly but rather what we were presented with was an abundance of melodrama and forced romance. Also, because of this, nothing ever feels as important as it should. It lacks the qualities which makes a viewer care, whether that be for the characters or for the entire show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion and Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nEven though Kiznaiver offered a good concept, the lackluster presentation and writing held it back from achieving anything noteworthy. If you can look past the flaws and enjoy the show for its nice visuals or just manage to appreciate it for the concept itself then you just might be able to find something in it. Otherwise if you\u2019re expecting a dramatic experience with solid writing then there are far better options within the medium.",

            "content": "What better way to make friends is there than making them feel your pain?...Is most likely an accurate way to describe what this anime is about.\r\nStory(7/10)\r\nKiznaiver is an anime that focuses more on the characters and their development rather than the story.Because of that,there is the imminent confusion to where the plot intends to go.\r\nIt starts with Katsuhira and his dream of a blue haired girl telling him that ''he'll definitely get his pain back''.Because of his lack of feelings,Kacchon is bullied and extorted money from.One day he meets a mysterious girl who pushes him off the stairs.The protagonist wakes up in what seems tobe an surgery room and the earlier figure who introduces herself as Sonozaki explains to him that he's been ''chosen'' to participate in an experiment with 5(later 6) of his classmates in which their pain is divided and felt between each other.They are put to make all kinds of tests to reveal their most embarassing secrets and missions to help each other whenever one is in torment.It mostly is that but then it's revealed that the experiment is not as safe as they thought and some were affected by it and while at it,the reason for Kacchon's lack of feel.And as the MC gains his feelings,he demonstrates a few things to Sonozaki too.\\n\r\nIt's quite cute and it has an interesting sense of humour.I also like the bonds they formed between them and there are some ships to sail too.Felt quite heartwarming at times to me so that's why it gets a passing grade.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI dig colorful art like chocolates as presents.The characters are soo rainbow inspired(as most MCs in anime intended for younger audiences).I don't have anything to complain but it still didn't leave my mouth gaping,most likely because the only interactions it focused on was talking.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op gave me a hypnotic high kind of feel and while I liked the ed,it didn't attract me especially.None of my favorite seiyuus but Nico's voice is too cute to ignore.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWe have an emotionless MC and his emotionless love interest,an childhood friend,the macho guy,the narcissist,the energetic weirdo,the masochist and the girl who has a sad past so she doesn't want to have anything to do with anyone.They are characterised by Sonozaki as ''the seven deadly sins'' because of their obvious flaws that prevent them from making friends.All in all,the characters are lovable,even if they are not the most unique.Of course,that should be a given,as this focuses on the characters more.I could recommend watching this if only for the masochist's weird moans and reactions and Honoka's acidic remarks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI strangely enjoyed seeing those teenagers going through their angst and misunderstandings,and the weird love octagon formed between them.This most likely is a representation of one of the questions which humans always asked themselves:how do you understand other people and the feelings they have?\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the mixed reviews this anime has,I liked it.Not most try do something besides the normal friendship formula so this was an intriguing take on what it means to be connected and have bonds.I would recommend watching this for the lols,the colorful characters and maybe if you want a bit of a change from what you usually watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nThis anime had an original idea, amazing potential, and good art, but it went downhill very quickly after about the fourth episode. Honestly I normally wouldn't rate an anime with a 1 unless I really, really disliked it, but this was definitely one of the most disappointing anime I have watched. A large part of the reason for that was all the unnecessary, forced shipping.\r\nI know that a lot of people hated Chidori, but I actually liked her. She had a lot of passion for Katsuhira, and loved him deeply. Not to mention she was friends with him for many years, and eventried helping him to the best of her ability. I felt like this anime basically spit on her feelings, and made them out to be completely unimportant. What ticked me off the most (I'm using nice language right now because God knows how much I want to curse), was when they force shipped her with Tenga. Uhm... excuse me? What? She's been in love with Katsuhira for how many years, gets her heart basically ripped out by him, and then goes along so easily with someone else? Makes absolutely no sense. I would have preferred her to end up with alone. Besides, Nico also liked Tenga, and I think she would have been good with him. Their personalities matched much better. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now let's talk about Nori for a second. Besides the fact that she is a completely clich\u00e9 character with absolutely no personality, AT ALL... she's just annoying in general. She tries to act all mysterious and such, but in reality she's just... boring. And the ending made absolutely NO SENSE. Nori has just been holding all their pain by herself for all of this time? Yeah, how convenient--honestly it was just a cop-out for them to not have to kill her. The plot would have made MUCH more sense if she had died, and I'm seriously not the type to want characters to die in anime--almost ever. If she had died, then of course their own pain could be returned to them. But no, they instead allowed her to live and somehow to even get with Katsuhira? It just makes very little sense. And that joke at the end about \"We haven't gotten there yet\"... way to completely step all over Chidori's feelings. It's been two years since I've seen this anime and it STILL ticks me off to think about this.\\n\\n\r\nAlso some of the plot was confusing in general and not relayed properly--I'm still not entirely sure what was going on towards the end there. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, in case you didn't see what I said up there, it's been TWO YEARS since I've seen this anime. Literally two years. And it still irks me to no end any time that I think about it. Like it literally puts me in a bad mood, which is rather rare for me. So I felt it only fair to vent out my feelings here. I literally created an account for this reason.\\n\\n\r\nChidori should have gotten with Katsuhira, but really, there shouldn't have even been any romance added into this anime. There are two things about anime that I hate the most: first few episodes are good, with a great idea, and the delivery is awful (I'm looking at you SAO and Code:Breaker), and when there are forced ships that make no sense and that really weren't necessary for the plot to progress but which just serve as an easy way to further it. Anyway, over all this anime was a huuuge disappointment, which is pretty sad because it had great potential. Honestly they should re-do it with a lot less shipping, and a lot more focus on other emotions. Perhaps I'm also hyper-critical due to my being a psychology student and knowing that there's a lot more to emotions than romance, but there's my take on it and I doubt anyone will be able to change my mind.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver's is a mess  that devolves from a show with an interesting premise and wacky trigger-esq characters into a melodramatic, boring waste of time that fails to deliver any real depth and ultimately leaves you regretting giving it the time of day.\r\nMy biggest problem with Kiznaiver situates from its dialogue; the writing in this show is absolutely atrocious and towards the end of the show becomes downright cringy in its directness. Few of the conversations between the characters feel legitimate as the characters are screaming the situation at you and telling you how to feel. Dialogue is meant to be utilised to give theaudience a sense of the character's personalities, their feelings and their goals. However, in Kiznaiver's case the characters just downright tell the audience what to think and it leaves you unaffected as there is nothing to care about as the character interactions feel so forced. For a show that is meant to be about friendship and the importance of communication, the show does a horrible job of developing actual friendships as all the characters and their supposed friendship feels disingenuous. \\n\\n\r\nThe Kizna system itself, what is meant to be the entire focal point of the show, eventually disintegrates and simply becomes a gimmicky tool to advance the story rather than tell the story. This really annoyed me as the system, though pretty ridiculous as a concept, introduced some really interesting themes that the show could of discussed and developed. The  show alludes to some of these themes but are ultimately overlooked in favour of furthering the idea of \"friendship can overcome anything\" motif. By the end of the show every bit of dialogue is just repeating and repeating this same fucking point until it begins to drive you insane. I FUCKING GET IT ALREADY- FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC! The show ends with the characters having some big \"we're all so close\" scene which is splashed in unearned pathos as I felt nothing for any of these characters since the show has used its time to simply tell us what to think and feel rather than develop the fucking characters and their relationships.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of character development: there is almost none. Most of the characters in this show don't development beyond their cliche's and those that do like Honoka end up just reverting right back into their cliche outside of the forced sentimental moments. I don't buy that the characters screaming \"We are good friends now, just accept it\" makes them friends, characters need to actually develop in order for that to be the chase which simply doesn't happen. That being said the show does have its genuine moments. Honoka's arc is the best bit about the show and I feel some of the conversations between Honoka, Nico and Yuta display moments of  genuine growth and investment. However, once this arc finishes it almost just reverts back to normal and the characters don't act like they've developed at all unless the show calls for it but overall it just comes off unconvincing. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing about the show I can be assed mentioning is the soundtrack as the OP and ED are both good and the soundtrack is pretty solid throughout the course of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show has moments of greatness but falls victim to bad writing, horrible pacing and pathos that ultimately leave the characters \"friendship\" feeling major league unconvincing and unmemorable.",

            "content": "There are so many things wrong with this anime and its setting.  The Kizna system in the end is just a plot device as a cheap explanation to have things make sense and fails at that.  The warning signs were right there from the first and second episode.  The protagonist gets pushed down some stairs, he's saved by having his pain shared among six other people (how the heck that works is anyone's guess), yet he and the six others right afterwards look and react totally fine, when the protagonist should at least have a couple broken bones and that pain shouldhave been distributed to the other six.  However, only six of the seven are summoned together and have this explained to them.  The seventh was purposefully left out to be another episode of the others finding him, which overall was just for episode count, because there was no underlying purpose to having him separated from the others in the main narrative.  Of course, everyone had this change done to them without consent and were abducted by a horde of mascots that roam the city for some reason.  The mascots continuously act as railroading personified throughout the series, and move the characters to where they need to be and dance to whatever narrative the plot needs them to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main characters are forced into this experiment with a threat of a \"bad end\" if they don't.  Their first task is completely nonsensical where they have to \"introduce themselves\", but really it's to share your most highly kept secret, and not telling will result in several traps bordering on death being activated to force it out of you.  Yet in the midst of this highly controlled environment they were placed in, one of main characters manages to get separated from the others somehow in order to give a hint of her dark and troubled past, and later appears in a mascot costume for some reason once the task is finally cleared.  Also, she gives her secret after their abductor already said they cleared their first task.  Oh, and one character's most valued secret is that she loves the protagonist.  She's also the childhood friend and next door neighbor.  Yep, a huge guarded secret there, and the first hint at one of many of the forced romances this anime will later try to shove in the audience's face in the second half.  So yeah, after that cluster of nonsense, this anime started out in the negative and future episodes would have to work to bring it up, which it never does.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fault is in half due to it's worldbuilding. Few things make sense and that's due to vagueness and inconsistency.  From what was told, this experiment was done once before, the city was constructed for that very purpose, with one third of the citizenry in on it, and ended in a huge failure.  As a result, 19 kids that were the subjects were robbed of their sensory system; some can't even go out into society.  That an experiment like this happened and not one mention of it was on the news or any social media not even as a rumor is ridiculous.  I imagine parents would be outraged and/or distraught for what happened, especially the parents to the kids that were experimented on.  But that's the issue isn't it?  While parents are mentioned, rarely any of them are shown.  The protagonist was a subject of the first experiments, yet he still gets the same cliche that his parents work overseas, when any caring parent after seeing what happened to their child would be with him no matter what.  The only parents that do appear aren't even any of the main characters', but for a side character, and they only appear for a few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nOnce learning the protagonist was part of the first experiment, you ask the question \"why was he chosen again?\".  It is never made clear.  It may have been to get his pain back, which is necessary for him to start emoting again (but it's really not), but later we learn that another subject is willingly keeping his and all the other kids' pain in her, which is ridiculous and a contradiction to previous info (which I'll get to later), and the other subject's goal in the end was never for him to get his pain back despite earlier hints that's what she wanted, and starts off what is one of the most sorry excuses of a plot twist and final confrontation.  It's all just a mess.\\n\\n\r\nI look at the the two experiments done for the Kizna system, and they only have a few similarities.  The first experiment as a whole is even more ludicrous than than one we find our main characters in.  It started with a mistake that resulted in one kid out of nineteen was solely getting the pain out of 5 kids (jumps to all of them later for no reason).  Gradually, the kids that were having their pain transferred became desensitized, not just physically but emotionally as well that carried over to the present.  The current subjects didn't have these problems.  For one, the current subjects' pain was distributed equally.  Second, theirs had a time limit and were freed after summer vacation, contrasting the original that continues to the current time.  If the researchers made improvements, how the heck did they test the modifications before the story starts?  Did they just administer it to the current subjects, and it worked?  But if they were able to fix the previous problems, wouldn't they be able to cure the first subjects?  You're left wondering because it is never explained!  It's instead used to set up one of the project members as some tragic character, because that person is the same kid that all the pain was transferred to.  The girl's circumstances get contradicted too, making the attempt at sympathy ineffective.  During certain moments the protagonist somehow is able to feel the pain of the girl through their Kizna link when from what was explained is impossible, even emotional pain in the last episode, when only the current subjects were able to advance to that level.  In addition, as I mentioned before, she's also willingly keeping the pain of the other previous subjects, which in no instance beforehand was ever hinted to be possible.  Her entire condition was because of a botch, and was something she had no control over.  However, in the final episode, we're told she does have control over it.\\n\\n\r\nSome may argue that the lack of consistency in the setting and it's rules is okay, because it would take away from the character interactions.  However, if your setting is crap, why would the characters be treated any better.  The answer is they aren't.  Late in the story, the focus shifts mainly on the girl from the first experiment and the protagonist's forced romance to her, and away from the six other main characters.  The seven are still in the midst of working out their drama, making this change in direction absurd.  The anime is supposedly about theses seven characters' issues and how they bond through overcoming those problems.  However, their friendship is mostly told, not shown.  The times they are all together are limited, and when they split into smaller groups, it's always with the same people.  There's no diversity.  The reason is for the other forced romances that are again mostly told and not shown.  How forced is it?  They have to have side characters make a character sheet on who likes who, along with expressing how \"obvious\" it was.  The romance is also the main source of drama, as if it needed it.  Seven people are linked to their pain.  They have no clue if these people that forced them into it will keep their word and release them after summer vacation, and constantly have to worry about each others' safety, especially when one of the seven is a masochist.  However, none of these very reasonable issues are utilized.  After their initial abduction and forced cooperation, the main characters just walk off what's happened to them and go home for the day.  The next day, they continue on normally, which is not normal!   They act as if they haven't become lab rats and had their human rights violated. Even when they find out their teacher and counselor are part of the project, they don't act realistically.  Only one of them gets angry; the others are far more subdued and calm.  What's worse is these two characters are only here to give exposition and act like giant scumbags.  It becomes more inconsistent when the counselor suddenly has a change of heart late in the series and believes what they're doing is inhumane and immoral, when she was shown to be able to cross that line well before and not show an ounce of remorse.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver constantly tried to have it's cake and eat it too, even at the cost of situations and reactions being portrayed consistently.  It wants this SoL drama along with an over the top setting and situations, but in attempting to do both, does neither one of them well.  Seriously, in the end, why were none of the committee members arrested!?",

            "content": "So what happens when 7 people, who knows almost nothing much about each other, are forced into a situation where they have to work together, know about each other's past, feeling each other's pain together (both physically and emotionally) and etc.? Well, Kiznaiver shows us how and they did a pretty good job presenting us how\r\n[Story]: (7/10)\r\nOne day Katsuhira, Chidori, and four other teenagers are abducted and forced to join the Kizuna System as official \"Kiznaivers.\" Those taking part are connected through pain: if one member is injured, the others will feel an equal amount of agony. These individuals must become the lab rats andscapegoats of an incomplete system designed with world peace in mind. With their fates literally intertwined, the Kiznaivers must expose their true selves to each other, or risk failing much more than just the Kizuna System.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kiznaiver is nothing new. High school students are forced to be together and they eventually learn about each other and all that crap. I've seen another anime that did pretty much the same thing called \"Kokoro Connect\". The only difference is they literally feel each other's pain and this is just an experiment while Kokoro Connect is some mysterious entity forcing high school friends to work together or else they suffer the \"consequences\".\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the show is decent and much of the show is focused on developing each and every main character in the series. I guess you can say that Kiznaiver has a \"Forced Character Development\". While that may be a bad move for most series, for Kiznaiver, it's not. That's the whole point of the series and it magically works. \\n\\n\r\nMy review for this section will be short since I'll be focusing much of my review on the characters itself. Meaning most of my review will be on the \"Characters\" section. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nI don't know what it is about Trigger's animation that I find so appealing and unique. Maybe it's because the way they draw their characters or how weird the visuals and some of the character designs look. Whatever, it doesn't matter because I weirdly love it for whatever reason. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (8/10)\\n\r\nSome of the OST's stood out like the theme that plays during the action scenes or scenes that has no action but is super intense but for the most part, the soundtrack is just average and not really worth mentioning. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME by Boom Boom Satellites\". The ED theme song is Hajimari no Sokudo\" by Sangatsu no Phantasia\\n\r\n I'm sorry guys but I'm going to be on the minority here and I will say that I hate the OP theme song. It's boring and I don't know what it is about the OP that people find appealing. On the other hand, I love the ED theme song. The singer has a nice voice and there are actual lyrics playing on the song instead of \"Woahhh Layyyy Youuurrrr Haaaaands On Meeee!\" which to me is not an actual song and more like a theme to something. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\n\"Character Development: The Animation\"\\n\r\n^^\\n\r\nIn my opinion, that title fits perfectly on what the show portrayed. When I first watched the series, I knew the character development would be amazing like Kokoro Connect and after 12 episodes, the show proved me right. Literally every single main characters here gets a screentime of their own and they will get a character development. It's like the Kizna Experiment is (not literally) stripping them down and exposing their main flaws and weakness that made them who they are today. Funny because I said the same thing when I wrote a review of Kokoro Connect. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, at first, the characters may come out as either super-cliche or just plain boring but as the series goes on, you'll understand why they're like that and you'll love these characters for who they are. Well, I did anyways. An example is Katsuhira Agata. When I first saw his character in episode 1, I thought he was going to be one of those silent and bland protagonists that we have seen a million times before. I don't know what it is about the silent types in anime that Japanese audiences find appealing but I'm tired of it. Except, he's not your typical silent dude. There's a reason why he's an insensitive and emotionless freak who doesn't feel any pain. They explained in the last 2-3 episodes and to be honest, those episodes were very emotional for me. To think how much kids have suffered just because of the Kizna experiment. \\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver has one -- if not -- the best character introductions I have ever seen in my entire f*cking life. If you check Chibi's episode 2 reaction to Kiznaiver, you can see that I left a comment saying the same thing and apparently, a lot of people agreed with me. Why the hell would I say that though? I'm going to explain. In my 1 year of watching anime, the way they introduced their characters is super boring and filled with expositions that makes it very hard for me to watch the first couple of episodes when I want to watch a new series. Kiznaiver is an exception. It's either introducing yourself to the party or you suffer the consequences. There's an exciting twist that makes Kiznaiver's character introduction so thrilling. Plus, during those character introductions..the experiment exposes that they may seem like your usual cliche characters that fits into one of the character stereotypes but there's a reason why they're even that way in the first place. The writers intended them to be that way and they have a reason why they're like that. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to character drama, not everyone will like it and it is evident (based on what I've read from people's opinions) that the community is split in half when it comes Kiznaivers character drama moments. 50% will like/love it and 50% will not like it because it's too melodramatic for them. If you ask me, I'm kind of on both sides. While I agree that the show's drama is so over the top, like the love triangles and how everyone in the groups loves someone in the group, I also disagree with the fact that Kiznaiver's drama as a whole is melodramatic. Besides the love triangle or pentagram or whatever , the show did a good job with its drama. The dramatic story that I want to use is Maki and her friend Ruru and their relationship. In my opinion, it was very well done. When Ruru showed her feelings to Maki, Maki didn't give her back the same feelings. Even though Maki is in love with Ruru, she didn't want their relationship to go any more further because Maki knows her fate. If she responded to Ruru's feelings, it would have hurt her more emotionally once she dies so she decided to just ignore her. This is actually one of those \"Pick your poison\" moments. If she responded to her feelings then she'd have to endure a more emotional pain once she dies while ignoring her would have caused her emotional pains too but not as hard or as painful as the first one. Their relationship also f*cking hit me right in the center of my heart which still hurts for whatever reason. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nI don't follow Trigger nor do I follow any anime news. So my expectations were at 1% when I first watched the series but after watching the first couple of episodes, I was very surprised. It exceeded my every expectations and after watching Kiznaiver, I expect every author/writer to write an exciting character introduction instead of our usual boring-ass character introduction. In other words, I'm expecting changes. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nKiznaiver was an exciting series to watch and it's a series that I didn't even plan to watch for Spring 2016. It exceeded my every expectations. While the show's plot may be weak, which is the reason why the show's overall score for me is an 8.5, the character development, on the other hand, is amazing. I never expected I would get emotionally invested in most of the main characters, especially Maki and her relationship with Ruru. In my opinion, the show's weakest plot point is its love triangle and some melodramatic scenes. After being disappointed with Trigger's Kill La Kill, Kiznaiver is currently the best show from Trigger. This makes me gain hope for Trigger and makes me excited for their future works. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)  \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Amazing Character Development\\n\r\n+Kiznaiver currently has one of the best character introductions\\n\r\n+Trigger's Unique Animation\\n\r\n+Most Character Dramatic moments are well done\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Weak Plot\\n\r\n-The Love Triangle Plot is completely melodramatic. \\n",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is a show with a fairly interesting premise and some actually quite good art and sound design, which is largely let down by a somewhat flat and rushed plot. To start with, the opening is a trippy experience with some slick visuals and a catchy song and the most memorable part of the show for sure, and I should note it has a pretty nice ED too. The character designs are for the most part pretty good and only Sonozaki is notably generic, and even then it actually works fairly well with her characters. The introduction makes her come off as rather crazy andmenacing and is actually pretty tense for what it is, basically just about revealing a secret about yourself, with characters getting decent starts: Tenga is the loudmouthed, fighting type who wants to live an exciting life and is a nice guy despite being a delinquent, Nico is the crazy girl living in a world of fantasy but is actually lashing out for attention, Chidori the girl with a crush who can't speak out, and so on. Our main hero, Katsuhira, has lost most of his ability to feel pain and so has difficult emphasizing with other people and has become dull of heart. Our heroes are made into Kiznaivers quickly: People who, through science, are bound together to experience each other's pain in order to develope a deeper connection.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary problem the show suffers is simply that the show does not really explore these characters in any depth for the most part, with only Sonozaki, Katsuhira and Maki getting any notable screen time. I feel like this is the fault of the episode length: Only Maki gets a true arc to her and she is notably the best character in the show for this, even if Tenga is pretty fun. Katsuhira and Sonozaki come off as incredibly obnoxious for the first 1/4th of the show, with Sonozaki in particular coming off as extremely evil, but they have backstory that does explain their actions: Katushira frankly still comes off as unlikeable and is my second least favorite character in the show, but Sonozaki's backstory is very reasonable for her actions and frankly it would be weird if she DIDN'T come off as crazy given what it entails, I kind of vaguely liked her in the end aside from some pretty conflicted feelings of parts.\\n\\n\r\nMaki is notable for the fact she gets an actual character arc, which nobody else in the show does, and it is DEFINITELY the high point of the show, with a reasonably done backstory that for the most part does not feel overly melodramatic, is fairly logical and works into the themes of the show. I feel like if the show was about twice as long and had character arcs like this for all of the main characters, it would probably be actually pretty good. Well, maybe not everyone, since Katsuhira and to a lesser extent Chidori's are baked into the plot, but for characters like Nico, Yuta and Hisomu it would have been especially good. Hisomu I particularly feel the need to point out, as he feels quite out of place and pretty much a gag character with his masochistic shtick when he doesn't get any personal developement. Nico also is practically begging for a character arc that could have done wonders for the characters, but she is instead left a one noter. I also applaud Maki's backstory for having a tension/break between two same sex characters not surrounded around gay angst, but instead actual issues between the two, and in fact the show not even bringing attention to it.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, the show isn't amazing, but it does follow logical progression and avoids making too many major mishaps...except in a way the ending. I won't get into it as it would be a lot of spoilers, but the latter 1/4th of the show I am very conflicted on and I feel like it was definitely not the BEST direction to take it, if nothing else it was definitely rushed. I do wish to give the story some props for doing some logical things that many other, better constructed stories I feel don't despite being good ideas: For example, the secret shadowy organization getting their government funding pulled due to being too conspicuous for their results and the resulting actions. Artistically, the show looks quite nicely drawn and rarely suffers off model moments, and I do want to give some sound design props for the cool noises of Kiznaiver effects activating and the like.\\n\\n\r\nIf you see more into the show's characters, then you will likely come to like it more: My personal issue was a lack of character developement and attachment to the characters in a series where such things are VERY important, the crux of it even, and some divided issues about parts of the plot. At 12 episodes, it is certainly worth a watch to decide for yourself, as it is if nothing else technically competent. If the concept was expanded on or redone, I can see something great comint out of it too, so that's a plus.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is a show that has an absurd premise yet fails to deliver because it tries to take itself way too seriously with the melodrama. The main cast are a bunch of eccentrics, some stand out and some feel underwhelming. The stylistic visuals are nice to look at but any other show can uphold that characteristic. The Kizna System is an interesting concept that could have been used as a subversion of \u201cthe bonds of friendship\u201d clich\u00e9, yet it tries to reinforce that very own clich\u00e9 and even wander into romance territory. \r\nThe \u201csharing of pain\u201d is not properly grounded. What if the other persongets sick? Will everyone get sick as well? The limits are not really set yet the show tries to venture towards the emotional territory later on which gets really complicated.  While it does try to promote empathy over sympathy, literally feeling another person\u2019s pain or feeling is not a good way to demonstrate it. The main point of empathy is to understand what someone else\u2019s feeling. This show just forces the character to feel something without really understanding why. Though they try to know the answer of the \u201cWhy do you feel that way\u201d question, they don\u2019t really achieve mutual understanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe show should have just focused on one type of pain and further explore that through frequent character interaction. The background of some characters is pretty good, but the story fails to transform that into good character development. The romance could have been done well if not for the very complicated love web the story presented. All in all, the show had potential if not for the bad direction of the story and the weak foundation of the premise. I could have given it a lower score, but the aspect of enjoyment is still there. There are some good standalone episodes and the show itself is a decent time-waster. I just really believed that the show could have been something greater",

            "content": "As an anime established around people and how those people interact with one another, Kiznaiver\u2019s cast should be memorable and fleshed out. However, for over half the characters, this just doesn\u2019t seem to be the case as they fall short when compared to other anime with similar goals such as Hibike Euphonium and Zankyou no Terror. \r\nIn fact, Kiznaiver flounders in almost every aspect aside from it\u2019s stunning visuals and decent soundtrack. These strengths are made apparent in the anime\u2019s opening theme which pairs a decent and memorable song with flashy visuals that catch the viewer's attention. I think this opening is also full ofmeaning, focusing mainly on the eyes and reflections of the characters showing that the anime itself is about seeing eye to eye. However, after this fabulous opening, the show almost immediately becomes sour.  \\n\\n\r\nWe are introduced to our cast of walking tropes from the airhead loli to the guy who is extremely cold because of some dark event that happened in his past and, like most anime that feature similar tropes, these characters (excluding Maki, which we\u2019ll get to later) barely change from their original state. When we leave off, Niko is still as much an airhead as she was episode 1 and Yoshiharu is still as masochistic as ever. \\n\\n\r\nThough some might fawn over \u201chow unique this anime is making all these different tropes interact\u201d there are actually many other anime that have something similar. This list, though extremely short, includes almost every generic harem that\u2019s come out. It\u2019s no stretch to say that, these interactions are in no way unique and a varied cast can be found in almost any anime made in recent years. \\n\\n\r\nNot only can varied casts be found easily, but so can relationships that are deeper than the ones found in Kiznaiver. Many anime breath life into the relationships the characters have with one another and try to make them as human as possible to best connect the characters to their audience. Kiznaiver, on the other hand, creates empty relationships between its cast. These platonic bonds that were forced upon them through the Kiznaiver system quickly turn into romantic interests. Literally every character is romantically attracted to another, creating a confusing web of love. Though I don\u2019t think a show doing this is necessarily bad, I do believe doing this in a fashion where there is no clear reasoning for said attraction is. Kiznaiver, though an anime about relationships, falls into the latter of the two categories, making this simple, yet devastating mistake. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, these bonds are not the only problem this trainwreck of a cast has. The characters themselves undergoes little to no change throughout the series, the primary exception being Maki who has an entire arc dedicated to her. I found this arc to be the best part of the anime as it fleshed out and gave life to one of the it\u2019s 8 main characters. If the anime had had arcs similar to this one for its diverse cast, I think it would have been much better. Unfortunately, Kiznaiver, most likely due to funding issues which only allowed them a meager 12 episodes, does not do this. It fleshes out Maki in her arc and gives Katsuhira a deep backstory throughout the course of the anime, changing the audience's perspective on him but leaving him relatively unchanged as a whole. However, the rest of the cast is left a mere reflection of their respective tropes. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, the one thing that does remain constant throughout this anime (besides the characters personalities) is it\u2019s art style, bringing us beautiful characters and scenery which are by far some of my favorites. Not only does the art style and animation breath some life into is rather dull cast, but it also remains constant throughout the show. From the fast paced scenes such as when the characters first meet to the slower ones where they\u2019re sitting on a train, I found the images before me to be as stunning and catchy as those presented in the opening. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals alone are no reason to watch a show, however, and Kiznaiver fails to accomplish anything it was aiming for. It had poor writing, poor directing, poor relationships and most of all, poor characters and because it lacked these essentials, I have to say that Kiznaiver is in no way an outstanding show. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

            "content": "Taking a single look at this anime, is becomes evident that Trigger is the studio behind it. The unique and vibrant visuals as well as having a colorful and mostly unique cast of characters is unmistakably theirs, but that seems to be where the similarities end. \r\nKiznaiver is a step away from their previous work, Kill la Kill, in a few big ways. Kill la Kill was centered around a relatively small cast of main characters, but with a color cast of side characters to fill the spaces. Kizvaiver takes a different approach, having eight characters as the focus and having few important side characters.Also, where as Kill la Kill was action oriented and strongly plot driven, Kizaiver is more comparable to a drama or a slice of life. \\n\\n\r\nNow, these changes definitely made distance between their two works, but was that for the best in the end? My answer to that question is both yes and no. I'll explain why in the body of the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nNow, you would think for a story driven drama, the story would need to be string, right? Well, sadly, in kizaiver's case, it tends to feel confusing and pointless far more often then is feels driving. The plot seems to be there just as a tool to make the characters interact and feel emotions, and, in a way, I suppose that makes sense to the plot. That being said, it doesn't make the plot any better really. It isn't a terrible story, but there are a few holes and lose ends that never really go explained and motives which make little sense.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nBy far the best thing about this anime is the art. Beautiful, colorful, and unique, the art goes far to make up for what the anime lacks in some other aspects. The style is clearly Trigger, and the setting itself is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the best OP's of the season, and the ED was very good was well. Very good voice acting, and everything felt very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nWhile some of the character development was great, it felt as if a few of the characters were ignored for a vast majority of the show. 12 episodes is a short amount of time to try to introduce and develop 8 main characters, and I think they did a decent job with what they had. However, it seems as if it might have been too much for them, because a few of characters felt a little cardboard, or as if they were there more for decoration than for the plot. But all together, the characters were unique and well portrayed enough to earn a 7 from me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nOriginally, I had rated enjoyment at an 8, however, after considering the fact that I had stopped watching this show after episode 4 and only continued after being goaded by a friend, I decided that 7 was probably a more accurate rating. \\n\\n\r\nThis show takes a while to get going, and at first it is a little hard to see what Trigger was going for. But once you get past the halfway mark, everything starts to fall into place, and the show gets much better and more enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis was a decent follow up to Kill la Kill, although being in a very different genre. It was not the masterpiece that some had hoped for, but it was definitely not a bad show in any regard. I would recommend this show to those who are looking for a beautiful and unique drama as long as you are willing to forgive some plot holes.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is the result of allowing shippers to run an anime tv series.\r\nBack at the beginning of the season, I decided to read more into the seasonal line-up. That's where I ran into Kiznaiver. I thought to myself \"hey that sounds like a neat premise, and it's made by Trigger too! Kill la Kill was pretty cool. This should be solid!\"\r\nBut by the end of it all, the only thing I know for sure that's solid in this show is the brick that is the main protagonist's personality. It is an experience for which I no idea how to feel about it. Instead we aretreated to an awkward, drawn out clustershow of character relationships that never really feel like they amount to anything. So complicated that two of the support characters actually had to draw out a vusual diagram of who likes who. \\n\\n\r\nWhile we do get some very emotional scenes, it never feels like it really contributes to the development of the characters as people. For example, one girl reveals a very dark moment of her past that led to her being cold and distant. After this dramatic scene plays out, she goes back to being a complete bitch. Instances like this make me feel as if none of what I'm seeing really matters, and it can be incredibly immersion breaking for people. \\n\\n\r\nArguably the most frustrating thing about this show is that it has enormous potential to go deeper into complex themes surrounding it's science fiction premise. The ethics of child experimentation, the concept of the good of group over the good of individual, and the morality of the Kizna system. These are all themes lightly touched upon over the course of the series, but is unfortunately obfuscated by the confusing litany of \"friendship and love can overcome any obstacle\" that the characters keep spouting through the duration of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just some dumb American guy who is not enlightened enough to understand whatever the hell message this anime was trying to get across. The only message that I took away is that Trigger's attempt at making a deep and meaningful show about emotions ended up being so emotionless.",

            "content": "I guess this show capped off by ending as poorly as the show had become really disappointed in Trigger but ill get right into my first full review (sorry if there are parts that dont make sense because they're not well explained I tried my best to keep it short but concise) \r\nArt-    I guess this is the one that annoyed me the most, mostly because the show started off with really awesome visuals that reminded me of watching Kill la Kill and it helped make THE best opening episode of the season imo until it crashed as soon as episode 3,Trigger might've stopped caring but they basically scrapped all their cool interesting color pallets and visuals in exchange for the generic anime look. I dont dislike the generic look either i realy dont but if you offer me a great looking burger, one that i have almost never seen before let me take a bite and afterwards take that burger and slap a turd on my plate im going to be pissed. This was probably the first sign that this show was going to be a shit show.\\n\\n\r\nStory-  I figured the story would have issues, before I even started watching and Trigger didn't disappoint as the story becomes a literal clusterfuck. For the sake of spoilers I wont say much but my main issues boil down too\\n\r\n 1) FRIENDSHIP CANT FIX EVERYTHING\\n\r\n 2) Poor Execution\\n\r\n 3) Kizna Experiment makes no sense\\n\r\n 4) Trigger didn't know where they were going with this (So to elaborate I think Trigger thought of the concept and the end but didn't know how to move their idea from point A to B. The shows suffers by being episodic and having the most boring middle sequence that i can remember from this season [from what i watched]. And at some point the show decides to go from very upbeat and happy to a teenage soap opera. Plus the only reason Trigger shows Kacchon's distorted flashbacks are so they can dangle the mystery over our head so we have a reason too keep watching) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters are one of the parts of the show I actually enjoyed with characters like Tenga, Yuta (he actually stood out the most to me in the series I loved Yuta wish they used him more), Hisomu, and the two teachers sticking out in particular. However the execution of how these characters were used was horrendous. It boiled down too the story focusing on these fixed love triangles (WHICH THE SHOW LITERALLY TELLS YOU ABOUT ). Plus the lifeless MC Kacchon was literally boring as hell his screen-time was complete cringe, and also just because he couldn't feel pain doesn't mean he would become a lifeless robot. On another note Honoka's arc was pretty dumb and it was her trying to be an edgy hot topic wannabee, The only thing memorable thing about Chidori was the fact that she craved Kacchon's D more than i crave Rasin Bran in the morning, Nico was fun FOR THE FIRST THREE EPISODES then she  got shoved in a cage and was only let out to spit nonsense about friendship. Its a shame that this show squandered all the potential of these characters for example Hisomu: He was awesome in his first appearance He seemed dark edgy (and not like Honoka who was blander than a stick) an interesting parallel to the inital cast but then no hes a masochist who didn't want the group to unite for some dumb reason. At that moment I thought ok fine that was funny this will be some nice comedy relief, BUT THEN HE IS SHOVED TO THE SIDE AND PROVIDES ZERO IMPACT ON THE STORY AND BECOMES BLAND AS HELL. Thats really the problem of the show shoving aside interesting characters in favor of Kacchon whos defining trait is that hes the blandest person in a 10 mile radius.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Really forgettable soundtrack how forgettable...... I forgot\\n\\n\r\nExecution: I keep rambling on about poor execution but how bad is it? pretty bad. So the big problem with this series is that it begins to take itself too seriously and evolves into this Soap Opera with little actual drama for the viewer to care about. It becomes a mess of love triangle drama and such that is overcome by \"friendship\". The show refuses to flesh out the interesting aspects of any of its characters as if its wants to rub in our faces how good the show could be if Trigger were to think about any actual interesting scenarios for the viewer to be sucked into.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: The show lacks the poise that Kill la Kill had and was a major disappointment by Trigger in my eyes. It went from a show that showed so much promise in its first 3 episodes but then went into full train wreck mode. Suffering from lack of a well thought out plot, and bad execution its an anime that fails to shine in a rock solid spring season 3/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is an anime produced by Studio Trigger, who created Kill la Kill back in 2013. I was a bit hyped, but the result is kinda dissapointing.\r\nStory: 5\r\nThis story is about bonds of friendship and love with an interesting and original concept as starting line, which is the Kizuna system. However, this series have what i call the \"angel beats\" syndrome, the inability to express itself clearly in 12 episodes. The story, while enyoyable, feels so rushed, and it has repercussions especially in the characters and their relationships. You can't make a love triangle and develop it nicely in just 12 episodes. Imposible.\r\nArt : 7\r\nTheart and character desing is fairly good just as expected from Trigger. this anime doesn't have many action scenes to shine properly this animation quality, but is good enough. Animation from OP and ED kinda superb, especially OP.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI found the OST quite common, just one or two soundrtrack that i felt good in that moment. However, the OP is ASTOUNDING, pretty damn original with a good song and superb animation as i mentioned before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nLet's go in. Each character is well \"characterized\", that is to say, you can distinguish each character and they have a different personality from the other ones. However, they are not well developed at all because the reasons mentioned before. You can't develop a proper love relationship in just 12 episodes, imagine FOUR and their feelings. In some of the cases, like Chidori's one (the tsundere girl) the love is quite obvious during the show, but there are some cases without a simple clue until the truth is revealed. It happens because yes. Not credible at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI have not bored watching this series,  it has some intense caps and pretty good arcs like Honoka's one. Moreover, the opening was always a gift to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThis is not a bad anime, it has a good idea and a nice potential. With 12 episodes more to develop better the characters, it could have been easily an 8, but it happens  to a large amount of series, so it's not Kiznaiver's fault at all.\\n\\n\r\n\"Do you recommend this anime?\" \\n\r\nit's still a good view if you like love stories, friendship and melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Kiznaiver, take a look to:\\n\r\n- Toradora, with a way better developed love story and some similar slice of life in its way\\n\r\n- Anohana, another story about a group of friends and their relationships well developed in just 12 episodes\\n\\n\r\nPD: Sorry for my english\\n",

            "content": "*Spoilers ahead*\r\nSo, this review is coming quite late. What's the reason for this? I just couldn't bring myself to get back and watch the last couple of episodes of this garbage for a long time.\r\nNow, i can't bring myself to say it was all bad, no, far from it, the visuals and drawing style was superb (as expected of trigger), the characters where pretty good (the interactions between them where not however), the op and ed (as well as some of the other audio things) where great.. But those things, while important, are kind of an extra, the wrapping on the candy if you will,and if what's under the said wrapping isn't good... Well, no matter how colorful and appealing you make it, the content won't become any better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nWell then, what is the problem with this show? Three things, as far as i see it:\\n\r\n1- the story. The story of Kiznaiver is extremely simple, almost non existent - some scientists decided to improve the world, by making a way to artificially share feelings... And then decided to try this on actual humans, and kids at that. It all went horribly wrong, as expected, and the actual story is about two of the luckier participants of this experiment who didn't turn into emotionless husks trying to get their feelings and identities back together. The's the idea at least, but... (see #2)\\n\\n\r\n2- Bad focus. The most troubled and therefor interesting characters are the protagonist and the girl who was in the original experiment with him, yet they get the least focus, and only towards the end of the anime. The rest of the show focuses on 6 individuals who barely fit in the show due to their \"problems\" being so common and insignificant (having no friends, unanswered love etc.. with the exception of one of them, who's close friend died, that's probably the only really troubled person out of the 6) that making such a big deal of it all is pretty much a joke that reeks of forced drama. \\n\\n\r\n3- Infantilism and bad interactions. As i already said, the show focuses on 6 more or less normal individuals. Now then, unlike the protagonist, they should have no problem understanding emotions and the concept of friendship, right? WRONG. Despite being around 17 years old, they seem to have about as much understanding of their, and other's emotions as the protagonist, who LOST all of his. As a bonus, they seem to have no idea how to interact with other people, and what friendship means. Why? No reason. As a result of that, watching them try to communicate is a pain, and coupled with how big of a deal they, and the show makes of their tiny little worries, the result is annoyance and/ or dullness, making the show a pain to watch.\\n\\n\r\nFinal word - I would not recommend this show, it lacks in interest and any kind of impact",

I got sucked in immediately by the art style and stayed for the plot.\r\nEverything in Kiznaiver well executed. It balances itself between character developement, giving us some slice of life (I mean, everybody is a teenager and has your average love problems and other things) while still providing science fiction backstory about a program that is intended to bring world peace. So Kiznaiver is a mix between Slice of Life and Sci-Fi which I don't see as often as I'd like to. One of my favoriteanimes is Steins;Gate which did something similar.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself is pretty close to perfect, the only faults I can think of is that at some very rare points it slows down a bit and I'd wish that it had more focus on the audio. For example, what makes Death Note so memorable is the OST while here they have stayed more safe without really bringing music to the front, opening being the exception because it was freaking AWESOME.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I have a longer review up on my channel on YouTube. MudanTV, would help a lot if you could check it out and leave some feedback. Thank you.",

            "content": "I have to say... I don't LIKE this show anymore. Not to say it is bad, but it isn't a show I could highly recommend, let alone re-watch.\r\nSTORY 6.75: I know I hate that rating but I can't give it a 7, but i certainly don't think that it deserves a 6. I love the story about these characters, besides the MC and Nori, but the plot just doesn't work when you actually think about it. Why connect them through emotion and pain? Couldn't you just force them to go on a summer trip together or have them work on a project? It just soundslike the writer thought it was a fun plot and just went with it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10: Truly gorgeously animated and the character designed are like my second mix tape(coming out 2124, pre-order soon). That's really all I can say, i don't really think I saw any sight not worthy of being seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9: The OP is FIRE, albeit a total rip of of another fire song. Everything else is fine, but I will give it a 9 because of how much I just love the op.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8: Would most certainly be a 10 if not for MC and Nori. I truly thought they'd develop, but they just don't. I'm not saying that they don't change from time to time, but there is a difference from a character changing and a character developing. Moving on to the rest of the cast... I think they are great. They all have their own personality and flare to them and their interaction is what makes the show worth it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 7: I put both together because I, personally, believe that they coincide. This was my most hyped show of the season, so anything below a 10 is a bit of a disappointment(unlike my mix take, coming out 2567), but it is certainly not a bad show. I hate to make a review before the conclusion because ending is the most important thing, but when I have to stop a show with only seconds remaining, I believe a review is in order.\\n",

It tries to get to some really deep spots in the plot which aren't quite satisfying. First episodes go really slow and it seems like they rushed the storyline too much in the last ones, specially in the last 2.\r\nIgnoring the greedy plot mistake let's get to the art..\r\nArt: \"verygood\" 8\\n\\n\r\nI don't see much remarkable stuff about the art, I believe any anime should have this smooth animation and the character art as well as their facial expressions are well-made. Its got a satisfying art and drawing style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \"good\" 7 \\n\\n\r\nMainly because of the opening I give it a \"good\", since the soundtrack isn't bad enough to be awkward nor good enough to be noticeable. The opening is very good in my opinion but the ending is nothing special, not attention-catching at all in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \"very good\" 8\\n\\n\r\nHere is where I prize the anime. Its characters are the typical steriotypical characters, they're even meant to be it (not wanting to give spoilers but they get \"gathered\" together since they are distant stereotypes) but even so, I like it that their bound is what unites them and separates them at the same time, this is probably more of a \"story\" section point but I do think it's more about how their emotions evolve, and how they're expressed than about the actual storyline thing. Won't say much more since it could be a bit of a spoiler but this show does focus a lot on how we carry our emotions and how we get along with others since them, that's really wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is a \"good\" 7\\n\\n\r\nI liked the show, saw it really quick cus I like watching animes as soon as possible, its a bit of an anxiety thing. You're gonna enjoy it, it has a good amount of romance, a bit of comedy even when it may not make you laugh it may get you into a good mood. It's emotive and if you arent too harsh is a good show, lacks a bit of smoothness in the narrative that's all. Overall is 7, it's the average rating I did and is how I feel of it; a show I wouldn't really rewatch but I would recommend to people who like friendship-centered animes specially.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is a show about connections. Its a show about connecting. Yet for something so focused on character interaction and empathy, it is a show that has barely anything worth connecting with.\r\n=======================\r\nFirst of all, the story:\r\nThe show follows an intriguing SCI-FI premise of characters being connected by pain and having to solve problems and psychological puzzles those running the experiment ask them to solve in a way being forced to deal with uncomfortable subjects and learn empathy. \r\nThe premise is promising. Its not unique as something akin to that was already done with Kokoro Connect or even currently running western show  - Sense8, butit is still something that holds promise. Character exploration and introspection can be enjoyable. Characters usually are where the substance of the show comes from.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Kiznaiver is already hidden in the story description I gave - \"forced\". The show feels forced. The SCI-FI setting and lore are poorly fleshed out and exist solely as plot devices to force characters to have melodramatic interactions with each other. The problem with that is that the said interactions are shallow and poorly written. Characters do not behave like people. For the lack of better example, the narrative's understanding of \"feelings\" or \"interactions\" is on the level of 12 year old high-schooler teen writing emo poems on tumblr. The show is filled with cringe-worthy use of \"feelings\", \"sharing the pain\", but majority of interactions are basically teenage melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nFor a premise with interesting SCI-FI elements and possibilities in the lore, the show does not bother to do anything with it beyond using it as plot device to force characters to have melodrama. The plot elements that ARE there are spaced out so much that the plot ends up very bare-bones and barely holds together as an excuse to have those interactions. \\n\r\n=======================\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nArtistic design and cinematography is one aspect where Kiznaiver is actually decent to good. The show is filled with interesting shots, creative and dynamic use of colors and great visuals.  Its basically Studio TRIGGER trying to present SHAFT-esque visuals and mostly succeeding. Its one of Kobayashi's  best works in terms of that. \\n\\n\r\nIt does suffer in terms of character designs, especially in terms of outfit designs - for supposed \"everyday teenagers\" the characters wear the kinds of clothes that nobody would wear casually. The kind of outfits that make the modern day designer collections look normal. It requires a SUBSTANTIAL amount of suspension of disbelief to believe that \"your everyday teenager\" would wear anything like that. \\n\r\n=======================\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound-track the show is nothing special. Hayashi Yuuki is not someone that stands out for me in terms of composer and surely the music is serviceable to work with the show without standing out, but nothing special, not anything I'd listen on my own to.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does have a brilliant opening song by Boom Boom Satelites, which is a good listen on its own, although not the best that band has produced in the time of their existence.\\n\r\n=======================\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nCharacters is where the show falls apart. For something that is supposedly so character-focused, Kiznaiver's characters feel stereotypical, manufactured and fake. You have typical emotionless MC, typical childhood friend, typical loony girl, typical megane, etc. You get the idea. The show tries to play it off as meta-aware by telling the viewer how they are supposed to fit the stereotypes, yet at the same time the show does nothing to make them feel more than that. \\n\\n\r\nWhile some characters like Niko are likeable in a way, everyone's existence begins and ends solely with their purpose of participating in melodrama:\\n\r\n- Niko is likeable and decent character that not much is done with. \\n\r\n- Chidori's whole existence revolves around childhood friend tropes.\\n\r\n- Sonozaki is poor mans Senjougahara, that, unlike Senjougahara, lacks any strong characterization beyond her personality tropes. \\n\r\n- Maki exists solely for her backstory(which has its own share of problematic tropes), \\n\r\n- Tenga is typical \"dudebro\" whose only purpose is to overreact and act cool. \\n\r\n- Yuta is barely fleshed out as a person and is used mainly with purpose of playing off the other characters.\\n\r\n- Hisomu literally lacks any purpose or characterization at all. \\n\r\n- The show's protagonist, Katsuhira, has interesting premise, yet terrible execution, which makes the character impossible to relate to and hard to understand, as sole elements of his character development are tied to VERY scarce plot moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lack relatability and the end conclusion to their arcs makes it feel like a majority of cringy melodrama the viewer experiences was kind of needless and pointless.  For a character-drama, the show falls apart completely in terms of actual characters. \\n\r\n=======================\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe show's sole enjoyment value comes from two angles:\\n\r\n- Either you are capable watching a mediocre show solely for sake of experiencing the directing and cinematography\\n\r\nor\\n\r\n- You are capable of bearing a juvenile high-school drama and are okay with bare-bones plot and no real emotion in narrative. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is like the show's protagonist - lacking empathy. I personally can't \"like\" or \"dislike\" it. The show just IS. It happened. But it lacks any qualities you can like or despise. Its fake, manufactured and stale.\\n\r\n=======================\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver originally was intended as wacky Okada-esque action show, but via production process, was overhauled into a character drama, resulting in a show that is ill-prepared to accomplish what its authors want to accomplish and the lack of identity is felt through entirety of the show because of that. \\n\\n\r\nIts the kind of a show you watch because it is airing. And then, when the show has ended, you put the complete tag onto it and go \"Okay, I watched this.\" without any real thoughts of feelings about it. \\n\\n\r\nIts a show that wanted accomplish so much, yet ends up accomplishing absolutely nothing - be it in terms of narrative or in terms of audience emotion.",

            "content": "Remember that childhood bully who would punch others all the time? Would he still punch others if he felt just as much pain as the person he was punching? Kiznaiver is a theoretical system that applies a communist-style approach to pain; if I were to feel pain if someone else got hurt, it's in my best interest to prevent them from getting hurt right?\r\nThough the premise sounds extremely interesting, the show plays out as something between Kokoro Connect and Danganronpa. Basically, a group of teenagers are forced, against their will to become Kiznaivers, and forced to undergo various trials meant to try to connect themeven more so and to test out the limits of the Kizuna System. It's a rather wild ride that ultimately fizzes out. If you're looking for a thinking show, this isn't quite deep enough. If you're looking for a show about relationships, this is still pretty shallow compared to other shows out there (such as Kokoro Connect). Ultimately, it's a fair watch but I was really hoping for better.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nDespite the show's poster image, the animation quality overall is only average. The show is drawn in a very saturated color palette, giving it a comic feel, especially in bright scenes. Backgrounds are reasonably drawn but detailing is a bit lax. The characters themselves are easily distinguishable though also not particularly detailed. The show has very thick character outlines, especially noticeable in bright scenes. Character emotions are average overall, though half of our leads try to hide (or seem to naturally lack) them. Our protagonist Katsuhira lacks emotions to the point of annoyance, just as bad as the lead in Persona 4. And what the heck are the Gomorins? Anyone who doesn't get suspicious with a city full of these things is weird.\\n\\n\r\nThere is surprisingly a lot of action in this show, but for some reason it all feels rather half-hearted despite characters having numerous near-death situations. Expect a good deal of fist fights, a lot of running, and even some explosions. There's a bit of blood but nothing particularly gory. As with most shows these days, there's the obligatory bath scene, otherwise it's not particularly ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a rather interesting choice for an OP; it's an electronic, heavily padded song that somehow reminds me of the OP of paranoia agent. Honestly, it's one of the more catchy songs that I've heard of late and apparently BBS's last song. The ED is a light rock piece that has a pretty good melody along with a few rather interesting pitch shifts. The BGM is fairly varied though overall it has an electronic inspired feel with a healthy dosage of fitting chaos. There are some action pieces when the Gomorins show up that give off some Arabic vibes.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is relatively mixed. We have veteran Rina Satou voicing an aloof girl and rising VA Misaki Kuno voicing a rather childish character. Junichi Suwabe also voices our teacher. The other VAs are either very junior or have had historically little luck getting large roles. I wasn't particularly impressed with the performance of many of the VAs for once, though perhaps that's just a consequence of the rather odd characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nKiznaiver's story is one big game. After being forced to become Kiznaivers, our band of characters, who supposedly would normally never get along, are sent through a series of quests ranging from giving introductions to helping each other out of dire situations. Just like Danganronpa, there is a group behind it all orchestrating this big experiment. The plot is one single thread that builds to an eventual (greatly foreshadowed) climax. As the story progresses, we find more about each of the main character's past, though Katsuhira and Noriko's exact past (hinted throughout) is kept from the viewer until the climax. There are quite a few twists along the way, but they all feel artificial as they're introduced by the researchers rather than the characters themselves (the researchers must have hacked Google or something to know so much about our main characters).\\n\\n\r\nThere are numerous issues with the story besides the artificial feel in the execution. First, I couldn't shake off the feeling that there are strong plot shields (I mean come on, Katsuhira doesn't feel any pain). Second, the show doesn't present the researchers as particularly scientific. Human testing is rather difficult in the real world, and given all the uncounted variables, I'm not sure how they can actually deduce anything. To further make things feel immature, they added a bunch of brainless nobodies in ugly mascot costumes known as Gomorins. These apparently rampage across the city doing any bidding of the researchers- fights with these mascots makes this feel like some stupid offshoot of Power Rangers. Finally, why does the project span the entire city when they only need a handful of test subjects? It utterly fails to sell the scope and benefit of the Kizuna System. With all the issues, you just can't take the show seriously.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCompared to Kokoro Connect, the characters here feel inconsistent. Katsuhira isn't particularly relatable as he is practically devoid of emotions. Noriko is central to the plot, yet her behavior is incoherent at times and her role questionable throughout the show. Overall, though each of the primary characters is assigned a specific trait, they don't have very much depth. They develop relationships with each other in this show, but these are supposedly formed via intervention of the artificial Kizuna System, and thus they don't really feel real. Ultimately, none of the characters felt particularly relatable or even likable, thus greatly reducing my engagement level.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nTo really enjoy this show, you ought to watch it from the perspective that it's so bad it's good. It's not serious enough to engage a thinking mind, and the characters are not developed enough to move the heart. Though the premise is interesting, the artificial feel of the execution and the lack of meaningful, relatable characters destroy the enjoyment of the show. Unless you really are out of things to watch, I'd skip this one.",

            "content": "I would consider this to be Emotional Dissonance: The Anime. \r\nKiznaiver was a really frustrating, deeply polarizing anime for me to watch - and one of the most memorable. It's a mixed bag, tbh, with the good parts being absolutely exceptional and the bad parts being really, really atrocious, and the rest being mediocre fluff. A lot of the writing is distasteful and really gross, and you almost have to pick and choose through the script and silently pray for a scene that won't make you want to throttle the writers. It wasn't until the midway point that the anime finally settled into itself afterthe horrible beginning episodes, and the 7th episode is probably the pinnacle of the series. \\n\\n\r\nI majorly associate Kiznaiver with Bakemonogatari and Angel Beats, and after having watched to the finish, I'm even more firmly convinced that this is the extremely stylish, immature lovechild with an unexpectedly wise outlook on the nature of empathy. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason why I even rated the Character section above a 2 was because of The One Character (c'mon, everyone knows who I'm talking about) whose arc was given a deeply lavish attention to. The others, as enjoyable as they were (though mostly irritating) were really superficial caricatures. They were a vague collection of archetypes that mainly existed to be the mouthpiece to the writer's fauxslophical musings about friendship and emotions - which isn't bad, and it seems intentional. The problem is, just, for a series so dependent on human relationships, it was a huge strike. \\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is absolutely amazing, and I would even say iconic at times. And it's a real shame about the characterization, because it's clear that the writers have a talent with writing character arcs. The problem is, they just didn't deem it to be a priority in a series where it kind of should've been emphasized to the point of overkill. The premise was really flimsy and contrived, and so was the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the forced romance- really unnecessary. Really, really could've been avoided. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: This review was written a while ago when the show was over. Thus, it does not necessarily represent my current opinions, writing, scores or anything really. Still, I somewhat stand with the core ideas of the review.\r\nKiznaiver is a character-driven show. After finishing all 12 episodes and reading most of the reviews on MAL, I feel many misunderstood the premise this series wanted to establish. \r\nUnlike many shows that try too hard to make their plot make sense, be interesting and all that great stuff, Kiznaiver's main and only focus is the relationship between our 8 main characters and the \"change\" from how theystarted in episode 1 as complete strangers, to the final episode how strong and affectionate their friendship turns out.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I enjoyed the hell out of this show, I do have to be fair and criticize the plot and reason for the bonding experiment'. The reasoning for the 'Kizna System' doesn't make much sense and personally I didn't end up buying how the heck world peace could be achieved by making everyone share their pain. What I do want people to understand is that this bonding is the vehicle that brings these characters together.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this show feels very unique from many of the most modern shows that come out in 2016 and I love it. The sound was also very well done and it really made some of the most dramatic scenes even more dramatic. The opening and ending credit songs are great in my opinion and it definitely made me want to look for them for another listen on my free time.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show to people who like character driven shows and are open-minded. This show has enough drama, ships, comedy and lovable characters to make you love this show as much as I did. If you want a show with deeper plot then I don't think this is the one you were looking for.\\n\\n\r\nTo end this short review: I definitely suggest everyone to go give it a shot. Some may love it and some might hate it but that's okay because that's how things work. It is a very enjoyable show with its comedic moments and its sad and dramatic moments. If you are worried about the ending then I say fear not because it is very satisfying and does a fantastic job at finishing a series which I had grown so attached to. I am definitely going to miss this one.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 8- It has its flaws but I enjoyed it too much for me to give it something lower than an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this review helpful.

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Days before the school season draws to a close, quiet and introverted Katsuhira Agata (Kaji Yuki), his childhood friend, and a handful of other students are abducted by the mysterious Sonozaki Noriko (Yamamura Hibiku) on behalf of the Kizna Committee. The seven students are selected to become Kiznaivers - people connected by a bond of shared pain among one another as test subjects for the Kizna Committe's end goal of world peace through connecting everyone through mutual pain and suffering. With this situation forced upon them, Katsuhira and the other students have to find a wayto understand and work with one another despite their differing personalities as their bond is tested over the upcoming Summer.  \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nGiven the premise of the show, it makes a lot of sense that Kiznaiver would focus almost all of its attention upon its primary group of 8 characters and a fairly concise supporting cast. This approach worked well insofar as none of the character's felt all that underdeveloped with the exception of Hisomu Yoshiharu who was introduced after the initial introduction of the other Kiznaivers. The characters themselves are fairly archetypal at first glance - Chidori is a stereotypical childhood love interest upon introduction, Yoshiharu sports a pretty typical depiction of a masochist, Honoka is a pragmatic and distant intellectual, and the list goes on. What's interesting is how the show grows these characters out of their initial depictions into something a bit more intricate. \\n\\n\r\nThough the Kiznaiver's themselves vary in depth, one thing that is certain is that their archetypal foundations do a great job in setting them very distinctly apart before the show invests time into discerning the context of their character. Their designs aid in this distinction as each of them look immensely different, causing them to stand out from one another on a visual level as well. The importance of detailing this distinction between each of the characters is that the show relies heavily upon them having contrasting and conflicting personalities and if nothing else, the show sets this up well. \\n\\n\r\nHad each of the Kiznaiver's remained as they were when they were introduced in the first episode the cast would have felt overwhelmingly stereotypical and tiresome however they quickly evolved beyond this if only slightly. Though Katsuhira's lack of pain and emotions has left him quiet and introverted, he is far more observant and thoughtful than he initially appears and a good deal of the show is about him coming into a new sense of agency. Other characters like Honoka, Tenga, and Nico all have their fair share of intricacies that are contextualized and accentuated upon by the show as it explores each of them each episode - gradually revealing more and more about each Kiznaiver as they are forced to work alongside each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe issues that arise within Kiznaiver's cast are less to do with the different Kiznaiver's on an individual level and more about the way in which they converse and act with each other. The plot pushes them along very deliberately and the characters act out in very extreme and exaggerated ways in order to promote the drama of each scene. Certain central characters such as Chidori are left far too one-dimensional to be taken seriously, her character completely defined by her attachment and romantic feelings for Katsuhira. All in all, Kiznaiver has a distinct group of characters most of whom possess pretty entertaining characteristics however the way in which they are utilized by the plot dulls their interest considerably. They are left feeling far too hyperbolic in their interactions and the resulting drama between them thus often feels absurd. \\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver's art and animation is its major strength and appeal as the show possesses gorgeous visuals. As mentioned above, the character designs are very recognizable and even unique in some aspects, going a long way in further differentiating the characters visually. The animation and character movement is flashy and expressive which worked well alongside the colorful and often extreme personalities present in the show. Kiznaiver had a wonderful variety of colors within its palette as well, its aesthetics heavily contrasting against one another with a heavy thematic focus on various shades of red. The animation was vibrant and entertaining and pretty much everything one would expect out of studio Trigger.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative and overarching plot of Kiznaiver is where the show truly falls apart. Given it's character-centric premise and early introductory episodes it would be a fair guess to say that the show itself was similarly character-driven however as its plot unfolded this became gradually less true. The plot of the show as well as its themes focus upon forming bonds of friendship, overcoming personal struggles through the help of others, and acting empathically. These themes are plenty interesting and even more so when set against such an outlandish premise such as Kiznaiver's - a setting where 7 people share each other's physical and emotional pain. The critical failure of the show is in the forced and artificial way these attributes manifest within an already somewhat vague plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of the show starts right into things, introducing the viewer to the Kizna system and the newly linked 6 students as it both explains the purpose of the experiment as well as their role in it. The second episode fills in the gaps as it begins to push the initially archetypal character introductions into a slightly more complicated light by forcing the characters to divulge certain information about themselves to their fellow Kiznaivers. The forced methodology that emerges becomes incredibly important as it sets the tone for how the show will behave for almost all of its future episodes. Rather than connecting the students and leaving them to organically solve their own issues or encounter their own hurdles, the Kizna committee plays an extremely active role in forcing them together and placing them in certain 'extreme' situations in order to generate data. Quickly the Kizna committee begins to feel like an unnatural writing tool for forcing drama to occur. \\n\\n\r\nBy episode 4 the show starts to pair off certain characters with one another and their relationships and romantic interests begin to take center stage thereafter. Kiznaiver's resulting dynamic is a show about an enigmatic and shadowy organization forcing students who share each other's pain into chaotic and ridiculous scenarios in order to develop romantic melodrama. Rather than exploring the psychological implications of sharing each other's pain or emotional states the show opts to invest itself in their romantic interests in the typical style of Okada Mari, the show's writer. The artificial way in which the Kiznaivers are placed in each dramatic moment makes it hard to take the show seriously which is very problematic given how seriously the show takes itself.  \\n\\n\r\nSomething worth touching upon that would otherwise seem very unimportant is the presence of the Kizna committee's mascots - the Gomorin. Their appearance is very cartoonish compared to the rest of the character designs which makes a lot of sense given their mascot-esque nature however it is their chronic presence in all of the dramatic scenes where they truly feel out of place. In essence, they are used by the Kizna committee to incite moments of dramatic tension by attacking the students or chasing them in some manner which is perhaps the most obvious insight into how artificial the plot progression of the show is. Despite setting no precedent for being dangerous or harmful, the Kiznaivers overreact to them, essentially draining the scene of any possible dramatic tension given the non-threatening appearance of the Gomorin and the scene's straightforward progression. \\n\\n\r\nWith all of that said, Kiznaiver is not completely bereft of good scenes and there are a few engaging moments throughout. The characters themselves are highly entertaining however it is the exaggerated and overly-sentimental scenes they are forced into that makes many of them fall flat. \\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the nature of Kiznaiver its soundtrack behaves as one might expect - emphasizing the drama of its scenes with given tracks and otherwise providing a fairly standard backdrop for the show. For me, there weren't any particularly memorable tracks.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, though Kiznaiver might hint at something more complex and compelling through its premise and initial episodes it quickly devolves into a rather incoherent story focusing on teenage melodrama. I myself am not a huge fan of Okada Mari's writing and so I may have disliked the show more than one normally might and perhaps fans of her other works would be able to overlook certain aspects of the show and enjoy it to a great extent. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 4\\n\\n\r\nI gave Kiznaiver a 4 because the way in which it attempted to conjure up a dramatic atmosphere felt forced and inorganic in how it was narratively presented. Though a handful of its characters were fairly entertaining, its cast also had a few one-dimensional and overly exaggerated characters which detracted from the cast. The visuals were terrific however they didn't dress the show up well enough to the point that its narrative and thematic issues could be overlooked, not that they ever could have.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nThose who have enjoyed Okada Mari's work in the past will likely enjoy Kiznaiver as well as the dialogue and themes are quintessentially her. Similarly so, fans of melodramas like Kokoro Connect, Nagi no Asukara, and AnoHana will probably find that Kiznaiver lies within their interests. Those who don't care for considerably sentimental character interactions and plot developments may want to pass on the show.",

            "content": "+A Brilliant setting that challenges the many themes of relationships\r\n+Visuals alone make this show a worthwhile watch\r\n-Though drama is well executed, the lack of a build up makes it all irrelevant\r\n- Sense of realism is not there due to plot inconsistencies\r\n-Romance that bloomed with next to no development\r\n-Gags that destroy the tension of the show from time to time.\r\n* A drama that is not too somber, with light hearted moments in between.\r\nKiznaiver epitomizes the word \u2018Force\u2019. It\u2019s setting focuses around forcing a group of people to be bound together, like putting lab rats in a cage, and see how they interact with each other. Itsdrama focuses on how the system forces the problems that are supposed to be to each his own to be shared among all. Even its themes questions whether is it possible for relationships among friends to be made forcefully. And subjective to the viewer, one could deliberate whether the story progression, character reactions, and perhaps even the roots of all the drama that unfolds in general, to be forced as well. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the show\u2019s writer observed his friends headbutting each other and beating around bushes that he thought if only understanding each other were to come easy, that if everyone had a sense of each other\u2019s pain, mutual agreement to problems wouldn\u2019t be as hard to come by.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of shared pain is intriguing. It basically puts the worldly concept of \u2018All-for-one and one-for-all\u2019 in the spotlight. From there, there are so many potential can of worms for one to open, so many issues to tackle. Thoughts like \u2018Isn\u2019t forcing understanding among one another, even for a good cause, self-righteous?\u2019, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t people be caring and helpful to others not for the sake of the one who\u2019s suffering, but for the sake of avoiding the suffering that they themselves experience?\u2019, \u2018If everyone can understand each other right away, then is effort to nurture a relationship, the very beautiful journey of making friends itself, redundant?\u2019  are all awesome questions that could perhaps find its answers. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver takes on a much light hearted, and arguably less mature style of storytelling. In typical fashion, the drama involves the cookie-cutter ingredients of romance, phobias and characters\u2019 pasts. Regardless of originality, these aspects could still be heart wrenching for the viewers to see if done well. But unfortunately, one would probably not shed many tears as the phobias are brought up in that one single moment of fear, and then never brushed upon again. It was as if to say that phobias, which are actually really serious issues in real life, are just typical character quirks and has insignificant effects on daily life. The drama that comes from romance like heartbreaks and unrequited love does not seem as moving as it could potentially be as the characters develop feelings for each other a bit too easily. One could argue that romantic development among characters do not need to be given a dramatic episode with tears, embraces, or heart-to-heart talks, but the romance between certain characters were so out of the blue that I had to rewind on a few episodes to make sure that they had a genuine interaction with each other. Like how it\u2019s useless if a house is built on sand, regardless of how well the dramatic scenes were executed, which they were, such a lack of build-up made it very difficult to feel empathy for the characters as the story unfolds. Perhaps romance wasn\u2019t the main point of the entire show, but it was indeed one of the main causes of drama, and understandably so because of the love triangles, and they were done so poorly to the extent that certain characters were given love interests that were so unexpected as if they were asspull consolation prizes designed to quell the rage of an unhappy  shipper.  The character arc that explains why a certain character experiences trauma was the redeeming factor. Though nothing new, it felt complete.  It had flashbacks about the past to make us understand the character, it felt realistic as the character was portrayed as being in huge turmoil when reminded of said past. It also brings up the topic on how cruel the Kizuna system really is for treating such horrible experiences as a mere scientific observation, essentially bringing up a debate on whether relationships should be tackled via logic or emotion. \\n\\n\r\nFor the weak-hearted who cannot stand too many depressing moments, rest assured, as the Kiznaiver ride could be best described as the emotional rollercoaster meant for children who can\u2019t reach that certain height to join the adults. It does not bring one on a journey of emotional conflict and tension at every twist and turn, but also has those light-hearted scenes that provide relief for the viewers psyche before plunging into a huge downward spiral of conflict and drama once again. Events like a group of friends casually conversing at a family restaurant, going to a camp in the woods together are all shown in typical slice-of-life fashion before showing characters isolating themselves from the group by walking away with tears in their eyes after a painful realization.  Not to mention the bread and butter drama scene of characters confronting each other in a huge torrential rain. As expected of a drama, not eye opening, but not particularly bad. Up to this point, aside from the lingering thought of how the build-up of the drama could be more realistic with more development time, admiration for the show was still high. The main gripe that I have with the show is this: Afterwards, the mood of the whole show is lifted be it after a reconciliation that sometimes seem to be way to short, or even worse- through one of the main weaknesses of the show- gags that has no place of even being there. During some very intense moments of the show, viewers are thrown at with comedic scenes, which most of the time revolves around how the characters react in ways that are way out of context, as if to portray them as being ignorant to the predicament that they are in. Introduced to a horrifying system that binds all peoples\u2019 sensations together? Sure, go ahead and fret about your crush being called by your first name. Being forced to yell out the thing that you don\u2019t want to say the most before dying? Then let\u2019s talk about your phobia of dogs, which was never mentioned again was of no contribution to the entire series.  These gags destroy the immersion of viewers who are trying to take the show seriously. Maybe these were done on purpose to avoid Kiznaiver as shown as being too dark to compensate middle schoolers who can\u2019t endure serious drama, we\u2019ll never know. Kiznaiver is the kind of drama with such a theme and setting that could potentially be done in a very mature and serious way, but instead was limited by the amount of unnecessary aspects that were mentioned.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, no anime needs to be as dramatic as Clannad or Anohana to be called a great show. And even if that is indeed the case, Kiznaiver has great potential to reach that great standard. There\u2019s nothing wrong with comedy in drama shows either, as it could perhaps be used for much needed character development, but Kiznaiver\u2019s gags were so out of place that it tells that it doesn\u2019t really know which direction that it wants to go, drama? Comedy? You can\u2019t be a jack of all trades on this one.\\n\\n\r\nSince this show is basically about putting together different people into a huge pit to spawn natural conflict, the writers do seem to make an effort in making the cast as diverse and different as possible.  From different hair colour to different personalities to different pasts, one can\u2019t deny that there is a distinction between them. Though different, they all share something in common, unoriginality. All of them easily slot in into a typical anime archetype. You have the muscle head who yells at every moment he gets, the childhood friend who acts all motherly around her crush, the quiet girl who snickers at every cringe moment she witnesses, the bubbly loli girl who could be very annoying at times, etc.  Factors to most character-driven shows that either define them as a relatable, moving drama or as the term \u2018melodrama\u2019 is: 1) The likeability of the character or 2) the growth of the character.  Are the casts likeable? The divide of character taste in the anime fandom makes this one hard to determine, as these characters can range from very lovable to wanting to see them die a painful death.  Like childhood friends? Well you\u2019re going to love this one from start to finish. Hate lolis? Then here\u2019s a medal of endurance if you manage to finish the series. There is basically no character that everyone could agree universally as a wonderfully written, they are just, different. Then there are people who are on the fence, hoping that these cardboard cop outs are able to break out of their character archetypes, show different sides of themselves which could perhaps define them as realistic human beings.  Did it manage to pull through? It \u2018half-did\u2019. The show isn\u2019t stupid or terrible enough to show absolutely zero character growth. As the series moves along, the characters\u2019 true vulnerabilities unveil. The loli shatters her happy go lucky shell and is shown to be able to feel sadness, the quiet girl is shown to finally overcome her past and hangs out with the group willingly. Though this does not involve the main cast, as some of them are really the same person from episode 1 to 12, change is there when needed and is not overdone. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not tight-knit either. The main issue lies within its consistency. As much as we are told to have a suspense of belief when we\u2019re entertained, this consistency issues lies with the overexaggeration of even the slightest of things that it\u2019s impossible to overlook. For example, the Kizuna System is explained to us clearly that everyone will have the pain of whoever\u2019s suffering be equally shared. The intensity of the pain then shown is terribly unrealistic, characters are shown to be thrown to the floor when a guy is slapped by a little girl and the same reaction is shown when a guy is being hit by a truck. Pinching your own cheeks can make the whole group feel the same impact as if you were punched in the face by a thug.  Not only that, something that was deemed as a fault by the Kizuna system, a very scientific problem, was instantly remedied by the power of friendship, as if it were just a flick of a magical switch. This makes the sense of realism in the show really lacking, and just like the many action movies in the cinemas nowadays,  Kiznaiver then requires me to switch off half my brain to enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no denying the fact that Kiznaiver is a very pretty show. Even the slightest details of reality like sun rays piercing through the gaps of the tree leaves as students walk along the pavement were not ignored. The animation when the Kizuna system is activated is so spectacular that it could make viewers feel like they had a jolt themselves.  The one scene where one of the characters were bound to a hospital bed and carried around was full of vivid colours that perfectly depicts the bizarre situation that our heroes are in. It is a genius in using colours and lighting that perfectly highlights the mood of the show. The Kiznaiver \u2018marks\u2019 on the characters were beautiful whenever they activate at their own different situations. Not to mention the Godly OP where the imagery far overpowers the music itself. (Even if you do not like the show, do get to see the Opening sequence as it is THAT good.)\\n\\n\r\nBeing pretty yet disappointing lumps Kiznaiver in the same category as Kabaneri and Guilty crown, beautiful shows with huge potentials of writing only for them to disappoint. Be it because it was limited to the episode count or because of strict instructions by the higher ups who insist on inserting gags and other unnecessities. The idea of having a group of teenagers having their sensations being joint together by a system is inhumane and goes against all ethical principles in the world of scientific research. With such a dark synopsis, expectations were on how serious and mature this anime could be by challenging the viewers fantasies of friendships and relationships, that friendship goes beyond understanding people, that relationships is symbiotic regardless of your efforts. Viewers would probably expect to see characters in unbearable pain, with his companions suffering and blaming the sufferer to get a hold of himself. We could probably expect sources of their pain like their dark secrets to be forcibly revealed, and the pain would be like how one forcibly rips off a bandage off an infested wound. Kiznaiver did not totally fail in delivering these, but it just did not quite hit the mark.\\n\\n\r\nIt is still a show with a great theme that has loads of take-home messages. In the end, it tells how our apathy cannot be purged that easily by means of understanding others sensations, how friendship itself isn\u2019t something that can be forged via logical/scientific methods but rather with abstract and emotional things like bonds. Perhaps some of us see the emotionless and numb MC in ourselves, that though he doesn\u2019t feel pain, he comes to realize that no man is an island, that no one\u2019s pain is just their own as someone close to them will also feel the pain as well.  \\n\\n\r\nKiznaivers flaws are not big gaping holes, but are small mistakes that make up one huge leak. As amazing as it throws out its characters, message, and visuals in the limelight, it is unfortunately shrouded by the many smoke clouds that it brought with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is a pleasant story, centered around a group of teenagers who have nothing in common aside from the fact that all of them are part of a staged dilemma that is forced upon them by a group of individuals pursuing a sort of extremist social experiment. It is a story writhe with a wide array of emotions, from joy to anger, as well as a great deal worth of unspoken romantic tension, pointing towards the fact that the main characters are all quite young and still learning to communicate their feelings effectively. By connecting with one another through the experiment, the teenagers participating inthe experiment\u2014Kiznaivers\u2014grow tremendously and eventually are able to collectively overcome many of their internal struggles which have held them back in life and later form a bond that does not solely revolve around the Kizna project.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kiznaiver's story is a very unique journey about the intriguing concept of how human pain\u2014through both emotional and physical wounds\u2014can be interpreted in many different ways and affect both the one who receives the wounds and the loved ones that surround them. This is shown in many different ways throughout the story, both in current and past struggles, and can leave the viewer feeling torn towards which characters they sympathize with most. While watching the series, I oddly found myself sympathizing the most with the characters that I had liked least at the beginning of the anime, which is a product of great character development. However, there were many characters within the story that were neglected in terms of background information or character exploration. Creating connections between each of these characters while overcoming their individual pasts, with an increasing cast as the story continues, was a concept too broad to be communicated effectively in just twelve episodes. There were also many theories that surrounded the Kizna system and its participants that were too vague or sketchy at the end of the anime, which could have been given better reason with more show time.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, Kiznaiver's designs are very flashy for some characters while more simplistic for others, which effectively matches each character's personality, pointing towards the fact that people of many different backgrounds can come together to share a bond. The visuals for the background and setting of the anime were also done quite well but seemed to fade from one's mind to focus more on the characters instead, unless highlighting on a particularly emotional moment, like the last climatic scene of the series on Yugomori City's bridge. Perhaps the most unique thing about Kiznaiver's art style is the visual portrayal of pain that passes between the characters during their Kizna bond, shown as a brightly colored transition that quickly shoots across the screen and then disappears. Overall, the animation and art are both done well, but there is nothing extremely notable about the visuals, paling in comparison to the art of other works made by Studio Trigger.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, Kiznaiver is definitely a series one could enjoy quite easily as a means of passing some spare time, though it might not impress more critical viewers. However, it is also something that could potentially influence people emotionally and encourage viewers to pursue positive relationships with others, despite past or current troubles. Though it is a unique story with a touching concept, Kiznaiver is a series that is much too rushed and half-baked in theory to deserve a higher score.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nLike everyone else (and that\u2019s not hyperbole), I\u2019ve experienced pain.\r\nAfter my first day at my first ever job, my shin splints made me unable to move my legs. When I was a kid, my heart sunk when my mother read some mean words I wrote about her in my journal. Continuous strep throat crippled me for months of my fifth-grade education.\r\nPain has this remarkable ability to make us react to the world around us. However, pain is often not something felt individually. Rather, it\u2019s shared. Shared between random people or the closest of family members.\r\nKiznaiverdepicts pain shared between friends \u2013 and what such sharing not only brings but means.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe anime begins with an ominous flashback \u2013 of a child presumably killing herself. When it returns to the present, Agata, Chidori, Tenga, Nico, Yuta, and Maki find themselves at the mercy of Nori. A girl who ties them all together through the Kizna System. As a result, these six (eventually seven) ordinary high-school teenagers each become a Kiznaiver.\\n\\n\r\nTo be upfront from the beginning, Kiznaiver is not perfect. No story ever really is, but that\u2019s a discussion for another day. So, for now, it is best to start with the show\u2019s narrative problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe most obvious issue the anime deals with is an overreliance on heavy drama. Exaggerated is another way to describe it. A scene like Maki screaming for her life in the middle of the day as a group of documentary filmmakers hound her means well (on a character and story level). But it lingers too long.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the premise itself invites this heavier drama. Literally connecting people through both physical and emotional pain makes these more out-there dramatic scenarios not so crazy. Still, Chidori crying and ranting for an extended period can start to get overbearing rather than emotional.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver also has trouble with some of its exposition. Namely, Nori\u2019s background. Hisomu, Agata, and Nico (as well as the audience) get a big info-dump about what happened in the past near the end of the season. Arguably, it was all mysterious, so it had to happen later. But the delivery wasn\u2019t exactly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise itself can also seem hindered when, except for the first major mission, the Kizna system feels underutilized. Not much variety or intrigue is added to their predicaments beyond just putting them all together and seeing what happens.\\n\\n\r\nThe show may even have an issue on a world-building front. This interesting city does not see much action or exploration beyond the Gomorin workers and that one bridge. But this detail (and perhaps the others) may be knit picking because, after all, the anime is not about the world let alone the city.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, it\u2019s about these eight (including Nori) group of kids.\\n\\n\r\nTheir journey begins where almost all other stories about friendship start: as strangers. Some are timid, some are uncaring, some are trying to be acquaintances. The building exploding around them obviously adds tension and a fire under their butts, but this high-stakes ice breaker pushes them past that initial, awkward state and down the right path.\\n\\n\r\nSaid path is filled with many events that bring them closer together. Chasing after a rogue Kiznaiver. Hanging out at a getaway lodge. Taking their picture in a crammed photo booth.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, through their pain-sharing connection, the anime starts to explore its theme on friendship. They can no longer only think about their sinful selves. Instead, they must think about each other, about how the other feels when they hit their head or fall to the ground. To them, friendship is some ways off, but the anime argues (at this point) that a physical connection is what can get them there.\\n\\n\r\nAs they do more with one another and start acting on their thoughts, the show transitions. In their hearts and in their souls, new bonds form. They argue. Feelings surface. Relationships break apart. In this way, the anime starts to question its original idea. That maybe it\u2019s not a physical connection that binds friends together \u2013 but an emotional one.\\n\\n\r\nYet one of its smartest writing moves comes after their literal mind-reading climax: The show chooses to end their Kiznaiver status. Rather than carry it through to the end of the season (the perhaps expected routed), the anime has them all return to their normal selves.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, they are in a worse state than they had been at the start. But this, once again, demonstrates the anime\u2019s thematic exploration. For, now, it\u2019s both the physical and the emotional that drives them towards one another. Holding hands and dancing around in the hallway. Empathy in regards to rejection. Concern and worry that aches their hearts for their dear friend.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s the last scene that demonstrates how thoughtful Kiznaiver is. Poetically enough, it\u2019s on that bridge, now a metaphor for bridging the gap between each other. As Nori stands above the others, she wonders what it is that makes people friends, the same question that the show and the audience has been pondering this entire time.\\n\\n\r\nWho else but Maki steps up. She declares that they are all disparate and different from one another. That it doesn\u2019t make any sense that they could or even should be buddies. But it\u2019s precisely because they don\u2019t understand each other that makes them friends. For that spurs them to understand. To communicate and to care and to connect.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, it\u2019s not a physical bond or an emotional chain that makes them friends \u2013 it\u2019s understanding those two connections that does.\\n\\n\r\nSo, sure, the anime\u2019s overly heavy drama, the sometimes-awkward exposition, and even the Kizna system itself aren\u2019t exactly positives. But its thoughts on friendships and connections, empathy and understanding, turn it into a story that is meaningful in direction and powerful in purpose.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver\u2019s visuals continue to prove the show\u2019s strength.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially the art. The backgrounds are very realistic, detailed in their depictions. Parks filled with trees. Apartments decked out in accessories. Dilapidated buildings coarse with cracks.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the lighting elevates the prettiness of everything ten-fold. Sunlight cascades on far-open skies. Shadows dance on their faces during a stormy night. Red warning lights and blue computer screens add variety.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, the lighting and the realism turn Kiznaiver into a powerhouse of artistry.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone, the character designs are likewise strong. All of them are colorful. Purple, teal, and orange, mixed with reds, whites, and brown, add to their flair. Different accessories, like charms, glasses, and wrappings, give them personality. And each has their own look. Tenga is tall, a bit burly, and tough. Nico seems as if she came straight out of a circus act. Maki\u2019s plain outfit contrasts well with everyone else and gives her an air of maturity.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the colors, such symbolism is always worth noting since it highlights parts of the characters. Agata\u2019s all-white hair and clothes represent how dilute he has become emotionally. Chidori\u2019s red-centric design coincides with her optimistic attitude. And Hisomu\u2019s lavender look evokes a sense of delicacy that fits his masochistic self.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation, Kiznaiver does well here too. Early on, segments like the camera panning through the group as the Kizna system comes online demonstrates this sentiment well enough. That\u2019s a more extreme case. But, even throughout the season, the characters are constantly running around, taking actions like jumping off bridges into traffic or attacking one another, and reacting in over-the-top fashion (especially Nico).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver focuses on eight specific characters (listed approximately in order of appearance): Agata, Chidori, Tenga, Nico, Yuta, Maki, Nori, and Hisomu. Now, given the logistics, that there are only twelve episodes to investigate them all, it\u2019s impossible for the anime to flesh them all out completely.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the anime has trouble in this category.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of strong and weak, the cast is split down the middle. On the positive side sit Maki, Chidori, Nico, and Agata. On the negative side sit Nori, Yuta, Tenga, and Hisomu.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s almost no question that Maki is the best character the anime offers. In the beginning, she is standoffish, unwilling to cooperate with the others let alone try to befriend them. Coupled with her declaration that she \u201ckilled\u201d someone, it puts her in a prime position to develop over the course of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAnd at that she does. While she continues to push back against the others, either by intimidating Yuta or giving the cold shoulder to Nico, her dark past comes to light. As one-half to the famous \u201cCharles de Macking,\u201d she and her best friend Ruru collaborated on a manga that became incredibly popular with the middle-school crowd. Unfortunately, Ruru\u2019s feelings for Maki were ones that Maki did not want to respond to. When Ruru passed away from a fatal disease she always had, Maki blamed herself for shutting her friend away during her most dire time.\\n\\n\r\nBut once she reads the final chapter of their manga, and she sees that the others are willing to (literally and figuratively) dive headfirst for her, she lightens up and finally becomes their friends.\\n\\n\r\nWhen they all go through their downward slump, Maki seems to go back to her former self, too. But, as her police-speaker speech reveals, she views them as her friends after all that has happened, signifying how far she has come. If nothing else, her having a romantic relationship with Yuta proves that she is not the same person that she was before.\\n\\n\r\nChidori\u2019s development isn\u2019t as pronounced, but it is easily the harshest. While it is infuriating to see her continually try and fail to connect with Agata on a level beyond just friends, her role of disrupting the relationships (through the multi-love-interest angle that ensues) helps everyone involved. Including Chidori. For, taking part in the experiment, speaking her mind, and ultimately accepting her loss to Nori, she grows up and takes the first steps towards moving on.\\n\\n\r\nNico manages to take a top-spot character-wise as well. But why? Compared to most of the characters (and what some of the lesser ones suffer from), not much is known about her besides her eccentricity and that she does not, in fact, see fairies.\\n\\n\r\nWhat she lacks in foundation, though, she makes up for (coincidentally enough) in spirit. She believes that \u201cFriends are soy sauce! The omnipotent seasoning! Much better than sugar or salt!\u201d Her affable personality, with her constant cheeriness and happiness, makes her an advocate of the anime\u2019s main themes on friendship and understanding. That is, she views the others as her closest friends for no tangible reason other than they just are \u2013 and that\u2019s perfectly okay.\\n\\n\r\nAgata is arguably the main protagonist of Kiznaiver. As an emotionless husk (which is just describing him and not putting him down), he feels no pain. At all. On both a physical and emotional level, he just exists as this guy who goes through life not really knowing who he is.\\n\\n\r\nMost of his time is spent thinking. He does his best to think about the other characters, the situation he is in, and, most importantly, himself. Meaning, for the most part, he does not actually have much of an impact on the events at hand.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, his connection with Nori and being one of the original Kiznaivers gives him some clout as a character. Not a lot and not surprising, but it is cool to see this twist with him later in the season.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, his emotional cry when meeting his friends from the past and his words towards Nori as he attempts to save her near the end of the series demonstrate, however slightly, his change as a person.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Agata\u2019s change is nothing spectacular. It may even be considered too small to outweigh his overall low impact. But unlike Maki who starts at the bottom, and unlike Nico who starts at the top, Agata starts in the middle. Neither mean nor nice, neither not-friends nor friends. So, his miniscule step forward is, for him, something positive.\\n\\n\r\nThose four \u2013 Maki, Chidori, Nico, and Agata \u2013 are the strongest characters in the show. On the opposite end are the other four: Nori, Yuta, Tenga, and Hisomu.\\n\\n\r\nNori is purposefully surrounded in mystery very early on. Her words on connections and her general air of mystique make it difficult to comprehend what it is she exactly wants. Furthermore, she\u2019s not often around. While the other seven cooperate, she is understandably controlling events on the side.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, this pigeonholing leads to a lack of focus on her character. It\u2019s obvious that she knew Agata or, at the minimum, was related to him in some form. But the anime\u2019s rushed attempts at providing her some backstory or trying to explain away the pain she has sealed away leave her character in a confusing, messy state.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other three, they simply follow in Nori\u2019s footsteps but to a much greater degree. In other words, the anime does not have much of a place for them in the story let alone for them individually.\\n\\n\r\nYuta hardly receives any time for himself, and, even when he is involved, it\u2019s either for the brunt of a joke or all the attention goes to Maki. He at least moves away from his arrogant-jerk status, so it\u2019s not as if he fails as a character.\\n\\n\r\nTenga is a cool guy, protecting Agata and looking after Chidori. But, beyond his crush on Chidori and being the only one capable of taking on their adversaries, the show doesn\u2019t spend much time on him.\\n\\n\r\nHisomu has it the worst, though. After his recruitment episode near the beginning of the season, he does not do or say much outside of loving pain.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest fault with the cast is not on an individual scale.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters have clear relationships. Agata and Chidori, Maki and Yuta. Yet a lot of them don\u2019t. How many times does Hisomu interact with the others? Do Yuta and Nico have any memorable moments together? What about Chidori and Maki? Nori and anybody else besides Agata?\\n\\n\r\nAnother way to put it, the anime does not do enough to bolster their group dynamic. The story\u2019s themes on friendship and understanding are clearly there. But, when they themselves are not equalized in their relationships, it almost goes against the show\u2019s own ideas.\\n\\n\r\nOne last note. The characters and their \u201csins.\u201d Nori describes each of them with a sin in mind \u2013 sloth, greed, etc. \u2013 but the anime does not fully explore this idea. A mistake, given how much emphasis it gained near the beginning of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Kiznaiver\u2019s strongest musical component is its opening track. In all honesty, it\u2019s not very involved. Possibly nearing repetition. But that simplicity gives it strength. The triumphant tone, the \u201clay your hands on me\u201d lyric, and the feeling of friendship permeate the piece. It\u2019s both fun and fitting \u2013 a winning combination.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting comes next. Everyone involved with the project does well in their respective roles, especially Misaki Kuno as Nico, Yuka Terasaki as Chidori, and Tomoaki Maeno as Tenga. Nico\u2019s high-pitched voice, Chidori\u2019s emotional range, and Tenga\u2019s upbeat attitude were only possible thanks to the VAs\u2019 strong performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track isn\u2019t anything particularly special, but it does have its merits. The strumming guitar that leads into the prominent piano, combined with the vocalist\u2019s ever-so-slightly emotional singing, creates a bittersweet tone. Said tone follows a handful of the relationships within the show itself: Romance does not blossom, but friendship stays forever. (An idea reinforced by the all the girls appearing in the ED\u2019s visuals with flowers in hand.)\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack does not have anything outside of the standard offerings. Funky, techno beats for the slice-of-life events and melancholic, violin ensembles for the dramatic ones. Not that it\u2019s used with poor timing or anything similarly negative, but the OST does not stand out in any notable or positive fashion either.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the Kizna-system sound-effect. The electric, computerized sound that played whenever the group shared their pain always sounded like it hurt.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nMany know that I am big on themes. I believe that a story with a message to convey is stronger than one without. Because stories don\u2019t just exist to entertain us; they exist to let ourselves grow.\\n\\n\r\nFor this reason, I liked the show. Its focus on friendship and connecting made me laugh, it made me emotional, and it meant a lot. I used to hang out with my own best friends all the time in elementary school. I once talked about them in another review; we were called the \u201cFive Musketeers\u201d because that\u2019s how close we were. So, it wasn\u2019t just cool to see this ragtag bunch of kids become friends. It was meaningful and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s the high end. On the low, low end sits Chidori. More specifically, how the anime treated her throughout its run. In short, I didn\u2019t like it one bit. It was bad enough that she was denied or pushed away from her happy, romantic ending. But episodes eight and nine, where she gets ignored and has her heart torn out (multiple times) made me think to myself, \u201cIf they nail her romantic coffin shut any tighter, she\u2019ll never be able to escape.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhich is part of the reason why I am not a fan of her (future or implied) pairing with Tenga. I like them individually. Chidori is a kindhearted girl, and Tenga is a noble dude. But, given all the events against her and how he became essentially the rebound, it didn\u2019t sit well with me for a few days after completing the show.\\n\\n\r\nSame idea applies for Agata and Nori. It makes sense that they would end up together (once again on a character and story level), but it just doesn\u2019t feel right that he chooses this girl he forgot about for years and years and years while he tosses aside Chidori who always tried to be there for him.\\n\\n\r\nRomance is king in my eyes, so these two outcomes are bone breakers for me. Especially Chidori\u2019s treatment. However, I was still a fan of two other major parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe first is (perhaps obviously) the romance between Yuta and Maki. Watching them quarrel early on, Maki \u201cbreaking\u201d over him at the getaway lodge, and Yuta running into the ocean at her behest made for some nice moments between them. But it was her last line about him eating fattier foods that sealed the deal: \u201cThen I won\u2019t have to worry about pests flocking to you.\u201d Man, that line was good. It had me grinning big, and it made it clear that their relationship would thrive in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe second is my favorite character in the whole show: Nico. Yes, she was hyper, kooky, and cute. But, above these more superficial traits, what struck me the most was her attitude.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, she reminded me of myself. I like to think everybody is my friend (unless you are a real jerk to me or others) no matter if we just met or if we\u2019ve known each other forever. Nico is the same. Her high value of friendship, her willingness to be there for others because that\u2019s what friends do, was a sweet treat to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver muscles through the pain to deliver a show filled with execution. The story\u2019s themes on bonds, the strong artistry, and that simple yet wicked OP are medicine for the body and the mind. A handful of bumps, like the unnecessarily heavy drama and some unexplored characters, sting. Yet it beats shin splints, mean words, and strep throat without question.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, while exaggerated drama, slight over-exposition, and not enough done with the premise exist, the thematic exploration on friendship is both meaningful and powerful\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful art, nice character designs, and above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Maki, Chidori, Nico, and Agata are strong, Nori, Yuta, Tenga, and Hisomu are weak, and missing group dynamics hurt the friendship idea\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, great OP, okay ED, okay OST, and above-average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, while Chidori\u2019s treatment was wholly unlikable, the overall ideas, the romance between Yuta and Maki, and Nico\u2019s fun, relatable character made it a worthwhile experience\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is really hard to watch for me atleast, because of its \"mainstreamyness\" and this \"fun with friends\" thing really doesnt do it for me, but it was still a decent show... until ep 7 i think. What happened in that episode is absolutely crazy guys, might have to do a double review today. \r\nOn a serious note, something happened that made me rip my balls off. Before i talk some smack about this show tho, i wanna say that this is MY personal opinion so fuckoff butthurt 12yr-olds. DONT SPAM MY PROFILE WITH YOUR SHIT. Now for the review tho\r\nAlso since this is areview, ill just quickly rate the story, concept, characters and so on. ( Skip this if youre here for the shittalking )\\n\\n\r\nStory - It was pretty average, 5/10 bcuz im just pissed at this series and my brain wont let me give it a good rating.\\n\r\nConcept - I guess its unique and cool, i could imagine it working with like some psychologial anime like Death Note. 5/10. ( again because im just mad )\\n\r\nCharacters - Main character was kinda emo i guess so 8/10 for him, but all of the other characters 2/10 at best. Fucking horrific, ESPECIALLY the girl with the glasses, but i have a whole section for her at the end of this review.\\n\r\nArt - It was definetly good, but art alone wont win you any awards.... actually SAO did so nvm. 7/10. ( you know why )\\n\r\nSound - Didnt really pay attention since the show was trash, but it wasnt bad i guess 5/10. ( duh )\\n\\n\r\nOverall its a pretty averag-- FUCK NO ITS SHIT\\n\\n\r\nSo what about this anime broke me? Well let me explain.\\n\r\nSo there was this girl with glasses, who was telling everyone from ep. 1 that she had killed someone and it she was always the \" im cool because ive killed a person\", which is definetly one of my most favourite character types and i really liked her UNTIL it was revealed, that she actually hadnt killed anyone....\\n\r\nShe just stopped being friends with some girl who died AND BETTER YET that girl had some disease, so she was gonna die anyway so its not like she killed herself, because she had no friends. She literally was gonna die anyway, so that girl with the glasses didnt cause or she didnt even have anything to do with her death, yet shes running around with a knife in her hand telling everyone, that she killed someone.... Get ge fuck out wannabe emo character piece of shit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is fucking trash and that fucking girl literally made me rip my testicles off and eat them with fucking soy sauce or something \\n\\n\r\nAnd yes that review part was just filler, so i could talk shit about it in the end.",

I mean, yeah sure I have always been good at wasting time it's like my only talent, but to actually regret my decision? Now, that's phenomenal.\r\nThen I read ZephSilver's review and I could greatly relate to it so much I, for one, wished MAL would implement a comment section for people like me to support the review. \r\nThis series is the epitome of forced drama. Oh boy, the 1st episode had me expecting for greater purpose and justification.BUT NO I WAS LEFT DISAPPOINTED MORE THAN READING BLEACH'S ENDING.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, it's like your typical teen angst drama, but instead of your typical angsty teenager as protagonist, they decided to throw in 2 listless, emotionless, deadpan protagonists and the ones doing all the teen angst burst of emotion are the side characters.\\n\\n\r\nWell, hoorray? NOT.\\n\\n\r\nDrama that forced audiences to empathize the characters was barf-worthy enough but forced romance too? *screams internally*\\n\\n\r\nI can still still tolerate good vs evil kind of angst but in the end this is all about a girl who strung along everyone around her with her problem. And what caught my interest in the first episode was nothing more than a charade to cover the lack of solid plot lines.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was the only reason I didnt drop this because I'm a sucker for sleek animation. If only this series didnt try hard to be philosophical and experimental, I probably would have forgiven the half-baked attempt.",

The idea is actually very interesting and several first episodes are intriguing. But! They seem to just fail it. Because they can't work it out properly. The behavior of the characters is highly irrational and unnatural. Not as irrational as realpeople can be but in an unnatural way. Their speech is the worst part of it. What charecters say is not just complicated and \"hard to understand\" or \"deep\". Their words just lack the meaning, have no consistency, are poorly justified and are full of contradictions. And it's not like intentional playing around as in some wierd funny animes. I was waiting for them to say something smart or some explaination in the end. But it just gets worse. The last episodes are the least sensible.\\n\\n\r\nI expect people to think that I just \"don't get it\" when they read me. Whatever. Looking smart is not enough to be smart. And having a good idea is not enough without proper implementation. I'll keep thinking what I think.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver was an anime that many people were excited about. It\u2019s been years since Trigger has made an anime series will full-length episodes (the last one being Kill la Kill), and it was time that Trigger works on larger project. It has a lot of things going for it; it\u2019s got an interesting and unique premise, pretty art, and good-looking characters\u2026 what could go wrong? Kiznaiver does a lot right, but they do make some mistakes in the way. But Kiznaiver turned out to be one of the better anime of the season for many good reasons. The series does more than just being pretty.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise of Kiznaiver might be the most original premise of the season. The story revolves around a group of teenagers that are forced to join the Kizuna System, where all of share and feel the same amount of pain when inflicted on one. The teenagers are used as test specimens for this experiment. The series revolves around these teens and how they share their feelings with one another in order to get along. It\u2019s an interesting premise that\u2019s actually quite unique. Though it may share some similarities with Kokoro Connect in terms of execution, as both series focuses on characters and character relationships. Kiznaiver, for most of the series, isn\u2019t very story heavy. It primarily depends on the characters and their past to get along. Most of the character backstories are quite good, particularly Maki\u2019s backstory. But the series felt too unfocused in the first half. But in the second half, the main story in put on the front lines and that\u2019s when the series feels a lot better. And the story gets quite interesting and there\u2019s some nice twists and reveals near the end. But the series starts to fall apart during its climax as the series starts to favor melodrama more than anything, and it makes the series feel too cheesy. The ending is too clich\u00e9 and too predictable, thus making the ending disappointing.\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nKiznaiver is made up of two structure. During the first half of the series, Kiznaiver is more character-driven than story-driven. The second half of the series, however, is the opposite. The first half of the series is used to establish its characters and create character relationships. This half focuses on backstories and lets the viewers know how the characters feel. During the second half of the series, reveals are made which makes progress for the story, character tension is created and the truth of the Kizuna System is revealed. Even though this half is used to focus on the story, character development is strongest in this half due to the tension created and how the characters react to it. The problem is that Kiznaiver feels like two different anime, due to a lack of flow between these two parts. And the series is very melodramatic (for the worse) throughout the series. Character reactions feel intentionally emotional, without feeling emotional. Unfortunately, the emotional pain felt by the characters isn\u2019t felt by the viewers. And at times, scenes that should keep you invested might just make you laugh instead, and that\u2019s not a good thing.\\n\r\nPresentation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nFor a character heavy series like Kiznaiver, there needs to be heavy characters (sorry). And it doesn't turn out all that well. Our protagonist, Agata Katsuhira, is a very weird protagonist to say the least. He\u2019s apathetic to the core. He feels no pain, he makes no emotion, and he has no goal. And he\u2019s strangely likable. He has a good backstory and he shines the most in the cast. Sonozaki Noriko, however, felt somewhat lacking as a character. She starts off as a generic coldhearted girl, and by the end of the series, it doesn\u2019t change much. Her backstory is good, but it\u2019s hard to care about her when she wasn\u2019t exactly likable in the first place. And unfortunately her relationship with Agata feels lacking. Takashiro Chidori was a more likable female character. Sure, she\u2019s got a fair share of problems too, and she\u2019s pretty selfish, but at least she made sense and felt realistic. Her and Agata\u2019s relationship was done a lot better too. Tenga Hajime isn\u2019t the most developed character, but he\u2019s fun, likable, and has some good character relationships. Same goes for Niiyama Niko. Maki Honoka gets quite a lengthy, yet interesting, backstory, and ended up being one of the best characters of the series. Yuta Tsuguhito on the other hand, doesn\u2019t get much development and ends up being one of the weaker characters of the series. And then there\u2019s Hisomu Yoshiharu, and he\u2019s just\u2026 yeah. \\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nWhat got me interested in Kiznaiver is the art, and it undoubtedly the best thing about this series. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful to watch at times. The bright colors complement its art style and the background are really well detailed. Kiznaiver doesn\u2019t aim for a photorealistic art style, but rather an abstract one. Character designs can be intentionally disproportional at times to add to the wackiness of the series. The character designs themselves are splendid. Agata\u2019s look is really cool as his hair is a mixture of white and brown (for certain reasons you\u2019ll find out later) and his look always remains the same. Tenga\u2019s hair is quite wacky and it complements his character. Same goes for Niko\u2019s eccentric clothes matching her eccentric characteristics. And Hisomu\u2019s piercing-heavy look is quite unique. Pretty much every character design matches the character. The only problem is that the art is somewhat inconsistent. There will be moments where things feel less detailed, such as character models from far away.\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations are good enough to complement the art of Kiznaiver. The animation quality isn\u2019t the most consistent as there are moments where the level of fluidity decreases, but when the animations are at its peak, it\u2019s really good looking. As some may guess from reading the premise, Kizaniver isn\u2019t an action anime, so animation qualities aren\u2019t demanding. But Trigger does whatever they have to do properly.And the backgrounds are really well animated too, so that adds to the production values. Characters are sometimes intentionally animated disproportionally for style. It normally wouldn\u2019t work well with other anime, but it works with Kiznaiver. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast in Kiznaiver does a very good job in what they have to do. There\u2019s nothing that really stands out, but it\u2019s fine the way it is. Kaji Yuki does a very good job as Agata, as he manages to make the character feel as emotionless as possible, and even during more emotional moments, Kaji does a good job in handling those parts too. Yamamura Hibiku also does a good job as Sonozaki, as she too manages to capture the emotionlessness of her character pretty well. Terasaki Yuka, Satou Rina, and Shimazaki Nobunaga all do a standard role as their characters. It\u2019s nothing too special, but it works. Maeno Tomoaki does a very good job as Tenga, as he manages to capture his over-the-top and down-to-earth moments properly. Kuno Misaki also does a very good job as Niiyama, as she captures her character\u2019s eccentric side properly. And Nishiyama Koutarou does a great job as the masochist Hisomu. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Kiznaiver is alright, though it\u2019s probably the OP and ED that shines the most. The OP, \u201cLAY YOUR HANDS ON ME\u201d can be described by one word: trippy. It\u2019s so trippy and whack that it\u2019s hard not to love it. Listening to it just makes me feel like I need to drop everything and zone out. It\u2019s a very unique OP, complemented by some great music and addicting vocals. The ED, \u201cHajimari no Sokudo\u201d, is also very good. Unlike the OP that heavily relies on the music, the ED relies on the vocals. And fortunately the vocals are pretty good in the song. It\u2019s not as memorable as the OP, but it\u2019s still good. The background music however is a mixed bag. There\u2019s no track that stands out in the series, but there\u2019s no track that left a spur impression on me. Better background music would have been better though. \\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Kiznaiver more than I initially thought I would. The only thing I saw from Trigger beforehand was Inferno Cop, so it was hard for me to understand this studio\u2019s potential. That being said, Kiznaiver was good enough for me to try out Kill la Kill later. Kiznaiver had some characters that I liked, and some characters that felt average. The main premise was interesting and the story was nice, but there\u2019s too many moments in the series where the drama was too much and, at times, made the series cringe worthy. And the ending did leave a sour taste in my mouth. But Kiznaiver, as a whole, was a good series. It wasn\u2019t memorable, but it was fun while it lasted.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kiznaiver is something worth checking out if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s got a good blend of drama, comedy, and romance, even if none of these genres ever get fully explored. The characters are good overall and that\u2019s good for a character-driven anime. The premise is unique, but the execution isn\u2019t up there. There\u2019s too many moments where melodrama takes over and character dialogue can get on the repetitive side. The main story is good once it kicks in and there\u2019s a good amount of reveals to keep you interested. However the ending might be a tad too predictable and clich\u00e9. But Kiznaiver manages to be a good anime despite its flaws, but it never gets to be the great anime it was setting to achieve. \\n\\n\r\n+ Interesting and unique premise that gets fully explored\\n\r\n+ Characters are good and get adequate development \\n\r\n+ Some really tense moments are present in the series and the story has some interesting reveals\\n\r\n+ Art style is absolutely gorgeous at times and the character designs are very unique\\n\r\n- Some of the dialogue can lack its impact and there\u2019s a good amount of cheesy moments\\n\r\n- Series ends on a low note due to a predictable ending\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.4/10",

The concept of the entire series just doesn't have a good enough base. It had a pretty weak start but my interest piqued in it around episode 3. I personally only really enjoyed one of the plot points surrounding one character and that only lasted 1-2 episodes. Many of the characters were ridiculously one-dimensional. The only thing that definedthem was their overall goal???\\n\r\nOverall I would highly recommend just because of the art-- the style alone is enough to make this a 7/10.

            "content": "\"Your bound by your wounds\"\r\nCan we just say that when Studio Trigger does an original work, they always succeed in both themes and being an overall great animes?.\r\nKiznaiver is very different but having the same impact from Trigger's previous original work Kill la Kill however where Kill la Kill is through sheer battle lunacy, Kiznaiver is through sheer emotional extremes and thus can be extremely relatable even in this state.\r\nIn terms of characters, the entire main cast are fleshed out characters with their own quirks here and there, but considering that we're looking at \"pain\" or \"emotional pain\" as a central focus, the anime developsthese characters naturally making the cast to be well-defined, solid and to be frank complex characters, not only on character development but backstory and once again being relatable. LA's favourite character became Niko Niiyama voiced by Misaki Kuno (well that and she reminded LA of a less psychotic but still genki Nui Harime) and LA felt that she was the glue that hold up the main cast together. Many of the characters were homages to previous Trigger/Gainax work, such as rambunctious deliquent Hajime Tenga voiced by Hitoshi Yanai being like Kamina from Tengen Toppa Guren Lagann, the mysterious deadpanned Noriko Sonozaki voiced by Hibiku Yamamura had shades of Satsuki Kiryuinn from Kill la Kill and ever worrying and caring Chidori Takashiro voiced by Yuka Terasaki was Yoko Littner from Tengen Toppa Guren Lagann, however besides Niko, LA had a soft spot for the harsh tsundere Honoka Maki voiced by Rina Sato...not only for her backstory, but Rina Sato did a great job voicing her.\\n\\n\r\nRelationship-wise to this anime, it slowly and surely becomes something of a love dodecahedron with plenty of unrequited love and really LA isn't complaining about the romance in this anime being one part love dodecahedron, one part twice shy relationship as it brings in the great amount of drama it has (consider that LA didn't say MELOdrama), the only three away from dodecahedron are the aforementioned Honoka, the masochistic Yoshiharu Hisomu voiced by Koutarou Nishiyama and the prideful idiot Tsuguhito Yuta voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki.  \\n\\n\r\nFinally LA would like to point to the main character of this series, Katsuhira \"Kacchon\" Agata voiced by Yuki Kaji was at first a deadpanned lifeless person with almost no personality besides his quirk of not feeling pain, but throughout the series, he grew as a character and through his interactions with the other cast members, he not only grew a backbone but a personality and if any character evolved through this series, it was well EVERYONE but also Kacchon too, especially him.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Trigger, well like Trigger to have some solid animation across the board, from the unique character designs to the aesthetics of the Kiznaivers to even how the characters act are solid. The animation is overall solid and unique typical of Trigger.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver's plot does bring up some plot twists here and there and by all means, it's justified and \"makes sense\" and LA really can't fault the writing for it either as even some of the more outrageous moments can justified all because Kiznaiver's theming, concept and execution were done excellently especially as a touchy and generalized subject of \"pain\" and LA isn't gonna lie, many of the plot twist to revelations the characters knew kinda got LA teary-eyed at times.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting???..well what can LA say but the voice acting was stellar throughout the board to the point LA can't single someone out as the best voice actor, the voice acting was just that great.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was by in large, something immense wringing in the character's motivations, emotional highs and connecting it's core themes into this finale and even though the final episode's impact wasn't \"physically batshit crazy\" amazing like Kill la Kill, but emotionally it \"triggered\" all the right notes and although it had a message about friendship, it's not about \"defeating evil\" more like trying to bring out an ENTIRE CAST' beliefs and revelation to the most emotional extremes. On the other hand LA thought the romance side of things did actually pull all the romantic notes decently enough with some official couples formed but some left up in the air and really LA isn't complaining, the ending was still great overall, OTP be damned or not.   \\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver like it's central theme of being connected through emotional pain, it's another great venture from a Trigger work and can be relatable (be it romantic or what have you) and by far this is LA's favourite anime of Spring 2016.",

If anything be prepared to be amazed~\r\nIn just 12 episodes, you are suddenly brought together along with the characters and become familiar with them at the same moment said characters get to know one another. You are thrown into their sudden lives and introduced to personal secrets about themselves that would take hours of episodes for a normal story to carry out, however you never loose the need to find out more. In this aspect, for the story as well as the audience, theplot magnificently ties together \"people\" and the innate need to \"bond\" and \"connect\" with others. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the few anime where they portray characters that branch out from the skin deep appearance and cliche' stereotyped personalities to a more realistic approach, in some sense... as for cons, some of the dialogue definitely seemed somewhat sloppy, especially when they try to define what \"friendship\" is and what it might or might not mean (the repetition is a bit unnecessary) but I think they did a good job trying to explain it in the end.\\n\r\nHowever as a viewer, I was not forced into liking the characters and/or hating them, which is rare.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story is a bit cliche', what with a city created by a secret organization behind the scenes in order to carry out the Kizuna System/project/experiment, but one can mainly look over this by the creativity of the stories entirety.  It's not incredibly impressive but it certainly pulls on your heartstrings and tear glands. \\n\r\nOn top of all that, the artwork, graphic, and soundtrack were very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for those interested in taking a quick roller coaster ride into a world of heart tingling moments, bizarre and awkward situations, and drama this anime will be pulling you along by the nose. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Those who brought you people fighting with super-powered fabric, a psychedelic ninja parody and a skeleton cop with fire for hair have decided to get serious. Sort of. Kiznaiver is the name of studio Trigger\u2019s latest effort, a story revolving around seven students bonded together through their pain. Compared to the studio\u2019s recent offerings it\u2019s a story that is a little more grounded in reality, attempting to appeal to a very important element of humanity: empathy. That\u2019s not to say Kiznaiver isn\u2019t without the sumptuous visual quirks and energy in the cast that made their wackier works so enjoyable, but this time it comes withmore focus on drama and the relationships between characters. It\u2019s a volatile concoction to try and bring under control and this new mixture doesn\u2019t quite work. At times entertaining, Kiznaiver starts dipping into uninteresting side stories, leaves much of the cast one-dimensional and cranks the \u2018drama\u2019 dial up to embarrassingly high levels. \\n\\n\r\nConfused and frustrated by the experiment they find themselves wrapped up in, the group of seven have to delve into each other\u2019s past and solve each other\u2019s problems to avoid hurting themselves any further. There\u2019s two stories going on in Kiznaiver which intertwine, one about the experiment while the other is how it all came to be. The latter was better at keeping my curiosity piqued but it doesn\u2019t get anywhere near enough screen time. Kiznaiver only delves into its most interesting ideas towards the end of the series and it makes you wonder if some early episodes served any purpose against the grand scheme of things. From initially being a more light-hearted story it\u2019s like someone smashed the \u2018It\u2019s time to get serious\u2019 button at a certain point, making for an extremely jarring transition. The issue is that they forgot to prime the \u2018character development\u2019 switch, so the emotional punch Kiznaiver attempts to pull on you during its climatic moments becomes something more akin to a feather touch.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the humour and the way the main seven characters\u2019 personalities clash with one another makes for some fun viewing, particularly in the opening third of the series. How much you as a viewer will take away from its more serious moments though may come down to your tolerance for Mari Okada\u2019s brand of writing: Saturated with characters expressing their feelings loudly and struggling to accept relationships that begin to either form or break down. You can\u2019t deny that the setting of Kiznaiver accommodates this to a degree (seven people forced to bear each other\u2019s pain will definitely bring that out) but that doesn\u2019t abstain it of guilt for some of the emotionally overwrought dialogue it spits.\\n\\n\r\nI feel much of my grief with Kiznaiver lies with Katsuhira as the main character. Katsuhira being such an emotionless shell is obviously an important part of the story. It drums up intrigue, especially with our quiet, white-haired lead posited against such an eclectic collection of characters. He\u2019s designed to make you ask questions like \u2018What brought him to that point? What can the group do to help? Why is he the odd one out?\u2019 And at the start of the series it works well. There\u2019s flashes of backstory and suggestions that there\u2019s much more to him than meets the eye. That initial interest in Katsuhira started to dwindle the more the show went on because all those questions about him weren\u2019t being addressed at an adequate pace. Writing such an emotionally-deprived lead can be a double-edged sword. It leaves plenty of room for growth but on the other side of the coin it\u2019s difficult to stay engaged with shows where the supporting characters do more to entertain and progress the story than the main one does. Katsuhira\u2019s character is so dry it becomes draining to watch, even when knowing there are layers shielding his past yet to be unravelled.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kiznaiver is a show that falls well short of what it\u2019s trying to achieve because it can\u2019t balance its silliness \u2013 a perfectly fine thing to have \u2013 with a sprinkling of maturity. The interactions aren\u2019t that realistic between the cast and that\u2019s a crippling blow for a show trying to tackle something quite serious: What it means to live through the \u2018human condition\u2019.\\n",

I normally hate this kind of character but his lack of personality is very relevant to the plot so I can let it slide. However, this makes the first part painful to watch because he's just not interesting. \r\nThe middle of the story however, is where the drama intensifies. I don't want to say more because this is the best part of the story. What I do wantto say is that all the other characters shine in this part of the show. And with that, Nico is best girl.\\n\\n\r\nIt all spirals downward from there as the plot tries to up the stakes. The central conflict doesn't have a lot of flavor because the main antagonist's struggle isn't explored enough to warrant her actions. It IS explained but it's very hard to give a crap about it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the story misses out on being an absolute blast and simply becomes above average.\\n\\n\r\nI would give this show a weak recommendation if you're only here for the drama because some shows can make you cry harder. If you're someone who likes to draw and is leaning towards a career in fine arts, it's worth it to  watch the show simply for the sake of the visuals. Art style is done by Miwa Shirow so of course the designs look sharp and appealing.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, the OP of this show is amazing.

            "content": "Kiznaiver Review\r\n(There is a possibility I spoil minor details of Kiznaiver in the following review. So be warned. I won't spoil any plot-heavy elements, but I do delve into the shows themes, as well as lightly describe a few characters and tease a late-series scene, but don't actually describe it in detail.) \r\nKiznaiver left me with just one feeling at the end of its twelve-episode run: understanding. Not an understand on my part, but an understanding from the studio. It seems legitimately like Trigger understands something that other studios just do not about the human experience. Obviously, they have showcased understanding of what makes funthings fun, namely in Kill la Kill, Inferno Cop, and Space Patrol Luluco, three of the most fun, hype, exciting, etc. shows I have seen since Gurren Lagann. But contrary to what the hedonists in your time will tell you, there is more to life than just having fun. I think, after instinct, humans have two basic \"things\" for lack of a better term: emotion, and connection. As people, we can both feel things that are not in the physical realm, as well as connect those feelings with others. In a way, we become part of each other, sharing our experiences and overcoming hurdles together. And before I continue any farther, I should say that I believe those two \"things\", those concepts of emotion and connection, are the driving force of Kiznaiver. They are the show, the story, the characters, the animation, and the sound. They pervade every part of this series, and they left me with something I had never quite felt in anime before.  \\n\r\nIf I just score this show on the outline to the side, using Story, Animation, Sound, Character, and Enjoyment, I cannot do justice to Kiznaiver. Just like human emotions, there is an intangible to this series, something that can't just have a number slapped on it to explain it. The more I write about this show, the more brilliant I think it is. The only way to understand my true feelings is to experience the show, and funnily enough, experience is such a core theme of Kiznaiver. I couldn't tell you for certain if this was Trigger's intention, but damn is it successful. Since I don't believe the score's for the five categories will truly highlight why I love this show, I will say now that this intangible I speak of is also factored into my overall rating. That may be confusing, but it is the only way I can see fairly assessing the show.  \\n\r\nThe story of Kiznaiver is interesting, using a textbook definition of science fiction as its plot. From Merriam-Webster, science fiction: stories about how people and societies are affected by imaginary scientific developments in the future. This is Kiznaiver's story, exploring how connecting pain between individuals can affect said individuals. Initiall, the show posits that world peace would be attained if this were applied globaly, but it doesn't focus on that. It instead uses a sort of slice-of-life format, choosing to zero in on eight main characters: Katsuhira Agata, Yoshiharu Hisomu, Honoka Maki, Niko Niiyama, Noriko Sonozaki, Chidori Takashiro, Hajime Tenga, and Tsuguhito Yuta, and delve into how their lives are affected by this \"Kiznaiver\", which based on the Japanese words for wound/scar and bond/connection. While Noriko Sonozaki archetypes the rest of the show's characters as \"Seven Deadly Sins\", it is my belief that this is one of the best casts of characters I have ever seen in terms of realism. I feel like in life I have met someone just as eccentric as Niko, someone just as closed-off and bitchy as Maki, someone as emotionally cut-off as Katsuhira, someone as confrontational as Tenga. The characters reminded me of the Great Gatsby, in the sense that they all felt like accurate depictions of people, not characters written for a story. Each one felt unique, and different, and it was wonderful to see. To add to that, the characters actually progressed from episode one to episode twelve. I was most surprised by Hisomu's progression from a seemingly-forgettable side-character to one of the funniest characters in the show, hands down. Each character reacted normally to situations, and didn't feel like some esoteric, philosophy spouting mouth-piece, but like people!  \\n\r\nSpeaking of mouth-pieces, they were all fantastically voiced by their actors and actresses. In fact, all the sound of Kiznaiver was excellent. Hayashi Yuuki, the composer of the My Hero Academia, Death Parade, and Haikyuu!! soundtracks did this one, and he was wonderful. The music brought out emotions like nothing else I have seen in anime, making you feel melancholy, joy, elation, excitement, and levity. In addition to the show's OST, the OP by Boom Boom Satellites was an entrancing electronic tune, and the ED was a solid, catchy J-pop song. And I would be utterly remiss if I didn't comment on the sound design, especially of episode ten. The shows sound director, Kameyama Toshiki, crafted one of the most heart-crunching, bone-chlling, emotionally-haunting scenes I have ever listened to in the final part of episode ten. I also feel I must bring up the excellent performances by the voice actors in this scene. I mean it when I say I do not think I will ever forget the word \"itai\" for the rest of my life.  \\n\r\nAnd I guess I could not end the \"objective\" portion of the review without mentioning the animation. With Trigger, you have three options, animation-wise. One, Little Witch Academia-tier, which is consistently amazing through out. Two, Kill la Kill and Space Patrol Luluco-tier, which shows flashes of brilliance but also poorly animated sequences, whether by lack of funding or by intention. And three, Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer-tier, which, to borrow Demolition D+'s word's, embraces the \"clip-art animation techniques\". It brings me great joy to say Kiznaiver belongs in the top-tier of animation, surpassing Little Witch Academia. The design of the city looks modern enough to surprise you with sci-fi elements, but also feel eerily like real life. The literal animation showcases some amazing talent. For some reason, the shadows stood out to me. The color palette was superb, with vibrancy when needed and dullness when required. And the character design is something to behold. Each character looks unique, with the exception of Tenga, because he just looks like red-haired Space Dandy. Yuta and Hisomu were probably the most original designs I have seen in the Spring 2016 season. Also, the fashion. It's like the gods of good clothing taste blessed these animators, not only allowing for incredibly stylish characters, but also for bright, colorful, and stand-out clothes to associate with the characters. The clothing honestly did so much as to contribute to the characterization, that is how amazing it was.  \\n\r\nIf you couldn't tell after slogging through my review, I have nothing but praise for Kiznaiver. It excelled at animation, sound, and character, while having a passable and intriguing story. But now I would like to attempt to explain the \"intangible\" I described earlier. Because that is what pushes Kiznaiver so far, not its superb animation, not its wonderful sound design, and not its diverse and animated cast of characters. No, it is the themes of the show, and their expression that push this show to new boundaries. To not spoil anything, pain, connection, and friendship are explored with more depth than I have ever seen. I believe that depth comes from the realistic nature of the presentation. You literally see pain, you literally see connection through pain, and you literally see friendship bloom because of that connection. The themes build upon each other, each one necessary for the other. Without pain, connection can't happen and friendship cannot either. With connection, then we would become isolated and most-likely calloused, maybe even jaded. And without friendship, we would lack a meaning expression of connection, and feel like pain and connection were purposeless. This is what I meant at the beginning when I said that Trigger understands. They simply get it. But what is \"it\"? \"It\" is to be human. I often hear the saying, \"Humans are social creatures\". And they are right. Humans need connection and friendship, and while it is unfortunate, pain creates connections like nothing else. Pain births people into the world as babies, and often times, pain takes people out of the world. Pain is absolutely core to our being, just like it is absolutely core to Kiznaiver. Without pain, the show, the story, the characters, the sound, they are nothing. But with pain, they are connected. With pain, they are friends. And with pain, they feel love.  \\n\r\nI can never truly justify my 10/10 rating of this show. By no means is it perfect, as my rating of the story should prove. And I doubt anyone will really experience the same thing I felt when watching this anime. But the positives of Kiznaiver far, far outweigh the negatives. No show has ever so uniquely and so piercingly explored its themes in the way Trigger explored its themes in Kiznaiver. And no show will likely ever connect to me on the emotional level like Kiznaiver did. Isn't that funny in a sense? A show about connection passes through the TV screen, and connects with its viewers heart. That is something beautiful, remarkable, and something I believe is worth celebrating.  \\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n",

But, it has fallen to what I like to call, \"Seasonal Anime Syndrome\". This is when a show wants to tell a grand story is hindered by its run time of only 12-13 episode. (i.e Charlotte) Kiznaiver offered some of what could've been the best characters I've seen in the summer season. In the first episode you are introduced to a bunch of high school sterotypes. (Greased-up punk, cold and studious girl, the cutesy weirdo.) But in episode 2, it is revealed thatthe cutesy weirdo acts the way they do as a desire to stand out. At first glance this would be great. Exploring seemingly one-note characters and exploring why they act the way they do as their true selves are forced out through the Kizna System, showing the complexity of teenagers as they struggle with mature and such. But after this revelation, it's almost forgotten, and the character doesn't change. This happens to all of the characters. Not to mention the one major arc focused around one of the characters is mainly backstory exposition with lesbians.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut dear god it looks great. Also I personally loved the opening and ending songs, especially the ending. While not visually stunning, the song itself was wonderful. But I'm no musician or artist so I won't go into detail.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I would've preferred if the series was a full 26 episodes, covering and developing all of the main cast, with the final arc covering Katsuhira and Noriko, but that's just me spewing my ideas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConsidering how negative this review is, I actually enjoyed the show a lot. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they are a fan of Studio Trigger's style of animation.",

Some love it and some hate it. I\u2019ve found that one\u2019s enjoyment of Kiznaiver depends largely on what type of plot you enjoy. I will give my opinion on whether I loved it or hated it and try to justify my reasoning.\r\nStory:\t9.35 / 10\r\nThe story is an emotional roller-coaster, explored from the perspective of several different characters. Due to these differing perspectives, I got emotionally attached to the characters and the developments were really impactful. The strong point of thestory is how it handles its characters, which I will get to later. Kiznaiver also has a brilliant message that you are left with after watching it which has been stuck in my head ever since I completed it for the first time. And I am the kind of person to enjoy plots exploring emotions and appreciate complex messages that a show leaves behind. As a result, I loved the story of Kiznaiver, although I will admit that your enjoyment does depend on your taste in story types. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\t9.85 / 10\\n\\n\r\nSimply beautiful. The color palette is amazing and the environment is vibrant and alive. The animation is always great and everything is always on-model. The art style always reflects the tone of the scene. Visually among the best-looking anime I\u2019ve seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \t9.65 / 10\\n\\n\r\nGreat soundtrack, especially in the big scenes where it matters. The English dub is really good as well. Kiznaiver does definitely get a massive plus in this category for its opening song, which is simply awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\t9.6 / 10\\n\\n\r\nWriting-wise, the characters are where this show shines. Since it is all about the 7 main characters and their relationships, each one of them is well developed, but in entirely their own way. Some of the character aspects might be exaggerated, but in this case, almost all of these aspects are actually explained through character backstory. Also, since the lineup of main characters is so large, it is more likely for the viewer to be able to relate to at least one of them, since they are so wildly different.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\t9.7 / 10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I loved the story of Kiznaiver. Though some might find it slightly confusing, since the show never outright states what message it is trying to convey. But that leads to the viewer having to think about the show to find the message \u2013 which is the type of thought-provoking emotional story that I enjoy. I enjoyed the visuals, the emotions, the characters (some more than others) and I especially enjoyed the opening. I enjoyed watching Kiznaiver so much that I have re-watched it three times and I definitely will re-watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\t \t9.65 / 10\t\\n\\n\r\nI think it is great. Not perfect, since there are some strange scenes and repetitive dialogue, but it succeeds on almost every other level. However, if the viewer cannot get invested in the characters for whatever reason or he/she doesn\u2019t like to think further to see the whole picture that Kiznaiver paints, I can understand why it can be disliked. Fortunately, I am one of those viewers that vote for this show\u2019s greatness.\\n",

The further it progresses, the duller and more predictable the story gets though.\r\nFull explanation:\r\nWhen I started watching this anime I was taken in by the interesting setting and the good artstyle and music. The characters are all very likeable and you enjoy their development. So in the beginning I though it would turn out a solid 10/10 anime. However after the first two episodes I already had a hunch how it would end, in episode three I was already sure of it and was never surprised or shocked by thedevelopment. It feels to much of a copy of any other romance anime. So basically I felt like it was an awesome setting and overall atmosphere, but it died along the way, giving it a huge penalty and settling for a final 6/10 rating.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver, or how to reach world peace by having everyone feel what everyone else feels.\r\nIt's errr...okay I guess.\r\nStory: 4: Without spoiling, don't expect the ending to be very good.\r\nThe Kiznaiver system ends up not paying off as well as you might expect and the whole of the story is structured around small episodes or double episodes which either explore the characters' psyche some more, either just provide a generic danger or trial for them to pass. \r\nThe main idea is interesting but not quite explored as cleverly as it could, and to be frank I found the anime fun and enjoyable to a point, butnever capable of delivering anything beyond some fun anime times. Mainly because the entire anime sort of waddles around the Kiznaiver system and the plot had other ideas in mind than just that. And secondarily because it's just not that well told. The anime is character-centric and isn't that good at expressing all of the characters' feelings (especially Noriko Sonozaki) and when the plot tries to tie in several layers together at the end, it reaaaaaaaally doesn't work well at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 : It's Trigger. Yes you'll find a lot of things to look like TTGL or Kill la Kill here. No surprises, it looks good, it's well animated, it feels alive and is overall very well done and stylish.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8: ripoff of a-ha or not, that opening alone will let Kiznaiver leave a (small) mark in my mind. Beyond that, solid voice cast and solid sound effects at all times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7: I liked Tenga quite a lot and I found Chidori cute and the others were also at least decent, but this isn't a character study.\\n\r\nIt's more of a \"diverse people become friends\" story, and it's built to be like that episode after episode, but since the main plot sort of clonks down around the end, the relationships between them are rarely pushed to the brink and they just all sort of are characters, and they sort of become friends, and they sort of fall in love or don't fall in love and some stuff happens.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 : This one boils down to one question to me:\\n\r\nDo you like anime and specifically Trigger?\\n\r\nIf yes to both, you'll enjoy this, at least to a point. \\n\r\nIf no to Trigger, this may not find much grace with you.\\n\r\nIf no to both, this definitely isn't the anime to show how great anime can be. I'm gonna be a little mean and say that it feels like standard anime with a standard anime plot of sci-fi and a standard character list of standard anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I'd just like to say that I had a good bit of fun watching Kiznaiver. I'm giving it a 7, hesitating on 6.\\n\\n\r\nBut will I remember it? Nope. Nothing about it, its plot, its setting, its cast, or any single specific part of it, shone out. This is an anime done by Trigger, with Trigger style of character design, drawing and animation, and it's good, it has a sort of bad plot that isn't terrible, and it has an anime cast of anime characters that are all anime. If you like anime and/or Trigger, you'll like it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if I sound bored by Kiznaiver, maybe it's because I sort of was.\\n\\n\r\nSure, it is stylish. It's from Trigger.\\n\r\nSure, nothing about the cast, art or sound was bad.\\n\r\nSure, it gave me a good bit of fun several times.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, the subpar plot does not destroy my enjoyment, even if I was sort of let down.\\n\\n\r\nBut being on par with the standards, even with the help of Trigger's talent, does not suffice at being anything above decent or good at best. And that's really what this is. It's decent. It's kinda good. It's got a lot of little ups and one down. It's not very ambitious. It's very generic. It's just...standard.",

AMAZING sound and music.  it was a feast for the senses, it was one of the few anime where I refused to skip the opening/ending themes. But because of the short season, a lot of thing were left up in the air. \r\nOne thing in particular was a satisfactory backstory for a third of their cast. If you are going to have a large cast and a plot focusing on equality, then a fleshed out back story for all the main characters is just needed. \r\nAnother thing was theplot itself. \\n\r\n*spoilers*\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf they had focused more on the Kiznaivers  bonding I would have been happy. More challenges before the Shipping Wars and the Climax happened. it was just kinda a \"how did they get from point A to Point B type of thing. It made the story fell disappointingly rushed (which it probably was for lack of time)\\n\\n\r\nAll and all though, despite the problems I have. GOD this series was enjoyable because of the EMOTIONS. \\n\r\nIt gave all the feels, all of them. All of the main characters were very relatable  (despite me complaining about lack of backstory). \\n\r\nIn the end I really found myself thinking about who I am, What I have accomplished, and the bonds I have made. I think THAT was the best part of the show, the part that makes you think. The part that maybe, just maybe, helps you discaver a part of yourself. <3",

            "content": "I've read many of the reviews and I disagree with many of them.  I honestly do not think they do this excellent anime justice; thus I thought I'd throw in my two cents about it.\r\nThe voice acting is superb in this anime.  Yuki Kaji, the voice-actor for the main character, expertly delivered the monotonous tone that was needed to convey the character issue - the loss of pain.  However, despite the monotony the voice actor portrays in the character, I was not, not even once, bored with Katsuhira.  From the first episode, the story developers easily establish the needed hints asto why Katsuhira is the way he is and why his loss of feeling pain was actually not how he was when he was younger. As a watcher of the anime, I knew that something traumatic had to have happened to him.  Around episode 10, Yuki Kaji slowly changes the tone and intensity in his voice, offering more life to the character that wasn't present in the majority of the anime. At that point, I could literally hear Katsuhira slowly regaining his humanity, almost as if the voice actor himself was slowly realizing that pain is precious in its own way and that his character needed to have the desire to feel pain first before realizing that.\\n\\n\r\nThe other voice actors also did an excellent job.  I found their delivery of the pain and suffering involved with getting their heart broken for the first time performed very well.  I was convinced that Chidori was in a lot of pain and that Honoka had suffered greatly in her youth. Yuka Terasaki delivered that pain in every line and I thought Rina Sato (Honoka Maki) stayed in character and delivered her lines well.   Overall, they all did well, and you always have to remember that the voice actors we hear all so often in animes do an excellent job anyway.  If there ever is a blame, it is in the story and how those characters are drawn to convey emotion.  There's only so much a voice actor can do.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was excellent.  There are a few flaws here and there, but I\"m not going to knock off a point for the story just because it isn't perfect.  Perfection is, simply, impossible.  Let me first start by saying that all of these characters are around sixteen, seventeen years old; so it shouldn't be a wonder that these characters are going to have high school related drama.  In other words, they are going to fall in love with their friends but find out that friend doesn't love them but one of their other friends...etc etc.  To be honest though, I thought the way the love stories developed was refreshing.  If you've watched as many animes as I have, especially recent ones (e.g. The Asterisk War, GATE, Fairy Tail...even Fate/Stay Night...) I think you'll find the candid confessions of the other characters to be very refreshing, indeed.  (cough cough, Gray and Juvia anyone???)  I mean, how many times have you seen a girl character have secret, hidden feelings, blushing like no one can notice and stuttering at every word when she's around the MC?  HMMMM??? Yeah, a lot.  And how long does that last?  THE ENTIRE FREAKIN' SERIES. In this anime, literally in the second episode, one of the female characters outright admits that she likes the MC. Let's just say that I was appreciative of that. \\n\\n\r\nI thought the use of the Kiznaiver system was a good way to push plot development and character development.  As other reviewers have stated, this anime is a character-oriented anime that involves a failed government program called Kiznaiver. This system started with nineteen adolescents (around the age of six or seven, although they don't specifically state that) with the hopes that if these children can learn to share their pain with each other, then world peace can be achieved.  This is pretty intuitive actually. I mean, how many murderers would murder (unless they were like Hisomu) if the pain they inflicted on others rebounded against them?  How many people would kill another if they were linked to that person knowing that that person they killed would be the end of them as well?  Murder would, for all intents and purposes, cease to be; war would end and everyone would become more conscientious of each others wants and needs. Sounds like a great idea....right?\\n\\n\r\nWrong. There was a flaw in that system, resulting in devastating results for those children. I won't say why, for spoiler reasons. Once the sponsors and the government running heard of this failure, the scientists running the show were left scrambling to fix the 'error' they had created while pushing forward a failed system that still had the potential to achieve their ultimate goal. This is where the anime starts.  Seven teenagers are 'kidnapped' and taken to a facility where they are all put into the Kiznaiver program.  The anime is centered around these seven characters and through the series, they slowly become friends while learning how to cope with each other's pain.  \\n\\n\r\nFriendship, itself, is the saving grace for the characters and is pivotal in explaining why one of the characters is dead wrong in her pursuit.  There is an underlining tone of being alone, of loneliness, and how that some people will try to do anything in order to achieve that.  Sometimes you end up hurting the ones you care about the most without even realizing it.  But that is the lesson of the anime; you can't go through life expecting not to get hurt and yet still live a fulfilling life.  A fulfilled life requires good friends, friends that will still like you even if you cause them pain or, you are in pain for whatever reason. To me, that is what this anime is really about. It's realizing the importance of feeling pain.  This anime plays around with that concept, such as in Katsuhira and Himosu. One doesn't understand pain and cannot feel it.  But at the same time, he acts lifeless and uncaring to his friends around him.  Himosu, on the other hand, loves pain because it makes him feel alive and it allows him to know who he really is.  That is the contrast with the characters and Himosu stands out for that reason.  Through pain, Himosu knows himself better than the others because they are afraid to get hurt. Katsuhira is the extreme version of that.\\n\\n\r\nThe flaws, I would say, is that the anime isn't long enough.  I would have liked to see the love relationships developed more. Another flaw is that the final crisis in the last episode is weak (not super weak, but weak enough to cause me to think, \"the poop hasn't really hit the fan, yet\").  The anime also tried to make some of the characters immediate love interests, which I thought was very sudden.  If they had extended the anime, that could have been fixed.  But that wasn't really a problem since I got the gist of it.  I didn't need a lot of backstory with all the characters since it was pretty self explanatory where most of the characters stood.  I mean, adding the reasons why Tenga was a hot-headed fighter would have been unnecessary and distracting from the main plot, and diving deeper into Yuta's weight problem wasn't needed either.  I get it. Yuta was fat and he was embarrassed by it.  What else do I need to know? I do wish, though, that they had developed the MC's love interest storylines more. That would have been welcomed. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I'm not going to edit this much. I just wanted to write something that was from the heart. I thought that was appropriate.\\n",

            "content": "Dear Kizna Research Team: Sharing pain is not the same as feeling empathy. You failed.\r\nStory:\r\nWhat is this anime actually about? Well, it starts out as a story about the Kizna system, that makes people feel each others pain. Bringing together a colorful cast of very different people and forcing them to more or less live together is a pretty interesting premise. Here's where the problems begin. Kiznaiver tries to be more and starts growing into several different directions, losing its focus on the way. First it (almost) drops the whole thing about being kidnapped and used as guinea pigs for a story about their growingfriendship, then we get a horrible teen love drama and then we go back again to the actual plot, but do something totally different with it. By trying to be something special, Kiznaiver fails to deliver and ends being a nearly episodic mess with no real conclusion. (Yes, it does have a conclusion, but there are so many things that were just ignored for it, that I have a hard time calling it that).\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIf you've seen one of the other Trigger anime like Kill la Kill or Gurren Lagann, you know what to expect and that is what you will get. I enjoy Triggers artstyle, though taking place in a more realistic setting, they don't go overboard with crazy stuff, which is okay. However, one starts to see a pattern in character art, which I may criticize in future reviews of Trigger anime.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening is awesome, plain and simple. The ending is also okay. Voice acting in general is well done, a little over the top at times, but charming enough for me. The rest of the soundtrack was okay, not memorable but not distracting either.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis one is hard to rate. On one hand, I liked many of them, the roles they portray and the way they react to things. On the other hand, we have the mess of a story that makes them look like idiots, even though they are rarely at fault for this. My big issue here are the main characters, Kacchon and Sonozaki, who are completely unlikeable. It's not because they don't seem to have any emotions, but rather the fact that they don't seem to care about anything but themselves and hurt others as they please if it benefits their goals. For me, the ending does not redeem them.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nKiznaiver gave me a hard time enjoying it. A promising start was followed by stupid decisions to take the plot into all the wrong directions. At around episode 9 it got so bad, that I was pondering dropping it. I managed to make t through, but my enjoyment died on the way. What pisses me off most about it is, that it was completely unnecessary. They could have just told a story about the Kizna project and I would have probably liked it. The way it turned out though left me unsatisfied. I wouldn't call Kznaiver a bad anime, but knowing what was ahead, I would not start watching it again.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n5.4/10",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is a show that's not entirely sure what it wants to be.  On one hand, it's a wacky adventure with colorful characters, and on the other hand it's a story about pain, friendship, and what it means to connect with someone.  It works well enough, but it's not as deep or amazing as it wants to be.  The parts using the profoundly strange setup for adventure and even some comedy are never quite as high energy as you want them to be, and because the show takes itself much more seriously than, say, Kill la Kill, it's much more restrained inwhat it's able to do, shackled to the desire to do the serious end of its themes justice.  On the other hand, the show might not take itself seriously enough to give a good treatment to pain and bonding (for which my touchstone, though outside the sphere of Anime, would be Planescape: Torment) and the dramatic moments can fail to land because of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, such as it is, is all over the place.  In a way, there are two of them, and they don't really interact as much as they dovetail.  Story One is the story that you get pitched in the beginning: seven profoundly weird people get connected in a way that causes them to share the pain they suffer with all the others they're bonded to.  It's adequately entertaining, but after a very strong first couple of episodes it starts to wear thin as the protocols of the \"Kizna Experiment\" come off as ever more forced and its results increasingly... nonsensical, and not in the \"fun and goofy\" way.  Eventually, in what was admittedly something of a return to strong episodes, it dovetails into Story Two, which concerns really only two of the characters, with the rest as a supporting cast.  Story Two is good, and it does need Story One in order to resolve, but I wish that the two stories had been more deeply interconnected -- we get some good setup for Two throughout One, but story One just ends fairly abruptly, like the writers realized they were out of things they could really do with it.  And for me, at least, the biggest problem is that it ends on a note where I would have liked to see it continue.  I can't fault this too much, but the dead end of the 'main' track really rubs me the wrong way.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is, at least, a show with a very definite style.  The animation is flowing and the cast is literally extremely colorful in a really dynamic and interesting way.  I think there would be some entertainment value in watching Kiznaiver even if you muted the sound and killed any subtitles, it's downright impressive.  There are better shows, ones that actually do something spectacular, but Kiznaiver is very good for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kiznaiver, however, are something that I really can't let slide.  This is very much a character-focused show, in that several characters get episodes devoted to just trying to work them out, and... as that, it doesn't land.  I don't dislike these characters, but the only ones that actually felt like interesting, rounded people were the more peripheral characters.  Chidori, Agata, Tenga, and Sonozaki are all pretty uninteresting: Tenga and Chidori pretty much play one note each and Chidori especially doesn't get forced out of her 'comfort zone' enough to really develop as a character.  It's a shame, she's performed very well and is central enough to the main story that I'd like to see her have more issues, or for there to be other things she cares about, but with the single exception of her unrequited love the show is largely uninterested in actually exploring who she is, what she likes, or even what else might make her hurt.  And for all the weight given to her love, I'm kind of at a loss as to why she's holding onto it so tightly.  She tells us a few things in the first episode, but they're all legitimately past-tense, and nothing about her situation or current interaction actually supports the depths of her feelings, especially with how badly locked out of the loop she is.  \\n\\n\r\nAgata and Sonozaki have a different problem.  They're the most central characters (the ones critical to what I called Story Two) and... they both are given almost totally flat affects.  Now, there's a good reason why each of them has this trait, and as far as the design of the show I know why they did it and good for them holding on to that despite what's going on, but... boy does it make them unappealing as leads.  In a way, I guess it actually supports the theme of the show (that people need to share and understand each others pains in order to connect, even if that should be done through mundane mechanisms), because these characters never emote, and because of that you can never quite feel for them the way you might like to.  They have one or two good scenes together, and Agata has another on his own, but at some point Agata should have, at least, broken out of the dull, flat affect.  He does for a moment, but then he's back at it all the way to and through the climax.  It was a philosophically consistent choice, but in terms of developing good characters, it was the wrong choice.  Especially when two more of the side characters, Yuta and Honoka, have slightly different but still largely flat affects\\n\\n\r\nI will say... I enjoyed the show well enough despite that.  The single loud notes of Chidori, Tenga, Hisomu, and Nico (along with the surprising depths of the latter two characters) make for a lot of good scenes, and while the writers still had material to work with the basic premise of Story One, it was really good.  Like I said before, I wanted to see that story continue, and I feel that in some ways the time that was spent on setting up and running Story Two could have been better spent extending and developing the depths of the basic Kiznaiver premise.  All the same, I didn't dislike Story Two, and it had some really good moments.  The show is at its best in episodes 1 and 2 and then sort of comes back into form for 8, 9, and 11.  The other episodes aren't bad, but I don't feel like they use their setup as well as they could, nor do they develop the right characters in the right way.  All in all, I'd be willing to watch it again if I knew someone who wanted to, but I probably won't go back for seconds on my own.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 6",

            "content": "Studio Trigger pulled the double this spring season of 2016. Their first show I came a cross this season was the short wild and wacky tour de force of Trigger intellectual properties: Space Patrol Luluco. The other was Kiznaiver, which continues Trigger's trend of producing a respectable number of original works to go along side their adaptations.\r\nOur \"main\" character Katsuhira has an odd condition in which he cannot feel pain, be it physical or, as it seems, emotional as well. His close childhood friend Chidori protects him from those who would look to take advantage of him, and if you're thinking this is some gradeA shipping fuel, well you haven't even heard the half of it yet.\\n\\n\r\nI say Katsuhira is a \"main\" character in quotations because the show quickly introduced a number of other characters who are all far more interesting than the first two I've mentioned. By the end of the first episode all these characters are abducted and given the show's trademark Kizna scars that bind them all together by making them all feel each other's pain. You might be saying at this point \"this sounds like a great plot for a suspense/ mystery show\", you're right it does. Unfortunately the blue haired Rei Ayanami clone in this show fucks that right up.\\n\\n\r\nStandard creepy blue haired emotionless doll character #241, Sonozaki explains all the details of the Kizna, how it works, what her and her organization hope to accomplish, etc. all in the space of a few minutes. She then explains that the group will have to complete tests together in order to avoid some non-specific penalty (These tests are beamed to the kiznas via hologram). \\n\\n\r\nAll of this effectively takes out any suspense or narrative investment right at the knees. However, the worst part of it all is that the show still tries to play it off as though there is still some big mystery when clearly there isn't.\\n\\n\r\nThe show would have benefited hugely if Sonozaki weren't introduced at all and the Kizna scars were never explained, only leaving the hologram notes of the tests that were now underway. Now that's a damn suspense/ mystery plot right there. But even then, there are so many group situations and group outings that are done for the sake of narrative convenience that are left poorly explained in every episode that the writers felt there had to be some anchoring point for the show to go from.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else from the show is solid though. The opening is nice, the animation and visuals are top notch even though the semi-futuristic light novel city trope is getting horrendously over used here in the last few seasons, and finally most of the characters do get some good development even though I found it harder to give a shit with each successive episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're a Trigger fan like me you'll probably feel compelled to watch the show from flag to flag no matter what I say. As for the passing anime fan: take it or leave it, you're not going to lose sleep either way. Although, if you're willing to put in the time for it, the back half of the show is far stronger than the first.",

            "content": "Did you read the synopsis? Did you like it? If you did, it's worth watching like it's a ten. If you don't then it's worth watching like an eight. That's actually all you need to know. If you want to know why I think that let me now get to the review part.\r\nThe biggest issue of Kiznaiver is in the nature of it's writing. The core idea is a story about people that literally share their pain. If you are interested in things like story writing or simply seen or read a lot of entertainment media like manga or anime then you might already havean idea of what will happen in the series. In fact you can make a checklist and play a drinking game with it. There are just certain obvious plotpoints and twists that have to happen in this story to not waste it's potential and they obviously will. I can't recall any anime that previously delt with this gimmick yet I already felt like it's \u201canother one on the topic\u201d. It's good, don't get me wrong. Great even. It's an ideal storyline for a slice of life drama and trigger being an action-loving studio keeps it interesting and well-paced. They basically took something obvious and executed it as well as it was possible to execute, but the topic itself provided little maneuverability and space for imagination. Once you know the characters you will know what will they do. It's an uncanny feeling that shouldn't get you out of the story but it makes it difficult to judge it's quality. The idea is great and the execution is perfect. But there's little to no effort in coming up with the idea or executing it due to how great it is on it's own. Does a story like that deserve a medal? An award for being invented or picked? I don't really think so. That's why I gave it an 8. It's more than good but less than revolutionary or inspiring. Putting it in a weird spot.  What I can say for sure is that it's worth going through at least once and that it's by no means any worse than a 7.5, which is quiet a good grade anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWhat helps the story a lot are the Characters. The character design is very interesting. They are different, they look original but they also don't stand out too much from common people. They fit their realistic modern-day setting but also thanks to that setting can't really do anything outstanding that would make them anything more even if their interactions are quiet reasonable and always in line with their personalities. They're just great. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the technical side the Art of the series is not bad. It has some nice colors and decent linework. I had a small issue with animation of running and only that. For whatever reason characters often run in a bizarre out-of-place fashion that actually took me out of the show a few times. It looks comedic even during dramatic scenes and it has no real purpose. It could be argued that it was done to make it look a bit more frantic but it failed at that. To outweigh that the show has some nice special effects and felt rather pleasant to look at overall. So I decided to rate it as a 7, but a 6 would also be in place. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound has similar issues. It was more on the enjoyable side but nothing really stuck in my head. It's just fair.\\n\\n\r\nI would have to rate my enjoyment at 8. I'm coming mostly from the fact that I put a lot of attention to the story of the show I'm watching and I enjoyed the execution of the topic of the show a great deal. Even if I can't rate it all that high. Nothing really stood in my way of having fun even if nothing was really outstanding. You could compare it to a catchy song. It might not have much meaning but there's something interesting in there and it's pleasant enough to put on your playlist.",

            "content": "(Disclaimer: I go into spoilers a little at the Favorite Character section, so just skip to the final paragraph if you want to see my overall thoughts. Also, rant warning, sorry.)\r\nFinishing Kiznaiver and Classroom of the Elite on the same day really made for a day full of disappointment, albeit for entirely different reasons. In Classroom of the Elite's case, it was due to the looseness of the adaptation, causing them to really fail to reach Classroom of the Elite's full potential. However, in regards to Kiznaiver, Trigger happened. Before I go any further with that line of thought, I'd better throw out there thatI did enjoy Kiznaiver a lot, I just didn't like the direction that it went around episode 9. The sad part was that I saw it coming. I told myself that this was a Trigger work and something bizarre was bound to happen, pushing the show over the line. It just seems like a curse at this point. Anything Trigger touches ends up breaking the bounds of ridiculous after starting off really strong.\\n\\n\r\nProduction-wise, Kiznaiver simply exudes that Trigger quality. The animation is smooth and pleasing, especially in the early episodes. As the show goes on, you can tell that the animation quality fades somewhat to 'normal' quality, which works just fine. The character designs are a huge strength in Kiznaiver as well, every single character has a unique design and color scheme to pair with their respective 'sins' or negative quality. It all comes together to really make the characters pop and give each their own unique personality without even having them say a word. As far as the soundtrack goes, none of the OST songs really shine in my opinion, but the opening alone causes me to give the audio an A+ from me. Visually, the ending is great, but the song is just kinda average, which works, since it's carried by its visuals anyway. All in all, Kiznaiver is really solid on the technical side of things, as expected from Trigger, as this is really where most of their works shine. However, up next is where I'll kinda go off on Kiznaiver.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Yoshiharu Hisomu\\n\\n\r\nHuh? The Masochist? The one who shows up like 3 episodes in and gets the least amount of screen time and development? I mean, yeah. Ironically enough, he is literally the only character that has an ounce of common sense in him. He's probably the only true friend of the seven, as evidenced by the fact that he stuck with Katsuhira even in his darkest time. I think his being my favorite character has more to do with the fact that the other characters really annoyed me at certain points of the show, whereas Masochist was really steady and reliable. Despite that, there was a point in the show as it was waning that I realized that Masochist had grown a lot. No longer was he the loner who cared only for his own self-pleasure, he had become quite the caring friend. Even though it was subtle, I definitely noticed that he grew. So, call it lack of development or a strong character, it really doesn't matter.\\n\\n\r\nChidori was a hair away from taking favorite character from Masochist, but I decided against it due to the fact that even she annoyed me at a certain point. It was brief, but enough to not choose her. On a more ranty note, I am really kind of pissed with the way that Kiznaiver used Chidori and every other Kiznaiver that wasn't the main character. To start with Chidori, she was just shafted the entire show. Whether it was being cockblocked by Noriko or her Kiznaiver friends, she had the most rotten treatment of the entire cast, which was really painful for me, because she was my favorite character for the majority of the show. Not to mention that the show kind of forced her into submission as the number 2 girl and settle for the 'other guy' for no reason other than the writers had a hard-on for Noriko. Yes, I am salty, but what's new?\\n\\n\r\nThat kind of leads me into my two big issues with Kiznaiver. The first being that the ending sucked and the second being that fact that they basically sideline the Kiznaivers for Noriko in the last third of the show. These two complaints kind of go hand-in-hand, so I'll discuss them together, along with complaints about specific characters. First, is the Noriko problem. Why is she important? Because. Because why? Because she shares a past with MC-kun! I'm being a little dramatic with this complaint, but that's kind of the theme of Kiznaiver, so I'll go along with it. My big issue with Noriko is that she becomes the main character at the conclusion and that causes all seven of the Kiznaivers to be shoved to the side. The very same characters that you spent 9 episodes getting attached to, thrown away for a character that really wasn't given any real importance other than being the Kiznaiver initiation mom. I get it. It was foreshadowed from the beginning scene that she was important, but at least make her part of the story for the middle half of the show. Obviously, I'm being really salty about this, but it just baffles me that the show took such a hard turn and became all about her in the end. And yes, this also has to do with the fact that my Chidori ship didn't sail.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I don't even really need to go into too much detail with the ending because of what I've laid out already. Basically, Noriko, the emotionless doll girl, has an extremely emotional response over a threat on the Kizuna system, which is her everything and tries prove that it works by converting everyone into Kiznaivers. And this is after 10 or so episodes showing the seven main characters learning empathy, how to talk about their emotions and secrets, and developing trust in each other through the Kizuna system. Tell me where an ending like I described above fits into that kind of small scale story? I could probably just leave it there and I feel like my point would be made. The fact is that a large scale ending was so forced. Kiznaiver up to that point was all about the character's relationships with each other, which was really good, but for some reason, Trigger decided that we needed some conflict for the ending. Why don't we instead go for a smaller scale resolution with, I don't know, our main cast instead of only MC-kun and his emotionless childhood friend that he loves for some reason?\\n\\n\r\nI have way more to complain about, but I'll keep it smaller for these, which deal with the other characters in the main seven Kiznaivers. The biggest annoyance for me was Hajime the dumb, strong guy. At first, I kinda liked him, but then somewhere down the line, he just became a white knight justice warrior kind of a character and began acting in the most irritating way. I just didn't understand where he got off berating MC-kun, who was a moron to be fair, when he himself was doing the exact same thing to poor Nico. Who was, by the way, also a great character. I have no real complaints about her, except how she had was that she was almost completely used a tool to unite the Kiznaivers and give friendship speeches. It just would have been nice to see some individuality from her. On the topic of low development, pretty boy Tsuguhito got the background development, he grew up as he supported Glasses-san through her tragic past. Thinking back on it, Tsugihito's growth may actually have been as good as Masochist's low key development, but it was just so understated that he was so easy to look over. Glasses-san, Honoka got pretty good screen time, enough to have her own arc. Her arc dragged on a little long in my opinion, but it was nice to see real development occur among the Kiznaivers. Lastly, we have MC-kun, Katsuhira, who's name I just had to look up because I forget it all the time. His development was actually really satisfying to watch unfold. Each episode, he was slightly more expressive and caring towards his friends, except for Chidori cause screw her, right? I'm kidding, of course, his treatment of Chidori wasn't really his fault. He tried his best, but Noriko always ended up messing everything up between them, which was annoying to watch, but such is anime, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nAs I glance up at my lines of ranting above, I have to wonder if that means that Trigger actually won. Clearly, I ended up caring enough about their characters to write so much on how I wished they had gotten more screen time and development. I do want to restate that I enjoyed watching Kiznaiver, especially early on. It was just so full of melodrama and love triangle shenanigans that it almost ruined it for me. I'd also like to apologize for ranting so much, but I only did it because I truly think that Kiznaiver could have been amazing if it had just stayed more grounded and not tried to shoot for the moon. Even though Trigger didn't work on it too much, I got Darling in the FranXX flashbacks as I was watching. All that potential early on, wasted with a overly ambitious ending. Hopefully Trigger learns from these shows and SSSS.Gridman and Promare finally break the Trigger mold and succeed!",

The author had the idea of making a story about people feeling the pain of others, and then literally couldn't put more than two thoughts together to form a cohesive story line or interesting cast of characters. Hell even 1 interesting character. The art was of standard quality. The sound was nothing memorable standard quality. I enjoyed almost no episodes of this show, other than maybe the first one, before I realizedthat there was nothing beyond a simple premise.",

            "content": "Sometimes I wish i had no emotions or feelings i wish this pain just to go away and just vanish in to thin air. The feeling that you don't care anymore, it feels kinda good at the same time scary. Those feelings that weigh you down but there's no body there to help you carry them, sometimes you think you're all alone and nobody cares. But in the end all of it was just a dream and in the morning you wake up and must face reality. Pain is a part of you, you cannot run away from it and must face it and endureit. Live your life to the fullest. Because pain makes you who you are.\\n\\n\r\nSo! As for the story of this anime it is quite good actually, i was amazed how the plot envolves and showcases everyone, well ofcourse due to the fact that they have lots of main chars in to this anime obviously, even side characters they also have back stories; The story is about Katsuhira who doesn't feel any pain at all, like nada even if you punch him bleed him he would never even flinch no emotions at all whatsoever, that makes him a good target and a good punching bag for bullies and he doesn't care if anything happens to him and then came in the main HERO of this anime! Haha just kidding! He was saved by his classmate Hajime and soon after made a contract with him and later they became friends. Well the story is not just the 2 of them ofcourse it's a very long story with so many characters involve in one plot and leads to different doors and its up to you to find out more because i don't want to spoil you! XD\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: oooooohhh.... Man this art is, this art is wow just WOW! I really dig this kind of art, the character designs are very mature and it looks lovely it really suit my taste. The girls, I like them big (i'm not a loli person just for your information ;) ). The colors oh man beautiful! 10/10 for me. I want more of it!!!!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: its Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad! Its bad that the vocalist of Boom Boom Satelites is gone T_T rest in peace brother! Your song is f/n Amazing and beautiful! The only Op song that i listen every episode and saved in to my playlist as top ten to play first. It is so mezmerising! It kinda reminds me of the 80's \"take on me\" they actually have a little bit of similarities but \"lay your hand on me\" is much better. XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: well there's nothing much to say about them actually, it's much better if you find out for yourself because i can assure you that each one of them they are very very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment itself, well yes i did enjoy watching it not only that, I also relate to it at some point and actually i was hoping for more of it but sadly it only has 12 episodes. But the satisfaction i've felt is really good! So kodus! And a lot of thanks to the people behind this, bringing this wonderful piece of work to us. \\n\\n\r\nMay Anime Jesus Guide you in the right path and make more of these! \ud83d\ude09\\n",

While Kiznaiver has dazzling visuals (Though we should expect nothing less from Trigger at this point), an amazing OP and soundtrack, weak characters and a predictable twist, as well as a sudden shift away from drama towards shipping in the last few episodes make this show very unenjoyable. While the fantastic quality of the art and music might've dragged me through the unenjoyable ending to this series, i don't imagine that will be the case for everyone.",

Let me tell you why... it's super relatable! i think it really portrays humans relationships in a very very realistic way.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nWhile the concept of the plot may seem simple and not outstanding at all they manage to pull it out in a great way, and as i said it's super relatable, i found myself saying \"damn, that's true\" a lot of times. As the story goes it becomes like a love triangleso considere that if you're not into romance. I wasn't very happy with the end because i wanted more! A lot of time passed since an anime left me with that giant hole and kiznaiver did it. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nMy favourite part about this anime is absolutely the art! daaaaaaaamn, the art is so refreshing and colorful, i loved the art style and the animation, everything suited the anime so well, i fell in love with the colour palette they used for the characters and tbh i've never seen an anime with that art style and colors so maybe that's why i found it super refreshing, while it may not be the best animation ever i really really liked it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nAs i said i loved the characters design. The characters, as the same as the show are very relatable, they all act human and i think that if it was me the person in that situation i'd act the same way as them. The characters are funny and seemed so fluffy! i felt like hugging everyone all the time lol. The development is fine, not the best i've ever seen but is not bad at all. They may be clich\u00e9 but you really come to like them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nIf it wasn't for the love triangle (i hate love triangles) this would be a 10. I'm a cry baby so almost very anime manage to make me cry BUT the thing that only a few anime can do is making me laugh and enjoy it. Usually when i watch an anime i'm really enjoying i watch like 10 episodes per day (normally i watch like 3 or 4 per day) and i watched Kiznaiver in one day, wich is really weird for me. \\n\r\nFinal thoughts: Should you watch it? If you like romance and more realistic anime yeah, if you don't like love triangles or \"clich\u00e9 characters\" don't watch it.",

I found this anime pretty enjoyable, or should I say unique. throughout the series I hungrily tasted every single episode, feeling refreshed every minute. you might say: the story is rushed, characters are cliche or even the idea is trash, but for some unknown reason I just find this particular anime so nice and interesting to watch. so if you are someone like me who has watched so many anime with the same art styles, characters andstory why not give Kiznaiver a try, it might make a 'connection' with you in some way.\\n\\n\r\nstory - 6/10: really I have to say the story was happening a bit too quick. from the start of the problem to all character's acceptance only used 3 episode. it looks like they are so quick to accept the fact that they have just been kidnapped and been experimented on that they are nearly inhumane. also, the story itself has a lot of plotholes, from a simple problem like suddenly fell in love with some you met for 2 days to the contradiction between the explanation and the actual thing in their 'experiment' ( no spoilers ). BUT, it was enjoyable anyhow. ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10: expecting nothing less from Trigger. another really unique art style that is just as colourful as NGNL but with a better skill at drawing quality and details like P.A. works. I have nothing really to say apart from the fact that it is simply so wonderful to watch and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nsound - 9/10: I'm not really an OST guy, I basically rate based on how each song has an impact on a particular scene. but the main soundtrack in the anime usually when Gomorin comes out in really nice. \\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 7: all characters are pretty enjoyable most of the time, maybe more at the start. \\n\r\n    - so we got the emotionless main character who let himself get beaten up which is pretty unique I should say.\\n\\n\r\n    - sonozaki, probably the main female protagonist who is also emotionless\\n\\n\r\n    - chidori, main character's childhood friend who likes him just like how every single other childhood friend who likes the main character.\\n\\n\r\n    - always cheerful nico\\n\\n\r\n    - tanga the thug\\n\\n\r\n    - honoka the high and mighty\\n\\n\r\n    - yuta the hot guy\\n\\n\r\n    - lastly, the wiedo hisomu who is a masochist\\n\r\nthey are..... interesting i guess. ;)\\n\\n\r\noverall I gave this anime 8/10 hoping people would appreciate these kinds of unique work more than they are now. if you are still not sure, give these anime a tour, cuz they are quite similar in some way: anohana and megakucity\\n",

            "content": "Well this anime caught my eyes from the first time I saw the visuals. The anime is quirky in style and approach. Eye-catching neons and pop colours everywhere. Has a twangy new angle of throwing an old ideology. The story-line is fairly good. In fact Trigger has done quite a good job drawing out yet another interesting story. They have a very fresh visual. I found their approach to their punchline of \u201cfeeling others\u2019 pain\u201d rather new and offbeat. It has a fun uptake on the matter. The characters all have their own personal spikes \u2014 some too aggressive , some goody-two \u2013 shoes\u2026 theirportrayal of comedy and seriousness is also offbeat however I was expecting a bit more of a dramatic ending. The series concluded on a low-key note though. It\u2019s a total different feel from their previous  work, Kill La Kill.\\n\\n\r\nThey story has style and  a fresh urban vibe. The characters are funny and have their own signature persona, each try to cope with the situation using their own views as well as mixing some views derived from their friends. Kiznaiver is like old wine in a new bottle \u2013 which is rather good\u2026 the ideology of feeling for others and understanding pain of others has been potrayed in a very technical way\u2026 instead of emphasizing on melodrama, heavy emotions to control the storyline \u2026 the anime established the essence of friendship in a very technically sound and urbanized way.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact the protagonist, Katsuhira Agata, around whom the message of friendship and compassion spirals, is ironically a guy who cannot feel pain (physically or mentally) or for that matter cannot fully comprehend any human emotions properly. His perception of pain is almost nil for which he is easily targeted by bullies. It is rather interesting how such a boy with emotional apathy slowly adapts to and explains the emotional wavelengths of his friends. Katsuhira\u2019s gradual evolution is interesting as he struggles to understand the emotions by logically mapping them or quantifying those unperceived emotions by deriving a new approach to the old ideology of connecting with people. The story skilfully guides the audience to this new approach through Katsuhira\u2019s struggle. Noriko Sonozaki, the other lead of this story is also ironically another character devoid of emotional perceptions. It is rather funny how these two emotionally and perceptionally apathetic characters bring out the essence of unity, love, compassion, friendship and pain in full bloom as their friends struggleand help each other out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is worth a watch. It\u2019s essentially the remix of an old song . Although the story is slightly predictable (well\u2026 its not a mystrery  genre), I think you wont be too disappointed. I personally liked it. The comedy is an extra perk. The story has a neon and a lightweight appearance that will catch your eyes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Rate: 7.5/10",

            "content": "If you had to drink for every time \"Nori-chan\" was said in the later episodes, you would be an alcoholic. \r\nExcluding Honoka's bit, almost all the drama in the series were connected to someone liking someone who liked someone else...or something. I get that Chidori liked Katsuhira because of who he was as a kid, sure, but I feel like the rest, especially Nico's, affections were random. You could say Tenga's developed from all his supporting and when he received from food from Chidori? Man, I don't know. If they were gonna use that as the main conflict, I wished they built it up alittle more. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of building up--They made me feel like there would be some epic climax with Nori going a little crazy toward the end, but nope. Everything gets solved with a talk with a crazy backdrop and everyone (kinda) gets a happy ending. Talk about anticlimactic. Why does Nori even have so much power anyway? How come nothing happened between the initial experiment and now? Why do the adults do nothing in the show do nothing but act as comedic relief? Why would they put two new/young researchers on a project that's supposed to be the solution to world peace? I'm not even sure what the Kizuna system was for anymore because it seemed like what they were trying to achieve didn't match what they were doing.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, I loved the art. That's what drew me to the show in the first place. Everything is so bright and I liked the designs of the characters. For some reason, I like the out of place creatures that some anime tend to have so those weird bird things were cool. The OP and ED were enjoyable. Music has never been a big deal for me so I don't have much to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Meh. They were given the archetypes of the Seven Deadly Sins by Nori, but even she said that they didn't adhere to them that well. I've always hated characters that were defined by their attraction to someone else. Chidori and Katsuhira are prime examples of this. Chidori's basically Katsuhira's mom and all Katsuhira can think about is Nori. Sure, they're connected by the past and he wants to figure it out but Nori-chan this and Nori-chan that all the time kills me. Hisomu felt like such a waste too. They had one episode dealing with the fact that he loves pain and then for the rest of the series, his pain fetish is just for comedic effect. He doesn't actively try to get hurt anymore even though he was known for frequent visits to the hospital. It seemed like such a cop out. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my complaints, I rather liked the anime. The story itself could've been fleshed out better and some of the characters could've been less one-dimensional, though I guess that's the point. If you wanted to watch the anime because of the mystery of it, I think you'll be disappointed. I don't think the mystery was a big part of the story and the conclusion to it wasn't satisfactory, but the build up to it was interesting and that's good enough to me.\\n\\n\r\nSide note: I read somewhere that this was an insight or something to mental illness. Nori, with her overexposure to pain/emotions and how she takes meds to deal with it; Katsuhira, with his indifference to everything; and the rest of the cast who are \"normal\". Something about Chidori having unrequited feelings for Katsuhira is supposed to parallel how non-disabled people want to understand those who are but are unable to. Not sure how true it is, but it's an interesting thought, even though it didn't change my opinion on the show.",

Going into it, I wasn't really expecting much and I actually- from the cover art- thought that the main character, Katsuhira, was a girl. Whoopsie. \r\nThis anime defiantly broke my expectations and I pretty much watched this with minimal breaks between episodes. \r\nI really enjoyed the concept and overall plot of the story and it definitely made me cry. (That's how I determine whether it was a good anime (jokes...))\r\nThough I loved thisanime, one of the downfalls for this series was the romance between the cast. I don't think any of the romance was necessary apart from the relationship between Katsuhira and Chidori. Everyone else just got in the way and the fact that Katsuhira ended up with Sonozaki- the first girl he ever liked- was really unrealistic. \\n",

            "content": "Many years ago, when the young me was still trying to figure out what exactly anime was, I stumbled upon a title many of you may be familiar with, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. The way the characters essentially jumped out of the screen and beckoned for attention left such an impression on me that I actually cited it as my favorite show of all time for a little while. What I didn't know at the time, however, was that the mastermind behind the series, Hiroyuki Imaishi, would go on to form Studio Trigger several years later and, as many fans of the studio say, \"saveanime.\" And while I don't necessarily believe that anime needs \"saving\", I believe it's pretty easy to say that Trigger has definitely established a name for themselves. After completing Kiznaiver, I can understand why.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver follows the lives of a group of teenagers that are thrust into an experiment in which all of them become connected by an implant known as the \"Kizuna\" system (Kizuna meaning \"bond\" in Japanese). Following the implant, our protagonists are told that any pain any of them receive from this point on will be evenly distributed amongst the entire group. Obviously, the teens take turns freaking out but ultimately accept their fate. I mean, how long can this possibly last? It's just an experiment, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, as things progress, the Kizuna project begins to look a little too in-depth to be considered \"Just an experiment\". The pain that everyone shares, which is purely physical at first, snowballs into a system that connects not only their nerves but their hearts and minds as well. Not only can the group feel each other's physical pain now, they can feel each other's, well...feelings. This creates an atmosphere in which each individual is afraid of even thinking, let alone doing anything harmful. As interesting as that sounds, the real beauty of Kiznaiver lies in the after-effects this implant system has on the group.\\n\\n\r\nEach member selected for the experiment is vastly different from the next -- each being specific embodiments of anime tropes or stereotypes (Interesting fact: Each member actually represents one of the Seven Deadly Sins). Having these completely different people thrown into a singular group and forced to cooperate with each other is obviously going to have its ups and downs. Despite that, many of the characters find ways to look past their differences and form their own unique bond, separate from their forced one. This bond, however, winds up unintentionally amplifying anything that the Kizuna system forces on them, resulting in a giant mess of emotions easily visible to themselves and us viewers.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS PARAGRAPH IS SPOILER HEAVY. As the series progresses, we begin to uncover more secrets of the Kiznaiver experiment. Sonozaki Noriko, the girl who acts as the figurehead for our protagonists' Kizuna group, is actually an experiment herself. In fact, she and Katsuhira have their own unique Kizuna that leaves long-lasting impressions on both of them. Basically, Sonozaki was selected to carry the burden of everyone else in the original Kiznaiver group, which was comprised of children given up by members of the lab. What this essentially means is that Sonozaki was feeling the pain of around twelve children at once, while none of them felt anything. And, as if that wasn't enough, the system amplified itself within her and could only be subdued by large doses of drugs that had to be administered to her nearly 24/7. The end result was Sonozaki becoming almost as much of a zombie as the other kids, who were left with no original emotions of their own.\\n\\n\r\nKatsuhira, also being an original child, has not felt anything in years. But, as his Kizuna system with his new \"friends\" begins to dissolve, those feelings come rushing back. Little by little, he remembers what it's like to be alive; he remembers all of his old friends. In fact, he even visits them in one of the last few episodes and goes on to create possibly the most emotional moment of the show when he realizes that they've become more like dolls than actual humans.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing several group-disbanding fights, our characters must fight battles with themselves in order to determine what exactly they want to do from this point on. However, these battles aren't easily fought as each of them still have residual pain from the experiment left over. Eventually, they all meet up again and, after a few more fights, it is revealed that this pain is actually not from the experiment at all -- it's the pain of actually being connected to one another. The experiment was a success in that manner, considering that each body remained linked in a unique and personal way.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver teaches us a lot about friendship, bonding, and free will. It demonstrates that forced friendships are nothing more than artificial, worthless creations while, at the same time, showing us that sometimes you can find beauty in unexpected places. Even though our characters were unlikely candidates for friends, they wind up becoming just that. It shows us a lot about how being judgemental can tear something apart before it even begins and, honestly, it's really beautiful. The characters were so well fleshed out that their relationships seem to parallel real-world friendships and romances. It becomes nearly impossible to root against any of them.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver teaches us that even in our darkest moments, there is still light. It's just that sometimes you might need a little help finding it.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nTrigger demonstrates that they're more than just good looks and comedy in this well-written and incredibly beautiful original series. Kiznaiver utilizes a realistic, intimate cast in order to lure the viewer into a fall sense of security that may just wind up tearing them apart from the inside out. With themes and lessons that parallel real-world friendships and what it's like to be miserable, it's quite hard to not take something away from this series. Don't watch this with a friend, as you will be compelled to awkwardly hug one another after it's over. Kiznaiver is a fantastic anime that shows us the true meaning of friendship while still having time to remind us of what it means to be alive.",

But don\u2019t raise your pitch forks if you think I\u2019ve spilled too many beans.\r\nFor any anime studio that makes a show that is all style, no substance, it is probable for anyone to denote the studio\u2019s value (there is Ghost in the Shell, but that\u2019s retro so it doesn\u2019t count). Unless if its Trigger. If there is one thing that we could all agree with, are the unique character designs: essentially Disgea heads with their chibi proportions toned down and are plonkedon Shoujo-style bodies. Sounds odd, but it works in a refreshing visual sense that you won\u2019t see from the onslaught of moeshit and the awkwardly large eye sizes from the mid 2000\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nIt is scientifically proven by the enlightenment association that the OP is also elder god tier. \u2018nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole gimmick behind the Kizna project is sharing all our physical and mental pain to the others around us. Ignore how the entire economy and civilizations looks awkward if someone gives birth, or someone crying over a funeral and everyone is forced to feel sad, or someone being mangled over a red room, or for every person who eats a ghost chili therefore causing societal collapse \u2013 I\u2019ll give the benefit of the doubt this time. You could say the show is inherently flawed by its conception, however, the means this kizna project is presented, is what matters here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by well-presented characters, I only mean one-noted archetypes. I may slide by the emotionless protagonist \u2013 there were some understandable moments; the tsundere red head \u2013 who doesn\u2019t have nearly as many TSUN moments, so praise fuckin\u2019 Michael!  And I can\u2019t even care about Sonozaki \u2013 similar to the protagonist but keeps all her emotions to herself; not like it matters since we only get to know her that way for only a total of 15 minutes tops. Nico is cute for the sake of being cute and is naiive as all hell. At the end of the show, did it really seem like the characters were fleshed out? But Tenga is a speck you don\u2019t see often. It is quite a disappointment because there was no backdrop that made the characters who they are. Apart from Maki who makes actual sense.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of good characters, Maki and Tsuguhito just work, due to the simple fact that their relationship is a logical one. Unlike most anime romances which makes a kiss the ultimatum; the end goal of all relationships.\\n\\n\r\nRelationships makes just as much sense as shipping discussions from fan fiction writers, or people who just wanna draw fappable doujins. I still don\u2019t know how Nico started getting feels with red head dude; there is some sense with his feels on the tusndere archetype. Sonozaki X Kitsuahara is still emotionless, even when they received their emotions ironically.\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Kiznaiver got the message out there: that uniting an entire social hivemind into an individual mass, as a means in achieving philanthropic ego for a cosmopolitan society: within each mind reads every other mind \u2013 alike that of a book \u2013 is a bad idea!\\n\\n\r\nEven if the story is just about some teenagers doing summer camps and having their lives risked for the sake of science without anyone\u2019s consent \u2013 shouldn\u2019t the police be there already? At least there were some legitimately funny moments sprinkled here and there. After all the episodic shit that is there to supposedly create character development (which barely happens), the huge plot twist was just anti-climactic as hell because I just can\u2019t stop giving a crap with these one dimensional and under developed people!\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 4/10 \u2013 Looks better than most spacky beans (with uniquely good taste). And fails at everything else, or lackluster in general.\\n",

I feel like it was shooting for a story much bigger than itself and ended up looking like a plot made by children...whose lives revolved around making friends and sense of the concept of true friends. \r\nI am wholly convinced you could shortened this series down to only 4 episodes and it would have come out better. It just seemed to drag on and a few episodes felt like deja vu. Many episodes just hammered in the same idea, that yes they were becoming friends. Likewise every episode askedthe exact same question, Is it because of Kiznaiver or not? I feel like they could have removed the \"friends\" narrative and replaced it with a stronger love one. This would probably would have made for a solid romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless I still continued to watch, but i think that was due to its great animation and some feel good moments. It was somewhat enjoyable however muddled its narrative was. Even though it was inevitable that they would all be happy in the end, i still watched on. I can understand for some that they could completely dislike it outright, furthermore i would also understand someone who would fall in love with this anime. But i think my view stands within the consensus. Most definitely this was just a filler anime for me. What was a real insult to injury for me though was the fact that Sonozaki and Katsuhira could have had a much better resolution. The only tangible plot was between those two characters and there resolution only lasted 5 minutes of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR: Kiznaiver is an extraordinarily average anime whose concepts exceeds its reality. Understandably to some it appeals to them, to some it doesn't. However to everyone else its damn well clear how average it is.\\n\\n\r\n~6/10",

They showed they are talented enough to build an emotional story with a psychological value and without excess of clich\u00e9, even if there is a little of that. A promising premise based upon a collective sharing of pain between 6 characters, because of a mysterious experiment which linked them. Well on, the 6 ones were not chosen at random, and their differences is a prerequisite for the sake of the experience. The show turns around an understanding of other one to move forward. Over time, their ordeal becomes more complex.

            "content": "So for my first review EVER I decided to talk about Kiznaiver! It's a bit of a particular show, as it made me go from \"wow this show is so awesome!\" to \"oh god this is cringy and horribly written\" really quickly. This is why I decided to give it an average score.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThere is not really any real plot to Kiznaiver, and that's why it is the weakest part of the show. There is one mini arc in the middle of the series that felt kind of satisfying, and the long overarching story which, quite frankly, makes no sense. Tons of things are leftunexplained, and the ending, which could have tied up many loose ends, ended up rushed and nonsensical. When I finished this show, I couldn't really tell what it was about apart from badly written teenage drama. \\n\\n\r\nThe story played around with many edgy and deep themes but failed to deliver it remarkably. Everything felt forced, from the awful dialogues which repeated the same things over and over again about \"pain\", \"feelings\", \"friends\" to the deus ex machina and the totally unrealistic science kiznaiver bullcrap (I know it's Trigger, but still). What started as a light hearted and kind of fun comedy evolved into an awful melodrama that got worse after each episode. I couldn't feel anything for the characters, because their problems just seemed so unimportant. \"Oh my god he/she doesn't love me let's make a scene\" <--- This happened maybe 5 times in the course of the last 3 episodes. I actually wondered if some of the scenes at the end were not written by 13/14 years olds edgy teenagers with too many hormones, because this felt like it.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, ok start and middle, and a terrible ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI freaking love studio Trigger and its art. Can't find anything bad to say about the gorgeous palette of colours and the wonderful, natural flowing animations. The character designs were fun and remarkable. The visuals for the opening blew my mind the first time I watched it, and it was definitely the best visuals for an opening this season.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI also loved the soundtrack. Wasn't really memorable (maybe because I only watched one episode a week), but amazing. The opening and ending were both incredible (the opening reminds me of the song Take On Me by a-ha, which I love.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThis one is tricky to rate. At first, I was interested in all the characters. They were clich\u00e9, but well done. I was very curious about Hisomu, which was quite the enigmatic one and I loved Tenga and Chidori.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, as the plot worsened, so did the characters. Tenga and Chidori became the two most annoying characters in this show, to the point where I couldn't even comprehend their tought process. Kacchon and Sonozaki, which were both mysterious, were developed the most, but with the way the dialogues were made I had trouble understanding what they felt. Hisomu, sadly, stayed as a comic relief character with a couple good scenes, and never got much depth to him. Nico, which I found a tad annoying at first, became the best character in the show for me. All in all, the characters had their good and bad moments. Most of the time, their reactions were not very realistic and felt forced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI really wanted to enjoy this show. The great soundtrack and pretty visuals helped me forget a bit about the convoluted plot and dialogues, but not enough. Some episodes were a drag, while others were really fun. The finale was \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nThis is not an horrible show per se, as it has a lot of redeeming features. If you are able to turn our brain off for a bit, or are into melodrama (I hate using that word that people use to diss actual good animes, but this is really what Kiznaiver is), then this show is for you.\\n\\n",

If you've made it this far into my review I would like to take the time and wish you a good day and a good night. However even now I am still lacking characters which cannot be said for the show, they were pretty decent, not the best but I mean given Trigger's and Gainax's history they were pretty solid. Same goes forthe story line, it was pretty typical Trigger with some weird story, but unlike with other shit anime like Kill la Kill, it was actually quite good.",

I can honestly say without a doubt despite being totally different (yet somewhat the same.) form the standard Trigger works they did a phenomenal job. character development was better than the average seasonal, in fact the whole show was based arond the character's development. (literally that's the whole plot.) despite looking pretty out there (standard trigger fashion.) the characters were very grounded, in dealing with each problem that arose. the music tied in very well, in fact the sound ingeneral did exactly what it was supposed to do doost the emotion in certain scenes and help carry the story forward. overall Kiznaiver was a great watch and at some point will be a great re-watch, i would recommend it to any one who has time to watch it, especially to fans of trigger works. Like i said, not only a great show but the debut from the new team. Looking forward to more works by them.",

            "content": "If you're wondering what \"Kiznaiver\" is about, it's like \"Kokoro Connect\" with some sci-fi stuff and more characters. And that's pretty much it.\r\nI'll start with, sadly, the biggest flaw of \"Kiznaiver\" - its plot. I suppose the storywriters simply hadn't known what they had wanted to focus on so the story is a weird mix of many different elements. The plot starts with a sci-fi-esque, dystopic approach but later on switches to full drama slice of life mode. The main themes are \"bonds\", \"sharing pain\" and \"connecting by wounds\" and these are shown repeatedly during the show. They are, however, shown in a very tangledand muddling way making the plot dull. To add insult to injury, it feels like there's more focus on the love triangles, rectangles, or whichever combination than on the actual story, yet each of them is painfully straightforward and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nJust because I liked the characters doesn't mean they were written well. In fact, they either lack personality or originality. There's the generic tsundere emo queen, muscle-headed stud or a girl, whose only feature is that she has a crush on the main character. Few of them have some kind of backstory, although it usually doesn't give much insight into their personalities. Even though the show focuses attention on Katsuhira, the viewers don't know much about him and they even don't want to know because of how cursorily he is portrayed. My guess is that they aren't necessarily badly written but there's simply not enough time to develop properly that many characters in only 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, both art and music are quite impressive. The show has its own distinctive look and the characters' drawing style is quite funky and it has its own unique manner. Throughout the show there are also some lovely backgrounds. Thus, I'd say that the art is the best part of \"Kiznaiver\". What's more, the opening theme is really catchy and really fits the atmosphere of the show. Besides the opening song, the music was quite alright I guess, although I have to admit I didn't pay so much attention to it.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, I had greater expectations of \"Kiznaiver\", hence I'm a bit disappointed. Yet I wouldn't call it a bad show. It certainly doesn't have the deepest plot ever, but at least it looks great. As far as I'm concerned, \"Kiznaiver\" is a six out of ten and is a show I don't regret watching. I probably won't watch it again though.\\n",

            "content": "Kiznaiver\r\nArt\r\nWhen I first started to watch this show, I was a little concerned with how the art presented itself. It seemed like it was one of those old cartoon styles everything that moved had a different color palate than did the background. But I found after watching it more and more and becoming significantly more invested in the show as a whole this didn\u2019t really bother me. I really liked the way how nothing was to extreme and over the top in terms of colors (except of course Nico). it all seemed to come together really well and when things started to really heat upi could feel the emotion that was present in each of the characters. The art style is anything but generic and actually unique in ways that make this show really pleasant to look at. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music\\n\r\nThe first thing one might notice about this opening song specifically is the similarity in the tune to a song called \u201cTake On Me\u201d from the \u201880s. And while that song is pretty cool, this song is way better in my personal opinion. This track is catchy and it is honestly one of my favorite parts of each episode. The other major thing I loved about the sound direction was the sound of pain that the characters felt throughout the entire show. When they were stunned with pain there was a shocker sound and it made me cringe just as much as the characters did. That kind of attention to detail brought me face-first into a show that I knew nothing about going into.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story in Kiznaiver is one of connection. These 7 people have seemingly nothing in common and one of them can\u2019t feel any pain at all. But through a weird twist they all discover that they share a similar wound on their wrist, and whenever one of them feels pain, the others all share that pain equally. It comes out that they are part of a project that aims to study the way emotions are shared from person to person. At first it mostly deals with pain, but the deeper goal is to find how positive emotions such as love can be spread from person to person. It all wraps up with the nice little bow of a romantic subplot between a few of the characters that drive the story forward, even if I ship characters different than what the story says.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection\\n\r\n I started watching this show out of sheer curiosity because of the summary provided on Crunchyroll. I wasn\u2019t looking to really get into it, but I found that after I really learned about the characters, it became such a pleasing experience to watch. I would look forward each week to the next installment of the series in eager anticipation to see where the story was going to go. I have always wondered about how I would be able to share my pain and my emotions with others because handling it all on your own is not a good thing to do. This show supports the notion that friendship, even with people that you have nothing in common with, is important. There will always be people that are going through similar things as you, and even if those things get drastically different, we all bleed the same color; red. I highly recommend Kiznaiver.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating : 8.5/10\\n",

Just the thought of it really makes me sick, it just i don't felt any chemistry between them. most of the animes are like this we can almost predict who's going to be hook up with who and all, that kind of this makes the anime feels boring to watch sometimes we may feel irritated and annoying too.but that doesn't happened here, entry of the character named sonazaki changed all of it,and it makes me really really want to know what's going to happen next how's everything going to end. this all kinds of this makes this anime one hell of a show.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this anime,it is the best anime i ever seen aside from the action,adventure anime's likes 'ONE PIECE' ,  FAIRY TAIL and pokemon xy&z. and i really hope amazing anime's like this Will come in the near future.",

Well, let us find out \r\nPros\r\n- Character Interaction (My god, they felt like real people.)\r\n- Character Problems/Relationships (Forgot it was an anime for a second)\r\n- Art and Animation (STUDIO TRIGGER GAVE ME EYEGASMS!! AND THAT OPENING!!!(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f) \r\n- OST \r\n- Initial Premise\r\nCons\r\n- Convoluted plot\r\n- Melodramatic at times (Felt like a cheesy soap opera \u2686 _ \u2686)\r\n- Characters (Some of you will begin hate at least one of these characters)\r\n- Lackluster Ending\r\nLets get this out the way....NICO BEST GIRL!! AND SONAZAKI X KATSUHIRA BESTOTP!! FIGHT ME CHIDOR X KATSUHIRA LOVERS! (\u0e07 \u0360\u00b0 \u035f\u0644\u035c \u0361\u00b0)\u0e07\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the tail end of the show had me face palming, I enjoyed the character rich ride that was Kiznaiver. As far as I can remember, I've never seen character interaction done so like well. It felt like I was watching real people who had real problems with their lives, relationships, etc... \\n\\n\r\nEveryone should check the show out especially now because you can just marathon it.\\n\\n\r\nGive it the 3 episode rule",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is the newest addition to studio Trigger's list of anime originals.\r\nIt was directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi, who has worked with trigger before but has mostly been doing the actual animation instead of directing it.\r\nTrigger's usual director Hiroyki Imaishi was busy with space patrol luluco while Kiznaiver was airing.\r\nBut that's enough about the production, what is it actually about?\r\nAnd it's really a commentary on people's personal connections.\r\nWhat would happen if people would be able to directly experience others pain, and so on.\r\nBefore I go into spoiler territory I'll talk about the Presentation of the show for a bit.\r\nAs I mentioed above Imaishi wasn't directing this,and as such the animation is considerably less crazy than Trigger's usual style.\\n\r\nThe character designs seem to compensate for the lack of craziness however, as they are all pretty out there and don't follow any usual formulas.\\n\r\nKiznaiver is pretty fun to look at, the its character designs work great in motion and the clear CGI backgrounds work fairly well as a contrast.\\n\r\nThe music for the series was made by Booming Satellites who have worked with trigger before.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes fit the show just fine and the backgroundtracks are fairly muted and consist mostly of electronic music.\\n\r\nTrigger did go out of their way to make this series very colorful and that still gives it a fairly unique look.\\n\\n\r\nNow with that out of the way let's talk characters and story.\\n\r\nI was wondering how Mari Okada's writing style would come to play in this series, because from the first three episodes \\n\r\nI wouldn't have been able to guess her involvement in the series.\\n\r\nBut later on as there are almost two love triangles present at once as well as lots of drama in general it starts to get clear.\\n\r\nDrama is a big part of kiznaiver and as such I think it's worth it to check if it's well done, and saying anything about Kiznaiver's drama is a bit difficult.\\n\r\nOn one hand the extreme amount of drama in Kiznaiver is easily justified in series by having the cast tied to each other through pain.\\n\r\nBut on the other the fact that none of them consciously chose to take part with the experiment lessens the emotional impact a lot.\\n\r\nEssentially it's in-series justified forced drama and your enjoyment of Kiznaiver will greatly depend on your opinion of this.\\n\r\nI thought that it was a fine way to include a large amount of drama in your anime with an added cool experiment, but it also made me feel more distant to the drama and thus it was pretty unrelatable.\\n\r\nAnd yes it does play out a lot like a high school drama.\\n\\n\r\nBut beyond just a device for drama there is an actual story to the Kiznaiver experiement itself, which I won't spoil here even though it isn't super important.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the characters involved they aren't super detailed.\\n\r\nThe only ones that get a proper backstory are the MC and Sonozaki, the person who conducts and supervises the experiment.\\n\r\nThough this might make it sound like the rest of the characters are bland, that isn't the case at all.\\n\r\nAll of the main cast are fairly eccentric teenagers and quite fun people to watch, even if they aren't that detailed.\\n\r\nThe relatability of the characters will pretty much depend on your personality.\\n\r\nAll of them have a part in the story except for maybe the masochist who seems to have been thrown in just to show how some people do indeed enjoy pain,\\n\r\nbut he didn't really have another purpose and doesn't really take part in the drama, which might make him relatable to some.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think Kiznaiver is in any way revolutionary or even super clever, but it was a fun watch none the less.\\n\r\nIf you like high school dramas or drama in general but feel like they're all the same Kiznaiver is pretty much just a slightly new take on it.\\n\r\nIt might take a while to get truly going but once it does I think most people would enjoy it.",

            "content": "Dramatic, entertaining, likeable and thought-provoking. Those are basically the words I\u2019d use to describe Kiznaiver.\r\nIt started off very strongly. Katsuhira\u2019s backstory was intriguing, Chidori was a really strong portrayal of a good \u2018childhood friend\u2019 trope, Tenga was the obligatory loudmouthed yet kindhearted character, Nico was the quirky but fun to watch one, and Maki was just overall brilliant as well as probably the best developed character in the series. Liked most of the characters initially. Hiromi annoyed me slightly but did add amusement to the anime \u2013 putting a character with his particular tastes into a group like theirs was pretty funny to watch. \r\nIcouldn\u2019t really get behind Sonozaki\u2019s character (especially in the last few episodes), and found Yuta bland and forgettable.  Their characters weren\u2019t badly done exactly \u2013 Sonozaki did actually add quite a lot to the interactions between the rest of the cast \u2013 but for some reason I just really didn\u2019t like her. I also felt that Chidori\u2019s character deteriorated somewhere around the middle of the series until she was basically one-dimensional, but this did get fixed near the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise was really original \u2013 totally unrealistic, but interesting all the same. The concept of feeling each other\u2019s\u2019 pain was clever and creatively executed. Good way to add drama without it feeling forced. Made me think quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nAwesome op, nice ed too. Liked the music overall, and the art and animation were fabulous. Seiyuus were great. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was really riveting until the final few episodes, which were kind of a let-down, to be honest. The last 3 eps felt poorly written and rushed; they did ruin the anime a bit for me. However the closing few minutes managed to redeem it - they were sweet and heart-warming and at least gave the anime a good send off in its final moments.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, I enjoyed it. A really good anime that manages to properly balance drama and comedy. A quick, quirky and entertaining watch.  \\n",

I thought it was weird how they made a town that revolved around a experiment,but the kiznaiver experiment really boosted my excitement, about the possibilities, of where the story was going. From episode 1 to 8 it seemed to be flowing. But then it came to a violent stop, when the melodrama kicked in. 4 episodes after that and it was already fin. \r\nThe opening was beautiful , pleasingto the eye. This drama, thriller, sci-fi, i would rate pretty high. \\n",

All the ugly and beautiful aspects of human beings. The theme on friendship and the systematic connection of physically and emotional feelings. Very nicely done anime. That ending was the icing on the cake. Character 10/10. Music 10/10. Art 10/10. Ship Complete! 10/10.\r\nThe only con I had was only the reasoning I had at the beginning of watching these episodes and questioning the system, logic, andimmoral aspect but if I just take it all with a grain of salt and just watch the anime.

He slightly fulfilled his role as an emotionless guy. but he was very good at the climax.\\n\r\nNoriko Sonozaki, the moment I saw her. I know for sure that she is the Teen Version of Esdeath in Akame ga Kill. but her mature personality lacks something I don't know the term for it. I love her 50% because she slightly blushed for the first time!\\n\r\nOverall I should give this 8.5/10 but there's no such thing so I would give them 9/10.",

I just couldn't stop watching it because whenever I finished an episode, I just wanted to watch the next one.\r\nI had it on my \"Plan To Watch\" list for a while but I decided to finish some Anime series first so then I couldwatch it, and I can tell you something... It was worth it, every episode.\\n\r\nI didn't feel bored at ANY second, literally.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing, the theme is very good too. For those who don't know, Kiznaiver is about human relationships and sharing pain with our friends, it is some sort of common thing in our lives but it was awesome to watch an Anime that is related to that.\\n\r\nThe story was very well written and the characters developed very well throughout the show, the only thing I did not like about this Anime is the opening.\\n\r\nMan, the op just doesn't match the Anime! Though the ending does fit much better comparing to the op.\\n\r\nI guess that is really about it. Overall it was worth to watch and I did not give it a 10 rating because the ending of the Anime wasn't quite I was expecting (although it was still very good).\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend you watching it?\\n\r\nSure. If you like romance and drama mixed together (expect a lot of drama related to relationships) you are going to love Kiznaiver.",

The story was very good, the art and animations was very refreshing, and the best thing that the series had was its characters. i started to realizes  that the main 8 characters have their own color that is themed to them and their personality. like Agata is themed around gray or white because he is \"emotionless\" and i could go on but i this review is not about talking about small easter eggs. \r\n    the story of Kizmaiver was great, but because of the idea of people being ableto feel each others pain through the kiza project, but how it uses it, to mess with each characters emotions and problems. There was a special bond that each character goes through, like what each character thinks about each other or their emontoinal past, like makes past and how she thinks that she (spoiler) killed her friend. \\n\r\n     I loved the characters and their personalities. many of the characters were very memorable, like Nico for how weird she is,or teenage for..uhh...how can i put this...HIPUUU SUUUMMERRRR...(you get a cookie if you get the joke) Anyways i love thatch character has their own problems and fears.\\n\r\n    I also like that they use their \"bond\" for comical sense witch made the show very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n   Over all KIznaiver is a GREAT anime for all kinds of people and a give it a perfect 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nthx for reading this review",

            "content": "So a lot of people say the characters are the best thing about this show. I pretty much completely disagree with that. The character's visual design is quite nice, however not much we haven't seen drawn before. Their personalities on the other hand? No. Just no. The personalities of every character are a plot device. And honestly? What more could they be in a mere 12 episodes? In order to get everything going and then wrapped up within the time frame the plot breaks into a run starting around episode 6, hitting it's stride at episode 7, my personal favorite of the 12.\r\nNow honestly there'snot much to say here. One really cool thing I noticed about the story was on its fixation of the number 7. 7 deadly sins is something cool that's talked about, the reason I found this funny though, was because the plot absolutely blows up in which episode? You guessed it 7. There are some other cool little meta jokes if you look. Par exemple if you look at the depictions of manga that the characters within the show read as part of a sub plot, this mangaception we see shows drawings of characters with absolutely HUGE eyes. Also there are multiple meta references to anime tropes with each of the 7 main characters basically being labeled as such very early on.\\n\r\nSo let's talk scores. Story? This one's probably the easiest for me as that's what I appreciate most of anything about all media is the story. For Kiznaiver I actually thought the story seemed incredibly played out AT FIRST, but then it takes an incredibly revealing turn, which, while I wont say it was completely unexpected, it was courageous, straightforward (important for being 12 episodes), and most importantly, WELL EXECUTED. So many animes I watch just can't end it. They can't do it. That's why I actually think the short format works to this story's benefit in this case, and I give it an 8, instead of the 7 I was leaning towards until the latter half of the story began.\\n\r\nArt? Striking. Colorful. And sometimes just plain and normal. There are frames where the artists just drew the character concepts and there's nothing happening. I don't know why but for some reason this was visible at times and it bothered me. Though I only elaborate on this to EXPLAIN why I felt I had to give the art a 9 instead of a 10 which could be argued that it deserves.\\n\r\nSound? Not revolutionary, but love the intro song. 8, professionally done.\\n\r\nCharacters? Honestly felt a bit one dimensional to me, however when the plot gets around for it being a certain characters turn to shine, they come alive, which slips this up to a 7 for me.\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? Honestly the first 6 episodes were not as good as the last 6. But it's OK because I'm here now right and I had the last bit to make me forget about all that right? No I didn't forget, but it does somewhat lessen the blow.\\n\r\nOverall, it's short, high production value, and done by someone you know you can trust (from Kill La Kill peeps). Give it a try.",

            "content": "(My review was deleted after the series finished airing, this is merely a copied version of it from when it was airing.)\r\nArt 10/10:\r\nThe art is beautiful. It is eye appealing and fits the world that the anime is set in. I find that the art style is both colourful and dull when it's needed and fits the mood perfectly for every scene. It I think it truly couldn't be done any better for this show. The art style almost of reminds me of a brighter and more colourful Durarara! \r\nSound 10/10: \r\nThe intro is catchy and nicely animated. The song fits the show and it'sa song that anyone can get attached to quickly. Personally, I think it might even be one of my favourite introductions, ever! And the ending does not disappoint either!\\n\\n\r\nI can say without a doubt that I'm not the only one who watches this show and dances a little bit when the intro begins!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely one of the stand out points in this show. They all are welly developed over the episodes which gets you really attached to them and nail biting at every sudden and horrible turn of events against them. But that makes the show even better! They are relatable too and truly have fitting and sensibly developed traits and personalities. \\n\\n\r\nRelationships play a huge part too. With multiple love interests, potential love interests and episode 8 (Which went specifically into the characters relationships, characters and story (Aka the episode where the creators used the episode to not only continue the story but to ship everyone together in a huge love triangle and confuse us viewers)), it gets you messed up to say the least. Getting confused over multiple ships is always fun to pull at your heartstrings and to debate over with friends (If you them of course).\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis story is another huge stand out point for me. I've never really seen an anime with such an original storyline. It's not everyday you find an anime about people linking together by their pain and emotion and unless I'm blind, It's an incredibly original idea. I've seen anything like it before.\\n\\n\r\nOther than it just being original the storyline is nicely thought out and there is never a dull moment. The plot advances throughout the series with twists and turns and angst and cute fluffy things. So be excited for that. \\n\\n\r\nNothing is left unexplained and confusing stuff is typically gone into detail with so you can be left with a full understanding of whats going on instead of going \"Lol what?\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nAs I've probably expressed through my review, this series is amazingly enjoyable. In fact, it slowly became one of my favourite series. Definitely one to watch again!\\n",

In episode 9, we found out about the love triangle of unrequited feelings and how depressing love can be. It teaches us something. Yes, it is not perfect. I shipped Nico and Tenga but the dude ended up with Chidori. But over looking that flaw, the anime is quite realistic when it came to drama. It wasn't too much, it was bold.

The premis of the show is great, the charachters sharing pain and emotion seems interesting enough,however, if that is the premise then the show obviously needs to be a charachter based show which is the major flaw here.\r\nA show like this only makes an impact if the charachters can make you connect to them and care about them. I personally had a hard time connecting with the charachters mostly because they were not like able. Also there is a prominent lack of back story for any charachterthat you might actually like.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the charachters the plot is kind of all over the place with pacing issues included free of charge! There are also times when the plot gets a little hard to follow but that may have just been me. As for the rest of the show...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great Bright and colorful and really catches your eye. Im not really knowledgeable about animation quality and specs but i do know that this is pretty good animation. The charachter designs are all unique and stand out alot. And i personally enjoyed the op so much that i watched it every time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall id say kiznaiver was fair to mediocre. If you are looking for charachters you can really sink your teeth into then this is not your show. But if you just want some shallow high school drama with colorful charachters, great art and animation then kiznaiver is what you are looking for.",

I'm gonna finally write a positive review for something.\r\nWith me piddling all over some other animes, getting a few removed etc. I think it's time for me to be positive for once. Besides in my HIV test.\r\nStory: 8!\r\nIf you take out the characters from the anime, the story is shit. It's a normal teen drama that we've all seen before, and just like some of the characters, adds fuck all.\r\nBut with the characters to connect it, it rises to the dizzy heights of basically alright.\r\nThere are still a few things I'd change, but those are minor complaints.\r\nArt: 8!\r\nIt doesn't really stand out eitherway, but I really like it personally. It has a great color scheme, and a unique artstyle that isn't the generic one with same-tone colors everywhere. It's *enjoyable*.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9!\\n\\n\r\nOooh boy. I kept getting chills because the voice actors did such a good job with their roles. The soundtrack is awesome, and well done. Not much more to say about it, really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10!\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to summarize all the characters in one world, it would be relatable. You can feel that you'd do exactly the same thing in the situation. They're all very human, and engaging. You can feel that they understand the shit they're in, and that they try to cope with the situation at hand the best they can. I'd go as far as saying that characters here are *almost* as good as in Re:zero.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9!\\n\\n\r\nA surprising anime, although only slightly cliche, a very enjoyable one. I have no complaints about the characters, which is in my opinion the most important part of an anime, because we're supposed to project ourselves onto one of those characters. That's why having a large variation of characters is very important.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9!\\n\\n\r\nWATCH IT. REASONS ABOVE.",

            "content": "Before I start the review,I've known that this anime is originated from the game \"Kiznaiver\",However,after the anime ended,I wasn't able to find the game in google to  compare it to,so I will do review based on the story development of the episodes.\r\nStory: 7\r\nHonestly,the story started off really slow.On the first 2 episode,I really felt like droppingg the anime because it was too slow for me.But soon the story slowly starts to develop by first bringing the Kiznaivers together and bulding connection among them instead of forcing viewers to gulp some idea or storyline without explaining.It does not just throw a solution of mystery tothe viewer,it actually develops it and gives evidence on how it was solved and the background story(hint:Sonozaki Maki).However,the story does take a major turn with the drama which will probably blow your mind because how the story take a transition from kiznaivers being friend from suddenly they are in love with eachother and fighting over eachother like a chain reaction,when one person rejects,it just end up breaking the friendship between all of them. However I was kind of disappointed with how the story ended,because I wished they would reveal more of the history of Katsuhira and Noriko's time of kiznaiver experiment and how or why it started.The ending clearly seemed too rushed since it made my feel like the story could develop more after Noriko started an all out \"connection\" experiment in the city.However,the ending matches up so it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art seems pretty unusual compared to other animes; it is like a game.So I'm guessing the art is similar to the one in the Kiznaiver game.It's not half bad;the art does not bother as much at all.It gives an impression of the game so it's pretty cool to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nStarting of with the opening theme,it's pretty trippy.The sounds in the game also go along good with the overall progress of the story,but it's not overwhelmingly astounding.When there's a need for an action-packed scene,they add a combat-like music to sync with it. But most of the time,I kind of don't really notice the background sound because it is kind of subtle.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe major characters in this anime are all connected to kiznaiver experiment,where Noriko and Katsuhira were the first ones to start the experiment as it seems like.But they gradually unpack the relation between the characters and their history.I would say they did a really good job with the development of the characters even though there are still some that are left totally unanswered.For example,they did not reveal the history o Noriko except that she was always \"alone\" and they did not also mention histories of the other kiznaiver that Noriko were friends with.However,the ending makes it end smoothly and they don't need to have a second sequel season. I wished they reveal more of the history of the characters in the anime except of just showing their personalities when it comes to the person they like. They kind of make the character relation look cheap because how it was suddenly all about love and love-triangles.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the beginning of the review,I wanted to drop the anime when I started watching it.I actually it put off to the side to add it on my drop list.However,when it was almost halfway into the anime and they developed the relationship between the characters,it was more enjoyable and I wanted to watch what comes after.Before it was confusing with how everyone just popped into existence.But since suddenly it was all about love triangles,I did not enjoy it more.But those were only during the last 2-3 episodes so it was still interesting to see what happens between the kiznaivers after.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThe story was really interesting and unique before they brought love between the kiznaivers into the story.My excitement dropped after that even though I liked how the story progressed.If they didn't rushed it to end the story,I would've given this anime a 7.",

            "content": "I usually only write a review when my own opinion seems to differ from the general consensus and I feel it's unjustified. This has only happened with a couple other animes (such as Casshern Sins and Charlotte) so I thought i'd put forward my opinion. \r\nKiznaiver is a show that uses a plot device one would normally associate with quite an intricate plot/mystery type anime, for a completely different purpose, which I believe is the source of much confusion. Kiznaiver's plot is character development. That may sound like a strange description for a plot, and it rarely is pulled off well. However when push comesto shove I honestly think that the entire point of the show, essentially the shows 'plot', was simply to create some characters and show how they/people bond. (as the show itself so often said). People complain that the plot seems directionless, especially in the first few episodes and they seem to miss that the reason behind that is it is introducing characters, the 'plot' seems to be lacking because the show is focused on building beautiful characters. It even points out the 'stereotypical characters' that it uses because that is half of the point of the entire anime (the ending basically summarises why they choose to use such \"Stereotypical anime characters\".\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying Kiznaiver was perfect, in fact I took a few days break around the middle of the show. However by the time I finished the show I was so connected to the characters and loved the way they all brought an individual perspective to the philosophy of the show. And all with incredibly well thought-out backstories that explain their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nFor those people who love concise, 100% complete explanations for everything in a show, you will struggle with Kiznaiver. Even the process of becoming a Kiznaiver is completely unexplained, (MILD SPOILER) you go through a quick surgery and boom, pain shared with everyone else who has that surgery. That's it, no more explanation. And I like that, it would be completely pointless info-dumping that wouldn't have contributed AT ALL to the character development. \\n\\n\r\nI could continue raving about various aspects of the show that I think were misunderstood but I shant bore you any longer. All I can say is that I feel Kiznaiver set out to accomplish a goal of a story focused around a group of three-dimensional characters using a unique plot device to get across a philosophical point and show how important it is for human beings to bond together, even through the painful times (Maki? Anyone) \\n\\n\r\nAnd to the producers of Kiznaiver I say BRAVO! Mission accomplished you did a beautiful job.\\n\\n\r\nI mean common, episode 11, the scene with Kacchon and Hisomu!!! I just sat back and thought \"Wow, I love these characters so much\" It felt so NATURAL to me, and I was just like, yea, that's what friends are for. AND THAT WAS WHAT KIZNAIVER WAS ALL ABOUT. So I think it deserves all the praise I can give it. (buzz buzz buzz, splash splash splash.... buzz, buzz, splash splash :) :) :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is supposed to be an anime that highlights the problem of the natural loneliness that all people feel and what that loneliness can turn people into. Does it manage that? In a way, yes, but that way is so unrealistic and exaggerated that nothing whatsoever can be learned from the series.\r\nPlot: 5\r\nIn core principle, I really like the idea of Kiznaiver. Connecting people through physical pain to connect them mentally - for a world without loneliness. The idea is beautiful and one that you could play a lot with.  Kiznaiver partly does that. The physical pain is first explored through a set of(in general) previously unacquainted teenagers. After a few episodes, as they grow closer and more familiar, this develops to an exploration of their mental pain. At some point this culminates, while a different story is presented to the viewer in pieces. An older and more mysterious story which is probably my favourite part of the series (Katsuhira's past). So okay, they have everything covered. But rather than choosing this mysterious route they laid out in the beginning, they explore through slice-of life moments of exaggerated feelings and borderline hysterical behaviour. What could have been a great sci-fi is turned into a mediocre drama. And even the mysterious past crumbles in feelings during the last episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAside from that, the episodes are rather mis-matched. The pacing is irregular and some of the episodes are so unrealistic that they don't even make sense (e.g. what Nori-chan did in the last episode). Some events seem irrelevant even if they are meant to be used for \"bonding\". Generally if the pace had been picked up, this series would have been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThis is definitely where the series excels. Gorgeous. I think that's the word for the art. Original character designs combined with a sense for detail, pleasant and detailed backgrounds, a very big focus on lighting and colours. That is what Kiznaiver's art is. Whether you like the design or not, the characters are beautifully drawn and all of them very unique. The eyes are the most detailed and spirited I've seen in a while, light reflecting from them with excellent detail. The hair - especially when moving - is also drawn very detailed, making it possible to tell individual strands apart (Nori's hair..). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\r\nSound is neither really good nor bad. The opening has a futuristic feel that fits the series well, while the ending is nothing special. Quite common for a slice of life, though a bit fast paced.  The OSTs are pleasant and well-used to create certain moods. A few of them are memorable and I generally think they did a good job in making the OSTs sound a bit \"spacey\" to fit the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:7\\n\r\nThe characters are actually rather nice. They are all different from one another and make a good combination. Our main character, Katsuhira, is an odd-ball with no feelings. This may sound familiar, but they actually make him work very well and make him seem as realistic as possible. Other characters include an energetic loli, a softhearted muscle man, the usual likeable female friend, a cold and rather mean glasses girl, and a school prince. All of the characters are actually likeable, and though some are exaggerated,  others are downright sensible people (Honoka and Yuta actually seem like real people). Another strong point is how much we get to know the characters, their bad points, weaknesses and their past. It makes it easier to understand their actions.\\n\\n\r\nNow the reason I haven't scored characters higher is their relationships. Being together for a few weeks, these very different personalities are suddenly best friends. The things that they'd do for each other after such a short period of time are way too many. Oh and let's not foget how everyone falls in love with each other. Their deepfelt confessions made me cringe. That said, I actually like the main couple. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nAll in all Kiznaiver ruined a very good idea. There were some enjoyable moments, but generally the series was boring and delivered weirdly. But if you like slice of life with a twist, this might be for you. Most people can enjoy the series if you put your focus on art and animation - if you're an art freak this series is not a bad choice, because the story is not downright horrible, just about decent.",

            "content": "As the next installment of studio TRIGGER's original material, Kiznaiver doesn't pack a huge punch, but still manages to hit.\r\nWhile I did enjoy what the show for its story, at first I had mixed feelings. One big reason could be the studio attempting their second TV series after the immensely popular Kill la Kill. With a show like that, it could be hard to top. However, after a while, I tried not to think about that. Instead, I accepted Kiznaiver for what it had to offer without comparing it to other works. It's very simple, but keeps it leveled, so it's not that grand inscale. In the end, I think what really mattered was the message of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the characters are what helped drive the story/message forward. What's interesting about them is they're basically forced to get to know one another, which is something that normally would happen in a story that's poorly written. Obviously, this is intentional, and even then, for most of them it was hard to accept each other at first. Now that I think about it, this is kind of like how I dealt with my expectations for this show.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that TRIGGER is always on their A game when it comes to animation. The character designs are individually unique and the movements can become either very fluid or just out there. It's never a dull moment watching done by TRIGGER.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without making any comparisons, I will say that I enjoyed Kinzaiver for what it is. I've been following the studio from their first ever project, and what they've made so far are unique in their own way. Amazing characters, story, animation, what have you.",

            "content": "Overall: 7 Good\r\nI was drawn first to the beautiful art/animation and then the interesting sci-fi premise. An emotionless main character is thrown into an experiment where participants feel each other's pain. The comedic dramatisation makes the storytelling more light-hearted, which fits the setting of high school characters. However, this tends to overwhelm deeper issues that I feel the anime could have explored more. Personally I did not understand where the story was heading until Episode 10, and while I really liked the concept, I felt that the previous episodes could have hinted or better led up to that point.\r\nStory: 7 Good\r\nThe initial episodes were notparticularly interesting to me, although they were important in setting up the characters and the setting of the Kizna System. However, introducing each character felt disjointed, as though some of them were simply put there for the sake of being participants of the experiment. Although I really liked the story concept presented by later plot development, personally I felt the storytelling could have better linked between each character's issues with the main theme so that the story could be more concise and impactful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 Good\\n\r\nStorytelling aside, the characters were decent. Not everyone may recognise the character development because it happens very slowly, Also, it tends to show more in the characters' change of thought/mindset rather than how they react/express themselves emotionally. While I can appreciate this level of expressivity from Japanese characters, I think a deeper exploration of each character's motivations and past experiences of pain would help me as a viewer understand and appreciate them better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 Very Good\\n\r\nSo far I have been following each episode as they are released weekly. If I had watched the initial episodes in one shot, the storyline might feel less draggy. However, Episode 10 really turned it around for me, because I finally understood the concept and the ambiguity in previous episodes finally made sense. I would recommend this to viewers with the patience to watch this till the end (there are only 12 episodes anyway) and still be able to note the subtle/slow development of characters and characters, which I feel is actually quite interesting to really think about.",

            "content": "The combination of Trigger's hyperactive visuals combined with Mari Okada's idea of what teen drama should be like was already considered a weird combination when Kiznaiver was first announced, but it was only upon airing that people realized just how much weirdness they can take. I'm sure most of you have heard by now that the show is basically Kokoro Connect if it stuck to its initial concept and traded the grounded tone for a cartoonish one. Which is a bit ironic considering I connected more to the cast of this show than Kokoro, as well as Okada's recent dramas like Anthem of the Heart- even though Katsuhira doesn't really do much more than the male leads in those shows in regards to affecting the plot other than get punched. Maybe it's because I've gotten so tired of teen dramas trying to recreate realistic personalities that seeing one not even bothering to pretend is a relaxing breath of fresh air.\\n\\n\r\nIt also helps that the concept doesn't really pretend to be realistic either, going for a straight sci-fi angle right off the bat in regards to the drama through the Kizna System: a scientific experiment designed to bring world peace by connecting people with a mysterious scar that'll allow them to share each other's pain and suffering, whether physical or emotional. Said experiment is used on seven students sharing the same class prior to summer break with the condition that they all stay connected for the entire summer and perform assigned missions that are so obviously intended to force them to be friends that there might as well have been a goals header explaining that fact. It's a bit hokey when you say it out loud, but what attracted me to the show were the possibilities of what the Kizna System could explore regarding teenage issues when said teens are forced by other people to confront them. They can be really annoying when handled improperly, but when they are, they hit the side of me that likes strong characterizations and social insight.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, I really hate when anime thinks it can be funny, and it gets particularly annoying when it gets in the way of the drama. I know Kiznaiver is a Trigger anime and all, but it has a bad tendency of picking inappropriate times to remind us of that what with the ridiculous secrets some of the characters revealed in the initial game or the jarring tonal shifts in general. It's not quite Jun Maeda-levels of distracting, but I have a feeling it would have been if PA Works had been the ones behind this show instead. Hisomu in particular reminds me of the dude's useless male friends, right down to having no importance to the plot other than to be a masochistic outsider. The Trigger wackiness fares better when those mascots that I can't remember the names of are involved, but I have the sneaking feeling that they were intended to be scary - and if that's the case, no they're not.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's talk about the drama itself. It's got all the cliches you'd expect from the writer of Anohana: love triangles, teens yelling out their feelings as a moment of release, friendship is the most important part of your youth, and the cast being a mixed bag with half of them being decent characters and the other half being stereotypes who are only there to provide levity or more angst. There are also two important plot lines that are mostly connected through our monotone male lead: the one about the six classmates trying to deal with the challenges put upon them by the scientists whilst getting closer as a result, and the one about Kizna System arbitrator, Noriko Sonozaki, and her mysterious past regarding usage of the system in the past (with the former having the extra task of dealing with some other subplots). And I don't think both plot lines connect very well, especially considering the former is basically a teen drama with the scientists literally being the writer and the latter is a sci-fi thriller plot I'd expect in an episode of Ghost in the Shell if GiTS's characters had any emotion whatsoever. Towards the end when the latter starts to become the main focus, it's right after the former experiences a (particularly forced even by the premise's standards) emotional climax and said climax mostly gets swept under the rug with what's left being conveniently resolved by this other plot line.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if the show had only focused on developing one plot line for the entire length of its cour, I found the results of the Kizna experiment to be very disappointing. Getting a little spoiler-y here, but saying \"human emotions are too complex to scientifically analyze\" is an incredibly obvious conclusion and aside from Maki's arc, there's a disappointing lack of flavor to the show's usage of puberty other than saying it exists. I know the way it's told to us through the director's great visual direction has gotten some praise, but Kiznaiver is not a 30-minute OVA. It's a twelve-episode long series, and there's only so long that positive can carry the show when it goes on for that length.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm kind of meh towards Kiznaiver. It's not the worst thing in the world or anything and I'd recommend it over most of the anime that aired this Spring. But like most shows of this type, it just doesn't live up to its potential. Half the cast end up contributing nothing substantial to the plot, the story doesn't go far enough with its premise, and the tone is very inconsistent all throughout. I suppose it's worth watching if you just want an emotional experience, since on those terms, I preferred it to other recent hits like Grimgar and ERASED, let alone every inexplicably popular VN/LN adaptation ever. After all, it has a good visual style, the other half of the cast are endearing (and it helps that they're the plot-important ones), and it does enough with Okada's formula so that it doesn't feel like you're watching a rehash of her previous stuff. Certainly seemed to have made a lot of my \"feels\"-loving colleagues happy, although given the announcement of that upcoming Little Witch Academia series, they're probably prematurely passing on the \"Trigger's best anime\" crown by the time this review comes out.",

Chill out it's just an opinion.\r\nKiznaiver was one of the anime this season that I think had pretty high expectations from people, including me. I think to many, it satisfied the expectations. In my opinion, however, it was subpar on most levels.\r\nThe story is about a group of people who learn to be friends through \"kizuna\" or \"scars\" that help them share their pain. There is this interesting concept that by sharing in physical pain, an emotional bond can be builtbetween people. Definitely something a lot of people have thought about. \\n\\n\r\nOn this basis, Kiznaiver could go in many directions. It could focus on exposing and developing characters. It could convey a large, thoughtful, philosophical message. It could break hearts with tear-jerking tragedy. However, Kiznaiver ultimately went down the safer and blander route of love triangles. I wouldn't have been surprised by romance at first, but for the series to focus so much on it in the second half really ruined it for me. Nothing really comes of the romance either. It's just there so that we can see some hints of character development that, though effective, is only temporary. The development was so forced and didn't really have a lasting effect on the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs much of a music nerd as I am, I never really expect much from the soundtracks of anime. Kiznaiver didn't exactly deliver an emotionally engaging soundtrack, but all I ask of a soundtrack is for it to be fitting during the moments it is utilized, and Kiznaiver satisfied this to the bare minimum. Not much to talk about here.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was unique however. I appreciate the character design. There were a few interesting camera angles from time to time, but Kiznaiver is not an anime that had much use for Studio Trigger's impressive animation. There were times when it shone brightly, but the effect was lost in the sea of dullness and boredom in all other aspects of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver was overall an anime with very high potential, and it's a decent gateway anime for people who are new to Japanese animation, but its potential was ultimately wasted on trying to force an emotional response from its audience with \"mindfuck\" and the overused tool of love triangles.",

            "content": "When there is a common opinion about a show, it's hard to form your own opinion but despite everyone not being fond of this show I can proudly say that I love it. \r\nStory: \r\nThe story is really something. It definitely didn't directly copy any other series like a lot of series do which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just cool to see something fresh every now and then. A lot of good elements of the story come later in the series which I do not want to spoil for anyone. The backstory of the characters is what mostly drives the current story whichmostly revolves around the emotions of the characters which is definitely a cool way to move a series a long. Though, the pacing wasn't the best, I can't complain either way because it sealed it for me and I was content with how it ended.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not movie quality, so rating it best on how usual TV anime look I would give it an 8. Kiznaiver has interesting and beautiful backgrounds and the character designs make all of the characters seem like their very own person and has a lot of their quirks show through their design. I can definitely say the way that eyes are drawn in this series are my favorite out of every anime I have watch which is good because eyes can tell you a lot about the character but I mean, they look really cool. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe overall OST really drives a lot of moments throughout the series, it can go from playful, heartwarming, to downright chilling. For me, the way the sound was directed really completed some scenes for me. The opening is a catchy tune and is reminiscent to A-ha's Take on Me but more electronic which is not a bad thing. The ending sometimes feels out of place in the beginning of the series because of how it's not as playful as some of the beginning episodes of the series though towards the end this is a wonderful song to think over the episode with when it suddenly ends. The voice actors were wonderful, especially Nico's. Overall the sound was really good but there wasn't necessarily any like epic bangers or anything.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nLike I said in the first part, a lot of the story is driven by the characters and their emotions. The characters are all unique and lovable and when drama arises and their emotions come with it, it really feels real and makes you sympathetic and towards the end of a certain episode, I just started bawling. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI always find myself coming back to this show every now and then. I remember the time I initially watched and how much I enjoyed it. Even after rewatching it, though the impact is not as heavy, I still feel the same emotions I did the first time around. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show that has comedic, heartwarming, and emotional elements in it which really make a series good. It has good characters and the show looks great in of itself. It's just a good fucking show.\\n",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nWell, aside synopsis I can only tell that story had powerful and spiraling emotions. The whole system feels cruel, tragic but at the same time was a beautiful push for human bonds.\r\nI find it hard to review story without spoiling, but all I can tell it that story felt powerful, interesting and fairly unique. It could been a lot better if given more time. As lot of things felt very \"last minute plot pushing and expanding\". I feel more time for some of the drama and thebackstory of the whole research project should have been given. On top of that finale felt rather rash and spontaneous.\\n\\n\r\nBut other than that it was beautiful storytelling about characters with their own issues, complexes and the bonds that grew between them. Sprouting into all sorts of emotions and offering fairly scarring emotional pain and strain of it.\\n\\n\r\nA splendid story especially if you can relate and understand the pain and all sorts of other dark feelings that were presented in this story.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nVisuals and animations were absolutely stunning.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music/OST .. it was good, but didn't really impress me. Weren't fond of opening song as well.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nLong story short, various \"modern\" stereotypes that did somewhat annoy me at start but I grew onto most of them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso did adore main character as I saw a lot of myself in him. Aside looks. But the whole ignoring the pain (in his case actually physically having reduced pain), the inability to understand himself and those around him. As well the whole avoiding people by giving in to them or simply ignoring them while being pushed around and so on. So he had his issues and was fairly stoic/robotic, but yet still as always those \"depressive\" Anime characters end up making me feel jealous especially because they tend to have someone who is beside him, love him and eventually expand into more bonds. Whenever it's strong friendship or romantic type of love with one of the female characters.\\n\\n\r\n#Skippable rant paragraph# This type of things somewhat anger me and gives another impact to solitude. Which kinda often wants me to be skilled director and make one actually depressing Anime and give it strong emphasize of losing self. Life long chaos and pain and on top of that a true loneliness, where is no magical \"childhood female friend who actually loves me and ends up being my savior\". And toss on top of that character being someone who lost control of his body as well thus make the MC round depressive character. Type of character that everyone hates (including himself) looks and personality wise and thus give grand finale of death that no one will care about anyways.\\n\\n\r\nANYHOW.. I went a bit off topic, but moral of the story is MC is another depressive character that gets saved by people around him.\\n\\n\r\nAll other characters also have their issues, quirks and pasts. But I feel that there is no need to explain them as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also few interesting side-characters that somewhat got a bit too little weight of importance. Meaning I felt as they should gotten a bit more backstory and explanation. But well, 12 episodes is fairly limited.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nAll I can say is. Depressing story with fairly dark drama that blossoms beautifully and enjoyably. \\n\\n\r\nI did feel quite emotional quite a lot, loved the main MC (Katsuhira) and were intrigued about the whole scenario.\\n\\n\r\nI personally find it an interesting idea to share pain in literal meaning. But not for such \"grand and good\" reasons, but rather for reasons of simply wanting someone who just tells with ego \"get over it\"  or \"just do that to fix that\" and so one to taste the pain someone lives in and then see if they shrug off fix in such an easy manner as they claim... \\n\\n\r\nAside that, it was beautiful how Anime characters blossomed and how strong their bonds became and how caring, worrying they became of each other. That is the magic of fiction. To see, experience and enjoy things that do not exist in reality.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this Anime will get my TOPFAV tag.\\n\\n\r\nTDLR; Want to see powerful Anime of bonds and emotions with fairly grim plot and setting? Then check it out. If you are the type to not comprehend this or \"shrug off\" such things/feelings. Then don't bother.",

            "content": "This anime is a masterpiece. The main characters development especially with the other characters in the anime is incredible. Through out the story him and 6 other teens in his class are tasked to do what they are told in order to \"connect\". As the teens go through out the story they progress in the connections and bonds. A lot happens throughout the story and towards the end you find out about the past of the main character. The story starts off a bit slow but then progresses into a full on sprint in the end then it suddenly just slows down allllll the wayagain then picks up which with the story worked well. About 3/4ths in i was starting to feel heart break after heart break and with in the few last episodes there is a bundle of emotions. As someone who isn't easily moved by things whether is heat break or over excitement, especially when it comes to non real life situations or things, I give this anime an over all 10. If i feel any heart moving emotions over an anime its and instant 10 for me. Being i've watched over 160 anime and about 60+ days worth of time I have only been moved by about 5-7 anime and even then only 1-3 moved me as much as this one did. the last two episodes had my emotions spiking and the whole anime had me hooked to the point where I had to watch the whole thing in one sitting which isn't too rare for me like the heart moving part is. One thing I think should be addressed is that this anime has quite a bit of romance in it although there isn't officially any romance going on until the end and there definitely isn't any real relationship type material until the very end i think it could of scrapped by with the romance category just because of the fact that it is strongly based on love the two major plot points have to do with love and each other's feelings, and in the end there is about 5 minutes or more of real romance material which is tied in from the character development through out the story. I would recommend this highly to anyone who enjoys anime about a group of people developing together and facing past traumas and experiences together. Overall a great anime.",

            "content": "Ok, this is my first review so uhh, yeah.. hope this is helpful!!\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI personally really enjoyed main story of kiznaiver.  It wasn't too much/ too overbearing, and was easy to follow.  I found myself drawn to the next episode, one after the other, on a search for answers and pieces to the puzzle.  For me, the story was one of this anime's strongest points!\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nAs for the art, I thought it was great as well.  The colors and style used was enjoyable to watch and I feel the art really brought the characters to life.  All of the characterswere very distinct in their designs, from hair, to face shape, physique, and their clothing style.   I really liked the eyes, especially Katzuhiras', despite them being blank and emotionless the whole time lol!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWell,  considering I'm listening to the soundtrack as I write this review I'd say it was pretty darn good!! The theme song was amazing and is probably one of my favorites, as well as the end song!!  as for the OST, it was very distinct throughout the anime.  I found myself identifying reoccurring songs in relation to the situations in each episode, which was nice.  For the most part, the background music stuck out when it had to during particularly emotional and intense scenes as well as in the quirky and funny ones.  Overall, the music was one of my favorite things about this anime!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong, the characters in this anime are some of my favorites but some of them were missing something.  To be quite honest, I loved all 7 of the kiznaivers, but while some were given loads of arc and development, some were just neglected in comparison.. I blame this on the amount of episodes, as 12 is not nearly enough for plot and and equal development of 7 individuals.  Also, I guess I'd rather have a few VERY well rounded characters and good plot than a bunch of half assed ones, so in my opinion, the creator did their best with what they were given.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis section should be rather simple, as every episode left me wanting more.  I liked how the pieces to the overall plot sort of fell into place overtime, and watching the characters in the situations and predicaments they were thrown into was rather enjoyable for me.  Not saying their pain and emotional suffering was \"enjoyable\" per say, as it was quite heart wrenching at times, but this anime made be feel some strong emotions on this side of the screen, and in my book that counts as enjoyable.  I will pretty much sell my soul to any sort of content that makes me feel emotionally connected to fictional worlds and characters, being the expert escapist that i am!! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\noverall,  Kiznaiver was probably one of my favorite animes' to date.  Great story, awesome soundtrack, lovable characters, and lots of eye catching art!!  I would 100% recommend this to anyone and I'll probably be watching it again in the near future!!",

Trigger took on way more and grander of a concept than they could eventually deliver.\r\nIt looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous, and the first half felt seriously promising with its intrigue, but in the end it goes nowhere and ends with what has to be one of the most terrible anticlimaxes I've ever experienced.\r\nIt really feels like they ran badly out of time and had to deliver something that they have to know is totally lackluster.\r\nApart from the huge letdown of an ending, the writing fails in other interesting ways as well. The side characterslook awesome and get at least some personal development during the series, while the two _main characters_ on the other hand both look and sound uninspired and unlikeable.\\n\r\nThe further I watched, the less I could find myself giving a shit about the only two characters whose stories really SHOULD have mattered by the end.\\n\r\nThere's also a noticeable amount of really jarring retconning where they pull unexpected new information and characters out of their ass and just expect you to care without any set-up. Nuh uh.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nArt and sound: stunning\\n\r\nCharacters: nice designs, bad development, incredibly dull and unlikeable MC+\"villain\"\\n\r\nStory: is all over the place and would've needed much, much more fleshing out and airtime to be good.\\n\\n\r\nCannot recommend this one, which is a shame.",

            "content": "This review is from my blog and that's why it starts off weird.\r\nAlso contains some spoilers.\r\nAfter been completely turned off of anime for about month thanks to a recommendation by a friend, I was finally able to muster up enough strength to break one of my rules and drop the aforementioned anime. It\u2019s name was Heroic Age. It wasn\u2019t bad per se. It was just\u2026 really boring. The characters, the setting, the animation, and the everything. I tried watching it, in vain, three times but I always fell asleep.\r\nAnyways, after a string of many lost games in League of Legends last night, I finally decidedto get back into anime again. I spent a good while thinking about what to watch. Then, suddenly, Kiznaiver came to mind. I wanted something good. Something interesting. I knew Studio Trigger would deliver. Good or bad, whatever they make at least has you interested.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most people who went into Kiznaiver thinking it to be another Kill la Kill or Inferno Cop (lol), I watched it knowing what to expect. Quite a number of people who watched the show while it was airing complained that it was rather slow, never went anywhere, or the characters were one-dimensional. Hell, some viewers even lamented the fact that it was nothing like Kill la Kill. Absolutely no fan-service whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver is Trigger\u2019s first attempt at trying something different. All of its shows till now have been either parodies, focused on action, or both. Even Little Witch Academia follows this. I, for one, am glad that Kiznaiver is very different from Trigger\u2019s usual works.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Kiznaiver is a mild case of character study. It doesn\u2019t just lightly touch it\u2019s subject matter nor does it go fully into psychological territory. It is very apparent from the second episode of Kiznaiver that it is a show meant for fun with a bunch of melodrama here and there. Exactly what I thought it would be.\\n\\n\r\nSo how come, you would ask, Kiznaiver interested me so? Well, other than the characters themselves, it was mainly because of the huge plot device that is known as the \u2018Kizuna System\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kizuna System is basically just having surgery performed on the seven main characters so that if one of them has pain inflicted on them then they all feel. Over the course of the show, as the Kizuna System progresses, if one of the \u2018Kiznaivers\u2019 feels any strong emotion then that emotion is felt by all of them. Then we go into reading the heart. Interesting concept, no? But, like I said before, the Kizuna System is just one big plot device. Without the Kizuna System, the anime would just have been an over-dramatic slice of life. This plot device helps create a balance \u2013 giving you the false illusion that something evil is afoot. This helps keep the oddities of the characters and their behavior in check and helps the anime not into Korean soap-opera territory.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to the meat of Kiznaiver. The characters!\\n\\n\r\nKatsuhira Agata is the main focus, in regards to the characters, of Kiznaiver. He is devoid of emotion and cannot feel physical pain. An emo without the trademarked black look. Along with his childhood friend, Takashiro Chidori, he and a six other students from his class are abducted and chosen for the Kizuna System experiment. They are told they have to expose themselves to each other for the sake of the experiment. For the sake of world peace.\\n\\n\r\nA point to note: no matter what angle you analyze the Kizuna System from, there is no logical explanation for HOW it will help attain world peace. Even the show doesn\u2019t explain how. So, while being an effective plot device, the Kizuna System is also one of Kiznaivers biggest cons.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, back to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTenga Hajime is the thug who secretly has a huge heart. Yuta Tsugihoto is the spaz who pretends to be what he\u2019s not \u2013 an arrogant tool. Niyama Niko is an eccentric Hollywood blondie who pretends to be eccentric because she thinks she isn\u2019t (whewie). Maki Honoka is\u2026 well it would be a spoiler. And, finally, Hisomu Yoshiharu is a masochist in denial who, in my opinion, is the most rational character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these guys and gals are gathered by Sonozaki Noriko who is adamant in proving the success of the Kizuna System for it has already failed before.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing of all these characters interact with each other and step out from their single dimension into the third is a fascinating treat. With grounded and witty dialogue, the characterization comes out just great. Exactly what it feels like when I talk to my friends. Yes, even Nico.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame that a lot of viewers just went with the first judgment of the characters and deemed them to be caricatures till the end of the show. Kiznaiver is slice of life disguised as action (but there is no action at all) so a lot people were left bored during the middle of the show which was just character development for the finale. I\u2019m not really sure if this is a fault in direction, script, or Trigger\u2019s image itself. Oh well, you win some and you lose some.\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver\u2019s music is OK, I guess. The opening \u2018Lay Your Hands On Me\u2019 by Boom Boom Satellites which bloody amazing for me since that kind of electronica and rock usually doesn\u2019t sit well with me. The ending wasn\u2019t bad \u2013 just that I\u2019ve heard a lot of songs like it so I just skipped it. As for the background music, nothing special. The hard violin, techno and beats certainly suited the show but overall, nothing memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is gorgeous. For once Trigger got its budget under control and created a show with no slacking in animation. The character designs are a neat break from the usual fare you see in modern anime. Light and long bodies with a lot of curves and fluidity topped by a bright color palette. Good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nIf Kiznaiver had a thorough quality check for its plot then it would truly have been something special. But, the Kizuna System\u2019s flaws and the contrived wishy washy ending deal a serious blow to it\u2019s overall goodness. Also, the world building needed some polishing too. No matter how good the characterization in a show is, without a properly fleshed out plot you\u2019re not going have many heads rolling and that\u2019s a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nRight as the show ended, I thought it was an 8.5/10 in my book. But, today after giving it some thought, I think it objectively deserves a 6/10 at most. But it\u2019s a 7/10 for me thanks to the fun I had watching the characters grow. Since this is a review, I'll input the 6.\\n\r\nRecommended for those slow nights when you suddenly feel like ringing up some friends but can\u2019t because they\u2019re busy. Or if you don\u2019t have friends and feel like wanting to make some.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver centers around Agata and several teenagers getting roped into a secret experiment utilizing a linked system called the Kizuna System that allows everyone in the group to experience the pain and emotions of one another. Agata's situation, in particular, is a unique one as he suffers from a lack of apathy and an inability to feel pain.\r\nOn paper, Kiznaiver seemed like it wanted to offer a stylish, yet interesting, commentary regarding personal communication between others with the Kizuna System being the means in which this theme is explored. The exploration of this is a bit hit-or-miss throughout Kiznaiver's run, but the positives of thisare still strong enough to prominently stick out and I will highlight these before covering the rather significant flaws of the series. A major positive for the series is the character exploration it offers up to several of its characters. A recurring theme with the major characters in Kiznaiver is how each one has dealt with loneliness. Kiznaiver takes some time to explore the personal dilemmas affecting several of the show's teenage cast to show how each have dealt with their issues before becoming involving with the Kizuna System project. This exploration led to some genuinely engaging plot developments with a couple characters, particularly Agata's unique situation and a personal trauma affecting Maki. The Kizuna System as a concept also has its effective moments to highlight the flaws of attempting an inter-linked system for people to know the thoughts and emotions of one another that shows that in spite of the potential barriers that direct communication offers for mutual understanding, it's still a better alternative than compromising your personal thoughts and pains through directly connecting them to others.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of these strong positives though, Kiznaiver's very premise does carry with it some major issues. The premise it attempts is a bit too grand to effectively pull off for a 12-episode series. This is quite noticeable in the anime's second half when its storytelling starts to take a hit quality-wise as it rushed with attempting more heavily dramatic and grand storytelling compared to the more grounded and mundane developments of the anime's first half. Some story elements in the second half explored have their moments they shone through such as more fleshing out of Noriko's character, but it still doesn't make up for the sloppy and rushed execution of the anime's second half. Another consequence of this issue is that a number of characters that make up part of the Kizuna System testing do get shafted in focus and depth due to the anime's limited episode count, thus limiting how much connection the audience could potentially develop with them. Perhaps if Kiznaiver were given a higher episode count or devoted another season to allow itself more time to develop its cast and premise, the series could have been a more cohesive package as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, Kiznaiver's high moments with its character focus and premise exploration shine through enough to make it an above-average offering as an anime in spite of its very premise being too grand to effectively explore in its 12-episode run. I would still at least recommend checking it out once as it what moments are effectively conveyed still make it a worthwhile watch.",

However, I enjoyed it more than I thought I could.\r\nStory\r\n-------\r\nThe story is based on fulfilling world peace by using individuals as lab rats to share their pain, physical and emotional. These individuals have to understand each other help each other with their pain. At first I thought this would be boring but the story was outstanding. The story follows the male protagonist showing that he recieves no pain so he doesn't mind if hegets punched by bullies. As this experiment continues, he tries to learn more about himself and it is truly outstanding (10).\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThe art is the key piece in this anime. It captures the scenes perfectly. The pain received, the emotions shared, the characters, the comedic actions. All of it. It's like playing minecraft since alpha and suddenly putting shaders on for the first time. It is truly outstanding (10).\\n\r\nThe sound is passes you by seemingly. It's really nice and doesn't stand out too much which is what you want from sound. Even the opening had great music in synergy with the art, which is rare sometimes since I usually find myself skipping intros; not with this one. It is outstanding (10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nAll of the characters drawn and voiced are absolutely perfect, everyone is unique with amazing characteristics. Even the background characters have their essence. Katsuhira doesn't feel pain, Niko is a complete nonce; Noriko is elegant while retaining that final-boss essence; Chidori is the type who makes her feelings obvious without knowing it; Hajime is like a red-head version of Kenji off of School Rumble. His attitude is hilarious and as you learn more of Hajime it makes you laugh more. I would say the rest but it would spoil the show. Overall though the characters are outstanding (10).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\r\nI enjoyed this with a (10) and overall it is outstanding (10).\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who wants amazing visuals, sound, plot, characters and more. It is a great romance/sci-fi anime and I enjoyed it too much.",

The premise was interesting and unique. I really enjoy psychological aspects of anime and this one really intrigued me, especially around the time when they began to connect emotionally instead of just physically. It appealled to something I strongly believe in which is that people really don't know how to connect emotionally with others, even if they're family or friends. This anime was incredibly unique in it's story and brought about some interesting questions about aspectsof society that are rarely outwardly acknowledged. Not to mention the animation is very nice, and it has a really cool opening. Overall, I gave it an 9/10 because I think the overall story made up for the somewhat predictable ending.",

I'll try to keep it short, though!\r\nStory: Amazing - 9/10\r\nThe story always keeps you entertained, and most of the time it is very hard to predict what is going to happen. The only thing I can ''complain'' (if you can even call it complaining) about, is the ending. You could predict the ending at around episode 10, and it was parly clich\u00e9, though the ending was still very good nonetheless!\r\nArt: 8,5/10\r\nDon't get me wrong, the art is very good! It just personally didn't quite suit my taste, and I feel it wasa bit too little detailed. I also can't help but feel like the drawings were missing something, albeit I'm not quite sure what...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nProbably the most enjoyable anime I've ever watched, and I am nitpicky as hell. This series even tops SAO for me (Yeah yeah, hate me), although I doubt this series wouldn't have a very high re-watch value now that I know everything that's going to happen. Not knowing is what made this series have such an impact on me. \\n\\n\r\nEmotional value: 9/10\\n\r\nAgain, really good emotional content, but didn't fit my taste 100% (NOT COMPLAINING THOUGH!!). I feel like there should have been more focus on the positive emotions. The most enjoyable feels for me was the one episode focusing on Maki. (Not gonna spoil any more for you! ;)  )\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat also made this series so great, aside from the emotional value, is the great and different personalities of the characters. We have the simple muscle head, the wild & hyper, the high & mighty, the good-looking guy, and one who doesn't care about anything, really. Somehow, all of these people with such different personalities manage to form a bond, through which the story evolves.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 9/10\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\r\nIf you like emotional series, YES!",

            "content": "This is fun, to say the least.\r\nThis is Kiznaiver!\r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nTeamwork! Friendship! Bonding! Relationships are sugoi desu and you deserve to be loved nya~\r\nIf that made you cringe, stop now, because this is literally what Kiznaiver is all about and would be nothing without it.\r\nAs stated in the summary, the seven main characters of the show are connected together by this particular wound, which means that they start to feel each other's pain and emotions, thus driving them much closer together as friends and potential lovers to tease fans. As we delve deeper into the series, we see that our main character, Katsuhira, has the inabilityto feel pain and fails to empathize with others, which is a frustration and a mystery to the other six characters we grow more familiar with. We also realize that all of this is part of an experiment with a sinister backstory---sometimes, the best intentions lead to the worst results.\\n\\n\r\nBrilliant concepts. But you know what I said about how great intentions don't exactly equate to great results?\\n\\n\r\nTo put it in short, the story jumps and drags. For an anime about the chemistry of its characters, you either learn a ridiculous amount about them, or nothing at all. (Spoiler, but there are THREE episodes about the tragic back-story of ONE character out of the SEVEN they focus on. A quarter of the series, basically.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat drove me to keep watching was what the writers decided to do with the concepts, even if it fell flat at times. The second half of this series is where shit hits the fan and it gets AWESOME. Only problem is that you need to go through the first.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\\n\r\nI mean...it's Trigger. The stylistic beauty is there, as you would expect a Studio Ghibli movie to be visually stunning.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have too much to say aside from the character design is lovely, and the animation is fluid. But again. Trigger. They didn't LOSE THEIR WAY on this one.\\n\\n\r\nHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA\\n\\n\r\nI don't get paid for this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\\n\r\nLAAAAAAAAY YOOOOOOOOUR HAAAAAAAANDS ON MEEEEEEEE\\n\\n\r\nGreat theme. EXCELLENT and chaotic soundtrack to match the show's tone. Violin is used masterfully in the background to relay distress, piano denotes beauty. Kiznaiver does an excellent job with manipulating your emotions through its melodies.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the voice acting is splendid. Extra points to the voice actress for Nico, who apparently has an already filled resume of kawaii desu des des characters with squeaky, energetic, diabetes-giving voices. I'm excited for a dub. \\n\\n\r\nWHIIIIIIIIILE I'MMMMMMM BLEEEEEEEDING OUT\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7\\n\\n\r\nThey're all likeable, from the angsty main character to the blatant female version of him. In all honesty, however, I can't remember most of the names. All I remember was that...I liked the tropes. Again, that's not exactly high praise considering that the entire purpose of the show is to follow the deep connections between these characters, which eventually stem into last-minute romances and the obligatory training camp episode.\\n\\n\r\nHowever.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one character that I need to scream my praises about.\\n\\n\r\nNICO.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so Nico is, in short, the weird one. But out of everyone, she is BY FAR the most interesting and delightful. She has this innocence towards the concept of forming a relationship with someone, as she is the most blatant example of an outcast: bizarre dress, third-person speech, etc. She, unlike most of the characters the show follows, is very human and relatable. We all have that one friend who tries too hard to stick out, and maybe not the friend that gets off to pain or beats people up after school but has a petrifying fear of dogs. She's human, and it's refreshing to see...for lack of a better term, another larger-than-life Mako. If you can't find a reason to watch this show but you want to, make Nico your reason. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else? Eh. Katsuhira is cute in an angsty way, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show, with its bright colors and building story with unpredictable pacing demanded my attention. As an avid fan of Kill la Kill's style and character, I was stoked for Trigger's next brainchild.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for good reason. It was fun to follow, albeit difficult at times. It was a delight to watch the conflict and the resolution. I never had thoughts of quitting, and after taking a break due to working at a summer camp, I was excited to dive right back in.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is so fun. You could tell that everyone had a great time making this show into life. Watching the pre-episodes that documented the making of this series showed the passion put in after the success of Kill la Kill, and when the performer has a good time, so does the audience.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile I had a few qualms with Kiznaiver, wishing they did some things in the plot differently and better smoothed out the story, (maybe it would have been better if it was given a second season?), I am rather pleased with what was given.\\n\\n\r\nWe all watched Kill la Kill and Gurren Lagaan to have a great time and a riveting anime experience that we won't forget for a long time. I don't know if this anime reached that caliber, but the style and the Nico made it rather close to that.\\n\\n\r\nI believe Trigger did an excellent job with this one. Of course, not their best, but if you're looking for something that will stitch you up after Matoi sliced you down, this should at least suffice.",

Kiznaiver is a drama filled with the neat concept of a hand full of selected teenage students who can feel and equalize each other's pain. It's neat in concept but in execution it lacks in many areas and becomes a whirlwind of eye rolling and ends up being a sort of cliche. If Trigger did anything right it was probably the art, being fantastic, colorful and expressive with action-based scenes being fluid and detail in areas that matter. The op by boom satellites is a greatexample of Trigger's visual mastery (great song btw). Anyways, all-in-all the plot simmers down at a certain point and becomes flacid around the second half though there are still some great moments to be found.",

The story idea was a great one, though i feel like they could have given it a little something towards the end. Personally the last episode was rather disappointing.\r\nFor the most part the characters were fairly unique, taking a stereotype and adding a slight twist to what the audience would typically expect from said character, and really the only spot I found lacking here was Chidori. I feel like the only reason she was there was to get her heart broken and we see very little development from her comparedto the other characters. *cough* Mary Sue *cough*. \\n\\n\r\nI felt like there was a bit of  lull in the pacing with episodes 4-6 but the characters kept bringing me back to it with all of their unsuspected actions!",

And this show is all about them.\r\nThe show starts with a lot of mystery. Who are these people? How were they pick? Whats this big project all about? All this gets eventually answered, but the show is all about character development, their relations and the drama built among them. You can expect some very touching moments. You get to eventually know and like every character but the MC, which i cant explain he is \"like that\" without spoilling. \r\nTheinitial mystery and somehow comedy scenario is slowly replaced byt a suffocating, yeat pleasure to watch drama. Liked Kokoro Connect? It feels A LOT like that. I would love a second season, focused on their relations, but it seems unlikely to happen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, and intense and enjoyable show.",

I love this anime, mostly because it's so emotional, it's so deep and...... just HUMANS MAN. I freaking loved the art, it was so beautiful,and don't even get me started on the intro and outro.

Having to witness a group go through an organziation's plans against their will or rights was interesting.\r\nI have a phobia of pain, more specifically empathetic pain.\r\nOur main cast is taken in for an experimentation, the Kizna System, where the group is connected by each others pain. Slowly but surely, we start to see how much this can amount on people.\r\nIt starts out with physical pain. When one person gets hit, everyone will feel the same hit.\r\nThen came emotional pain. From despair and sadness, comes thepain making us cry. It could even be from positive emotions, like happiness or joy.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, came the most invasive pain of the lot, Heartache. The pain from a person's desires. While others may not have much heart towards something, they could feel when someone in the group had great feelings that they would've never noticed themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThink of it all as this, I'm attached to you through the Kizna system, and were are in different rooms;\\n\r\nI get punched in the gut, we both will experience the pain of it. You'll be like \"The hell? It hurts! Where'd that come from?!\"\\n\r\nI get saddened from seeing an animal get hurt, we both feel gloomy. You'd react as \"Wha-what? I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm not feeling hurt, why do I suddenly feel depressed?\"\\n\r\nI start to think about this girl I like and become all stupidly fuzzy and spew desires that I would personally love, even if you share none of my desires, you feel and know fully what I am feeling about this girl I like.\\n\\n\r\nThe questions from watching Kiznaiver were;\\n\r\nIsn't this way too invasive?\\n\r\nIf I get punched in the gut, they feel the pain, but what about the effects like getting winded? Do they also get winded?\\n\r\nIs this in anyway a step towards peace?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was inquisitive to me. The twist had wrung my phobia the hardest. Orange hair girl is best girl. There were times I could relate, and times I'd just be \"What in the heck is this?.\"\\n\\n\r\nKiznaiver isn't mind blowing, but it's not distasteful. It's interesting to see how our variety cast deals with the situation at hand. If you liked Danganronpa or 999, this might be a nice small little anime to get your brain thinking on these types of scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder what a story would be like if everyone was forced to possess each other. Y'know, things like that. Interesting.",

            "content": "Ok... I'm honestly impressed. Are you feeling alright Trigger?\r\nThe first time I read the plot in the anime chart and saw the animation studio my first reaction was \"Oh God, it's those idiots again.\" But I guess everyone deserves a fifth chance, because honestly the anime turned out pretty amazing.\r\nIn a futuristic city of Youdon'trememberland, the protagonist Katsuhira lives a relatively uneventful life of being continuously beat up and bullied away from his money. He does not react to this however, because he is physically completely immune to pain. It's not that he's trained to ignore it or something, he physically has no sense ofpain whatsoever. His lack of pain has also apparently numbed out all his other feelings as well, with him usually showing no reaction whatsoever. Along with him is his ever-whining friend/potential love-interest/annoying red-head, Raikiri. She spends the majority of her time criticizing him, which will quickly make the viewer hate her, but moving on:\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nA mysterious girl, Noriko, traps the two, along with a few other characters with a \"Kizna\" (literally: pain) mark, inserted to their bodies through surgery. This mark links all their pain senses together, making the pain (both physical and emotional) of one being felt by the others as well. This only goes 1 direction for Katsuhira though, since he is completely oblivious to the pain of others as well. I do not want to spoil too much here since this is something that you should watch for yourself, but the Kizna mark keeps strengthening over time, starting to link way more than just their sense of pain, slowly breaking them. Also needed to be mentioned, Noriko seems to have some connection to Katsuhira, who seems overly emotional and caring when it comes to her, despite it being her fault that they're all in this situation. This often enrages Raikiri of course.\\n\\n\r\nReally, it's an anime mainly focused on drama. It does not exactly present any grand philosophical questions, but rather just shows the character development of the people. That said, there are some problems with the characters themselves. Katsuhira comes off as strangely sympathetic, and I get the feeling that the show was actually going for the opposite of that so they could redempt him in the final episodes. Same goes for Noriko, who acts like a bitch for the most part but for some reason you instantly like. The revelations in the final episodes of course confirm those feelings. Other characters on the other hand fail though. Both Tenga and Raikiri come off as unintentionally annoying, especially in the red-head's case (:P). Actually let me persist on that.\\n\\n\r\nThe red-head female lead is F@CKING AWFUL. She cannot make up her mind, is overly judgmental of businesses she has no place sticking her nose into and basically subtly bullies the protagonist into romancing her, while enforcing her standards on him. While Noriko acts like a bitch and oppressively, you know that deep down she's just a tortured soul, captain B!TCH over here constantly ACTS like a victim just to grab people's attention, while pretending to be the leading force that cares about the rest of the group. You know, as I write this I am reminded of Lori from The Walking Dead. Yeah, THAT bad. My favourite being when she's throwing a tantrum because Katsuhira hugged Noriko after a mental breakdown, wishes for him to hug her as well and the rest of the group practically bullies Katsuhira into complying despite he himself having absolutely no desire for that whatsoever. And when he does it THE B!TCH STARTS COMPLAINING AGAIN. Aaaargh! \"Hey Rick, I want you to kill Shane. Oh my god! Why did you kill Shane? You're a monster!\" You hypocritical, manipulative, drama-queen B!TCH! And they're trying to show her as SYMPATHETIC. \\n\\n\r\nCONTINUATION:\\n\r\nOk so what you read above was the original review when 11 episodes were released. The review was taken down because I hadn't received the complete anime experience or something (I think the mods around here take down reviews based on Darts games), so here are all the important details from the last episode, obviously spoilers:\\n\\n\r\n-.............Aaaaaand I got nothing. The final scene with Nori sitting atop the half-raised bridge and saying she \"doesn't understand\" was both expected and anti-climatic, but overall not that bad, so the last episode pretty much didn't change my opinion whatsoever. Kudos for making her smile at the end of the episode but that's it.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Wonderful character development.\\n\r\n-Surprisingly none of the Trigger trademark bullsh!t minus a bit of pretentiousness.\\n\r\n-Hell! They even avoided mechas!\\n\r\n-Very well animated.\\n\r\n-Katsuhira's voice acting.\\n\r\n-The anime is often very depressing.\\n\r\n-The feels you get for Noriko near the end.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-The feelings you develop for characters are often the exact opposites of the intended.\\n\r\n-Good f@cking god Raikiri is annoying.\\n\r\n-Masochist guy has no purpose whatsoever. Shame because he's actually pretty good.\\n\r\n-So apparently a whole bunch of people including teachers agreed to kidnapping and surgery.\\n\r\n-The moral message of the show fails. Wow! Being bound BY SURGERY will not bring happiness?! I couldn't have guessed that! \\n\r\n-I mean, have you even seen Human Centipede?!",

            "content": "(SPOILER FREE)\r\nTrigger's next anime finally arrived! And what can I say?\r\nIt's pretty good. Nevertheless it is still another generic anime about making friends, but with an interesting plot which gives this anime in particular an upper hand on others. \r\nSome aspects of this show are so enjoyable at times knowing when to be comedic and serious, there is a good balance between the seriousness of the show and the lighthearted feeling of the show, which makes it a good anime to watch either alone or with friends.\r\nThis beautifully drawn show is easily recommendable to anyone who appreciates a decent plot, memorable characters, comedy and amazingartwork.\\n\\n\r\nEver wondered what it would feel like to be in someone else's shoes? Feel the pain which they feel? Kiznaivers shows this in such a unique way, by connecting 6 completely different characters and one such person who feels no physical nor emotional pain, which is an intriguing aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the strengths and weakness of Kiznaivers, a unique characteristic of the show, but the writing and execution could've been improved in a vast amount of areas.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the plot is obvious from the start, and it seems extraordinarily interesting to begin with, but it turns out slightly disappointing as there isn't much progression in the plot which is one of its weaknesses, you end up expecting more about the \"Kizna System\" but end up with barely a handful. The plot is also somewhat generic putting antisocial characters together and seeing how they progress.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's very likeable indeed is the way the characters are put together through distress. on the other hand it should've been implemented further and in better ways.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nFlawless. The OSTs, the voice acting, and the OP and ED are a musical marvel.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFlawless, one of the very strong stubborn aspects, the art and each character design is so unique to any other anime I could think of which is one of the main reasons for driving me to write this review. The characters and scenery are beautifully drawn and the OP pulls you in into the kizna world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the pros and yet again flaws of the show. We are given 6 blank canvases to watch how they develop or given back story on. Yet the anime turns up with very little information on each character (other than their \"dark secrets\"). And One character (Hisomu) is not developed at all, he's literally there for no reason, other than the one or two comedic scenes. He was a blank canvas and they could've given him an amazing backstory, instead they just allowed him in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe good aspects though were the characters which were developed and feel like they're \"complete\"\\n\r\n(such as Kotaru at the end of the show). I honestly loved how the show put together 7 completely incompatible and unique characters together, each character is memorable and everyone can find themselves in at least on of the characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBy overlooking some minor flaws in such a pristine anime makes this very enjoyable to watch. \\n\r\nWhat is also interesting is seeing the progression of putting these incompatible characters together and then the show experiments on their friendship and development through the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I certainly enjoyed about the series were the ships I would discuss with my fellow anime fans, that just makes it interesting, it's certainly a show you can watch with others, discussing which character you can closely relate to or which ship you prefer for each character. The story combined with the visuals certainly allow this anime to be enjoyed to a very high extent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\n+Visuals\\n\r\n+Sound/Voice Acting/OP and ED\\n\r\n+Original Story\\n\r\n+Character Development\\n\r\n+ Amazing Drama/Romance\\n\r\n+ Very enjoyable relaxing anime to watch\\n\r\n+ Unique Characters\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Somewhat Generic\\n\r\n- Lame Writing for Said Characters\\n\r\n- Background info missing\\n\r\n- Plot drops off\\n\r\n- Had more potential\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: \\n\r\nVery likeable anime, Generic although containing unique aspects.",

            "content": "\"One for all....All for victory.\"\r\nThis is a spoiler free review everyone! ^^\r\nEveryone had high spectations on kiznaiver and I did as well. Everyone was specting a Kill la Kill like-story. And that's not what we got at all. And honestly I am kinda glad trigger changed their shonen go-to perspective and try to innovate with this seinen directed story. \r\nWell then let's jump to full-on review!\r\nSTORY AND SETTINGS:\r\nThe story revolves around a group of students from the same class, all with different personalities, that are selected to participate in the project \"KIZUNA\" that it's a project to connect or bond with other individuals by sharingpain/wounds. The whole city they live in was just created for the purpose of this project, even though their citizens don't know.\\n\r\nIt's a pretty interesting concept, and even though trigger has had another animes about \"human interaction/connection\" this was a pretty fresh approach to that. They d set the purpose of the anime very clear since the beginning and that's an A+ for me. Since it's set aroud a very sci-fi looking setting, but a little bit more modern and \"today-looking.\" So we can see relatable characters interact with each other and kinda develop and grow at a same pace which is really nice. \\n\r\nI think the story is original and enjoyable. The only thing I have to complain' about it, would be the huge time they spent in explaining the love tiangles.\\n\\n\r\nART AND OST:\\n\r\nI think the artstyle/visuals took a huge role on this anime.  The colors, the shading, the backgrounds... could really tell you what was going on  in each scene. They artstyle was pretty clean and inviting. The animation is smooth looking.\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it is not epic or memorable but pretty likeable, since it's full of energy and techno infuses. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\r\nKiznaiver doesn't have those memorable, overheroic and sacrificial characters. Other tan that they just show teenagers with different and pretty clear personalities. One good thing that this anime did was it's characters. \\n\r\nBecause they clearly showed their strength and their weaknesses and balanced it out, this also made them interact with one another in different ways. They are all pretty exciting and heartwarming in differnet ways. Tenga will probably stay in my memory for a long time (haha).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nKiznaiver was not the best anime of the season, but it' close to my heart.\\n\r\nThe characters gave me a bit of tears, laughs and reminded me a lot of my own group of friends which was really important, and I think everyone could relate to it, becuase it touches a human weak spot that is realating to other human beings.\\n\r\nFor me this anime was a great methapor for \"Putting yourself in the shoes of the next person.\" And it teaches us that we can understand each other and what they feel, but we would never connect to at 100%.",

            "content": "Kiznaiver is a really unusual show. With it's unique art style and character driven story, it really stands out among other shows. Certainly, it does have some weak points like the really slow pacing and some things don't get properly explained, but I enjoyed it a lot.\r\nKiznaiver is an anime about pain and friendship. It's about being connected to each other and how to accept each other. The plot doesn't even matter that much, sometimes it seems like there is no plot at all, while the characters aimlessly mess around. So please: don't watch it only for the plot. \r\nIn my opinion, Kiznaivers strong pointsare the visuals (Studio Triggers art style is always a win) and the interesting characters who seem shallow at the beginning but develop into well-rounded and understandable leads. \\n\r\nThe music and the voice actors are also noteworthy. They manage to portray the emotions and personalities really well.\\n\r\nSo after all, if you like to watch character driven, friendship-themed anime with a bit of drama, then I'm happy to recommend this show to you.",

Sadly, the 2 last episode leave a sour taste in my mouth.\r\nLet's start with the good stuff out of the way...\r\nThe story's pretty great, playing around with the connection of friendship. It's a pretty great concept with a mix of \"TRIGGER\" magic actually makes a pretty decent and engaging story.\r\nArt, great. Not really surprised with the art style and it really makes watching it pretty nice. It somehow makes me fall in love with both the environment and characters.\r\nCharacter, lovable. Interestingback story. Amazing development of characters. Romance is a bit of a stretch, but still keeps you on edge.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the last 2 episode seems to make it went from 100 to HOLY SHIT DAFUQ YOU DOING SENPAI, PLEASE STOP real quick.

(maki has the best lines and nico is best girl, so pure and lovely)\\n\\n\r\nthe plot's ok. there were some raise-eyebrows-are-u-sure bits but there were also plenty hit-you-in-the-feels moments so they balance out i guess. i found the last ep a little bit lacking though (plotwise). not sure if it's just me but the plot lost me a little towards the end. i mean, it made enough sense but there wasn't that boom oh man this is darn good, that kinda thing.\\n\\n\r\nin general, it was enjoyable for me because i liked the characters and their banter, there were humourous moments, a few nice scenes that made me tear up a little and of course, some pretty intense parts as well. a lot of people have praised the art -- it looks easy on the eye and the colours are pretty, an added bonus. music goes well too. so yeah, give it a go.",

            "content": "\"Everyone wants to connect with someone else.\" - Sonozaki Noriko aka Norichan\r\n*Spoiler Free Review*\r\nKiznaiver is an anime that focuses on character development and the way they interact with each other. The story is quite simple, a group of seven persons with completely different traits are bound together by the Kizna Project and they become Kiznaivers. The Kizna project is very simple each one of the members shares the pain they receive as equal because of a wound that was inserted into each one of them. If you expect an anime about action packed scenes / and a very complex story. Then you might consider notwatching the anime. Now even if the anime focuses on relationships and characters this is not a excuse if it has a lack of a solid story, and in Kiznaiver this is not the case because even if its lacking in some aspects its still decent enough to catch your attention. They way Kiznaivers choose the seven characters is quite simple, each one of them has a quality known as \"the modern seven sins\", Although this part is not well explained, each of the chosen ones represent the so called theory of the modern sins. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story:  7/10\\n\r\nSo as my last paragraph just stated, this anime has a very unique story but it definitively could had been done way better. The idea it uses is based on the 7 sins, which are Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy and Pride. Most of them still apply on a daily basis but the anime decides to \"update\" them, as in modernize it. The characters apparently portray what is called the modern sins. Which ill talk later on the character section. So overall the story brings out an interesting idea which is the modern sins. I already explained the Kizna system, and the purpose which I forgot to mention is the Kizna system is made so everyone can understand each other and by that it could bring peace to the world since they would all feel the same way. Now the reasons of \"to save the world\" is very clitcheish so in that sense the story took a generic approach.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 8/10\\n\r\nSo, each member represents a sin, so the characters are all completely different. None of them share similar traits and they way they are portrayed are all over the top for the sake of exaggerating so called \"sins\". Now, this might backlash if the anime fails to demonstrate and explain each character and if by mid season you feel no connection to the cast then the show failed completely. One thing I realized is that most modern sins have no actual correlation with the original sins which kinda ruins the whole idea.\\n\\n\r\nKatsuhira Agata aka Kacchon:\\n\r\nHe is the main protagonist, He represents the modern sin of \"The Gudon\" (The Imbecile). He is a gloomy person who barely shows any affection to others. He has a special trait, which has nothing to do with his sin, which is that he cant feel pain at all. Since he cant feel pain, that makes him develop a cold personality and its shown that for him is really difficult to have friendly relationships with other because he lacks of personality. His cold personality later takes a big part of the Kizn Project. \\n\\n\r\nChidori Takashiro:\\n\r\nFemale protagonist, She represents the modern sin of \"Goody Two-Shoes\" which means that is a person who tries to be as good or clean as it can humanly be possible. She has a love interest for Kacchon and is shown since episode 1. She and Kacchon are childhood friends. Aside from her romantic feelings to Kacchon, she is just an over the top person who is very caring about others and often places his friends over herself.\\n\\n\r\nHajime Tenga:\\n\r\nhe is the \"Muscle-Headed Thug\" which is portrayed as the delinquent who always prefers to take the problems up front rather than run away. \\n\\n\r\nHonoka Maki:\\n\r\nShe is considered the \"High and Might\" sin, which means that is the person who believes she is over everyone and no one is at her level. \\n\\n\r\nTsuguhito Yuta:\\n\r\nHe is the \"The Cunning Normal\", Is the one who places alot of emphasis on the way he looks, and hate when someone does not recognize his appearance. \\n\\n\r\nNico Niiyama:\\n\r\nShe is the \"Eccentric Headcase\" She is like the comedic relief of the series, She energetic and positive, acts immature.\\n\\n\r\n Yoshiharu Hisomu:\\n\r\nThe \"Immoral\", He is the weirdo in the group, he has a similar personality as Nico, He is childish around her but acts mature when needed.\\n\\n\r\nSonozaki: \\n\r\nA emotionless, cold girl who is the leader of the Kizna System, and works as the host of the 7 protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening song is called, Lay Your Hands On Me and is done by the group BOOM BOOM SATELLITES. Its an amazing song, really catchy and takes the attention of the viewer really fast. As for the Ending song, called Hajimari no Sokudo by Sangatsu no Phantasia. Aside from the opening and ending, the soundtrack of Kiznaiver is not very memorable, Its mostly the opening that attracts the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nBased Trigger delivering, Each character has a unique way of looking, they are really distinguishable from one another. The backgrounds and overall scenery is really great and amazing. Its really different from your typical modern anime look.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: \\n\r\nI believe this is where my positive review comes from, Kiznaiver sets a goal and eventually completes it. The characters are likeable and completely unique in their own way. As a fan of drama, I personally loved the series and go as far to say its probably one of the best anime this season. While is far away from a masterpiece, I believe Kiznaiver delivers and is executed correctly. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for the lazy fucks out there:\\n\r\nTL;DR: The anime is has somewhat lack of good story, but its complemented by the good characters which is what the anime is mainly focused. By no means the story is bad, but it definitely could have improved in multiple ways. 8/10 as in is definitely good and ill recommend it. Its unique in its own way, and even tho the whole concept has already been done (Kokoro Connect), its not that similar.\\n\\n\r\nPlease give me feedback since this is one of my first reviews. Any type of feedback (good/negative) is heavily appreciated. Thank you!",

            "content": "I have to say, Kiznaiver is very unique just like most of Studio Trigger\u2019s shows. From the art style to the story and characters, all of it is so different and it is a breath of fresh air in the anime world. Although one thing to not about this series is that is not for everyone in my opinion. If you are one person who is looking for action here, you won\u2019t find it; it\u2019s just pain, sorrow, and a lot of drama and relationships. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nKiznaiver\u2019s story focuses around 6 teenagers who are abducted and have their pain connected to each other. They becometesters of the Kizna system which was trying to bring world peace. Now this story is just great overall. Trigger still is able to tell a unique story and have it be interesting for most of the time. Now it was a bit slow in the beginning episodes and it was kind of boring there but the latter episodes are probably some of the best I\u2019ve seen in a while. Although the story gets sort of confusing sometimes and some things may not make any sense, it is still a great story that focuses on the characters and their desires. The story itself excels at drama related moments and pulls them off so well. The problem other viewers may have with the story though is the melodrama of this story. There is a lot of it and it succeeds in pulling your heart. The show is mostly dialogue like the Monogatari Series with minimal fight scenes. It also includes some romance and that romance is good. I\u2019m honestly surprised that is not on the genre tags. Overall, if you enjoy you dialogue, melodrama, and romance, then this story will appeal to you. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tStudio Trigger yet again gives us a very interesting art style. Although some people may not like it, I personally love it. It\u2019s so refreshing to see it compared to the one used in most shows today. Everything is well animated and set piece design is just amazing. Everything is detailed and it is absolutely beautiful. I wish I could call this a masterpiece of art but Studio Ufotable has shown me that there is better art out there, especially with the Kara no Kyoukai series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\t\u201cLAY YOUR HANDS ON ME\u201d is a great Opening by BOOM BOOM SATELLITES. With great animation and unique song that isn\u2019t normally heard, it definitely makes for a memorable OP. The ending, \u201cHajimari no Sokudo\u201d by Sangatsu no Phantasia is also a great ending song that fits with the ending of the series. The OST is great and helps out a lot during the melodrama moments. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tKiznaiver presents us with some great characters. All of them are interesting in their own way and showed us great development over the course of the series. From the relationship development to the development of each character\u2019s personalities, traits, and feeling, I feel that Kiznaiver\u2019s writers should be commended for making such great characters. Their designs are all unique and the pain they experience is something that the writers tap into and expand on. Most of them are interesting from Katsuhira who cannot feel pain to Chidori who loves him, Sonozaki who is the mastermind behind the experiment, Niko the cute and adorable character that is like Mako for anybody who watched Kill la Kill, Tsuguhito, the guy who nobody really cares about, Tenga, the bully turned into more of a good guy, and finally Honoka, the one with probably one of the most tragic backstories in the series. As much as I want to continue on talking about the characters, I would venture into spoiler territory so you\u2019ll have to watch it if you want to find out but it is well worth it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\tI enjoyed watching Kiznaiver. Its uniqueness and being made by Studio Trigger really hooked me on at the start. It went down a path I didn\u2019t expect but it was well worth it as it made for a great series. The only main problem I have with the series was that I was sort of bored during the beginning part of the series and some things just didn\u2019t make too much sense to me but overall, it a good anime and I enjoyed it. \\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\n\tKiznaiver is a unique work from Trigger. It has an interesting story with great characters to compliment it. Trigger never fails to impress me with their art style and the sound was great. I enjoyed most of this series and it\u2019s definitely something I would recommend to someone. Although this series will not appeal to everyone, it\u2019s good to give is a shot. \\n\\n\r\nWatch if: \\n\r\n-\tLove drama shows such as Anohana or Nagi no Asukara\\n\r\n-\tLike to see a unique art style such as those found in Kill la Kill, or the many of the Shaft anime. \\n\r\n-\tWant lots of dialogue \\n\r\n-\tWant a unique story \\n\r\n-\tWant great characters\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t Watch if: \\n\r\n-\tYou are looking for action\\n\r\n-\tDo not like lots of dialogue\\n",

I created an account just to review it lol. The ending is awesome, and it has a very thoughtful message. I would definitely recommend this anime to everyone.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nIt's a fast pace story and with each episode, you learn something new about the characters. The plot itself is very interesting and the character's feelings are all very believable. This is a character-driven story, each episode or two centers around the \"missions\" given to them by the peopleconducting the kizuna experiment and how they choose to complete the missions. In the beginning, the missions ended happily, with positive results for the experiment; however, the experiments are getting more dangerous. They are forcing the characters to reveal things about themselves that they would rather not share, especially the painful things. In turn, the results turn out to be pretty disastrous.\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nAll the other reviews I have read pin the characters for just being their stereotypes, and I thought so too, originally. However, the more I watch, the more I see that they are all very human, and also very similar. They're very believable and their problems and fears are very relatable. Their development is great. \\n\r\nAr 10/10\\n\r\nAwesome eye candy haha\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting is amazing. I couldn't really catch on to much background sounds though, maybe because I couldn't hear it over the sound of how awesome Yuta is) The op and ed are awesome. \\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\n(Read first part)\\n\r\nOverall 9/10",

            "content": "Story 10/10\r\nIt's been a long time since I've seen an anime that I've been really connected to. I only started watching the series because I saw a gif on tumblr that looked cute and began watching the series (only to find that the gif was from the very last 3 minutes of the entire series lol). The story was very emotional and knew how to keep it's audience up close and personal with the characters. I felt like the ending kind of tied everything together.\r\nArt 10/10\r\nI mean aside from some weird looking mid-frames the characters in their posture alone had an energy about them. Tengafor example always had a presence like he was never static in a scene and when he did move he was expressive. The design of the characters themselves were fitting and unique, like nothing I'd ever seen in an anime before. I really loved the fluid movements and the use of colour in any given scene . Very well thought out from an artisitic standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, connected the audience on a deep level. Even during quiet scenes there was that element of anxiety that the series intended for you to get from the lack of sound, and excited, action filled scenes were always heart racing and the music kept up with it. The voice actors were very suitable and I especially like Katsuhira and Tenga's voice actors!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe villain could have had a better redemption arc. If anything that was the only flaw with the ending where they wrap it up like \"We're all fine now\" but the audience (or at the very least me) still couldn't really forgive the villain for what she did. And the purple theme character (his name escapes me right now) could have had a less uncomfortable signature trait. ASIDE FROM THAT the other characters were very enjoyable and I could relate to each of them personally and the struggles they were going through.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was never a dull moment with this anime and it was the same level of enjoyment the second time I watched it all the way through with my friend (who also loved the series). At the end of every episode I was always staying up to watch the next one because I just had to know what happened next!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGet a blanket, get some comfort drinks and settle in because if you are anything like me, you'll be hooked on the series from episode 1 and you wont be able to stop yourself from finishing it in one night! Hope you enjoy it!",

            "content": "Kiznaiver was a show that I immediately got into by the first episode. While others might have found the plot a bit too strange or the reasoning for this flimsy, I was able to suspend my disbelief and really get into the show. \r\nHowever... Despite this rather positive introduction, this show only received a 7/10. This is mainly because I felt like the series strayed too far later on. Let me elaborate:\r\nWhile I was watching the first 7 episodes, I was enjoying the show immensely and I was certain that if the show kept going like this then it'll get a 10/10 from me. Howeverepisode 8 onward seemed to take the show in a completely new direction which I felt only hurt the show. The main cast (with the exception of our main character Katsuhira) and even the main premise took a backseat to following a major side character (at least, I consider them a side character) and their backstory. I feel like this overall hurts the show as some of the main characters are really left under-explored (1 character especially).\\n\\n\r\nWhile the 2nd half wasn't bad, it definitely felt like the show peaks at episode 6/7 and only goes downward afterwards. However what is consistent is the beautiful art and animation! Most of the character's designs look great and the way they're animated gives each character their own flair as they move and interact with each other. Speaking of the characters, a lot of them are rather well done. There seems to be a lot of criticism towards the characters however while I do feel like Nico and Tenga were under-explored, I feel like (with the exception of 1 character) most of the main cast developed enough or had enough characterization that I was invested in them from the beginning, even Katsuhira while he came off as fundamentally uninteresting, which I feel is deliberate, he has this aura of mystery surrounding him as well as his interacts with others kept me interested in him from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do think the story taking a dive in the second half is the biggest issue the show had, I felt like there was another major issue in the form of Hisome. Hisome was a character with a lot of potential and I thought he was going to be one of the majorly explored characters especially with some of the hinting early on, however he ended up being the most under-developed character who just didn't seem to fit into the story and generally just came across like he shouldn't be in the show. I do feel like he had an occasional good scene or two, he did not have enough to justify his existence in this anime and I feel like it would have been really easy to do so.\\n\\n\r\nHowever despite this, I'm still giving the show a 7 which is a Strong 7 to a light 8 because I really did enjoy this show. Episode 1-7 are still 10/10 in my books and even though I felt the story dived afterwards, I still enjoyed the ride. The show is solid and at least deserves to be checked out but it could easily not be someone's cup of tea especially with the sheer amount of melodrama in this and not melodrama as a negative buzzword but melodrama has a genre which this is probably one of the best in terms of being a melodrama. If you're into that genre, you're likely to enjoy this show as well.",

            "content": "Alright, I love this series. I love how the fluff/drabble from the beginning of the series slowly transitioned to something deeper towards the end. I love the roller coaster of emotions towards the end and I like how it ended I guess. I'm just dissatisfied that there wasn't closure for some characters. The ending sorta reminded me of the ending of \"Charlotte\". \r\nThe art is absolutely amazing. The graphics were consistent and top notch through out the whole series and there never seemed to be any dull scenes. The scenery were all drawn to either compliment or intensify emotions being brought out by the scene.The music was outstanding as well. From the light hearted ones to the heavy depressing pieces, each complimenting the emotions being conveyed perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nBut even though I feel that way and I love this series (I really do), I still thought it was pretty bad. I was just so disappointed with how they managed the plot. Most of the mechanics of the Kizna System weren't explained enough and we still don't know what really happened \"12 years ago\". \\n\\n\r\nAlso they seemed to play around with character development too much, especially with Honoka. She just kept on going back and forth so her character development seemed a bit weird. And where the hell did the Nico ---> Tenga thing come from (Sorry if that counted as a spoiler, I just needed to point that out to prove a point.)? This is exactly why I think this series is also lacking in character development. It's understandable to focus on the main characters but simply letting character development fall off on other characters is a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nOver all, I really liked this series even if I was a bit disappointed. Trigger could have managed the story better and characters were okay, but could've used more work. I would recommend this series to anyone who is invested in drama and romance.",

            "content": "***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\r\nWith Studio Trigger gradually making a name for its self in the anime industry, I have come to respect their works. Kill La Kill was a visual and audio feast for the eyes and ears while Little Witch Academia was one of the most perfect short films I had ever seen. I was expecting a lot from Kiznaiver when I heard of its existence; did it live up to my hype?\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe plot (and how it is presented to the watchers) is one of the tools that a content creator has at their disposal for telling a compelling andcomplete story. Other things like audio and visual elements help the overall package of a movie/show but the plot is usually an important part of the puzzle. Kiznaiver unfortunately fell too close to the Kill La Kill camp when it came to its plot coherentness. It is obvious that Trigger wanted to make a character development driven show since the over-arching plot does a very poor job of connecting the dots. Why things happen and the \u201chow\u201d leading up to key events in this show are not really driven by plot elements; they are almost entirely character driven \u201cthrough the power of love/friendship\u201d (kind of like Interstellar). I really cannot give this part of the show any higher than 3/10 due to how the plot was presented. If the lack of story driven elements did not bother you in Kill La Kill then it won't bother you here.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9.8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are 3 great things about the animation in this show. The first was the background architecture and general visual aesthetics. This is a thing that when done really well it makes you really appreciate the creative minds behind the show. The buildings (and bridge), character clothes, and greenery were so amazing that each frame of animation could be a pretty decent background picture. It's obvious that they wanted to flaunt their stuff in this show; and they did. The second great visual thing Trigger accomplished in this show was something that was done really well in Kill La Kill; fluid scenes. The animation in general just flows really well in almost all situations. Fighting, walking, running, and standing conversation scenes just ooze with detail whether it is in motion or facial detail. The last great thing that this show flaunted was the character models. Yes some of the characters look like they were straight up ripped from other Trigger shows but they look great in this show too. The females were super cute and the males were believable. The voice support for each character helped make them more believable on screen but we will get to that in the sound part.\\n\\n\r\nAlso wanted to point out that the lighting (in all conditions) was amazing. Freaking amazing lighting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was an amazing visual performance from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't normally comment on the opening/ending songs but I have to give props to the opening song by Boom Boom Satellites. It somehow fits in perfectly with the vibe of the show; I cannot really describe it. Onto the audio elements actually in the show, one reason why I am rating this section so highly is because the performance from the voice actors is absolutely out of the park. Each character has an extremely well done performance behind the microphone. They just fit in so well; I really do not know how else to describe it. Music used during the show was pretty good and it fit in when needed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is what will make or break the show for a lot of watchers. If you do not like the cast after the first two episodes then you need to drop the show because the characters are the lifeblood of this show. There isn't a deep story being told in the background; it is literally the forming of the friendship between these strangers. I am rating this section so high because of how awesome the character interactions were in the entire show's running. It felt so tangible and fluid that I was honestly taken aback at first (especially since it is so good even early on in the first episode). Each character has a good amount of growth and towards the end you will start to either love or get pissed off at certain characters depending on who you are aligning with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.8/10\\n\\n\r\nI was worried that I was going to go too fanboyism on this review but after averaging all the components together, 7.8/10 feels just about right. The show did everything correct (even above and beyond on some elements) except falling flat on the \u201cdeep\u201d plot that I was hoping would be present. If you want an amazing character driven show about strangers becoming friends that also incorporates some of the best visual and audio elements then this is absolutely a show for you. Trigger is getting better and better so you better watch out. I honestly cannot wait for the newly announced Little Witch Academia TV series to come out. It is going to be so freaking lit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

The artwork is a delight to look at and the animation and some of the shots are downright gorgeous. The soundtrack is also marvelous.\r\nWhere Kiznaiver fails, however, is that it sets for itself lofty goals.\r\nKiznaiver tries to tell a character based story but doesn't have enough runtime to do so. To say that the pacing is breakneck is an understatement. Most of the characters remain underdeveloped, which is a crime. The show tries to take the audience high up in the sky, perhaps too close to the sun, but never really reachesthose lofty heights it aims for because of the limited number of episodes. This is one show I wish that the studio had taken more time to flesh out the narrative with. At least with 20+ episodes. Probably less than 30 would have made it an easy 10, but we never get to know the characters long enough and so any empathy and pathos doesn't really connect.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's going to be a large cast of characters and the episode count is low then I suppose that's just the natural outcome of the narrative is that it is going to receive a rushed job and the pacing is going to be wildly off. I get that writing can be difficult and most of the time writers would rather commit suicide than continue to put words to page, but there's really no excuse for being lazy. And that really is what the script is. Neat premise, though.\\n\\n",

In Kill la Kill they discussed feminism and societal corruption within capitalist systems, which they did wonderfully, and the story was obviously thoughtthrough very thoroughly, however this time with Kiznaiver they spoke of teens emotions, and  although all of the studio's members were obviously once teens, I don't think any of them ever experienced growing up with Autism, nor did they contact anyone who did to try and understand it better.\\n\r\nSOOOO the basic plot of Kiznaiver is seven students becoming connected in order to TEACH the characters Sonozaki Nori and Katsuhira about how to PROPERLY SHOW THEIR EMOTIONS AND INTERACT WITH OTHERS. Although the other characters don't share their emotions with others properly either, so the whole thing just becomes a learning experience for all of the teens on how to properly interact with others and deal with their sin. Yes they call it sin. Each character has something in their past that makes them act a certain way around others, that gets in the way of them properly interacting with others, and Trigger decided to call it that character's sin. So basically Trigger thinks that anything that gets in the way of people interacting with others must be something freaky in their past, that is JUST IN THEIR PAST, and that they should just GET OVER IT. \\n\\n\r\nOOOooh you were born DIFFERENT and sent to a lab to be lab rats. (AKA you were born AUTISTIC, kids from our generation did not get the proper treatment they deserved because adults didn't understand autism completely yet, and they still don't. So you were abused for your facial expressions as a child because they were different, until you just stopped showing emotion in public. SO WHAT? Oh its still concurrent, like anytime you accidentally show emotion in public, you look up to see someone near by that you either don't know, or is a classmate that you have to see everyday looking at you like there is and always will be something wrong with you that you can't fix?) GET OVER IT. And if you don't? well... You look like those vegetable kids that can't like think, in our opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOOOooh you were fat as a child! you still feel ugly and insecure about yourself, and act a certain way because you think it will make people like you better, oh... are we trying to get you to do the exact same thing by telling you you need to act more smiley and social and interact with others as if you were happy. GET OVER IT. And if you don't? well... those girlfriends of yours that you amuse with your speech and your charm, well... they like this other sexy kid better!\\n\\n\r\nOOOooh you wrote an artsy yuri-esque manga, in middle school. well... **** you! We're TRIGGER and we're super jealous because we could never come up with a story that would actually get serialized and published with out us having to run around begging for funds. And that friend of yours... Well... She's DEAD from some random disease that you don't have to be constantly in intensive care for since its not curable! GET OVER IT. And if you don't... Well your a YURI!\\n\\n\r\nOOOooh are you a meat head deliquent kid that skips class frequently and doesn't have any friends and so you get attached to MCs' easily, enough to break into their apartment and start to crush on their female friend. Well... your scared of dogs! not as tough now are we? not going to ever beat me up for my lunch money again are we? GET OVER IT. And if you don't... Well we're going to make you wear glasses and you're going to be one of those quirky characters that wears glasses despite being a stupid-head. \\n\\n\r\nOOOooh are you rich? enough to afford hair dye and loli styled insane outfits? Well... SCREW YOU! I bet you just wear those outfits to look MO-E~<3, for BOYS! GET OVER IT! And you know what? the boys still don't like you, YOU'RE ANNOYING!\\n\\n\r\nOOOooh are you the MC'S childhood female friend? OOOooh do all the boys like you? well... Not the one that you like! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Not going to GET OVER him are we? well we're going to make you an emotional sack of potatoes, and you're going to get mashed and explode every single episode!\\n\\n\r\nOOOooh are you an attractive delinquent kid that skips school completely everyday while we have to study? well... You're going to be a frycook later on! And you know what? I bet that you're not even out there having fun! I bet you're just a hikkikomori that masturbates all day at home! Well GET OVER IT! seriously you're even more unhealthy then those autistic kids. At least their not suicidal... and EMO!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kiznaiver wasn't a complete waste of time because of the animation and it's worth it's bit in humor as well , I just didn't like it too much, and I don't think anybody who was remotely similar to any of the characters at any point in their life would enjoy being made fun of in this way either.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's a whole new breed of a story and it goes perfectly with the art. \r\nThe art is colorful, flowing, and beautiful... the character designs are reminiscent of Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Tokyo) as well as one character has a striking resemblance to the Gurren Lagan older brother (forgive me for lack of name, it's been a while).\r\nAlong with Re: Zero and Boku no Hero Academia, THIS IS THE SHOW TO BE WATCHING!\r\nRegretfully, I've dropped quite a few other shows from this season thatI truly thought would be amazing.... HOWEVER, I knew from the moment I laid my eyes on the poster that this show would be absolutely incredible. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single episode is loaded with plot, story, and edge-of-your seat entertainment even though it's not even a typical thriller. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is so invigorating and, again, innovative, that it's truthfully something that should have been done a long time ago...\\n\\n\r\nThe music fits well with the story, but it's not Kabaneri/Attack on Titan/Aldnoah Zero memorable...\\n\\n\r\nAnd although the actual story and plot are something that hasn't been done (in any anime I've seen (and I've seen A LOT)... it's something on a much different scale.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS BELOW*\\n\\n\r\nSome might think that it is akin to mind reading, but this is completely different. Everything about the story and the people involved are absolutely incredible. Sharing pain to truly connect with someone at the core of their existence?

            "content": "The easy thing to do is say how much I liked the art and music and concept. It's easy to praise an anime this good that lacks magical girls, mecha and powered up transformations. I can easily say this is my second nominee for anime of the year. The hard part is explaining why it shouldn't win. Now before I get into that, let me reveal something here. This anime is a deconstruction of the stereotypical anime characters. That's why there's no clear villain, everyone takes their turn playing that role; with the other Kiznaivers playing the role of hero. And that's brilliant! It's areal thinking persons anime which I love though is the bane of others. The humor is well balanced and well placed. And fan service doesn't come into play. This seems like the perfect anime. I don't want to build suspense so let's dive in. \\n\r\nOne: \"The world will know true pain, and fear of that pain will put an end to war...It will lead the world to stability and peace.\" - Pain; Naruto. It's a increasingly annoying anime cliche now. It's like creators aren't reading works to the end to understand why \"the human instrumentality project\" is a bad ideal. \\n\r\nTwo: Sequel limbo. Do I want to see more of this? Is it a complete work? Is there more story to tell? I see room for more but is that what we want? One doesn't think this about top tier anime. I'd want to see more but more seems to water down the whole. And I wouldn't want to watch these characters endure stereotypical high school anime episodes. The beach, summer festival, valentine's day, some one's birthday etc. \\n\r\nThree: The end of heartache. So if it's not a sci fi adventure series it must be about unrequited love triangles. You know my least favorite thing in anime today. I won't spoil it here but I'll just say they had plenty of time to solve their problem. It just so high school.\\n\r\nFor the record my favorite character is Yoshiharu Hisomu and this is the primary reason why this otherwise great anime suffers from \"Beautiful, but not perfect syndrome.\" I don't want to spoil anything here but my fundamental understanding of this character took away from this series a bit. Needless to say he's the character needed to bring this situation to a close, that's why he's introduced last. Any earlier and he can solve this problem. Were he motivated to do so. That's what made him great his motivations. Conclusion, watch it unless you're a die hard action fan.",

It's not one of the best I've ever seen and doesn't really stand out, but it's consistent and fluid.\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nWords cannot describe how amazing the music is in this anime. Just listen to the opening song and you'll instantly be hooked. I could listen to the entire soundtrack of this anime for hours.\r\nCharacter: 10/10\r\nThey did an excellent job with all of the characters. This anime is a perfect example of how to develop your characters. Katsuhira was the best example. He started out as abland main character that you don't really care about. But as the story progresses, so does he as a character as he learns to accept pain and develop normal human emotions. Eventually, he becomes a main character that you can relate to and root for. Although I liked all of the characters because of their unique personalities and getting their time to shine, my favorite character was definitely Nico. She really inspired me in the ways she kept the group together despite the shit she took from Honoka about them having nothing in common. I also felt a connection between all of the characters and rooted for every relationship. I didn't have a specific favorite because I thought all of them were cute.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed everything about this anime, even the feels. That just made it so much better.\\n\r\nFinal score: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not really a fan of drama anime because of all the feels, but I definitely enjoyed this one. Definitely recommend it. One of the best drama anime I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Have you ever wanted to take another person's pain just to ease his/her pain a little? Well, this anime captured that situation. Close enough, at least. So let's get to why this anime was so good.\r\nAs usual, let's start with the plot: At first, I thought it'd be another anime with a normal protagonist meeting a girl and facing many obstacles. But I was wrong. It wasn't just focused on the MC, it was focused on all the characters. It was as if all 7 of them were main characters. Well, apart from Nico, but I'll get to that later. Usually, mixing genres would leadto disaster, but this one had a mix of Romance and Slice of life in it, despite its Sci-fi and Supernatural elements, which was blended together well. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the characters are what stood out to me the most. As stated before, it's like every one of them is the MC. And further character development only proved that. You may say that each of them are flanderized characters, but I digress. And with the help of the kizuna system, we actually see more to them than we expect. The only exception is Nico, who's basically there as a mascot. If it weren't for this flaw, I would've given this anime a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt is good, as expected from the ones who made Gurren Lagann. But it's also because of the art style that made me realize some of the characters look similar to their previous shows. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime wasn't bad, but not perfect. But as reviewers, it's our job to share our pain and feelings to everyone, just like the kizuna system. So, are you ready to be a kiznaiver?",

Personally, I was hooked with the series but not to the point that I would spent countless nights thinking theories and rants as I sleep. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI felt the plot was in the middle of a sci-fi/mystery/romance tug of war with a pinch of slice of life. I did get that theauthor wanted a solid plot for the series but I felt everything just went overflowing and was a bit strained or forced. I just wished the author went with a lighter and easier plot to digest for the audience because frankly, this anime really had a goo potential.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n10 OVER 10. ENOUGH SAID.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Enjoyment: 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI have no complains with the characters and I honestly did like them. I don't mind peeking through their loop holes because I find each character really easy to get a long with as you watch the series. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Kiznaiver? Yes... and 1/8 No.\\n\\n\r\nI was really expecting something with the last episode. Kiznaiver started real good and but I just felt that my expectations weren't met. Maybe because of the overwheming plot the author put in that made me pull  2 stars back from giving this series a 10. Or maybe my inner rage for the ships in the series (HAHA)? I just can't put it into words.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would still recommend Kiznaiver. If you want something fresh, good art (YES GOOD ART), and a mix of sci-fi/mystery/romance/slice of life going on. Just message me once you finished this series if you want someone to talk to haha, you'll get me soon! :)",

            "content": "If you enjoy the philosophy of the mind and the self, I think this anime is quite nice. Often times, I'm reminded of the beetle in the box by Wittgenstein. You can read it here: http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/oldsite/pom/pom_behaviourism_wittgenstein.htm\r\nIt represents the dilemma that we all share as human beings with minds. We can't know unless we communicate those feelings whether through language or facial expressions. By having the Kiznaiver experiment, it allows for them to feel the pain of others as well instead of having to understand it through another perspective..I feel this knowledge holds more truth because often times language cannot truly represent one's own emotion orfeelings such as pain. You can't truly know the pain unless you've experienced it yourself\\n\\n\r\nWhy is this? Because pain for one person is not the same for the other person. Another person may have a higher tolerance to pain than another. Notice how the main character,  Katsuhira, has no pain at all..cannot feel pain..cannot truly comprehend the pain that everyone around him is going through. Even for people who understand pain, emotional pain..mental pain..are even more difficult to describe versus physical pain..and those vary tremendously among each individual.\\n\\n\r\nSo in terms of story, I thought it was great in how it represented this. In terms of character, I thought it represented the many complexities that arrive when you try to understand another person's emotions and feelings. It started with physical pain and it led to more complex forms of pains such as emotional or mental which I think are the three main forms of pain.\\n\\n\r\nI probably did a terrible job in trying to describe this broad topic, but it really is a great philosophy. I really encourage people to read more into philosophy of mind and the many theories that are behind it. Even the crazy concepts like Descartes's dualism are great reads. I think this is what the main purpose of the series is about..understanding the limitations to communicating how you feel, but in the end, you don't have to truly understand pain to connect with someone. Despite not being able to truly know another person, you can still connect with them on a deeper level and that's the take-home of the ending of the series.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully this will help some of you understand what was going on.",

But more than that the series is so focused on character archetypes that comply with the plots endgame it neglects to make the characters seem realistic as people at all i.e. all the random love connections and how they're dealt with, so as a viewer I felt a complete disconnect to them. It had some interesting ideas, great art and sound but forme this and the flawed childish idealism at its core made it a bit unbearable.",

            "content": "I'll say this up front: Kiznaiver is essentially a collection of anime tropes, well-worn plot points and generic character archetypes. The thing is - that might be the point.\r\nStudio Trigger really pulled a fast one on me with Kiznaiver. Based on the premise, as well as Trigger's previous works (including Kill la Kill and Gurren Lagann (yes I know that's technically Gainax, but it's the same crew)), I had expected this to be a high-concept sci-fi romp with increasingly ludicrous scope and stakes as the show went on. The first episode did nothing to dissuade me of this belief, as we're introduced to a castof characters who, it seems, VERY INTENTIONALLY recall Trigger's previous hits (don't tell me that's not Kamina. That's definitely Kamina), who are bound together by some pseudo-science mumbo-jumbo so they share each others' pain, and apparently also gain superhuman resiliance. Sounds like a setup for a pretty good techno-dystopian adventure, right? Throw in a sinister organization with limitless resources apparently led by a stonefaced, long-haired high schooler, and I'm ready for Kill la Kill 2: More Clothes.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not what Kiznaiver is. What Kiznaiver IS is a high-concept slice-of-life in which a group of high schoolers are bound together by some pseudo-science mumbo-jumbo so they share each others' pain, and then we learn a lot about their feelings. There is still a sinister organization with limitless resources apparently led by a stonefaced, long-haired high schooler, but the show veers away from the insane stakes of Kill la Kill or TTGL and instead focuses nearly entirely on the bedeviled pain-sharers and their growing relationships. It's Kill la Kill 2: More Feels (and also More Clothes).\\n\\n\r\nI can't help but feel that Trigger played we viewers' expectations of their own work against us. The similarities between Sonozaki and Kill la Kill's Satsuki, for example, or Tenga and TTGL's Kamina are too strong to be mere coincidence. Even Niko is basically Mako with a bit of Nonon thrown in. The fact that this is \"only\" a slice-of-life show, albeit one with a sci-fi bent, seems to intentionally be a bit of a surprise, especially considering Trigger's body of work to date. They knew we would assume this was going somewhere crazy (possibly to the center of the galaxy, possibly to the planet of the life fibers), so instead they subverted our expectations by keeping things very intimate.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow, Kiznaiver manages to play to Studio Trigger's strengths while still being somewhat of a departure compared to their previous work. The animation is, it should go without saying at this point, gorgeous (this IS Trigger, after all), and the character designs are well-executed if extremely unoriginal (a bit more on that later). Through clever management of this limited cast and a reined-in storytelling style, Kiznaiver manages to tell a story that is at once personal and has far-reaching implications without getting lost in its own ambition. That alone is commendable, but doing that while also making the characters so darn likeable is impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe interesting thing about those characters is that every one of them is not much more than a classic anime archetype (with the notable exception of Hisomu) - you've got your gutless protagonist, the cute neighbor/friend, the meathead with a heart of gold, etc. etc. There's even an estranged childhood friend! Early in the show not-Satsuki even shows a little slide deck with each of the main characters and their archetypical nicknames. This shows that the use of generic character archetypes is completely intentional, and instead of detracting from the quality of the show, contributes to a metatextual theme.\\n\\n\r\nAnd make no mistake - Kiznaiver IS a metatextual show. In most slice-of-life shows, we watch a group of characters live, love and laugh with little or no \"greater\" conflict - and generally the characters are all close friends by the end (if they weren't already). Kiznaiver actually writes into the plot itself a REASON for why all these mismatched archetypes would even spend time together in the first place - not an after-school club, but a sinister science experiment that literally binds their feelings together. There are characters that manipulate the main characters' relationships - just like the writers of an anime. There's even a plotline about writing a manga that intertwines with the authors' real-life romance! If it were any more metatextual, it'd be FLCL. Kiznaiver is postmodern in its approach - this is a show ABOUT SoL anime - just like Trigger's other show this season, Uchuu Patrol Luluco, is a show ABOUT silly sci-fi adventures.\\n\\n\r\nBut all this high-falutin' literary trickery would just seem like masturbatory fluff if the show didn't also have a strong emotional throughline. Kiznaiver has a real heart, and I was moved quite strongly by the show several times. The characters are so well written that even though they're essentially tropes, you come to care about their relationships and the strength of their group friendship.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kiznaiver is an impressive little show with a mean postmodern literary bent and a liberal dose of feels. The animation, voice work and overall sound design are excellent, and while the plot isn't terribly deep, it's all pulled off with so much confidence and skill. Kiznaiver is very good - maybe just shy of the greatness Trigger's previous works achieved. This season, Studio Trigger boasted that they were going to \"save anime\" - if Kiznaiver is any indication, they might just be the heroes we need.",
