            "content": "When I first heard of Pupa it seemed rather interesting and worth looking forward to. Based on the horror manga with the same name, Pupa tells the story about two orphaned siblings who only have each other to rely on after severe domestic violence. However, one day they are both infected with the Pupa virus which turns the younger sister Yume into a grotesque man-eating monster while the older brother Utsutsu gains regenerative abilities.\r\nThis is, to put it bluntly, an exciting premise and Pupa appeared to have all the elements to make a memorable horror anime. While there had been mixed opinions from those whohad read the manga, I figured that at the very least it would make for an experience unlike any other in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I personally found to be noteworthy was how Pupa appeared to be the complete opposite of the recent brother and sister relationship trend in anime that often danced around incestuous undertones. Here we would instead have an older brother who had to sacrifice his own body to satisfy his little sister\u2019s cannibalistic hunger. Rather than a cheerful outlook it was cynical one full of dread and hopelessness.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, much like a cruel joke, it was the actual anime adaptation itself that became full of hopelessness. You see, Pupa was originally announced in early 2013 yet all buzz around it quickly faded due to a lack of news. Months passed and finally a vague air date was revealed: the fall anime season. Eventually the fall anime season approached, however Pupa was nowhere to be seen. The staff apologized for the delay and announced the series would instead air in the winter anime season 2014. At this point in time there were also some bad rumors floating around, mentioning how Pupa would be a short five-minute anime and not actually full-length.\\n\\n\r\nToday, we all know the result. Indeed, Pupa ended up only being a couple of minutes per episode. As you might understand, this is a format that makes the actual horror atmosphere a disservice. It is impossible to create a proper eerie atmosphere with such little time, especially if the story is to move forward in a reasonable manner. Speaking of the story, it is nothing but haphazardly told nonsense. It jumps from one event to the next with little to no explanation and ends in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nTo make the story even more difficult to follow, Pupa suffers from heavy censoring for no obvious reason. It is also incredibly inconsistent \u2013 sometimes censoring a mere knife while letting loads of guns pass \u2013 and often covers the whole screen with censor beams, effectively destroying what little that was left of the actual horror.\\n\\n\r\nExactly to who is Pupa aimed towards? Fans of the manga will be disappointed with this mess of an adaptation while anime viewers will be utterly confused. I cannot come up with any good explanation myself other than that this is the worst anime I have ever seen.",

            "content": "Let me be frank here: I love this show. It is horrible. It is absolutely appallingly horrible. I can't think of a single good quality it has. I think Pupa is hilarious. I usually don't like anime humor, but, wow, this is crazy. It's not THE worst anime I've ever seen, but, yeah, it is up there. I love it though, because it's really confusing and disgusting and so amazingly poorly made all at the exact same time, which is kind of the best combination. I try to get like everyone I meet to watch the episode thats literally nothing but the sister character eatingoff her brothers skin. I watched all of this show wide awake and stone cold sober and I have absolutely no idea what the over arching plot was about. And I really wanted to know what was happening because I was having a fabulous time and wanted to appreciate every second of glorious Pupa, but I don't think there is enough information in the anime to distinguish what the ongoing plot is about. Something about mad scientists? I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nBasically what I'm saying is you should really watch this show. Everyone on the planet should sit through this amazing trash fest. It really is the best kind of bad. It's so sexual and complicated and repulsive all in the most incredible way possible. What it feels like is that they wrote the anime to be full episodes and then they got shortened to four minute episodes and had to scrap almost all of the plot. I have no idea if that actually happened or not, but either way that's the level the writing and pacing is on. Even if they had gotten 20 minute episodes, this show would still be fucking atrocious though. It's like 50 layers of appalling. It's like someone put Elfen Lied in a blender, dumped it on the ground, slipped on it, vomited, and spent 45 minutes lying in the blended up Elfen Lied vomit while someone else accidentally records the whole thing on their flip phone.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I should mention the theme song, because, wow, it's like nine awful metal songs playing at once. God damn. This is my favorite bad anime. What a show. Pupa 4ever.",

            "content": "If there was ever an anime that screams \"most terrible anime of 2014\" then pupa will be known as the anime to fit this title. This was an anime that was supposed to premiere in the fall and it got a lot of hype for having a really interesting story based on the synopsis and being a psychological horror. Then bad news hits this series with about as much subtlety as a brick to the face. \r\nFirst, it went from being a 23 minute runtime per episode to about 4 minutes. Now with that in mind one would assume that they did this to preserveanimation quality. But this only works with comedy series where a 4 minute runtime isn't completely unreasonable. Because this is a show that's supposed to have a deep story and plot, there would need to be time dedicated to telling a backstory in this world and all the complexities it presents. By having the entirety of the series be the length of two episodes (48 minutes) of a normal anime, This would lead to extremely fast pacing and a story that will either never be explained properly or having the original story gutted for the sake of time with characters that will be left as boring and underdeveloped by the end of the series as they are right now in the beginning. With story elements aside people would at least think animation would be decent if the story is told terribly.\\n\\n\r\nThis sadly would be an assumption that most people would get wrong as this shows second biggest problem is the art and animation. The art is so crude and poorly drawn at times that it makes me wish to watch an anime series from the early 90's rather then this crap. Sure there are moments where the art is above average but only for mere seconds, nowhere near enough time to appreciate it. And during the first episodes' most climatic moments, it gets heavily censored with a giant horizontal black bar that is faded at the edges leaving the impact of the moment to be nonexistent. there are moments like these all throughout the series. The character designs are also really boring and bland, the only thing the main character of the show has is a scar or mark below his eye and aside from that he's your typical high school teenager who wants to make sure his sister is safe. \\n\\n\r\nSound is the best thing about the show but that's like having a broken hand and saying you like the index finger the most because it's the only thing that isn't completely screwed up. The opening is mediocre at best and the background music they use comes off more corny and cliche than creepy like it intends to be.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment? There is none.... None whatsoever for this series. If anyone reads this, do yourself a favor and watch literally ANYTHING (and I mean anything) but this garbage. I know there's an unspoken rule that you shouldn't judge an anime until you are at least three episodes in but I feel this one series in particular is the exception to the rule.\\n\\n\r\nThis series gets a 2 out of 10 on the whole solely because the opening music ranges from Meh to mediocre",

            "content": "Pupa is a symbolic story of an abused maiden, Yume, who upon entering puberty develops an abominable and perilous love for her older brother Utsutsu. Seemingly a series which only caters to those who are gratified by gore and incestuous lust, Pupa actually explores, more than most other \u201cimouto shows\u201d, the complexities of the tabooed love between siblings. \r\nPerhaps most importantly, understanding of the series\u2019 themes necessitates recognizing the circumstances surrounding the siblings\u2019 childhood, and the Freudian psychoanalyses which the author may well have been inspired by. Sigmund Freud pioneered the field of psychology during his time, and a significant portion of his revolutionary findingscan be summarized into the notion that powerful childhood experiences, even if the subject does not remember said experiences, can subconsciously and drastically affect the development of libido and bring about what is known in psychology as \u201csexual aberrations\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nYume and Utsutsu grew up with an abusive and sadistic father, their only solace lying in each other. Utsutsu seeks comfort from his sole purpose of defending his beloved sister, whereas Yume is soothed only by her brother\u2019s protecting arms. Yume is, metaphorically, a pupa containing the unnatural feelings imprinted into her subconscious during her childhood. Fast forward to puberty, and these feelings undergo a metamorphosis into a \u201cmonster\u201d, in this case her monstrous lust for her brother. Both Yume herself and her surroundings realize the abominable nature of her love, yet Utsutsu remains in complete denial as Yume\u2019s love has always been a natural and pivotal part of his life.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several factors which gives rise to this interpretation. Yume morphs into a monster in a set time-cycle, and requires feeding in this cycle. This is comparable to the menstruation cycle which initiates during puberty, and the cyclical inclination to sexual activities which arises from it. While this depiction is blatantly simplified and even sexist, it is not completely unjustified as a symbolic representation of an especially anomalous case. The infamous feeding sessions are, as many suspected, metaphors for sexual intercourse. Both parts are reluctant to this act; Yume is afraid of hurting his brother for her own selfish desires, while Utsutsu is unable to derive sexual enjoyment from intercourse with his sibling, hence his suffering during feeding. Yet, he is unable to leave his sister in misery, and Yume imminently succumbs to her lust. Interestingly, neither characters perceive the act as perverted or sexualized, further proving the psychological derangement of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs Yume and Utsutsu fall deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole, their conflicting feelings are depicted as outside forces which seek to interfere with their relations. Both are chained and tormented by unknown institutions, which they are eventually forced to confront and demolish. Perhaps they shatter the barrier erected by the morality of society, as symbolized by the slaughtering of the soldiers? Or do they overcome the innate biological repulsion toward incestuous acts, symbolized by the malign scientists? Yume\u2019s and Utsutsu\u2019s struggles with themselves as well as each other are undoubtedly convoluted, and Pupa provides an interesting and unconventional depiction of this strife. \\n\\n\r\nAny analysis above is only that of the writing and themes, and it is important to keep in mind that the anime is an adaptation by studio DEEN of the manga original. As is widely established, the animated Pupa\u2019s production values are certainly not top-notch. While the animations are completely inexcusable, I personally do not find the art or sound too terrible considering that most shorts are not visual spectacles. Though this is rather inconsequential in its evaluation. More importantly, the short length of the adaptation has simplified the story to the point that it scarcely contains anything beyond vital plot elements. Add to this the frequent interruption of the narrative and the pacing problems it imposes, it becomes rather difficult to form an emotional attachment to the characters or the story. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I do not think Pupa deserves all the ridicule and hatred that is being dished out. It provides a fascinating and unique symbolic illustration of the overused incest trope, complete with a hint of psychoanalysis that it deserves. Yet, when subjected to the magical touch of studio DEEN, it becomes a terrible series from every perspective other than the psychological.\\n",

That's right, the sophisticated, goose-bumping machine 'Pupa' is here, the most clever thriller since Monster and GitS.\\n\\n\r\nYou don't need a billion episodes. You don't even need twelve full episodes; 3 minutes of material in a span of 12 weeks is more than enough to realize the glorious masterpiece DEEN has given us. Lots of people complain that it's not long enough at all; \"They have their priorities straight with Sakura Trick\". Yuri lickers are disgusting, I mean who would want to see 12 episodes of two girls cuddling in bed? Pupa need not 20 minutes to develop a sense of agony, despair and suspense as its presentation and world-building pretty much exceeds in perhaps life itself. Pupa is that strong.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot follows the ultimate incest story revolving a brother and a sister. They find themselves alone. In life. In darkness. In the universe. And one day, Yume, the sister, finds a ever so strange and out of place butterfly. Perhaps because it was red. But nevertheless, the impact of seeing such a sophisticated and impacting butterfly contrived her to undergo an extraordinary yet unusual metamorphosis that implants her life in stake; a cannibal monster that eats humans. Her brother attempts to save her from the utter despair that bestowed on her, only to be stirred in unsettling situations, events and occurrences that gives his life a twist and turn of fate and mystery.\\n\\n\r\nSee how deep the synopsis is? And this is only the summery. It passes Evangelion of deep, and Utena of symbolism to the point where both seems like 4-piece puzzles. And from browsing the MAL forums (lol), a lot of responses to Pupa usually varies from \"dont get et\" to \"wat hapend :(\" and even \"FUCK YOU DEEN I HATE YOU WAAAAA BWAAAAA\". Of course, there are people who see this as exaggerate, and it's saddening to see how low MAL has dug their grave but only 200 people on MAL has seriously seen the light, including Rog.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the many strong components of this extraordinary story is the way they handle its incest commentary. Remember Ore no Imouto? Me neither. Pupa bubbles a series of questions in which involves the boundaries of crossing the line of incest. How far should you go in saving your sister? To the point of spilling your guts out and regenerating a cycle of pain, despair and hopelessness in order to satisfy your sister's stomach (and possibly pussy), while she faithfully repeats \"Onii-chan~\" about seven dozen times? The bond between their relationship is not of a typical 'i wuv you pls wug me' but instead exceeds with a bond so complicated yet fractured, corrupted while constructed all in their minds, that describing this makes my sentence wobble to the pont wear it aons't maek senasfo32?{'#$*()\\n\\n\r\nThe psychologicalness is relentlessly high in this sophisticated animation too. The writing offers so much in its concept and messes around how human nature behaves past the borderline of death, and beyond. The pain yet bittersweet comfort of seeing your sister in a monstrous form. The choice of suffering while helping another in order to avoid suffering. Abuse of inhuman abilities within society. Capturing happiness under the conditions of midget police forces and strange pregnant women who wants to capture you. Getting a boner when your sister with tight shorts eats your guts while lewdly touching you and saying 'onii-chan' in your earphone, as the audience reaches for those tissues and- and- and undergoing surgery due to sub-consciously cutting themselves for the trauma or the scarce the anime has caused them.\\n\\n\r\nPupa.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style references various infamous paintings and sculptures in the last 10 centuries. The paintings includes \"Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault - Anatomical Pieces\", in which has disembodied body parts which Pupa references from the cannibalism imagery blocked by stylish and symbolic shadows (some people call this censoring - ignore them). \"Odilon Redon - Smiling Spider\" is symbolized from Yume's character, in which she's seemingly a monster that can still earn happiness. \"Francisco Goya - Saturn Devouring His Son\"; back to face with the relationship of family, in this case brother and sister. \"Francis Bacon - Painting\" is something creepy but it has bacon, mmmm. But yeah, art is nic\\n\\n\r\nSound give s a creepy, unsettling y et unimaginably po werful at mosphere.

Thank DEEN for saving the medium that died long ago. Thank God, for the beginning of life that led our imagination and creativity to show impact and succession in our fullest potential in human nature. My review may not reach to convince enlightenment to those readers out there, but I hope you at least by mere curiousity to check the practically Jesus of story-telling.\\n\\n\r\nPupa is the anime we need; not the one we deserve.",

            "content": "HELLO and WELCOME to \"HOW TO RUIN AN ANIME 101\". In today's episode, let's discuss how to ruin an anime called \"pupa\".\r\nFirst off, let's delay the series for one whole line up! People are expecting something non-moe and unique to change the pace, no? That's why it's a GREAT idea to make them wait 3 more months! It will make them confused and wonder why?\r\nDone? Good. Next step is to shorten the length of the anime. 23 minutes? Pfff. 4 minutes is the hit! You say this is for gag animes only and not for deep anime? WELL WE DO NOT CARE  as ourgoal is to destroy the anime as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else is left? Let's put the plot so confusingly no one will get it and all it will be about is \"onii-chan, onii-chan\" and gore. PERFECT. Viola~ A perfectly ruined anime.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nNow that you heard out some kind of satyric joke attempt of me... let's get to the point.\\n\\n\r\npupa is the sole anime I would legitimately label \"trainwreck\" just because of how butchered it was. It is so bad yet I just can't stop watching it...just to see how bad it gets. \\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nIf my satyric joke hasn't hinted it to you yet, it's because of what was originally expected from the anime and what it became. I'm not even a type to give in to premises and expectations and rate anime low if they aren't met, but pupa is a dissapointment even with just having the basic ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was delayed for a season for the purpose of IMPROVING. If THIS is what I get for waiting a season, then I'd rather get each anime one season early so they're worsened to the better.When there's a delay, some nifty animation or sound is expected; however, there was no animation that was out of the ordinary; sound was good but I think it didn't need the necessity of one whole season either. If it was budget reasons, then Pupa should have waited a while longer before aiming for an anime, or should have indefinitely postponed the whole thing to make it look somewhat decent, even if not worth the wait\\n\\n\r\nMore than the delay, which can be so simply forgiven and tossed aside, the length of the episode turned out to be completely unsuitable to the genre. Pupa was probably supposed to be a deep anime with much thinking, peering inside the characters, more exciting moments... but ended up bringing in just the gore and the \"onii-chan\" as if to make the anime bad on purpose. I don't know what happened there at Studio DEEN but I'm not liking it at all.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe induced by the length, maybe not quite, the story is trimmed down just to the key-elements - in fact, I'm not sure if they even are key; and many of the matters miss an explanation in time. The characters remain anonymous from the inside, and become rather insignificant. The length doesn't provide enough depth to give any of the inside matters of the characters more than a mention. It's like a extended summary of osmething people might have seen, but it's something new...so it's unacceptable.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't see away for this to be anyhow enjoyable, apologies for those who do... Only if you like just gore, or watch it ironically with a group of friends that then go biting in some meat going \"onii-chan\" with squeaky voices.",

            "content": "People must be overreacting. There\u2019s no WAY Pupa is as bad as everybody says. There must be SOMETHING good about it\u2026 right?\r\nNow I\u2019m the type of person who whenever I hear about a show everybody says is bad I get this sudden urge where I have to watch it and see just how bad it really is. And before I started Pupa I sat down and said to myself \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t care what people say. There must be something good in this show and I\u2019m going to put my full effort into finding everything good in this anime! I\u2019m gonna find something to enjoy!\u201dSadly my strategy did not go as planned. After about a minute in, the show quickly turned into a disgusting, messed up gore fest. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen plenty of messed up shows and movies before that were still good! So if I just look past all the gore in this then I should still be able to enjoy Pupa for the story and characters!\u201d Well\u2026 That plan didn\u2019t work so well either.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is utter crap. So much so that I almost don\u2019t even know what the show was about other than Yume and her brother Utsutsu Hasegawa get infected with the \u201cpupa\u201d virus that turns Yume into a flesh-eating monster and gives Utsutsu the ability to regenerate from any damage no matter how severe. And because of this regeneration ability, he has to serve as her\u2026 food source. Pupa is 12 episodes and each episode is only 4 minutes long. So as you would probably expect from such a short show, the story is rushed. Very\u2026 VERY\u2026 rushed! The show is constantly jumping around from plot point to plot point with almost no connection between scenes. And apparently the writers also thought it would be a good idea to have practically every episode introduce a new major plot point that raises many big questions but then completely drop said plot point after the episode and never go back to it or bother to explain anything. \\n\\n\r\nDid I mention this show was messed up? Because holy crap is this show messed up and overflowing with disgusting gore! But not messed up in a good way like Higurashi but rather messed up in a way that just makes you think \u201cWTF am I watching?\u201d There are three cannibal scenes in this show that are all very graphic and one of them is literally an entire episode of just Yume eating her brother. Now this could have been a rather thrilling or creepy scene but they portrayed it in a sexual way and he seems to enjoy being eaten by his sister and all I can say to that is\u2026 \u201cWho gets turned on by this!?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHow could I describe the characters? Let me see uh\u2026 Flat. Boring. One-dimensional. Hollow. Bland. Idiotic. Unrelatable. Unrealistic. Unlikeable. And absolutely NO character development whatsoever! Honestly that\u2019s really all there is to it. I mean what can I say. The characters were TERRIBLE in every possible aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was also crap. Neither the intro nor the outro were anything special and the only track that stood out was the piano instrumental that they played whenever they showed Yume eating her brother and the only reason it stood out to me was because of how unfitting it was to the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in this show was\u2026 interesting\u2026 but I hesitate to call it \u201cgood\u201d Now I\u2019ve heard a lot of people complain about the censorship in this show. However I was lucky enough (and by that I mean unlucky) to see an uncensored version on YouTube in glorious 1080p and the art style was certainly graphic and\u2026 detailed (at least in the gore) so I\u2019ll give it that.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the verdict. Pupa is an abomination and as I mentioned before I tried to find good in this show. I really did. I spent the entire show desperately searching for even the tiniest thing besides the art style that I could call even halfway decent thinking \u201cCome on Pupa! Give me something good! Please! Anything I can praise! ANYTHING! AT! ALL!\u201d But as much as I tried to find good, every waking second of Pupa was complete and pure badness and I do not recommend this show to anyone unless you\u2019re like me and like to watch shows just to see how bad they are. Even if you\u2019re into this type of messed up gore there are still plenty of shows out there that are messed up and still have great stories and a cast that doesn\u2019t suck. Or even if you are into cannibalism then just go watch Silence of the Lambs or High School of the Dead or listen to the song Evil Food Eater Conchita. Anything! Is better! Than Pupa! I mean if you really want to see something that's messed up and still good then go watch A Clockwork Orange.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n",

            "content": "You ever feel that itch in the rims of your ass crack that happens when you don\u2019t wipe long enough? If there was ever an anime to signify that horrific itchy feeling in the most monstrous example of that region, Pupa would no doubt fit that description.\r\nNever has there been hype so decimated after a rocky development schedule, season after season. It will go down in the books of how not to screw up your production schedule or else it will come back and bite you and your credibility. People, such as I, were very curious to see what Pupa had to offer in thehorror genre in anime, because it\u2019s not often we get to see many horror themed anime come out these days. Then all of our expectations suddenly dropped when this was announced to only be three minutes long. Judging by how I viewed the 36 minutes of content through the whole show\u2019s run time, this was obviously something that was just not finished.\\n\\n\r\nWhy you may ask? Well, for starters, the art style looks inexcusably low-budget, even for three minute show standards. Hell, Ai Mai Mi looked like it had quality production compared to this. Especially the background artwork, where the colors look almost like an elementary school student painted it with a flimsy paintbrush. The designs of the characters are at least a little bit tolerable considering they do look like actual people in most cases.\\n\\n\r\nNow the animation part is where it gets really hilarious. There is one instance where an ambulance car is driving and you can tell, even from the crappiest quality stream imaginable, that the wheels are not moving whatsoever. Not only that, but it almost looked like the animator didn\u2019t bother to put any frames on any part of the car so it looks like he dragged it with the mouse. This is but only a few of some of the glorious hilarity that transpires from the lackluster animation. Unfortunately, it seemed the networks airing it felt embarrassed to bother showing the animation so they decide to censor almost 80% of it.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I don\u2019t discuss censorship in the shows I review, only because they\u2019ll eventually release the uncensored Blu Rays at a later time. But considering how universally panned this show is, I can\u2019t see this ever having that kind of royalty in the near future. It is often a cringe worthy experience to have to sit through censors in a horror anime that covers up the disgusting gore and blood, but with Pupa, the way they censored certain aspects felt really disjointed. For instance, there is one scene where Yume eats her brother\u2019s flesh and obviously they censored this out right. Then in another episode we are shown a room filled with dismembered bodies scattered in a hallway, badly drawn by the way, and yet it isn\u2019t censored in any way. Why? Was it because it wasn\u2019t in motion? Or was it that the animation was so horrible from Yume\u2019s flesh eating that they demanded that no one see it fully? Either way, it felt like an unnecessary decision.\\n\\n\r\nPupa\u2019s plot leaves a lot to be desired, and that is the understatement of this entire review. I would complain profusely about how unfocused the entire structure of it and how each episode does not feel connected to each other in the slightest. Reading these negatives might leave the impression that it is badly written, however, once you actually watch Pupa all the way through, it almost feels like an unfinished product. Almost as if they were originally going to go for a standard 23 minute episode show but somehow their work got corrupted halfway down the line. Considering they had to delay this for another season seems like the most logical reason for this.\\n\\n\r\nCould Pupa have been a great show had they been more careful with their development schedule? Who knows. That other reality is all but shrouded in mystery from our own and we may not ever see that happen. That is if they decide to remake the entire adaptation and make one that is more faithful to the source material. I would put this up as a grand cautionary tale for people who want to get into the business of TV production. Will this be considered one of the great classic bad anime alongside Mars of Destruction or considered an avant-garde masterpiece like Tsui no Sora by trolls? I would argue that the latter would be the most likely scenario, god help us.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\\n",

            "content": "Well .. where do I even start .. the thing is that there are anime so bad, that you actually find them good.. like Mars of destruction .. what i mean is that some anime are so bad but because of being so bad they are also funny. \r\nThis one, Pupa.. is so bad, that it is bad at being bad. Did you get that? \r\nOne sentence to resume the anime: Wtf just happened ? \r\n12 eps long, each one with 2 min lenght, i wasn\u00b4t expecting for something good .. but this? No this is the SHIT. Let's get started.. \r\nStory: 3/10. This shitmakes no sense, i mean plot holes, missing parts, stories left behind, anything that you can imagine. \\n\\n\r\nSome few examples.. \\n\\n\r\nYume, since she was born, she had a virus. Well that's okay .. so why the virus only awaked after 14 years or whatever her age is. She only turned into a monster after 14 years. \\n\\n\r\nHer brother, gets infected when Yume bites him. Surprisingly he gets the same powers so why he does not have to deal with the sister's problem (she only can eat humans in order to calm down the monster inside of her), is he special or something? \\n\\n\r\nShe was born with all her teeth, clearly normal doctors will find it really weird (it is theorically impossible to born with any kind of teeth). But fuck normality, here they didn\u00b4t gave 2 fucks about that. \\n\\n\r\nA secret team of scientists arrests Yume and her brother in order to investigate them. They knew what they were, but still there is no protection at all. They operate an monster with no precaution .. ofc they would get killed. \\n\\n\r\nThere is even more of this. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. Well at least something had to be good. Even though 60% of the show is composed by single frames and the background is almost non-existant, the gore is well made and i actually enjoyed it. WATCH THE UNCENSORED VERSION.. the censured version the only thing that you see, is a black screen. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10. The opening is acceptable. But the OST .. wow .. you gotta watch the 6th episode with censure. The tracks that they use to ease the anime are so pathetic .. just .. really bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10. Well .. what characters? I just didn\u00b4t gave 1/10 because we do have a background story not so bad. The characters are at least pathetic. Their reactions, their emotions.. Yume basically says \"Oni-chan\" throughout the entire show, and her borther only says \"Yume\", that's all i know about them.. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10. Bad .. really bad. The last episode I was literally with my mouth opened because I just couldn\u00b4t understand what i was watching. The overall anime just looks pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10. Well, this anime is really bad for sure. But .. i reccomend it. Why you ask? Because i defend that we have to give a chance to great anime , the top anime and also the worst anime out there.. we have to taste the great and the bad, in order to really know what is good and bad by contrast. By doing that i think we can get our judgment more accurate. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is that everyone who calls themselves \"anime watcher\" should have the worst anime on their lists ..",

            "content": "\"Onii-chan, you're delicious.\" ~ Yume\r\nPupa, otherwise known as Onii-chan the anime, is a so-called \"anime\" which I first stumbled upon in the review section on MAL. It caught my attention when I saw the low scores it got. I thought to myself \"It can't be that bad.... Right?\"\r\nI could not have been more mistaken.\r\nPupa's story revolves around the brother-sister relationship of Utsutsu and Yume. Two orphaned siblings who have to support each other to live on. That is, until a deadly disease dubbed- \"Pupa\" infects Yume (much like the way this show infected the anime community, ironically). This new disease causes Yume to have ainsatiable hunger for humans. And the first person she eats, is none other than her brother, who comes back to life after being infected as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a surprisingly decent premise, which promises a decent anime of the horror genre. Unfortunately, that was the only positive part of this entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the laundry list of flaws.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the premise of the story is good, the actual story is rushed to an unimaginable level. This is mainly due to the fact that each episode is no-more than 5 minutes long, yes, only 5 minutes per episode. It's plainly visible why the story is so rushed. It is impossible for the writers or anyone to explain the story to the viewer when every episode has a maximum of 4 minutes of actual story, the rest being OP and ED times.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the writers, the script of the show is the most unintentionally hilarious thing you can imagine. The script for every episode contains at least two lines of Yume saying - \"Onii-chan\" in the most incestuous way possible. This failure of scriptwriting can easily be found in the infamous episode 6. The entire 4 minutes, it shows Yume, eating her brother, and saying Onii-chan, OVER, AND OVER AGAIN. For the entire episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the technical department of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as each episode is so short, you would expect every episode to have at least tolerable animation. But no, of course not, life isn't fair. Even the animation is a victim to the lazy disease that seems to have affected everybody involved in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the show is tolerable. The opening isn't half bad, and considering the size of each episode, the music isn't terrible either. But unfortunately, the disgusting lack of talent that went into the voices of the characters is what drags the score down. It's probably not the fault of the Voice actors that the characters suck, more so the writers faults for giving them such shitty lines to read.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I've got nothing to say. None of the characters go through any kind of development, and how could they when every episode is only 5 minutes long?! If I had to say anything about the characters it's that Yume and her \"Onii-chan\" are two of the worst characters anime has seen.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, I'd suggest this anime to everyone. It needs to be seen by all, as an example of how to not make an anime. Who knows, you might even enjoy it, although I highly doubt it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+...Uhhh... Good incest ?\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Short episodes\\n\r\n-Hurl-Inducing art and sound\\n\r\n-Inexcusable scriptwriting\\n\r\n-Terrible characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do those Cons spell? SHIT.",

            "content": "Ah, infamous anime, my favorite. I recently had the pleasure to experience Pupa. Scratch that, because it wasn't a pleasure at all, it was a nightmare.\r\nWhen i first heard of this anime i thought it wouldn't be so bad, since the horror genre in anime is usually quite the enjoyment. I was wrong on so many levels.\r\nStory: 1\r\nVery little development. It was hard to follow. Useless dialogue. I mean who need dialogue anyways? We can just have an episode of pure \"onii-chan... onii-chan..\" I mean the episodes aren't too long. 4 minutes in fact. Minus of course the time of the OP and ED totalingin 3 minute episodes. Yes the creators still had the nerve to include the OP and ED in every single episode! I still have no clue what the story was about. The only episode I enjoyed story wise was the last episode. In fact if the series was like the last episode I wouldn't mind at all\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nI actually liked the art, although it could have been way better. Imagine very little movement, and sometimes the voices being out of sync with the lips of the characters. At Least we got some nice animated violence right? let me touch up on that. THE CENSORSHIP WAS HORRIBLE. It was weird how they would censor out some things like a guy pulling out a knife but then they would show some guy getting his eyes plucked out. I'm not sure why even censor anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3:\\n\r\nThere wasn't much sound, thats why there is such a low rating. It would be a 1 if it wasn't for the music. Not much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nNo development. Characters were all pretty typical, and the ones that seemed interesting had very little on screen time. It was a cliche older brother who loves his sister and little sister who depends on her older brother. It got old, quick. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nThere was no time to enjoy, like i said before. The episodes were so short, and confusing, it was hard to digest. It was supposed to be scary but i found myself laughing at times wondering \"what in the world am i even watching.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1 \\n\r\nMaybe I am missing something big. Some sort of physiological message is supposed to be embedded in my mind now or something. Maybe I am too young to understand something like this. Perhaps one day in my dying bed I will remember \"Pupa\" and figure out that \"Pupa\" infact told me the meaning of life, and i just now understood it. We will see, I'll keep you guys updated if i figure out something. I don't know. This is all personal opinion, It was a waste of time. But the hour of viewing time went by so fast, I didn't even feel time move.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have a spare hour and want to experience the wonders of Pupa, by all means go ahead.\\n\\n\r\nWill I ever want to experience Pupa again? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\nAny feedback is much appreciated on this review. I am a total noob at reviews, I am seeking to become much better.\\n",

            "content": "There's Mars of Destruction and there's Pupa. I remember hearing about Pupa when the project was starting, and I remember the disappointment when hearing it was going to be shortened to four-minute episodes. The show looked vaguely interesting and I assumed that it was going to be shortened because the content was going to be so severe, possibly having some of the most messed up scenes in anime. However, that isn't quite what we have here, and one's feelings to the shortening of the series might suddenly make more sense upon watching it. If I had to guess why it was shortened to such anextent, I would guess the reasoning is because Pupa is pretty bad. People misuse the term \"edgy\" all the time, but Pupa is one of those anime that reminds us that there is still use for the word.\\n\\n\r\nPupa gave people the impression that it would be one of the most brutal and gory anime around, but it would be a lie to say it met that marker. When the show was decidedly shortened, it also felt as though the budget itself was dropped for funding each minute of screen-time. The animation, at its best moments, is just about average for anime series back in the 2000's. The art style (not the style the characters are drawn in terms of line-work, but the actual art style of shading and the color scheme) doesn't have character and just feels cheaply made. There are many moments where the animation will look a bit shoddy. The \"gory\" moments are where the animation is at its best, and this usually involves our beloved imouto eating human flesh. Is an imouto eating a handful of opaque, purple goo considered gory? If not, that is basically the goriness of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the series is average, and most of the music tracks will likely not be too memorable. However, the opening song is very catchy and Pupa should be given a thumbs-up for that. The ending song is also alright, but for the type of song it is, a shortened version doesn't do it justice. The music itself carries electronics with drumbeats to it, along with some piano. The music serves its basic purpose to the series, but rarely sounds good enough to the level of pulling the viewer in. Switching to the sound effects, Pupa fails to an extent. There are many times where a scene will be almost silent and the only sound playing will be the character's voice. In those moments, the atmosphere will feel very plain. Pupa tries to hide this by playing a light soundtrack song to cover up the silence, but the songs being so light most of the time makes this phenomenon still noticeable. In terms of audio and sound, Pupa stays around an average level.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Pupa is about a monster needing to maintain its cannibalistic desires, and the spread of this monster's disease. That will lead to some light gore of cannibalistic behavior, and some other disturbing scenes of people trying to stop the monster. By the end, none of this is explained in the smallest detail and what I state is where that plot element stays throughout. What also doesn't develop is the characters. The main, sibling characters barely develop in their relationship, even though it's basically all they talk about the entire time. No character here is sensible, and the character roster relies heavily on tropes and archetypes. The story is very simple with flat characters and, even though its elements don't even attempt to become understood, another issue rises with the series' closure. The ending of Pupa is entirely unsatisfying and doesn't give closure to any of its characters or any information to its basic, plot elements. The story also ends in a very unfinished state from what it considers to be a reasonable ending. The main characters get out of a dilemma and escape for a brief moment, but for some reason they choose to end it there. The ending shifts the stories focus to the sibling's understanding of their love (not to incest level) for one-another, which they seemed to already know long before these series of events even started.\\n\\n\r\nPupa tells a story that allows the creators to fill it with gore to be disturbing, but without even the attempt of explaining the elements that allow the gore in the first place, making it all feel forced and as if it was the only selling point of the series. Also, with the lacking budget in place, not even the gore is carried out well enough to be worth watching for that alone. The animation is average, and there are many moments with barely any animation whatsoever, even with this series only totaling to thirty-seven minutes in length. The art style is basic and feels incomplete for the type of style it wanted to represent. The music serves its place, but the lacking sound effects can make entire scenes feel incomplete with moments of literally no sound effects whatsoever. The characters are plain archetypes with some carrying inscribed symbols on their faces for an aspect of uniqueness, but that only makes their roles feel even more plain as you stare at their out-of-place tattoos that give them the extent of their uniqueness. No character goes beyond their archetype and there are even moments of pure stupidity, like a soldier calling out the lost torso of his ally's legs. Those moments go laughably near the level of Mars of Destruction. Yet, one plus Mars of Destruction has over this series is that it's half as long, and its elements were so conventional that it could all be considered stupid fun. Pupa's elements aren't compatible with fun, but only with the inclusion of gore. Without a proper disclosure as to why it's that way: Pupa feels plain, desperate, and self-conscious as one of those anime that deserves to be labeled with the term \"edgy\". Should one watch Mars of Destruction or Pupa? Mars of Destruction, if imoutos aren't all that.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're in dire need of a Pupa viewing, watch this Pupa instead: http://vimeo.com/96882171",

Wait, what story? I mean, yeah, the plot exists, but what can be expected from a 4 minute episode where the opening and the ending represent half of the time? Nothing. The action is so rushed that you barely understand a thing, especially when there are also flashbacks. I didn't read the manga (although I was recommended to) so I had no idea what this anime was about, and after I finishedit, I still have no idea what this is all about. \\n\\n\r\nArt is meh. Nothing special. I could say that the gore parts are not that horrible and the characters have a decent look but this is really not important relative to the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: awful.\\n\r\nUtsutsu and Yume have this well-known brother-sister relationship where the big brother would do anything for his lil sister. He even lets her eat his flesh which is way too awkward, especially when Yume is rather happy and doesn't see any problem in eating her brother. Oh..those family bonds..\\n\r\nAgain, the episodes are so short that we can't see any development of the characters, just one episode (or 2) dedicated to their past so we learn a bunch of useless and incomprehensible things. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: NO\\n\r\nWhat should I enjoy about this? I remember this episode when, for 2 minutes, I had to watch Yume eating his brother while saying \"Onii-chan\". It was pathetic. I like gore animes but this one, even if it is some kind of gore, is a joke! Basically, there is no point in watching this anime. I saw about 10,000 people planning to watch it. DON\"T. It's a total waste of time and there are lots of good animes out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rated 1. I would've rated it 0 if I could. Seriously.",

What do you do?\r\nA: Attempt to Kill her\r\nB: Flee\r\nC: Allow her to eat you since you suddenly have the power to regenerate.\r\nIf you answered C then you're right! If you have no clue what on Earth I am talking about then consider yourself lucky that you haven't seen this anime before. With the previous OVAs I have reviewed you COULD argue in their defence that the reason why they were so bad was on account of their age and that they were made at a time in which Japan was going through aneconomic crisis. This still doesn't make the OVAs I've talked about any good but at least it can act as an excuse when defending them. Pupa has no such excuse since it was made only two years ago and to this day remains one of the worst anime ever created.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this show when it was initially airing and I was even more confused, disgusted and appalled by each passing episode. Not a single part of the anime makes a bit of sense and the character development and narrative is the most nonsensical thing I have ever witnessed. It's about two siblings who were beaten as children and as a result grew a rather intimate relationship with one another. While walking one day in the park the sister turns into a monster for NO REASON and devours and rips apart people that happen to be in close proximity. The anime hints at the sister's sudden transformation being a result of something called the 'Pupa' but it's never explained to us in the slightest and feels like such a lazy way to explain this event that it comes across as being forced. The brother, upon seeing the massacre his sister has inflicted upon these poor innocent people still sees this beast as his own sister and not some disgusting monstrosity. He opens up his arms to embrace his monster-sister (which sounds like I'm referencing Monster Musume or something when I think about it) but the sister ends up killing the brother instead. But don't worry! The brother somehow has the power of immortality and no matter what damage is inflicted upon him, he will regenerate! From that point on the sister fills her appetite by feasting on her brother's back while the show tries to present these scenes as being sexual complete with awkward moaning and the repeating the lines \"Oni-chan\" every second.\\n\\n\r\nIf that plot synopsis sounded absolutely insane that's because it is! The anime is only four minutes in length and does a terrible job at developing its characters or just telling a simple coherent story. There is another plot that runs aside the one I just mentioned in which some generic organisation are researching the pupa...or something. They never make it clear what their purpose was in the slightest! So the plot is horrible and the characters are terrible. The animation is just as bad! It's so uninspired and dull to the eyes! There is a lot of blood-shed and the such which was heavily censored while it was airing so for people like me who watched this trash two years back we were just essentially watching a black screen. The only thing I found that was okay the opening which is only thirty seconds long and is more interesting than the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the very definition of awful. It has nothing. It's an empty shell with no ideas and a plot so disgusting that I want to kill myself. There is nothing to laugh at either since everything in the show is so terrible. Stay away from this one. If you're really curious then just watch the Onii-chan eating scene. Anymore will kill you.\\n\\n\r\n(Part of LIQfilms 12 Days of Christmas - Day 7)",

            "content": "When I first heard of Pupa it seemed rather interesting and worth looking forward to. Based on the horror manga with the same name, Pupa tells the story about two orphaned siblings who only have each other to rely on after severe domestic violence. However, one day they are both infected with the Pupa virus which turns the younger sister Yume into a grotesque man-eating monster while the older brother Utsutsu gains regenerative abilities.\r\nThis is, to put it bluntly, an exciting premise and Pupa appeared to have all the elements to make a memorable horror anime. While there had been mixed opinions from those whohad read the manga, I figured that at the very least it would make for an experience unlike any other in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I personally found to be noteworthy was how Pupa appeared to be the complete opposite of the recent brother and sister relationship trend in anime that often danced around incestuous undertones. Here we would instead have an older brother who had to sacrifice his own body to satisfy his little sister\u2019s cannibalistic hunger. Rather than a cheerful outlook it was cynical one full of dread and hopelessness.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, much like a cruel joke, it was the actual anime adaptation itself that became full of hopelessness. You see, Pupa was originally announced in early 2013 yet all buzz around it quickly faded due to a lack of news. Months passed and finally a vague air date was revealed: the fall anime season. Eventually the fall anime season approached, however Pupa was nowhere to be seen. The staff apologized for the delay and announced the series would instead air in the winter anime season 2014. At this point in time there were also some bad rumors floating around, mentioning how Pupa would be a short five-minute anime and not actually full-length.\\n\\n\r\nToday, we all know the result. Indeed, Pupa ended up only being a couple of minutes per episode. As you might understand, this is a format that makes the actual horror atmosphere a disservice. It is impossible to create a proper eerie atmosphere with such little time, especially if the story is to move forward in a reasonable manner. Speaking of the story, it is nothing but haphazardly told nonsense. It jumps from one event to the next with little to no explanation and ends in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nTo make the story even more difficult to follow, Pupa suffers from heavy censoring for no obvious reason. It is also incredibly inconsistent \u2013 sometimes censoring a mere knife while letting loads of guns pass \u2013 and often covers the whole screen with censor beams, effectively destroying what little that was left of the actual horror.\\n\\n\r\nExactly to who is Pupa aimed towards? Fans of the manga will be disappointed with this mess of an adaptation while anime viewers will be utterly confused. I cannot come up with any good explanation myself other than that this is the worst anime I have ever seen.",

            "content": "Let me be frank here: I love this show. It is horrible. It is absolutely appallingly horrible. I can't think of a single good quality it has. I think Pupa is hilarious. I usually don't like anime humor, but, wow, this is crazy. It's not THE worst anime I've ever seen, but, yeah, it is up there. I love it though, because it's really confusing and disgusting and so amazingly poorly made all at the exact same time, which is kind of the best combination. I try to get like everyone I meet to watch the episode thats literally nothing but the sister character eatingoff her brothers skin. I watched all of this show wide awake and stone cold sober and I have absolutely no idea what the over arching plot was about. And I really wanted to know what was happening because I was having a fabulous time and wanted to appreciate every second of glorious Pupa, but I don't think there is enough information in the anime to distinguish what the ongoing plot is about. Something about mad scientists? I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nBasically what I'm saying is you should really watch this show. Everyone on the planet should sit through this amazing trash fest. It really is the best kind of bad. It's so sexual and complicated and repulsive all in the most incredible way possible. What it feels like is that they wrote the anime to be full episodes and then they got shortened to four minute episodes and had to scrap almost all of the plot. I have no idea if that actually happened or not, but either way that's the level the writing and pacing is on. Even if they had gotten 20 minute episodes, this show would still be fucking atrocious though. It's like 50 layers of appalling. It's like someone put Elfen Lied in a blender, dumped it on the ground, slipped on it, vomited, and spent 45 minutes lying in the blended up Elfen Lied vomit while someone else accidentally records the whole thing on their flip phone.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I should mention the theme song, because, wow, it's like nine awful metal songs playing at once. God damn. This is my favorite bad anime. What a show. Pupa 4ever.",

            "content": "If there was ever an anime that screams \"most terrible anime of 2014\" then pupa will be known as the anime to fit this title. This was an anime that was supposed to premiere in the fall and it got a lot of hype for having a really interesting story based on the synopsis and being a psychological horror. Then bad news hits this series with about as much subtlety as a brick to the face. \r\nFirst, it went from being a 23 minute runtime per episode to about 4 minutes. Now with that in mind one would assume that they did this to preserveanimation quality. But this only works with comedy series where a 4 minute runtime isn't completely unreasonable. Because this is a show that's supposed to have a deep story and plot, there would need to be time dedicated to telling a backstory in this world and all the complexities it presents. By having the entirety of the series be the length of two episodes (48 minutes) of a normal anime, This would lead to extremely fast pacing and a story that will either never be explained properly or having the original story gutted for the sake of time with characters that will be left as boring and underdeveloped by the end of the series as they are right now in the beginning. With story elements aside people would at least think animation would be decent if the story is told terribly.\\n\\n\r\nThis sadly would be an assumption that most people would get wrong as this shows second biggest problem is the art and animation. The art is so crude and poorly drawn at times that it makes me wish to watch an anime series from the early 90's rather then this crap. Sure there are moments where the art is above average but only for mere seconds, nowhere near enough time to appreciate it. And during the first episodes' most climatic moments, it gets heavily censored with a giant horizontal black bar that is faded at the edges leaving the impact of the moment to be nonexistent. there are moments like these all throughout the series. The character designs are also really boring and bland, the only thing the main character of the show has is a scar or mark below his eye and aside from that he's your typical high school teenager who wants to make sure his sister is safe. \\n\\n\r\nSound is the best thing about the show but that's like having a broken hand and saying you like the index finger the most because it's the only thing that isn't completely screwed up. The opening is mediocre at best and the background music they use comes off more corny and cliche than creepy like it intends to be.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment? There is none.... None whatsoever for this series. If anyone reads this, do yourself a favor and watch literally ANYTHING (and I mean anything) but this garbage. I know there's an unspoken rule that you shouldn't judge an anime until you are at least three episodes in but I feel this one series in particular is the exception to the rule.\\n\\n\r\nThis series gets a 2 out of 10 on the whole solely because the opening music ranges from Meh to mediocre",

            "content": "Pupa is a symbolic story of an abused maiden, Yume, who upon entering puberty develops an abominable and perilous love for her older brother Utsutsu. Seemingly a series which only caters to those who are gratified by gore and incestuous lust, Pupa actually explores, more than most other \u201cimouto shows\u201d, the complexities of the tabooed love between siblings. \r\nPerhaps most importantly, understanding of the series\u2019 themes necessitates recognizing the circumstances surrounding the siblings\u2019 childhood, and the Freudian psychoanalyses which the author may well have been inspired by. Sigmund Freud pioneered the field of psychology during his time, and a significant portion of his revolutionary findingscan be summarized into the notion that powerful childhood experiences, even if the subject does not remember said experiences, can subconsciously and drastically affect the development of libido and bring about what is known in psychology as \u201csexual aberrations\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nYume and Utsutsu grew up with an abusive and sadistic father, their only solace lying in each other. Utsutsu seeks comfort from his sole purpose of defending his beloved sister, whereas Yume is soothed only by her brother\u2019s protecting arms. Yume is, metaphorically, a pupa containing the unnatural feelings imprinted into her subconscious during her childhood. Fast forward to puberty, and these feelings undergo a metamorphosis into a \u201cmonster\u201d, in this case her monstrous lust for her brother. Both Yume herself and her surroundings realize the abominable nature of her love, yet Utsutsu remains in complete denial as Yume\u2019s love has always been a natural and pivotal part of his life.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several factors which gives rise to this interpretation. Yume morphs into a monster in a set time-cycle, and requires feeding in this cycle. This is comparable to the menstruation cycle which initiates during puberty, and the cyclical inclination to sexual activities which arises from it. While this depiction is blatantly simplified and even sexist, it is not completely unjustified as a symbolic representation of an especially anomalous case. The infamous feeding sessions are, as many suspected, metaphors for sexual intercourse. Both parts are reluctant to this act; Yume is afraid of hurting his brother for her own selfish desires, while Utsutsu is unable to derive sexual enjoyment from intercourse with his sibling, hence his suffering during feeding. Yet, he is unable to leave his sister in misery, and Yume imminently succumbs to her lust. Interestingly, neither characters perceive the act as perverted or sexualized, further proving the psychological derangement of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs Yume and Utsutsu fall deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole, their conflicting feelings are depicted as outside forces which seek to interfere with their relations. Both are chained and tormented by unknown institutions, which they are eventually forced to confront and demolish. Perhaps they shatter the barrier erected by the morality of society, as symbolized by the slaughtering of the soldiers? Or do they overcome the innate biological repulsion toward incestuous acts, symbolized by the malign scientists? Yume\u2019s and Utsutsu\u2019s struggles with themselves as well as each other are undoubtedly convoluted, and Pupa provides an interesting and unconventional depiction of this strife. \\n\\n\r\nAny analysis above is only that of the writing and themes, and it is important to keep in mind that the anime is an adaptation by studio DEEN of the manga original. As is widely established, the animated Pupa\u2019s production values are certainly not top-notch. While the animations are completely inexcusable, I personally do not find the art or sound too terrible considering that most shorts are not visual spectacles. Though this is rather inconsequential in its evaluation. More importantly, the short length of the adaptation has simplified the story to the point that it scarcely contains anything beyond vital plot elements. Add to this the frequent interruption of the narrative and the pacing problems it imposes, it becomes rather difficult to form an emotional attachment to the characters or the story. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I do not think Pupa deserves all the ridicule and hatred that is being dished out. It provides a fascinating and unique symbolic illustration of the overused incest trope, complete with a hint of psychoanalysis that it deserves. Yet, when subjected to the magical touch of studio DEEN, it becomes a terrible series from every perspective other than the psychological.\\n",

            "content": "\"Alone. Yes, that's the key word, the most awful word in the English tongue. Murder doesn't hold a candle to it and hell is only a poor synonym.\u201d \u2015  Stephen King\r\nPerhaps horror is long gone absent in the animation industry. The same symptom of films has affected anime as well; deaths often play a humorous role with irony and poor presentation (Another, Blood-C) and over-reaching plots makes crystal clear as day that they wanted to make the audiences shit themselves in fright (though instead they only made shit themselves). But who would've thought that one of the most intelligent, philosophical and ground-breaking anime liesin an entry that MAL considers 'utter shit (4.62)' and has a length of only four minutes? That's right, the sophisticated, goose-bumping machine 'Pupa' is here, the most clever thriller since Monster and GitS.\\n\\n\r\nYou don't need a billion episodes. You don't even need twelve full episodes; 3 minutes of material in a span of 12 weeks is more than enough to realize the glorious masterpiece DEEN has given us. Lots of people complain that it's not long enough at all; \"They have their priorities straight with Sakura Trick\". Yuri lickers are disgusting, I mean who would want to see 12 episodes of two girls cuddling in bed? Pupa need not 20 minutes to develop a sense of agony, despair and suspense as its presentation and world-building pretty much exceeds in perhaps life itself. Pupa is that strong.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot follows the ultimate incest story revolving a brother and a sister. They find themselves alone. In life. In darkness. In the universe. And one day, Yume, the sister, finds a ever so strange and out of place butterfly. Perhaps because it was red. But nevertheless, the impact of seeing such a sophisticated and impacting butterfly contrived her to undergo an extraordinary yet unusual metamorphosis that implants her life in stake; a cannibal monster that eats humans. Her brother attempts to save her from the utter despair that bestowed on her, only to be stirred in unsettling situations, events and occurrences that gives his life a twist and turn of fate and mystery.\\n\\n\r\nSee how deep the synopsis is? And this is only the summery. It passes Evangelion of deep, and Utena of symbolism to the point where both seems like 4-piece puzzles. And from browsing the MAL forums (lol), a lot of responses to Pupa usually varies from \"dont get et\" to \"wat hapend :(\" and even \"FUCK YOU DEEN I HATE YOU WAAAAA BWAAAAA\". Of course, there are people who see this as exaggerate, and it's saddening to see how low MAL has dug their grave but only 200 people on MAL has seriously seen the light, including Rog.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the many strong components of this extraordinary story is the way they handle its incest commentary. Remember Ore no Imouto? Me neither. Pupa bubbles a series of questions in which involves the boundaries of crossing the line of incest. How far should you go in saving your sister? To the point of spilling your guts out and regenerating a cycle of pain, despair and hopelessness in order to satisfy your sister's stomach (and possibly pussy), while she faithfully repeats \"Onii-chan~\" about seven dozen times? The bond between their relationship is not of a typical 'i wuv you pls wug me' but instead exceeds with a bond so complicated yet fractured, corrupted while constructed all in their minds, that describing this makes my sentence wobble to the pont wear it aons't maek senasfo32?{'#$*()\\n\\n\r\nThe psychologicalness is relentlessly high in this sophisticated animation too. The writing offers so much in its concept and messes around how human nature behaves past the borderline of death, and beyond. The pain yet bittersweet comfort of seeing your sister in a monstrous form. The choice of suffering while helping another in order to avoid suffering. Abuse of inhuman abilities within society. Capturing happiness under the conditions of midget police forces and strange pregnant women who wants to capture you. Getting a boner when your sister with tight shorts eats your guts while lewdly touching you and saying 'onii-chan' in your earphone, as the audience reaches for those tissues and- and- and undergoing surgery due to sub-consciously cutting themselves for the trauma or the scarce the anime has caused them.\\n\\n\r\nPupa.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style references various infamous paintings and sculptures in the last 10 centuries. The paintings includes \"Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault - Anatomical Pieces\", in which has disembodied body parts which Pupa references from the cannibalism imagery blocked by stylish and symbolic shadows (some people call this censoring - ignore them). \"Odilon Redon - Smiling Spider\" is symbolized from Yume's character, in which she's seemingly a monster that can still earn happiness. \"Francisco Goya - Saturn Devouring His Son\"; back to face with the relationship of family, in this case brother and sister. \"Francis Bacon - Painting\" is something creepy but it has bacon, mmmm. But yeah, art is nic\\n\\n\r\nSound give s a creepy, unsettling y et unimaginably po werful at mosphere.

Thank DEEN for saving the medium that died long ago. Thank God, for the beginning of life that led our imagination and creativity to show impact and succession in our fullest potential in human nature. My review may not reach to convince enlightenment to those readers out there, but I hope you at least by mere curiousity to check the practically Jesus of story-telling.\\n\\n\r\nPupa is the anime we need; not the one we deserve.",

            "content": "HELLO and WELCOME to \"HOW TO RUIN AN ANIME 101\". In today's episode, let's discuss how to ruin an anime called \"pupa\".\r\nFirst off, let's delay the series for one whole line up! People are expecting something non-moe and unique to change the pace, no? That's why it's a GREAT idea to make them wait 3 more months! It will make them confused and wonder why?\r\nDone? Good. Next step is to shorten the length of the anime. 23 minutes? Pfff. 4 minutes is the hit! You say this is for gag animes only and not for deep anime? WELL WE DO NOT CARE  as ourgoal is to destroy the anime as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else is left? Let's put the plot so confusingly no one will get it and all it will be about is \"onii-chan, onii-chan\" and gore. PERFECT. Viola~ A perfectly ruined anime.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nNow that you heard out some kind of satyric joke attempt of me... let's get to the point.\\n\\n\r\npupa is the sole anime I would legitimately label \"trainwreck\" just because of how butchered it was. It is so bad yet I just can't stop watching it...just to see how bad it gets. \\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nIf my satyric joke hasn't hinted it to you yet, it's because of what was originally expected from the anime and what it became. I'm not even a type to give in to premises and expectations and rate anime low if they aren't met, but pupa is a dissapointment even with just having the basic ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was delayed for a season for the purpose of IMPROVING. If THIS is what I get for waiting a season, then I'd rather get each anime one season early so they're worsened to the better.When there's a delay, some nifty animation or sound is expected; however, there was no animation that was out of the ordinary; sound was good but I think it didn't need the necessity of one whole season either. If it was budget reasons, then Pupa should have waited a while longer before aiming for an anime, or should have indefinitely postponed the whole thing to make it look somewhat decent, even if not worth the wait\\n\\n\r\nMore than the delay, which can be so simply forgiven and tossed aside, the length of the episode turned out to be completely unsuitable to the genre. Pupa was probably supposed to be a deep anime with much thinking, peering inside the characters, more exciting moments... but ended up bringing in just the gore and the \"onii-chan\" as if to make the anime bad on purpose. I don't know what happened there at Studio DEEN but I'm not liking it at all.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe induced by the length, maybe not quite, the story is trimmed down just to the key-elements - in fact, I'm not sure if they even are key; and many of the matters miss an explanation in time. The characters remain anonymous from the inside, and become rather insignificant. The length doesn't provide enough depth to give any of the inside matters of the characters more than a mention. It's like a extended summary of osmething people might have seen, but it's something new...so it's unacceptable.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't see away for this to be anyhow enjoyable, apologies for those who do... Only if you like just gore, or watch it ironically with a group of friends that then go biting in some meat going \"onii-chan\" with squeaky voices.",

            "content": "People must be overreacting. There\u2019s no WAY Pupa is as bad as everybody says. There must be SOMETHING good about it\u2026 right?\r\nNow I\u2019m the type of person who whenever I hear about a show everybody says is bad I get this sudden urge where I have to watch it and see just how bad it really is. And before I started Pupa I sat down and said to myself \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t care what people say. There must be something good in this show and I\u2019m going to put my full effort into finding everything good in this anime! I\u2019m gonna find something to enjoy!\u201dSadly my strategy did not go as planned. After about a minute in, the show quickly turned into a disgusting, messed up gore fest. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen plenty of messed up shows and movies before that were still good! So if I just look past all the gore in this then I should still be able to enjoy Pupa for the story and characters!\u201d Well\u2026 That plan didn\u2019t work so well either.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is utter crap. So much so that I almost don\u2019t even know what the show was about other than Yume and her brother Utsutsu Hasegawa get infected with the \u201cpupa\u201d virus that turns Yume into a flesh-eating monster and gives Utsutsu the ability to regenerate from any damage no matter how severe. And because of this regeneration ability, he has to serve as her\u2026 food source. Pupa is 12 episodes and each episode is only 4 minutes long. So as you would probably expect from such a short show, the story is rushed. Very\u2026 VERY\u2026 rushed! The show is constantly jumping around from plot point to plot point with almost no connection between scenes. And apparently the writers also thought it would be a good idea to have practically every episode introduce a new major plot point that raises many big questions but then completely drop said plot point after the episode and never go back to it or bother to explain anything. \\n\\n\r\nDid I mention this show was messed up? Because holy crap is this show messed up and overflowing with disgusting gore! But not messed up in a good way like Higurashi but rather messed up in a way that just makes you think \u201cWTF am I watching?\u201d There are three cannibal scenes in this show that are all very graphic and one of them is literally an entire episode of just Yume eating her brother. Now this could have been a rather thrilling or creepy scene but they portrayed it in a sexual way and he seems to enjoy being eaten by his sister and all I can say to that is\u2026 \u201cWho gets turned on by this!?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHow could I describe the characters? Let me see uh\u2026 Flat. Boring. One-dimensional. Hollow. Bland. Idiotic. Unrelatable. Unrealistic. Unlikeable. And absolutely NO character development whatsoever! Honestly that\u2019s really all there is to it. I mean what can I say. The characters were TERRIBLE in every possible aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was also crap. Neither the intro nor the outro were anything special and the only track that stood out was the piano instrumental that they played whenever they showed Yume eating her brother and the only reason it stood out to me was because of how unfitting it was to the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in this show was\u2026 interesting\u2026 but I hesitate to call it \u201cgood\u201d Now I\u2019ve heard a lot of people complain about the censorship in this show. However I was lucky enough (and by that I mean unlucky) to see an uncensored version on YouTube in glorious 1080p and the art style was certainly graphic and\u2026 detailed (at least in the gore) so I\u2019ll give it that.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the verdict. Pupa is an abomination and as I mentioned before I tried to find good in this show. I really did. I spent the entire show desperately searching for even the tiniest thing besides the art style that I could call even halfway decent thinking \u201cCome on Pupa! Give me something good! Please! Anything I can praise! ANYTHING! AT! ALL!\u201d But as much as I tried to find good, every waking second of Pupa was complete and pure badness and I do not recommend this show to anyone unless you\u2019re like me and like to watch shows just to see how bad they are. Even if you\u2019re into this type of messed up gore there are still plenty of shows out there that are messed up and still have great stories and a cast that doesn\u2019t suck. Or even if you are into cannibalism then just go watch Silence of the Lambs or High School of the Dead or listen to the song Evil Food Eater Conchita. Anything! Is better! Than Pupa! I mean if you really want to see something that's messed up and still good then go watch A Clockwork Orange.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n",

            "content": "You ever feel that itch in the rims of your ass crack that happens when you don\u2019t wipe long enough? If there was ever an anime to signify that horrific itchy feeling in the most monstrous example of that region, Pupa would no doubt fit that description.\r\nNever has there been hype so decimated after a rocky development schedule, season after season. It will go down in the books of how not to screw up your production schedule or else it will come back and bite you and your credibility. People, such as I, were very curious to see what Pupa had to offer in thehorror genre in anime, because it\u2019s not often we get to see many horror themed anime come out these days. Then all of our expectations suddenly dropped when this was announced to only be three minutes long. Judging by how I viewed the 36 minutes of content through the whole show\u2019s run time, this was obviously something that was just not finished.\\n\\n\r\nWhy you may ask? Well, for starters, the art style looks inexcusably low-budget, even for three minute show standards. Hell, Ai Mai Mi looked like it had quality production compared to this. Especially the background artwork, where the colors look almost like an elementary school student painted it with a flimsy paintbrush. The designs of the characters are at least a little bit tolerable considering they do look like actual people in most cases.\\n\\n\r\nNow the animation part is where it gets really hilarious. There is one instance where an ambulance car is driving and you can tell, even from the crappiest quality stream imaginable, that the wheels are not moving whatsoever. Not only that, but it almost looked like the animator didn\u2019t bother to put any frames on any part of the car so it looks like he dragged it with the mouse. This is but only a few of some of the glorious hilarity that transpires from the lackluster animation. Unfortunately, it seemed the networks airing it felt embarrassed to bother showing the animation so they decide to censor almost 80% of it.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I don\u2019t discuss censorship in the shows I review, only because they\u2019ll eventually release the uncensored Blu Rays at a later time. But considering how universally panned this show is, I can\u2019t see this ever having that kind of royalty in the near future. It is often a cringe worthy experience to have to sit through censors in a horror anime that covers up the disgusting gore and blood, but with Pupa, the way they censored certain aspects felt really disjointed. For instance, there is one scene where Yume eats her brother\u2019s flesh and obviously they censored this out right. Then in another episode we are shown a room filled with dismembered bodies scattered in a hallway, badly drawn by the way, and yet it isn\u2019t censored in any way. Why? Was it because it wasn\u2019t in motion? Or was it that the animation was so horrible from Yume\u2019s flesh eating that they demanded that no one see it fully? Either way, it felt like an unnecessary decision.\\n\\n\r\nPupa\u2019s plot leaves a lot to be desired, and that is the understatement of this entire review. I would complain profusely about how unfocused the entire structure of it and how each episode does not feel connected to each other in the slightest. Reading these negatives might leave the impression that it is badly written, however, once you actually watch Pupa all the way through, it almost feels like an unfinished product. Almost as if they were originally going to go for a standard 23 minute episode show but somehow their work got corrupted halfway down the line. Considering they had to delay this for another season seems like the most logical reason for this.\\n\\n\r\nCould Pupa have been a great show had they been more careful with their development schedule? Who knows. That other reality is all but shrouded in mystery from our own and we may not ever see that happen. That is if they decide to remake the entire adaptation and make one that is more faithful to the source material. I would put this up as a grand cautionary tale for people who want to get into the business of TV production. Will this be considered one of the great classic bad anime alongside Mars of Destruction or considered an avant-garde masterpiece like Tsui no Sora by trolls? I would argue that the latter would be the most likely scenario, god help us.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\\n",

            "content": "Well .. where do I even start .. the thing is that there are anime so bad, that you actually find them good.. like Mars of destruction .. what i mean is that some anime are so bad but because of being so bad they are also funny. \r\nThis one, Pupa.. is so bad, that it is bad at being bad. Did you get that? \r\nOne sentence to resume the anime: Wtf just happened ? \r\n12 eps long, each one with 2 min lenght, i wasn\u00b4t expecting for something good .. but this? No this is the SHIT. Let's get started.. \r\nStory: 3/10. This shitmakes no sense, i mean plot holes, missing parts, stories left behind, anything that you can imagine. \\n\\n\r\nSome few examples.. \\n\\n\r\nYume, since she was born, she had a virus. Well that's okay .. so why the virus only awaked after 14 years or whatever her age is. She only turned into a monster after 14 years. \\n\\n\r\nHer brother, gets infected when Yume bites him. Surprisingly he gets the same powers so why he does not have to deal with the sister's problem (she only can eat humans in order to calm down the monster inside of her), is he special or something? \\n\\n\r\nShe was born with all her teeth, clearly normal doctors will find it really weird (it is theorically impossible to born with any kind of teeth). But fuck normality, here they didn\u00b4t gave 2 fucks about that. \\n\\n\r\nA secret team of scientists arrests Yume and her brother in order to investigate them. They knew what they were, but still there is no protection at all. They operate an monster with no precaution .. ofc they would get killed. \\n\\n\r\nThere is even more of this. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. Well at least something had to be good. Even though 60% of the show is composed by single frames and the background is almost non-existant, the gore is well made and i actually enjoyed it. WATCH THE UNCENSORED VERSION.. the censured version the only thing that you see, is a black screen. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10. The opening is acceptable. But the OST .. wow .. you gotta watch the 6th episode with censure. The tracks that they use to ease the anime are so pathetic .. just .. really bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10. Well .. what characters? I just didn\u00b4t gave 1/10 because we do have a background story not so bad. The characters are at least pathetic. Their reactions, their emotions.. Yume basically says \"Oni-chan\" throughout the entire show, and her borther only says \"Yume\", that's all i know about them.. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10. Bad .. really bad. The last episode I was literally with my mouth opened because I just couldn\u00b4t understand what i was watching. The overall anime just looks pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10. Well, this anime is really bad for sure. But .. i reccomend it. Why you ask? Because i defend that we have to give a chance to great anime , the top anime and also the worst anime out there.. we have to taste the great and the bad, in order to really know what is good and bad by contrast. By doing that i think we can get our judgment more accurate. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is that everyone who calls themselves \"anime watcher\" should have the worst anime on their lists ..",

            "content": "\"Onii-chan, you're delicious.\" ~ Yume\r\nPupa, otherwise known as Onii-chan the anime, is a so-called \"anime\" which I first stumbled upon in the review section on MAL. It caught my attention when I saw the low scores it got. I thought to myself \"It can't be that bad.... Right?\"\r\nI could not have been more mistaken.\r\nPupa's story revolves around the brother-sister relationship of Utsutsu and Yume. Two orphaned siblings who have to support each other to live on. That is, until a deadly disease dubbed- \"Pupa\" infects Yume (much like the way this show infected the anime community, ironically). This new disease causes Yume to have ainsatiable hunger for humans. And the first person she eats, is none other than her brother, who comes back to life after being infected as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a surprisingly decent premise, which promises a decent anime of the horror genre. Unfortunately, that was the only positive part of this entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the laundry list of flaws.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the premise of the story is good, the actual story is rushed to an unimaginable level. This is mainly due to the fact that each episode is no-more than 5 minutes long, yes, only 5 minutes per episode. It's plainly visible why the story is so rushed. It is impossible for the writers or anyone to explain the story to the viewer when every episode has a maximum of 4 minutes of actual story, the rest being OP and ED times.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the writers, the script of the show is the most unintentionally hilarious thing you can imagine. The script for every episode contains at least two lines of Yume saying - \"Onii-chan\" in the most incestuous way possible. This failure of scriptwriting can easily be found in the infamous episode 6. The entire 4 minutes, it shows Yume, eating her brother, and saying Onii-chan, OVER, AND OVER AGAIN. For the entire episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the technical department of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as each episode is so short, you would expect every episode to have at least tolerable animation. But no, of course not, life isn't fair. Even the animation is a victim to the lazy disease that seems to have affected everybody involved in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the show is tolerable. The opening isn't half bad, and considering the size of each episode, the music isn't terrible either. But unfortunately, the disgusting lack of talent that went into the voices of the characters is what drags the score down. It's probably not the fault of the Voice actors that the characters suck, more so the writers faults for giving them such shitty lines to read.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I've got nothing to say. None of the characters go through any kind of development, and how could they when every episode is only 5 minutes long?! If I had to say anything about the characters it's that Yume and her \"Onii-chan\" are two of the worst characters anime has seen.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, I'd suggest this anime to everyone. It needs to be seen by all, as an example of how to not make an anime. Who knows, you might even enjoy it, although I highly doubt it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+...Uhhh... Good incest ?\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Short episodes\\n\r\n-Hurl-Inducing art and sound\\n\r\n-Inexcusable scriptwriting\\n\r\n-Terrible characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do those Cons spell? SHIT.",

            "content": "Ah, infamous anime, my favorite. I recently had the pleasure to experience Pupa. Scratch that, because it wasn't a pleasure at all, it was a nightmare.\r\nWhen i first heard of this anime i thought it wouldn't be so bad, since the horror genre in anime is usually quite the enjoyment. I was wrong on so many levels.\r\nStory: 1\r\nVery little development. It was hard to follow. Useless dialogue. I mean who need dialogue anyways? We can just have an episode of pure \"onii-chan... onii-chan..\" I mean the episodes aren't too long. 4 minutes in fact. Minus of course the time of the OP and ED totalingin 3 minute episodes. Yes the creators still had the nerve to include the OP and ED in every single episode! I still have no clue what the story was about. The only episode I enjoyed story wise was the last episode. In fact if the series was like the last episode I wouldn't mind at all\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nI actually liked the art, although it could have been way better. Imagine very little movement, and sometimes the voices being out of sync with the lips of the characters. At Least we got some nice animated violence right? let me touch up on that. THE CENSORSHIP WAS HORRIBLE. It was weird how they would censor out some things like a guy pulling out a knife but then they would show some guy getting his eyes plucked out. I'm not sure why even censor anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3:\\n\r\nThere wasn't much sound, thats why there is such a low rating. It would be a 1 if it wasn't for the music. Not much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nNo development. Characters were all pretty typical, and the ones that seemed interesting had very little on screen time. It was a cliche older brother who loves his sister and little sister who depends on her older brother. It got old, quick. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nThere was no time to enjoy, like i said before. The episodes were so short, and confusing, it was hard to digest. It was supposed to be scary but i found myself laughing at times wondering \"what in the world am i even watching.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1 \\n\r\nMaybe I am missing something big. Some sort of physiological message is supposed to be embedded in my mind now or something. Maybe I am too young to understand something like this. Perhaps one day in my dying bed I will remember \"Pupa\" and figure out that \"Pupa\" infact told me the meaning of life, and i just now understood it. We will see, I'll keep you guys updated if i figure out something. I don't know. This is all personal opinion, It was a waste of time. But the hour of viewing time went by so fast, I didn't even feel time move.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have a spare hour and want to experience the wonders of Pupa, by all means go ahead.\\n\\n\r\nWill I ever want to experience Pupa again? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\nAny feedback is much appreciated on this review. I am a total noob at reviews, I am seeking to become much better.\\n",

            "content": "There's Mars of Destruction and there's Pupa. I remember hearing about Pupa when the project was starting, and I remember the disappointment when hearing it was going to be shortened to four-minute episodes. The show looked vaguely interesting and I assumed that it was going to be shortened because the content was going to be so severe, possibly having some of the most messed up scenes in anime. However, that isn't quite what we have here, and one's feelings to the shortening of the series might suddenly make more sense upon watching it. If I had to guess why it was shortened to such anextent, I would guess the reasoning is because Pupa is pretty bad. People misuse the term \"edgy\" all the time, but Pupa is one of those anime that reminds us that there is still use for the word.\\n\\n\r\nPupa gave people the impression that it would be one of the most brutal and gory anime around, but it would be a lie to say it met that marker. When the show was decidedly shortened, it also felt as though the budget itself was dropped for funding each minute of screen-time. The animation, at its best moments, is just about average for anime series back in the 2000's. The art style (not the style the characters are drawn in terms of line-work, but the actual art style of shading and the color scheme) doesn't have character and just feels cheaply made. There are many moments where the animation will look a bit shoddy. The \"gory\" moments are where the animation is at its best, and this usually involves our beloved imouto eating human flesh. Is an imouto eating a handful of opaque, purple goo considered gory? If not, that is basically the goriness of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the series is average, and most of the music tracks will likely not be too memorable. However, the opening song is very catchy and Pupa should be given a thumbs-up for that. The ending song is also alright, but for the type of song it is, a shortened version doesn't do it justice. The music itself carries electronics with drumbeats to it, along with some piano. The music serves its basic purpose to the series, but rarely sounds good enough to the level of pulling the viewer in. Switching to the sound effects, Pupa fails to an extent. There are many times where a scene will be almost silent and the only sound playing will be the character's voice. In those moments, the atmosphere will feel very plain. Pupa tries to hide this by playing a light soundtrack song to cover up the silence, but the songs being so light most of the time makes this phenomenon still noticeable. In terms of audio and sound, Pupa stays around an average level.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Pupa is about a monster needing to maintain its cannibalistic desires, and the spread of this monster's disease. That will lead to some light gore of cannibalistic behavior, and some other disturbing scenes of people trying to stop the monster. By the end, none of this is explained in the smallest detail and what I state is where that plot element stays throughout. What also doesn't develop is the characters. The main, sibling characters barely develop in their relationship, even though it's basically all they talk about the entire time. No character here is sensible, and the character roster relies heavily on tropes and archetypes. The story is very simple with flat characters and, even though its elements don't even attempt to become understood, another issue rises with the series' closure. The ending of Pupa is entirely unsatisfying and doesn't give closure to any of its characters or any information to its basic, plot elements. The story also ends in a very unfinished state from what it considers to be a reasonable ending. The main characters get out of a dilemma and escape for a brief moment, but for some reason they choose to end it there. The ending shifts the stories focus to the sibling's understanding of their love (not to incest level) for one-another, which they seemed to already know long before these series of events even started.\\n\\n\r\nPupa tells a story that allows the creators to fill it with gore to be disturbing, but without even the attempt of explaining the elements that allow the gore in the first place, making it all feel forced and as if it was the only selling point of the series. Also, with the lacking budget in place, not even the gore is carried out well enough to be worth watching for that alone. The animation is average, and there are many moments with barely any animation whatsoever, even with this series only totaling to thirty-seven minutes in length. The art style is basic and feels incomplete for the type of style it wanted to represent. The music serves its place, but the lacking sound effects can make entire scenes feel incomplete with moments of literally no sound effects whatsoever. The characters are plain archetypes with some carrying inscribed symbols on their faces for an aspect of uniqueness, but that only makes their roles feel even more plain as you stare at their out-of-place tattoos that give them the extent of their uniqueness. No character goes beyond their archetype and there are even moments of pure stupidity, like a soldier calling out the lost torso of his ally's legs. Those moments go laughably near the level of Mars of Destruction. Yet, one plus Mars of Destruction has over this series is that it's half as long, and its elements were so conventional that it could all be considered stupid fun. Pupa's elements aren't compatible with fun, but only with the inclusion of gore. Without a proper disclosure as to why it's that way: Pupa feels plain, desperate, and self-conscious as one of those anime that deserves to be labeled with the term \"edgy\". Should one watch Mars of Destruction or Pupa? Mars of Destruction, if imoutos aren't all that.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're in dire need of a Pupa viewing, watch this Pupa instead: http://vimeo.com/96882171",

Think of it as a survival game, how long can you possibly watch it? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really hate making reviews in which I'm criticizing so bad an anime but Pupa is just the worst anime I've ever watched so I had to make a review.\r\nStarting with the story... Wait, what story? I mean, yeah, the plot exists, but what can be expected from a 4 minute episode where the opening and the ending represent half of the time? Nothing. The action is so rushed that you barely understand a thing, especially when there are also flashbacks. I didn't read the manga (although I was recommended to) so I had no idea what this anime was about, and after I finishedit, I still have no idea what this is all about. \\n\\n\r\nArt is meh. Nothing special. I could say that the gore parts are not that horrible and the characters have a decent look but this is really not important relative to the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: awful.\\n\r\nUtsutsu and Yume have this well-known brother-sister relationship where the big brother would do anything for his lil sister. He even lets her eat his flesh which is way too awkward, especially when Yume is rather happy and doesn't see any problem in eating her brother. Oh..those family bonds..\\n\r\nAgain, the episodes are so short that we can't see any development of the characters, just one episode (or 2) dedicated to their past so we learn a bunch of useless and incomprehensible things. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: NO\\n\r\nWhat should I enjoy about this? I remember this episode when, for 2 minutes, I had to watch Yume eating his brother while saying \"Onii-chan\". It was pathetic. I like gore animes but this one, even if it is some kind of gore, is a joke! Basically, there is no point in watching this anime. I saw about 10,000 people planning to watch it. DON\"T. It's a total waste of time and there are lots of good animes out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rated 1. I would've rated it 0 if I could. Seriously.",

What do you do?\r\nA: Attempt to Kill her\r\nB: Flee\r\nC: Allow her to eat you since you suddenly have the power to regenerate.\r\nIf you answered C then you're right! If you have no clue what on Earth I am talking about then consider yourself lucky that you haven't seen this anime before. With the previous OVAs I have reviewed you COULD argue in their defence that the reason why they were so bad was on account of their age and that they were made at a time in which Japan was going through aneconomic crisis. This still doesn't make the OVAs I've talked about any good but at least it can act as an excuse when defending them. Pupa has no such excuse since it was made only two years ago and to this day remains one of the worst anime ever created.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this show when it was initially airing and I was even more confused, disgusted and appalled by each passing episode. Not a single part of the anime makes a bit of sense and the character development and narrative is the most nonsensical thing I have ever witnessed. It's about two siblings who were beaten as children and as a result grew a rather intimate relationship with one another. While walking one day in the park the sister turns into a monster for NO REASON and devours and rips apart people that happen to be in close proximity. The anime hints at the sister's sudden transformation being a result of something called the 'Pupa' but it's never explained to us in the slightest and feels like such a lazy way to explain this event that it comes across as being forced. The brother, upon seeing the massacre his sister has inflicted upon these poor innocent people still sees this beast as his own sister and not some disgusting monstrosity. He opens up his arms to embrace his monster-sister (which sounds like I'm referencing Monster Musume or something when I think about it) but the sister ends up killing the brother instead. But don't worry! The brother somehow has the power of immortality and no matter what damage is inflicted upon him, he will regenerate! From that point on the sister fills her appetite by feasting on her brother's back while the show tries to present these scenes as being sexual complete with awkward moaning and the repeating the lines \"Oni-chan\" every second.\\n\\n\r\nIf that plot synopsis sounded absolutely insane that's because it is! The anime is only four minutes in length and does a terrible job at developing its characters or just telling a simple coherent story. There is another plot that runs aside the one I just mentioned in which some generic organisation are researching the pupa...or something. They never make it clear what their purpose was in the slightest! So the plot is horrible and the characters are terrible. The animation is just as bad! It's so uninspired and dull to the eyes! There is a lot of blood-shed and the such which was heavily censored while it was airing so for people like me who watched this trash two years back we were just essentially watching a black screen. The only thing I found that was okay the opening which is only thirty seconds long and is more interesting than the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the very definition of awful. It has nothing. It's an empty shell with no ideas and a plot so disgusting that I want to kill myself. There is nothing to laugh at either since everything in the show is so terrible. Stay away from this one. If you're really curious then just watch the Onii-chan eating scene. Anymore will kill you.\\n\\n\r\n(Part of LIQfilms 12 Days of Christmas - Day 7)",

            "content": "Ladies & Gentlemen, I now present to you the best anime of all time \"Pupa\". Directed by Tomomi Mochizuki and produced by Studio Deen. It has great animation, great characters, a deep story and I really was surprised to the point I go defenseless. Never mind let's get onto the review.\r\nPupa is an anime about Yume and her \"Onii-chan\" and you know I hate them. I will only give one positive thing in this anime. The opening theme and the ending theme were ok. The opening theme gives a tone that is creepy and the ending theme gives a sad tone. The rest of theanime can be summed up in 5 simple words: \"I DON'T GIVE A ****!\" From the story, characters and animation. They put nothing into this anime, they just shot it right out saying \"Here, anime fans, eat our crap!\".\\n\\n\r\nSorry, for the outrage. I can't forgive anime companies like that. I don't care if it is Winter Season or not. A crap anime is a crap anime no matter what you say. Crap anime should not be made. I have never been as angry as I was since I reviewed \"Ultimate Girls\", one of the worst anime I watched. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, was Ultimate Girls in 2005.\\n\r\n2nd, Amnesia in 2013.\\n\r\nAnd now, Pupa.\\n\\n\r\nHow dare you do this to us.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (1):\\n\\n\r\nThere is no story. The story just jump from scene to scene sporadically with no continuity in the episodes. Not only that the episodes are just 4 minutes long each. For slice of life or comedy, it is all right. But it is not all right when doing it in an action, mystery or horror anime. In fact, the main story glorifies incestuous cannibalism. The younger sister eats her elder brother and that's the story. It is basically a romance story, not even a horror anime.\\n\\n\r\nART (1):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looked god-awful. The animation was like a 9 year old started painting or maybe the animation was made with murky toilet water or acid. Not only that there is unnecessary censorship like the guy holding a knife in episode 8 was censored.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (1):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are boring and dull to listen to. Even though the opening and ending theme gave some tones, I still find the opening and ending boring to listen to. Even the music in the anime. I don't have to go into detail because it's not worth talking about.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (1):\\n\\n\r\nHuh? Where are the characters? They're just puppets. They're not even characters. Puppets do not have any connection.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (1):\\n\\n\r\nThis is what is wrong with the anime industry. They keep releasing shitty anime in the winter season. Why is that? I really feel terrible for everyone in the anime community after watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf the anime industry continues to release shitty anime in winter season, I am now starting to feel worried about what will happen in the near future in the anime industry. \\n\\n\r\nI feel that it becomes a much bigger rant than has nothing to do with the anime. But I have to say it is so bad that I have nothing more to say. I already summed it up. The anime has terrible animation, wooded characters, no chemistry or bond between any of the characters. The story is weak. This anime is a huge steaming pile of s**t. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for the 1st time in a year I give it a solid 1 out of 10. Terrible from start to finish. The worst anime I have seen. Avoid this anime like the red butterflies.",

Imagine several pieces of cloth put together to form a little tacky scarf, and you might get an idea of just how poor the story is. The fact that each episode is only four minutes long only aggravates this problem. \r\nArt: We would expect a short episode anime to at least have some good animation, but no. Character design,backgrounds and animation are all terrible, and gore scenes are censored on purpose (not by the show's producers, of course), so the only thing you have left is a Microsoft Office assistant looking-like girl chewing her brother's flesh through the magic of Nintendo 64 graphics.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: Horrible and predictable voice acting. PUPA's seiyuu cannot possibly think saying Onii-chan and chewing SFX is not good acting.

            "content": "There will be a time in our lives when we'll undergo something so awful that we'll try desperately to block it from our memories.\r\nAllow the pathetic excuse of an anime, Pupa, to be one of those awful experiences. I mean, it was listed as horror but I didn't realize it would be so scarring that I'd want to write it out of my mind completely. Seriously, it was so bad, it was almost laughable.\r\nAt first, the story seemed somewhat appealing but the fact that each episode was only 4 minutes long was a bit questionable. There was no way that a story such as thiscould be condensed into just twelve, four minute episodes. That still rings true. Granted, if it was longer I would have dropped it in a heartbeat. The story gets a 4, since it could have been something. I guess I'm just feeling generous today.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was... different. It wasn't totally awful but it just didn't feel finished. It felt like they let a child paint it but the kid got bored and fell asleep. I feel the same way, young child. The gore was alright, but as a major fan of horror, I've seen better. Way better. Although, I will say that I liked how they were represented as bears when entering the past. Oh, how I wish I could enter the past and decide not to watch this. Art: 3, and only because I understand that child on a spiritual level.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was so absolutely awful that... you know what, no. Can I just walk away right now? Can I just get up and leave? The sounds when she was chewing were so bad I can't even put it into words. There was an episode that was pretty much cannibal porn - it was literally her eating her brother for 4 minutes while she internally whimpered 'onii-chan' over and over until your ears started to bleed and your brain exploded from so much WTF it's not even funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality when it comes to the music is the opening, which was just catchy enough for me to sit through for thirty seconds before all hell broke loose in the few minutes that followed.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give the show credit for bringing forth a whole new kind of incest. She eats her brother, in the least sexual way possible. The characters were one dimensional, and there wasn't any effort in making them otherwise. Their pasts were interesting but not original.\\n\r\nMusic and Characters get a 1.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: no.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Burn it and all memories of it before your brain rots.",

            "content": "Studio Deen, notorious for producing anime nobody likes, yet again delivers another shitty anime. I was prepared for disappointment when I watched the first episode, knowing not to expect anything from Studio Deen. How do you produce an anime when all you've got is 99 cents and a rapidly declining animation business? Well, Studio Deen can answer this question with their latest anime - Pupa. \r\nThis anime is the epitome of pathetic, nothing more. From start to finish, I was contemplating sending a dead fish to Studio Deen's headquarters. For starters, Pupa was delayed for an entire season in the first place. The soundtrack wassomething I could produce while farting into a microphone. Sure, the opening and ending themes were mediocre at the best, but other than that the soundtrack makes my ears bleed. The art had entered a new, unimaginable dimension of lousiness. The background art was painful to look and the colors were flat to say the least. At certain scenes, it looks like a bunch of scribbles all over a toddler's coloring book. The animation was so stiff that it made me stiff to just look at. A damn pole has more flexibility than that horrid animation. That's not all. The characters were basically non existent. Since the anime is the length of my penis (which doesn't exist), there was never a chance to fully introduce the characters, and therefore there was little to no character development. We never really got to know the characters to begin with. On top of that, the character designs were the definition of boring. Despite this, Pupa itself has a decent plot, and I understand what's it's trying to project towards the audience, but nonetheless it was poorly executed (thanks, Studio Deen). \\n\\n\r\nThis anime production can easily be reproduced by a preschooler blasting explosive diarrhea all over an empty sketchbook. The sight of this anime makes me want to descend deep into Earth's mantle and disintegrate into millions, possibly trillions, of pieces. I am beyond the realm of disappointment. Jesus died for your sins, and this is how you repay him, by making shitty anime?! Shame on you, Studio Deen.\\n\\n\r\n(This is like my 90th time reposting this review.. bear with me.)",

            "content": "Lots of people were calling this anime one of the worst of all time. I kept thinking \"come on, it can't be that bad.\" Oh it is. I'll give it credit that it succeeded in creeping the hell out of me. But I'm pretty sure most of it was unintentional.\r\nStory: 1\r\nI can hardly even understand what is going on. There are points in the \"story\" that seem to contradict each other. Plus the story is told in 4 minute episodes, so by the time you get into the swing of the episode, its halfway over already. So you have no time to figure things outlike \"where the hell are the characters\" or \"why the heck is any of this happening.\" Not only that but it feels like the episodes got scrambled halfway through because there are \"flashback\" episodes that ruin what little of a continuity this story had to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nI will give the anime credit for having a unique-ish look. And there is a design later on that reminded me of a Resident Evil like monster. But other than that the colors are unpleasant, but not in a way that accentuates the horror. Some of the characters have scars?/tattoo? like things on their skin that make no sense. Plus they keep bringing in this teddy bear stuff in an attempt to make a visual metaphor, but it just highlights how pathetic the whole story is. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\n The sound does its job. Plus the opening music is legitimately creepy. But when you have the characters acting as ridiculous as they are, its hard to take any of the sound seriously. Whoever they got to play the brother sounds like he's choking and having an orgasm at the same time whenever he screams/pants. And then everyone else is completely un-noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nI literally have no reason to care about anyone in this anime. The last episode made a very small effort to make me care. But by that point I was so fed up with the stupid plot, confusion, and complete frustration with the characters contrived and stupid characterization that I couldn't give anymore of a crap about the characters. And some flashback about them as kids was not going to change that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nLike I said before, this anime creeped me out. But for the wrong reasons. It's hard for me to get invested when the story makes so little sense, and it's hard for me to feel scared when the characters are acting so illogical. I should have been creeped out by the cannibalism. Instead I was freaked out at the writing choices.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:1\\n\r\nIt's almost impossible to make an anime that doesn't look and/or sound pretty in 2014, so production values don't even matter to me with an anime like this. When you get down to it, this is an anime with a torture porn like plot, that could have been scary. But because of the 4 minute limit on every episode there was no time to establish anything that was going on. And even if you ignore that, the characters were archetypes at best. The plot holes were so large, and so all over the place that they confused me. So by the end I was more frustrated with the show than anything. I do not recommend this anime unless you want to see an example of virtually non-existent continuity, and the worst characterization I've ever seen.",

            "content": "I watched the uncensored show all together in a compilation, and I heard that the censored version was even worse...how? This anime was so bad it inspired me to write my first ever review on here.\r\nIn trying to figure out if the score was a 1 or a 2, the word \"appalling\" was certainly the best fit, so I decided on that one. Although it's every scene is not as poor quality as Mars of Destruction, Pupa more than makes up for that with it's very limited \"redeeming qualities\" (Mars was at least funny in it's ineptitude) and in having the worst scene of anyanime that I've ever witnessed (even seeking out \"worst scenes in anime\" on youtube didn't prepare me). But I'll get to that in the story part of this review, which contains...spoilers? Even not having watched the anime you likely know as much about it as me, but yeah, I'll call this anime having a plot that can be \"spoiled\". The rest of the review wont have spoilers so you can read until the story section if you are dead set on avoiding them, pretending as if there's a plot to care about.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe art got such a dreadful score because I hate the main character's face. What is that awful red mark under his eye? A highly regrettable tattoo? Raw flesh that needs to get checked up on? Swearing on the pain of death, I honestly don't know either way. And then that hair ornament? Yeah...this is the worse character design I've ever seen. Try to prove me wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nIt...had sound...I think. It wasn't annoying so that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nI'll sum up the character traits I know of the main characters...\\n\\n\r\n...they are...\\n\\n\r\n...brave? I guess? \\n\\n\r\nThe main bad girl was sort of cool even in only a few regards but I don't remember much about her either. Eh...one character sort of cool somehow earns it a 2. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThere's around a minute's worth of scenes that are sort of fine. The rest is painful.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe worst scene ever involves the main character's sister eating bits of him while saying \"onii-chan\" to a literal ad nauseam. I truly don't know how long the scene lasted but it was likely an entire episode's worth and felt much longer than that. Few scenes have achieved being both annoying and disgusting at once, so that was quite the accomplishment.\\n\\n\r\nIt was shortly after that when my brain decided to kill itself, entering into a hazy stupor and I began to almost fall asleep (admittedly I did watch this late at night). Therefore, I can't say with all honesty that they never explained anything, but my dying brain couldn't pick up on any details that explained what was going on (other than the fact that the girl had a virus that increased healing but made her eat people) or how the two got out of the facility at the end and got a normal life again. I guess they simply killed everyone who knew about them? They showed another monster like what the girl could transform into and the leader woman, but I don't remember either of them doing anything at the end or getting killed. Sequel? Did I literally fall asleep rather than just feeling like I was going to? I'm not watching it again to find out.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nYou might find it unfair to not judge it with a clear mind, but if the anime is literally bad enough to make that impossible the first go around without advanced mental preparation exercises, why should I care or give it any higher of a rating? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There comes a time when something becomes so bad that not even the good aspects can salvage it, and this is certainly the case with Pupa. From repetitive events to scenes that almost made me vomit, Pupa does everything it can to make you hate it. If that was your intention Pupa, you certainly did a great job in doing so.\r\nIf I had to describe Pupa\u2019s \u201cstory\u201d (if you can even call it that) in two words, it would be \u201cdreadful mess\u201d. It\u2019s basically just torture porn. Utsutsu, our main male character, tries to save his sister Yume from becoming a monster due to somevirus, who then proceeds to eat him alive. After she\u2019s done with him, he revives, because he also has some sort of virus, and the episode is over. Next episode, rinse and repeat until episode 11. Episode 12 however is completely different, but it establishes nothing remotely interesting and leads me to believe that the creators just gave up and said, \u201cWell, if people didn\u2019t like episodes 1-11, then why not fuck with them and produce a useless ending that has nothing to do with the rest of the show?\u201d \u201cGreat idea man! *High five*\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as generic as you can get, the only thing I remember about them is that Utsutsu has a scar over his left eye. That\u2019s it; they left no impact on me. Not even the black-haired woman (who I think I\u2019ve seen in a hentai by the way) made me care about her, she was just kind of there.\\n\\n\r\nI think the worst part about Pupa is the fact that they decided to censor out some of the bloody and violent parts, while keeping in others. For instance, in one scene a knife is censored out for some reason (don\u2019t know why), but then like a minute later Yume is in the middle of eating her brother and that\u2019s not censored? What is that about? You decide to censor out a knife but not a guy being EATEN ALIVE? Come on, you can do better than that.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing from my last paragraph, even if the show wasn\u2019t censored and we got to see all the blood and gore, the art and animation is so basic that it wouldn\u2019t even look decent. You\u2019d think that since the episodes are only 4 minutes long, they would have to spend less money per episode which would lead to better art and animation, but that\u2019s where you would be wrong. They instead decide to save as much money as possible by making low quality frames and character models.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really enjoy something that portrays itself so badly and makes me want to stop watching it. I can\u2019t see how anyone would enjoy this, unless you\u2019re into torture porn or vore I guess. But even then, there are better options out there that don\u2019t make you want to rip your hair out at how infuriating it is. Not many shows have made me angry while watching them, but Pupa became one of them, and for that I salute you; You\u2019ve entered the pit of no return, the place where only the worst of the worst get permission to enter. You can never leave, and you will never hear from me again. Say goodbye Pupa, you will not be missed.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Pupa is an awful mess that not only repeats itself every episode and has a horrible ending that ties nothing together, but also makes you angry at the fact that the creators actually made this irredeemable pile of junk. Don\u2019t watch this, unless you\u2019re a complete masochist or into torture porn and vore. You have been warned.\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThe world is filled with every manner of creature. From the red cardinals of North America to the tiger sharks of the Pacific Ocean, the range and variability of the Earth's organisms are quite the sight to see. But this is only at the macro level. At the micro, one can find strange cells and harmful bacteria. And the worst offender of them all is the dreaded virus. It's only directive is to infect the host it attacks, and depending on the type, particular outcomes can be found. Pupa is like a deadly virus: unwanted, unneeded, and completelyunhealthy for anyone involved.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nPupa begins with Utsutsu being greeted by his younger sister, Yume. While waiting for her brother, she is attacked in the park, leading to a rather otherworldly development.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire series runs at just under forty minutes. Even if one were to give the show a little leeway in terms of progression, the amount of plot holes that exist are too egregious and many to warrant it forgiveness. What purpose did the monster dog serve? Where did Maria's character go? Why is Yume capable of growing tentacles? How did Utsutsu obtain the virus? Who did their mother get impregnated by to birth a demon baby? All of these questions and more are raised, but are either never answered, skipped over, or blatantly ignored to proceed to the next set of unexplained plot points.\\n\\n\r\nAnother of the show's faults is its inability to properly keep its tone in check. It dips and dives without rhyme or reason, and never really settles on a specific presentation. It tries to take itself seriously when showcasing past trauma, frightening with the blood and screaming, creepy with the supernatural beings, and insanely cute and happy to round everything off. Most of the time, one is laughing at the absurdity of the situations taking place. And coupled with the missing narrative and these abhorrent disconnects in expression, it causes the entire experience to come off as a complete mess.\\n\\n\r\nDigging deeply into the despair that Pupa delivers, one discovers a literal delegated theme. In essence, it tries to convey the notion that not everything can be done by one's self. That a certain amount of support is required to accomplish particular tasks. This is clearly seen with Utsutsu towards Yume; he becomes the sustenance she needs to survive. At the same time, Yume supports Utsutsu by eliminating the people causing harm towards him. Even their mother technically receives help from their father. The issue, though, resides in the huge disparity between what is rational and what is reasonable. Utsutsu's example is cannibalism; Yume's is murder; and Sachiko's is physical abuse. When one thinks \"support,\" these ideas never come to mind. It's entirely nonsensical, and is perpetuated further by Pupa's lack of a coherent story.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nPupa is rather dull in regards to both the art and its actual animation. This is taking into account the uncensored version only.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is often very dark, taking on a drawing or painting effect for its backgrounds. It comes off plain, but gives this effect that what one is watching is almost dreamlike. The contents are also quite gruesome: liters of blood, chopped limbs, and masses of flesh are common within each episode. It's all rather graphic; this is not a show for the faint of heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are weird because they follow Pupa's odd trend: almost zero explanation. Utsutsu's red facial mark, Yume's transformation, and Maria's leg scars are given no pretext at any point during the show's duration. The only article that is given any amount of attention is Yume's hairpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation usually rests below average. It picks up during the eating scenes, where mouth movements, alongside the tearing of flesh and organs, become the norm. Otherwise, characters are almost always shown standing around, sitting down, or laying back, with only the spurting of their blood seeing velocity.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIt's very difficult to talk about the cast of Pupa. The reason is that half of them are given \"importance,\" but are then subsequently never used afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst offender of this technique is Maria. Donning a witch-like hat and menacing eyes, she randomly appears near the start of the show. She acts as a sort of observer, taking a lot of interest in the monsters that are Utsutsu and Yume. However, following a startling revelation, she disappears. From then on, she is neither shown nor alluded to in any fashion. While the plot itself is usually disjointed, what she could have potentially brought to the table would have been interesting, or \"relevant,\" to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for Utsusu's and Yume's parents. The father, with suit and glasses, was abusive towards not only his wife but to his own kids. Mr. Hasegawa's inclusion served one purpose: to instill some sort of drive within Utsutsu, causing him to always want to protect his little sister. Again, though, not only is this \"development\" given little context but the father is never actually seen; he exists only in flashbacks. All of this says nothing of the mother. Sachiko's long brown hair and calm expression hid her true feelings. She was fearful of the daughter she gave birth to, knowing the kind of beast that she was. In order to reaffirm her reality, and to \"escape\" from the dream she felt trapped in, she accepted the pain given to her by her husband. Beyond giving Yume an origin (but still with no justification as to Yume's condition), Sachiko fades from the show. All of them -- Maria, Mr. Hasegawa, Sachiko -- and other unnamed characters only serve to further the inconsistencies that already exist.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, the only characters that at least maintain connections to the anime are Utsutsu and Yume. The former is the older brother. Sporting a feminine-looking hairpiece, a red-mark, and plain looks, he harbors a deep love for his little sister. This characteristic is shown from the beginning and never falters, causing his entire development to stagnate. He does nothing other than becoming the food source for Yume and screaming due to pain from time to time. And Yume is no different; her initial abomination provides an interesting outlet to explore, but is immediately dropped. Instead, she never seeks to alter her path or find any type of solution, reciprocating the same \"love\" that her brother gives to her. Both are one-dimensional, flat people that never see growth.\\n\\n\r\nThis is odd, considering the characters' supposed theme. The title of the anime is \"Pupa,\" after the name of the virus that has invaded both Utsutsu and Yume. However, the show constantly refers to butterflies. Why is this? Going biological for a moment, the butterfly is a creature that follows a simple life-cycle: larva, pupal, adult, and repeat. Thus, \"Pupa\" isn't so much about the disease as it is about the apparent state of the characters. A pupa is normal and boring on the outside but contains a yet-to-blossom magnificence. And that's the show's intended message; that one's outer \"ugliness\" doesn't reflect a person's potential inner beauty. Utsutsu and Yume are mysterious monsters on the outside but caring humans on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nThis point is lost, though, for two reasons: one, it's muddled with an overwhelming feeling of lost realism. The lack of audience-relation persists, because the topics themselves are too perverse to give the characters the opportunity to seem human. Two, and following the analogy depicted earlier, it's a cycle, not just a stage. Because the characters themselves never grow, never transition, to that next part of life, they always remain a pupa. The siblings' inner beauty, like the motif, remains trapped and unable to escape from within; a figurative \"death by suicide.\"\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is somewhat quick, but also somewhat lame. The transition in the beat is awkward, the instruments are boring, and the final \"Pupa\" chants are rather silly to hear.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ED, it's not that bad. It contrasts heavily with the show's darker tone, bringing about high vocal singing and soft piano playing.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contains melancholic violin pieces and more ambient, chilling ones to provide an appropriate feeling for the situation at hand. Besides this, though, the tracks are completely forgettable, and are not designed to be listened to outside of the show itself. If anything, the sound effects -- the crunching, munching, and scrunching of flesh and bone -- were always gross to hear.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting sees average to below-average performances for the entire cast. A special shout-out to Nobunaga Shimizaki for his role as Utsutsu, having to scream probably for three-quarters of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nPart of the likability of an anime like this is in its innards (pun intended). That is to say, one cannot be fazed by \"horror\" or gore when attempting to partake in what it has to offer. For me, the show never came off as frightening or creepy, mostly because it was imploding right from the get-go. As for the graphic nature of it all, I consider myself rather desensitized and therefore had no qualms looking at the pools of blood or the organs of those killed.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not quite at the \"so bad, it's good\" level. It's definitely atrocious, but I couldn't help myself from laughing or finding amusement at some of the scenarios. Maria correcting Yume about what she did, the entire episode that was basically a sexual innuendo, and the non sequitur that is the finale are all easy instances to point to that should have been \"serious\" but simply come off as highly humorous.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you think about terrible anime, Pupa should come to mind instantly. With its ridiculous story, forgotten and stale characters, and unintentionally funny showing, it's a miracle that this one was even green-lit in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, plot-holes, tonal shifts, and unrelatable theme\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, brooding, bloody, and boring art, \"unexplained\" character designs, low actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, underutilized, underdeveloped, with unfocused motif\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, bad OP, okay ED, bad soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, gore galore but laughing all the same\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 1/10",

To be honest, when I first read the plot for the series, I was intrigued... but I didn't start watching right away. But after a while, I came back to the page and was about to add it to my list, when suddenly, an army of wild 1/10 scores appears! I read them and thought... \"Is this really that terrible?\" Upon reading them, I decided not to get my hopes up on this anime, knowing aboutall the hate, but I was hoping it would be better than Mars of Destruction. In the end, it was, but my God, it was still bad...\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a brother and sister and their lives as they try their best to live out their lives as normally as possible. However, it proves to be quite difficult when the siblings find out that the sister is a flesh craving monster, and he can regenerate his body at incredible speed. Now, have you ever heard the phrase \"eaten out\" before? It is usually used in a sexual way, but with Pupa, the phrase is taken literally. The brother lets his sister eat him, usually in fairly erotic ways I might add... strangest time to raise the flag pole, seeing as I was watching someone practically get murdered over and over, but hey, I have no control over it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot had seemed interesting, in the end, it was just plain awful. Plot holes, hardly any character progression, and a filler ending to the series. It was honestly the worst thing about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound were the only good things about it. Produced by Studio Deen, with main characters voiced by Nobunaga and Ibuki, these 2 subjects were the only things I didn't actually hate about the series. Sadly, it wasn't nearly enough to give me any hope that the series would get better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were just plain... strange. We got our two main protagonists, brother and sister, who have been watching over each other for years after their parents split up (terrible parents, both of them, I might add). Somehow, I feel that if the series were to continue, we might have a bit of an incestuous relationship going on, especially while watching Yume eat her brother out (literally). Then there's the unmentionable villains. I will not be mentioning them, cause frankly they shouldn't even be considered plot characters. That's it on characters. Sad, huh?\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, I finished Pupa in one go, but seeing as it's not even the length of 2 episodes of anime, it's nothing to brag about, either hardcore otaku-wise or love of the show-wise. It was just terrible.\\n\\n\r\nDon't believe me? Watch it for yourself. I'm sure YouTube will have it up, seeing as it's not worth the effort to take it down.",

            "content": "Wow, I just went and checked the ratings and reviews on it on MAL, and everyone is being way too harsh on it. This has pushed me to write my own review to actually be informative instead of it being all about bitching about the series. It's your own faults for looking up anime from the synopsis only. Pupa is proof that the only way to know if the series is good or not is by checking it out yourself or asking others. \r\nI will try spoiling as little as I can the storyline and contents of the episodes.\r\nSince the synopsis is on this site,I won't resume it another time. The series progresses really quickly, from [u]episode to episode[/u] because of time lapse, except for one, which most people hate (I think 3 or 4, which looks like a sex scene between siblings [it's not]). It was the only really useless episode, considering I saw it in the censored version, so all you could [b]see[/b] were the noises... Yeah, I did that on purpose. Anyways, the story hooked me up still, so I plan on completing it, although most people are deceived by it. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not really attachable, It's not that type of emotional story. The story follows the progression of, let's call them, Big brother and Small sister, who both have the Pupa virus and lived a tough childhood. You understand that they only have each other. Aside from them, the other characters don't really look that interesting at all; the rest is all about people that want to harm or dissect them, like if they were a new species (which they have become). 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's not all that bad. It's not the same type of art you'd experience in modern anime, but it's not something unbearable, or something that deserves to be treated as such. There really is only one problem (which is relatively big) : censorship. Why is it present? I've got no idea. It's very inconsistent and inappropriate most of the time and it breaks most ties you could develop with the series. What I mean by all that is that they might censor \"A\" at some point and a few seconds later they will show us \"A\". It was a shoe. That is how I felt about this censoring... (It's obviously an example.) 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty mediocre, I feel as if the effects were done poorly; outside noises or sfx weren't realistic, I guess they were low on budget? It still manages, but yeah... As for the music, it's okay. The opening and ending are somewhat catchy, and it's interesting that they're also short. I think these two sort of save the other type of sounds in the series before being completely horrible in sounds overall. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to rate my enjoyment, which is most important for me when judging series, I'd go with a 6 out of 10. Not much explanation to do here, it's very personal. I would have really loved it is they dropped the censoring though. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, on an unbiased (no hating for what people, including me, were expecting out of it before it even came out) scale from one to ten, I think it deserves a 5.5 at least. I think people should judge it for what it is, not for what they wanted it to be. It's a short 4 minutes per episode series, so it should be treated as one. I don't think they're doing such a bad job on it either. Had it not been about the censoring and that one episode, I think its score would average 7 (or something like 6.6) on MAL.\\n\\n\r\nI will end up deliberating with a generous 6 (because I can't rate 5.5, but I still tend towards a 6 more than a 5). I would not recommend this series to anyone unless they are specifically looking for a short series both in terms of episodes and episode length. You could be against my score, but that is very low on my list. I was very surprised of the score here on MAL, since people hyped it up before it came out (which is the reason I gave it a try), but I believe it is also the reason for its abnormally low score. \\n\\n\r\nRemember, it's only your own faults for trying to turn it into what it's never been.",

            "content": "Sitting through Pupa is like a half-baked high-schooler trying to will something into existence on his blank essay paper. It doesn\u2019t deserve any praise, what it does deserve is to be buried alive, along with School Days and every other abomination created from the anime industry, deep into the ground where it can never see the light of day again. I have already done the work for you and watched it on your behalf, below are the reasons why you shouldn\u2019t bother wasting your time on this piece of trash.\r\nDubbed \u201cThe Worst Anime of 2014\u201d, Pupa is a little horror story about a brother andsister.  One day, the sister becomes a strange monster that feasts on human flesh, then from there, it essentially becomes an edge lords wet dream\u2014exploiting the audience for shock value, with no underlying rhyme or reason to it. On top of that, you have the combination of plot threads ending as soon as they begin. As for the story, it teases at having one, but ultimately goes nowhere, nothing makes any sense. Then when you think it can\u2019t get any worse, it has these blinding censorship bars that somehow makes the gore fest scenes even more of an eyesore. Scenes of eyes being gouged out feel routine and almost tame compared to the extreme dismemberment that other characters go through, sometimes while they're still alive\u2014this show violently screams edge! Probably the absolute worst example is an episode-long scene of Yume eating her brother's innards while reciting \"Onii-Chan\" in a very sexually suggestive manner that would fit right in at a Lannister family reunion; it's not just incest, it's necrophiliac incest. \\n\\n\r\nWhy her brother? Because he has regenerative powers, for some reason. Thermian Fallacy? You got it! Thanks to the sounds and subtext of the whole ordeal, the entire scene was uncomfortable and almost nauseating. What was the point to this scene? The answer is nothing! Just like the rest of the show, didn't really make much sense either. The horror continues when Pupa actually ends on a totally irrelevant flashback, blatantly dodging any attempt to explain itself. If I didn't talk about this, I might have mistakenly given you a reason to watch this but trust me, there is none. The episodes are over before they start, like this one episode\u2014where a different character is pregnant with some kind of monster of her own, poor explanation for it all, and this is the only scene that ever mentions it, immediately, it is abandoned in favour of other random nonsense. Honestly, it\u2019s hard to remember most of the series aside from a select few scenes, because the remainder is boring, poorly-written, and relies on shock value. It\u2019s not a troll, it isn\u2019t unintentionally humorous, and there's no air of mystery or suspense to any of this. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are awfully bad, one-dimensional, unrelatable and lack intelligence. The visuals are completely atrocious and it's poorly animated, you can\u2019t help but think, what on earth was studio DEEN even thinking? Filled with nonsensical dialogue and the background art never gives the viewers any real symbolism or atmosphere. Instead, you get red butterflies transmitting an evil flesh-eating disease\u2014no real subtext, no underlying theme and zero layers to the atmosphere. The soundtrack is forgettable, the sounds effects are repetitive and gratuitous that it totally ruined the effect and voice acting is limited due to run-time and monstrosity of a script. With only 4 minutes episodes, what is the point of having an Opening and Ending? Especially when they are far from being interesting. Pupa rather insults us by trying to be edgy, surrealist, and experimental, but just ends up being a product of an incestuous love affair in all of its deformity. \\n\\n\r\nApparently the manga's supposed to be a lot better, but the anime doesn't exactly give anyone any good reason to find out. Pupa is a tragedy, the experience of watching this is like a beautiful sunset wasted on the blind, a gorgeous symphony wasted on the deaf, a fabulous meal wasted on someone who just joined Weight Watchers. There is a good reason why this series has such a low score and not positively received, its much deserving of a lower score. It ticks all the boxes on how to make incoherently poor anime. On top of all the bad decisions Pupa went for, it just had to take the incest route, right? Well, just goes to show that incest is \u2018relatively\u2019 boring.\\n",

            "content": "Pupa is an anime of a generation. Few anime can come close in comparison to the intellectually stimulating progress of character and plot that pupa has to offer. Pupa is not just another one of \"those\" anime that are boring and unfun to watch like Gintama or Death Note. Pupa puts itself out there and clearly doesn't care what anyone thinks of it.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story of Pupa is so mentally challenging to me that at times I had to stop and have a moment of rumination. The thing about the story is that it takes turns in random directions where you never know where itsgoing to go next. It doesn't follow any of the standard norms that regular anime would adhere to, which makes it a breath of fresh air in the current anime productions of today. \\n\\n\r\nAs you follow the sibling dynamic duo, you'll find yourself asking questions like \"what's actually going on here?\", \"Is this a dream?\", \"What do the butterflies mean?\", \"What does the dad have to do with this?\". And as the story progresses, you'll find none of these are addressed explicitly because the creators entrust that the viewers are able to have the proper mental capacity to understand the concepts and motifs shown. In conclusion, the story is fantastic and the real selling point of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nStudio Deen hit a homerun with this art style. That's how amazingly brilliant it truly is. Some might say the scenes are bland and don't contribute to the overall tone conveyed. However, it is in this simplicity that the magic of the art comes to life. The scenes react and portray the inner struggles of the characters and the imagery used is phenomenal to express thoughts and feelings. The overall artwork and animation is near perfect with what this anime is about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nEver wonder what its like to be eaten by your little sister? Well, this anime is perfect for that because the little sister gores her older brother for sustenance so she doesn't have to kill anyone else. The sound quality as a whole is on point and the music is very nicely done. Nothing else to really say about the sound, as it was close to perfect in the messages and scenes being shown.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't even remember their names because of how thought provoking they really were. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIt was the fastest 37 minutes of my life. Pupa left me begging for more and unfortunately, there wasn't any.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nGee I don't even know if I can write anything for this other than it was utterly beautiful and I am at a loss of words. I am a changed person after this viewing experience. 10/10 everything.",

            "content": "This anime, I think, can't be understood literally. \r\nIt's a story about complicated and extremely painful relationship between brother and sister who were abused by their father since early childhood. The siblings are alone in whole world, adults are some kind of threat for them; so they begin to build their own world, their... cocoon of maturity. \r\nThe beginning of anime underlines: it's a story about siblings' love, and, actually, there IS a lot of love. Maybe, too much. But children haven't ever known what \"normal\" love should be. Their father abused them, their mother ignored them, and such type of relationship was \"so itbe\" for them. They are used to be beaten and to protect each other; now they are alone, they are closer to adults by age (but aren't adults YET), they can be free of abusing... More than it, their abuser wasn't interested in them during some time.\\n\\n\r\nBut they love each other so, so much, how should they express it? They were beaten and protecting each other before; now they are not beaten, can't feel pain and take more pain to protect the other. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, there is the virus, \"Pupa\" (which seems an allegory of being teenager, not child and not adult), and sister must hurt her brother to stay a human, not a monster. Literally she _eats_ him, but he's regenerating from time to time - he is also infected, regenerating is his only possibility. \\n\\n\r\nAll of us can understand the subtext of biting, eating and drinking blood - a sexual desire. The scenes between brother and sister, when he \"helps\" her, looks more like sex, than like anything else. They are partially naked, they are moaning, touching, she hurts him, he is bleeding, like a virgin girl - gender roles are vice versa, and this is the dark side of incest, like in manga \"Berserk\" (Serpico and Farnese), there a girl is absolutely dominant. But in \"Berserk\" we have other setting, the sexual desire's expressing more literally, and the parents are not so abusive - as a result, Serpico and Farnese are not so crazy for pain. They can express their love with other tools.\\n\\n\r\nBrother and sister in \"Pupa\" can't. Why? Because they are only pupas, cocoons. So their relationships are painful and horrible - they are not used to normal life, normal love, all is complicated and causing pain... now.\\n\r\nBut their cocoons may become butterflies someday - this is meant to be an adult. \\n\\n\r\nYou can understand \"Pupa\" only with allegorical thinking - and tremendous scenes from series are just footprints of reality, fantasies built around feelings grown in sadistic family. \\n\r\nFantasies, in which brother sacrifice his body for sister - not vice versa. He is her victim, her food, her desire, her crucified love; all we know that men can be cruel and love in one time. Women can too - anime shows it. \\n\\n\r\nHere we have a system of forbidden motives - incest and awful bloody love as the strongest. But it's definitely LOVE, mixed with desire and need in own sibling to be alive, to be a human; our morality's protesting, because most of us have good parents and don't know how is it to be beaten every day.\\n\\n\r\nWith the fact that this anime is short (imho it's good; I could understand the main idea and like it, now I'm interested in manga) and that it's thought to be a horror, not a family drama about teenagers who are siblings and love each other in forbidden way... I think it's not strange that it is underrated.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I had my pleasure to watch it - story and characters are real for me, I liked music and art... And extremely liked subtext of the story.",

In fact, it\u2019s so bad that I had to use a dictionary while writing this review, to look up words that accurately describe how bad it was.\u201d \u2013 Hanimir 2014\r\nIt\u2019s not easy finding words for what I have just forced myself to behold. There must be an objective opinion for everything, but how can such a thing be achieved if one sees himself confronted with the definition of the word horrible? Such is Pupa. Sometimes people just long for something that is bad, something that can make them appreciate other anime more, something that gives thema means of measuring quality, the far end of the spectrum. If that is what you looking for, look no further, if not then this anime is just a monumental waste of time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\r\nSo what is the story actually? Apparently it revolves around two siblings who were once the victims of domestic violence for some reason. The girl seems to have been a monstrous abomination from birth, capable of easily mutilating humans and consuming their flesh. Her brother seems to have no special characteristics, other than being infected by some kind of virus, whose form, effect or function is never explained. Anyway, so then there\u2019s this other woman who kind of likes to experiment with everything in the world and then there is this secret organization that kidnaps the siblings and does experimental things and\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I probably just spoiled you but such a thing cannot be helped with a total of twelve, four minute long episodes. A lot of the story elements are never properly disclosed in the arbitrarily thrown together chain of events, to the point where some things do not even make sense at all. Not going into detail, there is not much more to say here other than that it\u2019s bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10\\n\r\nVisual Quality does not help in any way to have Pupa appear in a better light, character arts are mediocre at most and backgrounds are naught more than atrocious. That in itself would not suffice to justify a score of two, if it wasn\u2019t for the god-awful censoring attempts. Black stains and white bars do not help to emphasize a shows atmosphere. I even found myself burst out in laughter that one time a guys severed torso was censored and he just slumped over to reveal his wound while the smudge that was supposed to cover him up did not move an inch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nIt is alright, the opening theme is fitting and pretty good so that is something. Not so many good points on the ending theme however and the rest\u2026 well I don\u2019t even really remember much of it. Let\u2019s just say it wasn\u2019t good like everything else about this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nJesus Christ on glow-in-the-dark rocket roller-skates. Okay so what do we have here. Let\u2019s start with the male protagonist Hasegawa Utsustu, whose entire existence is probably defined by his clover hairpin, much like people from other anime that shifted their conscious mind into a pair of glasses, just not as funny. He\u2019s a masochist who likes getting eaten by his sister, also he regenerates perpetually so he\u2019s fine with being eaten. No sir, I kid you not. The female protagonist is some kind of monster that eats humans; her favorite food is her brothers\u2019 tasty brawn, sometimes she seems to lose control and kills people. No sir, I do not jest. There are side characters but nobody cares, they don\u2019t actually do things or seem to have any impact on the situation. The characters behavior is in no way relatable or logical, there is no reasonable character development or reason to feel sympathetic for any of the cast. Pupa is probably the pinnacle of bad characters and there are a LOT of generic harem anime out there, starring recycled archetypes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nThis is the one instance where the word \u2018Appaling\u2019 is truly fitting. At least allmost, we're not quite there yet. There is nothing wrong with horror elements or gruesome animations but Pupa continues to be grotesque without reason. Whenever new bits of the questionable plot are revealed, you end up not craving more but shaking your head in awe at how the events are devoid of all reason. There is not anything you could derive some manner of enjoyment from here, except of course if cracking up over how bad everything is can be called a form of appreciation.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nResult: 2/10\\n\r\nLet me get one thing straight then, this does not deserve to be rated 1/10. Appalling is, when watching an anime causes a mental stress so great that it becomes unbearable to watch anymore. Pupa is not that yet but it\u2019s certainly on the far end of anything I have watched so far. If there is someone out there who feels offended by this review because he really likes this show, hell if I care. There are no words I could produce to make Pupa look good and you sir, whoever you are, should stop to base your enjoyment on how many intestines and chunks of flesh you see flying over the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the most objectivity I could muster, saying anything else then what I did would be a blatant lie. Move along, there is nothing here worth watching.\\n",

            "content": "You may be reading this review and thinking the following: ANOTHER POOPA REVIEW? Yes, another Pupa review. You may also be wondering why I flubbered early on. To answer your question, it was not me flubbering at all. I'm not Mayoi from Bakemonogatari and this series is just that: POOPA. I mean how bad can an anime be before it deserves a nomination for worst anime ever made or at least a total flop. Well, Pupa is both of those things and the proof was there before the anime even broadcasted its first episode. Upon finding out that Pupa was greenlit for four minute episodesinstead of a full duration, I just knew Pupa was going to be worse than spending a full day with a wild constipated Gorilla. Don't believe me? The anime adaption speaks for itself. Yes, give me that Gorilla because this anime is worse than that experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about as coherant as the anime \"Shamanic Princess\", but at least that anime was mildly entertaining at times. I'm an Otaku though so I fight foward seeing the goal of the ending of this anime in sight! A positive though in the story is no episode as of now should be as bad as the sixth episode, or at least it was around that. I will avoid spoilers though, that would be wrong to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is actually okay, but nowhere near the best of the season. The best is surely opinion, but this is likely not to be a top contender. The ending is very bleh, heck I barely remember it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are boring. I sometimes wish the \"Wake up Girls\" would wake me up, if you got that joke at all. If this anime was longer, the characters \"may\" of been better, but that is all speculation.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end? Pupa is terrible, simply terrible.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

What kind of person would liek let their sibling feast on them like that? It  have to take lots of guts (lol joke intended) to do that and the main character seemed to be not a little scared that his sister was that THING. it is also not original at all dis concept has been used many times where the character has a family member or friend that is a supernatural thing. nothing new at all but if done right it could've achieved more than a eyesore \\n\r\nscore: 1\\n\\n\r\nart\\n\r\nTHE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS!!!!! i liked the style but nope da artist didnt go into much detail liek in backgrounds or da small things mostly with characters then they got lazy and left background all weird looking. \\n\r\nscore: 4\\n\\n\r\nsound\\n\r\ni dont remember hearing annything musical or described as sound besides the sound of the sister eating her brother and saying onii-chan and dat is no where near music :p\\n\r\nscore: 1\\n\\n\r\ncharacter\\n\r\nlolol wat character oh you mean those people that are in dis anime? i couldnt even call them characters they are liek just there but like the story they make no sense and are very dull. IMO the mother was the best character cuz she tried to kill the little girl (MONSTER) thing before it killed her son (HUMAN). \\n\r\nscore: 2 (mother adds 1) \\n\\n\r\nenjoyment\\n\r\ni had no other way to waste some good 20 something minutes of my life on i be staring at pictures of old people doing the limbo if not watching dis at the time. i cant say dat you dthe viewer will enjoy it or anything\\n\r\nscore: 4\\n\\n\r\noverall\\n\r\na \"ANIME\" that is on the same level of mars of destruction. its entire existence is an eyesore and should be disposed of quickly. the creator of this wherever you are should be ashamed of making such a horrible thing. sit in that corner and think of what you done!!!!!! \\n\r\n-end of a terrible reivew :D but no where near the terrible of Pupa-",

            "content": "Pupa is a new anime based on a bloody and gory manga created by Sayaka Mogi.\r\nJust like the manga counterpart, the anime itself is thick laced with extreme gore and bloody effect. However, the violence was a bit toned down, and it was heavily censored once it was aired in television.\r\nThe manga itself was extremely satisfying for those hungering for bloodthirsty graphic. The anime version has also managed to almost captivated an audience like me to become entrapped in it's cycle of mayhem, but due to few reason, I had to surrendered a bit before being submissive as I am an entity that lust forblood, even though that it was merely drawn.\\n\\n\r\nLike many people has already claimed, Pupa were considered to become one of the worst anime ever to become presented on Earth ever since Mars Of Destruction was created in 2005. Pupa is without a doubt has a problem of it's own, but it isn't superbly as awful as people make it out to be because these people that voted negatively for it, were mostly just a bunch of whiny kid that has not much to be talked about in their reality and presumably trying to take all of his/her annoyance onto everybody else available on the internet. If it was an adult rampaging like a mere scarecrow that just got his straw hat taken away by crows, then what you would see there is an epitome of an older man/woman that couldn't bothered to think that he/she should get a job instead of rumbling in thinking that some people would cared to see his/her livid presentation. MyAnimeList is filled with annoyance of these kind, but this is a Pupa review, so I would get back on track. \\n\\n\r\nPupa was presented as a short anime format, given a time constraint of 5 to 6 minutes for each episode that were broadcast for a single episode each week. Nonetheless, back before it was being screened, people were screaming on how tempting they are to witnessed the violence that would be presented. However, once people were given information of the time constraint, many were disappointed, and some even has already published their hatred by saying something like, \"This is shit! I want more time to see more gore!, and so on many childish demeanour. MAL community is as bad as it is, and from which once this anime was presented, you can see how terrifyingly horrible it is was for the heart of men. The first episode were given to them whom mostly watched online without the need to pay, and 99% of the watcher dwell in rage as they doesn't have the capability to acknowledged the fact that the gore was censored and they couldn't watched more blood. Let me tell you, the people whom has witnessed the war wouldn't ever be more than willing to see more blood again, even though that he/she is a soldier. War is a deadly admission, and it would inflicted extreme psychological damage into the heart of those that can't faced it. These children that hungered for blood, are mostly savages that has never been on the battlefield and doesn't understand of the true fear of seeing a real botched up body in their eyes. The gore presented in Hollywood movies might make it out to be so realistic, but the truth is even more than capable of victimising you, scaring you enough to become crazy and then you would be hauled to the asylum. I am not a soldier, but I was to be involved in a massacre event that were remained a secret in my nation, and I'm one of the few survivor for such thing that happened when I was younger. There is no way I could provide evidence of involving in an event aforementioned, but hey, this is the internet of course. People might be lying, and an anonymous entity like me shouldn't be believed. While the downside is that I'm instead being a demonic blood hungering crude instead of being the opposite, the effect might be different for people, but still, even though the gore was censored from the animation of Pupa, it doesn't do it right to stamped that material with failures stamp just because of censorship and time constraint.\\n\\n\r\nStory- Many people bashed it because of it's storyline was way too horrible and perhaps were non existent at all, but for me, the storyline is there, or else there would be no need to write down a synopsis at all. Let see, the storyline involved of a brother trying to save her sister that were turned into a monster that hungered for flesh. Well, I wonder where the heck could I managed to located such a short synopsis..Hmm?..Most people claims of this having no storyline are baseless, and also since many were to be seeing this series just for the sake of blood, I find myself bewildered concerning on why would these trash would be looking for a storyline in the first place. Though, it is hard to understand what it is trying to tell, as Pupa time constraint were deliberately too short. The ending were a little abrupt, but that doesn't give people the advantages to bashed the ending too. Apocalypse Zero and Genocyber also has a very weird ending, but I don't see these series being mocked all the way to the end of the galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nArt -  This is where Pupa greatness should be acknowledged. However, many are just too thick headed on screaming failures that they failed to see other aspect that this work should also be credited for. The art for Pupa is chilling, extremely dark and monotonous, completely surreal enough for the theme it's trying to presented. It's literally dark, the atmosphere that is that it is hard enough to see the screen once the censorship began. With the usage of pastel like graphic that Studio Deen used while making Rozen Maiden Zuruckspulen, it fitted against the anime as nice as possible, and hell, Pupa wouldn't be so much enjoyable without it for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Such series has presented a deliberately wonderful sound effect, if I say so to myself. The bizarre noise compelled once the feast begin are haunting, as if you were experiencing it by your own self. This series also win for the sound factor, as this is how horror anime should be given with, an extremely realistic and hart sickening sound, that couldn't easily be forgotten. Another also has beautiful and eerily ghastly soundtrack which is similar to this anime and also in the term of genre. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Quite a bit of an disappointment here because each character aren't properly fleshed out and some character either gone missing later on or aren't discussed one bit. But, I wouldn't blamed you, Studio Deen, like many other incomprehensible fool around MAL. The time constraint has clearly taken a lot of toll here. However, if you were to properly analysed the main character yourself instead of watching the anime explaining itself, you might managed to guessed out a few pointer. Some people expressed their horrible \"concern\" of the male main character might be gay just because of the hairclip, but guess what, it was a very important material for him. But, you know, people wouldn't understand another and more likely to mocked him/her if she/he was an anime character. As for the female main character, her situation was very scary indeed, and those with no heart couldn't possibly understand the grave situation these two sibling are involving in. Hitting on her just because she always kept mentioning \"Onii-chan?\" Well, aren't you a bunch of sceptical and open minded being. Tried getting an adoption for a sister for once, and you understand how hard it is for a real brother to witnessed such a pain that were encountered by her beloved sister. Incest? No. The male character is a true man, trying to helped her sister in every possible way, including of giving away his body and succumbed in endless pain. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Not much to be explained here. If you like watching a series that has a very minor way of explaining thing and let the viewer guessed themselves, then you might as well enjoyed this very confusing show. It is not for the gore fan though, even though it is ripe with it because it also has a storyline that it is trying to tell and a sad one too. But, people clearly doesn't get it and abolished every single factor that is available in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- This show astounded me, as I'd understand of the theme and the hard to grasped storyline. Pupa clearly need a lot more investment into it though in order for it to developed more, as the time constraint given for this show is what driven most of the best part into the wall. Pupa need a lot more time to properly explained itself, and I bet that even Studio Deen would agreed on this. I do hope for a reboot of this show someday. This show is not at it's best at the moment and I do hope that some people would understand the sadness and trial faced by the two sibling that is the main character for Pupa, but all I get is nothing but grief and baseless mockery. Well, I guess that's what you get if you were to given anime to a bunch of children that never learn to appreciate something and were spoiled. Like some of the review here had mentioned but I'd reversed the sentences, very easily does we see a bunch of anime fan that failed in every aspect of trying to judge a series that were should be acknowledged throughout every session inside and out. MAL community are evolving at it's out most extreme patheticness < This is not even a word and some has typed this down and that review has received the most \"Helpful\" vote. Really?\\n\\n\r\n By the way, please be at least knowing to the fact that people would be finding that this review doesn't helped at all. The more \"touchdown\" I get, the more I shall laugh.",

            "content": "Before I start I want to say I'll try to be as fair as possible considering the amount of backlash Pupa has already gotten. That said most of the backlash is well deserved; now for the review. Where do I even begin on this one, I first heard of this show through an anime season chart and the synopsis and style seemed fairly interesting especially when compared to the droves of slice of life and moe shows the industry churns out. Unfortunately it was delayed and while that's unfortunate my anticipation, and I'm sure many others', was still present. Little did we know that wewere anticipating something the like of which had never, or rarely, been seen....and believe me that was not a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you first watch this show the first thing you'll notice is the length it's 4 minutes an episode which is already misleading as Deen had the gall to devote 1 minute to an OP and ED which cuts it down to 3 minutes. This format has worked for series' before, most notably Inferno Cop , but the glaring difference is that Inferno Cop never presented itself as anything more than comedy not meant to be taken seriously. Pupa takes itself all too seriously.\\n\\n\r\n                                  *MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*\\n\r\nSTORY - 4\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Utsusu and Yume, a brother/sister pair who have had a rough, life this has left Utsusu with a guardian complex and Yume almost completely dependent on him. Nothing groundbreaking there, things get weird when Yume sees a butterfly and  a weird witch-esque woman, transforms into a horrible monster and goes on a murderous rampage eating people, Utsusu arrives on the scene and despite better judgement finds his sister and miraculously accepts her as the monster, firmly believing that Yume is still in there somewhere...............she kills him.\\n\\n\r\nPupa opts to show and not tell, leaving the viewer to make connections and fill in plot points on their own. Something which has been done before but fortunately what Pupa does show us is absolutely useless at times. One episode is devoted to Yume feeding on Utsusu in a scene with incestuous overtones that are about as subtle as a brick to the face. We are told nothing important to the plot (other than onii-chan....seriously this is the only bit of dialogue in the episode) and are left feeling as if your times been wasted. For a something that lasts about the length of a song, that's quite a feat. Now don't get me wrong some episodes DO give us glimpses into what might be an interesting plot, but it's over just as you start getting hooked. If I could change one thing about this series it would be more time, at least 10 minutes per episode to give the audience something to sink it's teeth into......no pun intended.\\n\\n\r\nART - 2\\n\r\nThe art isn't the worst I've seen but it certainly isn't the best, the colors look washed out and dull and the copious censoring(and there is a lot of it) leaves you looking at black or white screens more often than not. The animation is stiff, lifeless, and above all boring to look at, even for the gory or action scenes there are points where you're subjected to still shots with voices played while the camera pans over them. Corners cut? ABSOLUTELY!!!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 3\\n\r\nAbsolutely mediocre bordering on bad, the voice acting is generic. Most characters simply say things, no emotion or proper delivery behind them. The background music is just as bad, if an OST is ever released I wouldn't be surprised if the track listing went something like.:\\n\r\n2- Generic Sad Theme\\n\r\n3-Generic Tense Theme\\n\r\n4-Generic Action Theme\\n\r\nIts that bad. One saving grace is the Opening which reminds me of Another or Rozen Maiden; whenever I hear it I can't help but hum along. It's only 30 seconds but it's the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 2\\n\r\nLaughable, there isn't any. Utsusu can be summed up with \"Yume\" and Yume can be summed up with Onii-chan.\"  The supporting cast is equally dull but not for lack of trying, Maria (the witch lady) is at this point a generic ambiguous villain whose true motives will be revealed later (hopefully). Her sidekick Hotoki, in all 1 minute of his appearance has solidified himself as the 2nd most enjoyable character on the show (Yume and Utsusus mother being the most). Everyone else is faceless and unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 3\\n\r\nI truly don't know why I continue watching, I really don't enjoy it. I feel like I'm being teased by this show.The hints of something interesting are quickly losing their mystique and I don't know how much longer I'll continue watching which is why I'm writing this review in hopes of shedding some light on what future viewers, if there are any, are in for.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 3",

            "content": "There are many different kinds of bad. There's the \"came really close to being decent but was ultimately irredeemable\" bad, the \"who the hell put together the staff that botched this idea\" bad, the \"Jesus Christ who thought that would ever be a good idea in the first place\" bad, and of course the ever popular \"so bad that it's hilariously amazing\" bad. Today, however, we'll be looking at another type of bad, a bad that I like to describe as \"hyped beyond any possible reality and then proceeds to slam into every single hurdle\"bad. Hype can often be a dangerous thing for a TV series, especially when the series shows signs of malnutrition before it even begins airing. Today, we'll be looking at what was possibly the biggest letdown of 2014, as we come to understand what steps a series incurs on the spiral downward towards infamy.\\n\\n\r\n          Our story focuses on two teenagers, Utsutsu and his little sister, Yume. One day after school, Yume runs into a dog with a rather strange infection, and is then attacked by said dog. Utsutsu later finds Yume lying unconscious, but as soon as he approaches, her body starts to morph and change into that of a monster, and she ends up attacking Utsutsu as well. Both siblings have been infected by a virus called Pupa, which mutates its host into monsters with an insatiable appetite for human flesh, though, curiously, Utsutsu ends up taking on bizarre regenerative abilities rather than turning into a monster like his sister, and so he decides to lend his body to Yume for her to feed on.\\n\\n\r\n          While the story itself is important, I think it's almost just as important to learn the story behind how this anime came to be what it is now infamous for. Originally, Pupa was set to air in the Fall 2013 season as a regular, full-length TV series, and the hype that was being generated for it was pretty high, putting it at approximately 3rd place for most anticipated of the season, right after Kyoto Animation's Beyond the Boundary and Studio Trigger's Kill la Kill. However, as soon as the Fall season began, it was announced that the series would be pushed back to the Winter 2014 season. While there's not much information on why this is, the most often cited answer is that Studio Deen had problems finding a TV station that would air something that has as much gore as Pupa had. Another theory suggested that the series suffered significant budget problems and was forced to delay its premiere. Then, at the beginning of November 2013, it was announced that Pupa would only be a four-minute TV short series, rather than the usual 24 minutes. Regardless of the reasons for its setbacks, the result was both one of the most memorable failures and most abhorred anime of the season.\\n\\n\r\n          So, what exactly is wrong with Pupa? To go back to a point I brought up way back during my review of Tonari no Seki-kun (https://www.facebook.com/notes/ember-reviews/ember-reviews-tonari-no-seki-kun/1481071598788328), and more recently my review of Magica Wars (https://www.facebook.com/notes/ember-reviews/ember-reviews-magica-wars/1574541519441335), when creating a TV short, it's important to remember that a non-continuous, episodic format is most likely the only format that will actually work, and attempting to have a continuous, week-to-week story in four-minutes chunks is basically a death wish. To put it more simply, it's practically impossible to have any significant development happen in the span of four minutes (technically three since it also has two 30-second animations for its opening and ending), and any attempts at development miss the mark entirely. When taken as a whole, the series almost feels more like a recap movie rather than an original animation, with actions and plot devices happening without any buildup to them whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\n          The sad part, unfortunately, is that this actually had the makings of a really strong anime. If you actually sit back and look at the themes being presented, themes like cannibalism, family bonds, and parental abuse, you can clearly see that the original story for Pupa was incredibly strong, and it even seems to match my own strict requirements for a true horror series with its unbelievably dark plot events and intense reliance on psychological terror. I normally don't bring up the original source material in my anime reviews, but after the first time I dropped this series in around February, I decided to see if the manga was any better. Sure enough, it was actually fairly solid, and I plan on reading more of it. Unfortunately, all of the potential themes and plot points for this series could never amount to anything simply because there wasn't enough time for them to happen. To put the actual time in perspective, the entirety of Pupa, minus the opening and ending animations for each episode, adds up to 36 minutes (48 with the opening and ending still attached), making it about the same length as one and a half regular TV episodes. Now, 36 minutes is technically enough time to tell a story, as a regular episodic TV series can easily do it in 24, but when that story is divided up into twelve segments of plot, it simply becomes impossible. \\n\\n\r\n          I could go on to discuss character development and lack thereof, or how the plot jumps from scene to scene so fast it'll make your head spin, or the fact that there are at least two gigantic plot points left unresolved at the end of the series, but it's always going to come back to the fact that the episodes don't allow time for any of said developments to occur. I will say that, aside from this, the final episode was unbelievably disappointing. As it turns out, the actual main story of Pupa ends after episode 11, and episode 12 simply uses a flashback for a vain attempt at character development that should have happened halfway through the series, preferably right before the episode that spends all of its three minutes showing Yume eating a hole in Utsutsu's chest.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced by Studio Deen, and considering their past works, you would not be at fault for thinking that it looks bad. However, this series, while not reaching the level of \"insultingly good,\" is still leaps and bounds better than its story. The character designs and environments are very basic and simplistic, yet charming and effective, and there seems to be an overall fuzz or haze filter that creates this very unsettling atmosphere which, while completely unfitting for a full-length series, fits perfectly with its TV short format. I do have a few gripes about the gore however, as it is rather inconsistent. Sometimes the gore is hyper realistic and shows even the exact muscle structures and organs, and other times it's just a big purple-red mush. Additionally, as of today, October 31, 2014, the series is still heavily censored, but what really bugs me about it is there doesn't seem to be any central guideline for the censoring. Sometimes straight-up gore is censored, and sometimes it isn't, and somehow a naked breast is shown without any censorship at all. Someone pulling out a knife is censored, but showing them holding the knife isn't. It's honestly just one big giant mess.\\n\\n\r\n          The music was composed by MOKA\u2606 (Elfen Lied), and is even more impressive than the animation. Most of it is simple electronic swells and dissonances, but there are also a few occasional piano melodies, my favorite being the main theme whose happy and jaunty tune is always used ironically by being coupled with a scene of Yume eating Utsutsu. The opening them \"pupa\" was performed by Ibuki Kido & Erii Yamazaki and gives us a solid heavy rock/electronic track, while the ending theme \"Dare yori Suki na no ni\" was performed by Kusuma San Shimai and plays us out with a simple and uninteresting ballad-like piece.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, despite possibly having the makings of a good, or even great series, Pupa is an unforgiving mess completely devoid of any development for its story or characters, but is this really the worst anime of 2014? Not at all, as that title still firmly rests with Magica Wars, and that's honestly why I wanted to do this review in the first place. Unlike Magica Wars, I can actually see a reason for Pupa to exist, as it does have a huge amount of potential, and I will remain hopeful that an OVA remake is resting somewhere in the minds of much better directors and animation studios.\\n\\n\r\n          If you still wish to partake in this near-atrocity, Pupa, while still unlicensed for DVD distribution, is currently available for streaming over on Crunchyroll.",

This series had potential and i was really looking forward to it but studio deen took a massive shit on my excitement by releasing this piss poor adaptation of a fantastic manga. The art style is probablly the worst thing about this anime. it is UGLY down to a fucking T! the backgrounds and objectslook like a 3 year old colored them and the animation is stiff and boring to look at. This has to be the most ugliest animation ever to grace an anime period. The opening is actually my favorite thing in the show, and it pretty much takes up a good portion of the runtime. Studio Deen ruined what could have been a great horror anime. This is just sickening to see since it had SO MUCH POTENTIAL. Overall there is nothing good about this series (Except the opening) The story is gone, its ugly as hell, and its just painful to watch. You should definitely just forget this ever existed and read the manga. That is the best option or submit yourself to this bottom of the barrel \"anime\" and hope you don't kill yourself after watching this piece of shit.",

            "content": "Pupa is an interesting little creation. Originally set to be aired in Fall 2013, the show's production seemed to be riddled with uncertainty, eventually being pushed to being aired in Winter 2014 in 4-minute long episodes. The show has a dark but oddly enticing premise that promised to rip through comfort zones and break taboos. The vagueness of the premise and its twisted implications served to deepen its allure, as did the delay in its release. Needless to say, it caught the interest of many in the anime fan community. After all the waiting and wondering if the show was even going to be made,it finally aired... and boy, it is one mess of a show.\\n\\n\r\nPupa's story is a bizarre and gruesome one, both in content and execution. It chronicles the twisted, cannibalistic relationship between Utsutsu and his younger sister Yume, who is turning into a monster. See, Yume was infected with the mysterious Pupa virus, which periodically transforms her into a horrific monstrosity that will eat any living thing she comes across. To appease the beast, Utsutsu offers up his own flesh to Yume, only to find out he is also infected with the Pupa virus, which gives him regeneration; allowing him to offer up his body for Yume to devour time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nGrotesque as the story might be, there is a lot of potential here. For Utsutsu to continuously allow himself to suffer such physical pain for Yume's sake indicates an uncomfortably strong attachment to his sister, even an unhealthy one. This is in line with the fetishistic brother-sister relationships which have become prominent in anime, but with a more sinister edge given the show's content. The premise almost acts as a subversion of the sister-fetish trend, with the relationship being physically self-destructive for Utsutsu, and likely mentally damaging for both of them. This is a corrosive relationship that sees sibling love go to dark and thoroughly unhealthy extremes yet a horrifyingly necessary one for Yume. Flashbacks reveal that Utsutsu's obsessive over-protectiveness of his sister stems from a troubled family life and parental abuse, adding more unsavory implications to the equation.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a shame, then, that the show is only able to gloss over these issues rather than fully fleshing them out. This is very much because of the 4-minute running time of the episodes. This small amount of time forces us, the viewers, to see the situation through a keyhole rather than allow us to see the whole picture. Episode 6 most clearly exemplifies the show's potential to subvert the sister-fetish trope, with Yume eating Utsutsu portrayed in a way that is discomfortingly sexual. This  scene, however, takes up the entire 4-minutes of the episode; four agonizingly slow and uncomfortable minutes. There isn't any room in an episode to be contextualize the themes of the show, so it becomes simply gratuitous. This is incredibly damaging to the show; without effective development of the themes of parental abuse and a damaging borderline incestuous sibling relationship, all that remains is shallow shock factor with questionable value. That the final episode is completely unnecessary, not to mention completely tone dissident from the rest of the show, is a testament to this.\\n\\n\r\nThe restricting time constraints also rob the show's plot of coherence. There are dozens of unanswered questions and hanging plot threads. The titular Pupa virus never gets a definitive explanation, it is never made clear how the virus functions outside of what is required by the premise, or even how it came into existence. A mysterious woman called Maria, who knows more about the Pupa virus than the two protagonists, gets almost no screen-time in comparison. A secret organization(?) is introduced late in the series with no clear motivation besides apparently trying to destroy the Pupa virus, somehow. Events in the plot have no clear flow, and unfold with little cohesion or connection to one another. The story overall is a clustered mess of various plot points that gets entangled in itself, and ultimately loses sight of where it is going.\\n\\n\r\nDirector Tomomi Mochizuki's (Ocean Waves, House of Five Leaves) visual direction and sound design are actually a saving grace for the show, despite the obviously low production values. Sure, the character designs aren't strikingly unique, and the rampant censorship does hurt the series. However, the washed-out watercolor of the world these characters inhabit gives the visuals a haunting quality. Mochizuki direction is sometimes like a hazy fever dream, scenes of horror unfold like waking nightmares. The use of teddy bears to enact horrific events is also surprisingly effective. The orchestral and piano driven score is filled with dissidence, and even the few tracks that aren't heavily dissident are quite melancholy. This works well to create a haunting atmosphere. The munching noises Yume makes while feasting on her brother are also appropriately nasty. Still, production values as low as the ones for this show are a hindrance not even the best of direction can hide, and Mochizuki's direction is only just competent. There are some images that fail to look the least bit frightening, and perhaps even comical, because of the dismal budget behind them. Most notably, a scene where Yume is transforming into her monster form in order to unleash her wrath on soldiers that are torturing her brother and holding the siblings captive; her glowing eyes and inhuman appendages just look silly. An abundance of stills are used, and tracks of music are revisited over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think Pupa is quite the unwatchable failure that its detractors claim it to be. However, that isn't to say the show is good or even successful, it is not. It does have an intriguing premise, some haunting imagery, and a decent grasp on atmosphere. Unfortunately, those are the extents of Pupa's accomplishments, because nearly every other aspect is a mess. This really is a disaster of production, courtesy of the infamous Studio Deen, which won't be getting any boosts in reputation from this somewhat ambitious but very much failed project. Which is just a shame, because Pupa could have very well been a delightfully nasty tale of the macabre.",

There was too little feeling while eating him for me (maybe that scene has any romantic akcent).\\n\r\nEnding satisfied me - it's even like happy ending etc...\\n\\n\r\nArt 7\\n\r\nIt's matched good for this animation and story, some scenes & characters looking great - everything achieve that specific mood with style.\\n\r\nBackgrounds are poor, but quality of that what should be showed is good, but as I said be4 there's too much censure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7\\n\r\nVoices very good match to Yume, her father and Maria.

            "content": "Anime exists as a former of entertainment. It is here to make us laugh, cry, and leave us in pure awe. But when a show like Pupa comes around, it is no longer entertainment. It is rather pure torture. As this anime just ended, I finally decided to watch it because I knew it's episodes are short and there was NO WAY I'd watch this weekly. So I watched it...in less than an hour...and I've come to the conclusion that it is one of the most poorly executed anime I've ever seen. \r\nSTORY: 1/10\r\nNow, the premise isn't bad. You've got a brother and sister withthe sister being some sort of monster who devours human beings. Or as it is listed \"The Life and Death sibling story.\" No, that seems like it could work as a good horror anime right? Well it didn't. It didn't work at all. EVERY EPISODE IS ABOUT 3 MINUTES LONG. That is torture to watch. You cannot develop ANYTHING in 3 minutes. You can not have exposition or any real progression in a story in that short amount of time. I don't know what Studio Deen was thinking. Once heard it was supposed to be a movie or something and it got cut back to this mess of a TV show. I'm not as mad about how bad the story was executed, as I am mad that this had a lot of potential if it was a real 12 episode series with 22 minutes per episode. Since not much good horror anime have come out lately...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 2/10\\n\r\nThe characters are cookie cutter at best. You've got your extremely protective older brother, your Onii-chan screaming, flesh eating, adorable little sister character, and a few others that I didn't bother to remember. No real development comes from them. Its weird to see things like episode 6 where the entire thing is just her devouring her immortal brother. The relationship sure is unique I guess. \\n\\n\r\nART: 4/10\\n\r\nThe animation is done by none other than Studio Deen. It's decent at best albeit a little unique for what it is but it's nothing to special. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 4/10\\n\r\nThere was nothing memorable about the soundtrack really. The only song that I'll remember is the opening theme. Pupa!......Pupa! Pupa!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\\n\r\nOVERALL: 2/10\\n\r\nI would find it really hard to believe if you were to tell me that you enjoyed this anime. Trust me, there are much better horror anime than this pile of garbage. It is one of the most poorly executed anime I've ever seen. I didn't think it would turn out this bad. Hell, the show didn't even end, the FINAL EPISODE IS JUST A DAMN FLASHBACK THAT HAS ALMOST NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING. Last thing I'll say is that I in fact watched the show on Crunchyroll. On the website and I'm assuming everywhere else, they CENSORED all the gory scenes. I cannot even begin to describe how pissed I am about that. It's really really annoying when I'm going into a show fully expecting a lot of violence and blood and gore and HALF THE SCREEN IS BLACKED OUT WITH CENSORING. They are releasing an uncensored version on Blu-Ray DVD coming soon and I will tell you right now there is no way in hell that it's worth it. Well anyway thanks for reading this little review of mine. (Even though it was just me bashing the shit out of this travesty)\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it? \\n\r\nFuck no.\\n\\n\r\nDo I regret watching it?\\n\r\n...yeah.",

If you want to waste your 48 minutes of your life then try to watch this. \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThis anime is a horror and psychological anime. This is a story about a brother and sister who has been abandoned by their parents.They have been orphaned. These siblings support each other to live. One day, they saw a red butterfly.

            "content": "Ever since the over-rated Boku no Pico came to popularity with it's weird fetishes I have looked for a hentai that appeals to my REAL and SENSIBLE fetishes and I've got to say, Pupa is arguably the greatest cannibalistic, incestuous, gore hentai I have ever seen in my life and it dominates that market.\r\nStory: \r\nA hentai with a STORY???? You may be asking yourself, why yes! The story follows the love between a brother and sister who were abused by their dad, one day yume turns into a monster that eats people and that's when the real good stuff gets going, she's locked up andher brother vows to be her feed for the rest of her life, if you want some really steamy hot action of these cannibal scenes I recommend episode 6, they have a whole episode dedicated to it ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). After the incident they're outcasts and a bunch of crazy things happen to them that I won't spoil, it's a rollercoaster of emotions, self revelations, and super sexy gore, disembowelment and flesh eating. The story takes a lot from Elfen Lied, because the little girls powers are akin to that of vectors where she has arms coming out of her back that she controls to kill people and the OST is arguably up there with Lilium.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound in this is like no other, the screams of agony are bone chilling and the show really focused on the ost and ending, so much so they dedicate an entire minute of the four minute show, EACH EPISODE! That's some dedication to your sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is where the real story of this hentai comes from, the love of onii chan and yume is a passionate and true love, the likes I haven't seen since Asuna and those tentacles from the alfheim arc of sword art online (Come on you and I both know she loved those tentacles ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)) The story shows how far onii-chan goes to protect his sister, even sacrificing himself by being her feed causing agonizing pain for him, (which also leads to great hentai scenes). Really great overall, probably as close to \"perfection\" as any medium of entertainment can get.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIS THIS EVEN A CATEGORY? This hentai is awesome! It appeals to all my fetishes while also having a story in the likes that I have never seen before. \"Your Name.\"? More like my name, and that name is PUPA!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nProbably the greatest hentai I have ever seen, even beating out the likes of tentacle and witches AND boku no pico. Overall an underrated masterpiece that most normies won't be able to understand, but if you read this far, you understand, and I understand.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI had to give the art a 9 because in episode 4 there was a part at the end where blood gushed out of onii-chans arm, and you can tell this blood was not the best they could do, really seem liked they wanted to save budget, rightfully so because of what happens later on, but as a professional anime connoisseur I can not let this grievance pass me by, it would be a stain on my integrity as an anime reviewer and hentai lover.",

I watched the entire thing hoping that there was some point to the entire series, but there was none. Well... the creator may have meant the work to be satirical in nature about how depraved incest between siblings happens to be, but if it was meant to be satirical it crossed the line of noreturn into a gory slasher film. So... if you happen to like slasher works, then go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise though it isn't worth the time. I personally feel that once you've seen one plotless slasher film, you've seen them all. The only redeeming thing is the art work. The plot... non existent. The characters... well, there are major plot holes. You take your pick.",

            "content": "I started watching Pupa even after having seen the extremely low rating on MAL and the numerous reviewers watching others not to watch it. Unfortunately, I naively decided to watch it in hopes that maybe it\u2019s not so bad after all. \r\nNow, kiddies, don\u2019t make the same mistake as me. Trust MAL. People know what they\u2019re talking about. Let\u2019s face it, most anime have a score above five, so seeing one at four has got to mean something. \r\nThe story itself isn\u2019t so bad, it\u2019s actually relatively good, but that\u2019s all thanks to the original manga. The people making this anime had no sense ofstory whatsoever. First, 4 minutes per episode is pure trollops. Even RWBY episodes are longer than that. Secondly, there are so many holes that I was left feeling quite lost. Concepts are pulled out of their arses just to vanish into thin air, forgotten. \\n\r\nThis anime fulfils it\u2019s role of \u2018psychological\u2019 and \u2018horror\u2019 to a tee. Normally, I like psychological, horror I guess I can cope with, I mean I didn\u2019t find Another that bad, but this was just horrible. After a few episodes I was left feeling quite distraught and questioned whether I should keep watching. \\n\r\nThanks to the terrible episode layout, which I shall talk about later, the storyline went kablooey and all over the place. To finish it off, it was also superbly rushed.\\n\r\nI just have to give story a 3. It\u2019s really a shame. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of characters wasn\u2019t so terrible, but the art in general was. The scenery was some kind of uneventful watercolour background which may as well have been absent. Some of the shots just plain looked like stills. Basically, they put some - SOME - effort into the characters, and none into anything else. I also think they concentrated a little too much on the gory scenes. Let\u2019s face it - Pupa is graphic, no doubt in my mind, and absolutely not for those of the faint of heart. Maybe not even for me. \\n\r\nArt gets a 4.\\n\\n\r\nSound was pretty terrible. Whilst the actual quality of it wasn\u2019t so bad, the choices were. Let\u2019s start with the opening/ending themes. The opening theme, even though I still stand by my point of view that it was useless music wasting 30 seconds, it was fitting of the anime. Yet, towards to the end of it, it speeds up dramatically in a way that never ceases to surprise me. It seems as if they cut a four minute song which gradually sped up. The ending theme is so unfitting, and it feels like it was once more a longer song. This time, they don\u2019t even bother to end it properly - it simply fades out, once again catching me by surprise every time. \\n\r\nThere are also numerous short violin pieces within the episode itself. I think they\u2019re supposed to be suspenseful but are more like failures. Sometimes, they are unfitting, and other times, they are cut short, much like the other themes of the anime. \\n\r\nAside from music, the sounds of cries of pain which are predominant in much of the episodes are so well done that I feel sick to the stomach upon hearing them. So much that I actually decided to watch the anime without sound. \\n\r\nI just have to give sound a 2.5.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty much in shock about the characters. I can\u2019t even begin to describe them. Sadly, I mean this in a negative way. I don\u2019t know what exactly to say about the older brother - can\u2019t even remember his name. He is sweet in the sense that he\u2019s protective of his younger sister to the point of letting her eat him alive, but sometimes this character trait is so emphasised that it seems to be his only trait, not to mention way overboard. The sister is super weird - she eats her brother, causing him immense pain, as she keeps thinking \"Onii-chan, onii-chan\u2026\u201d which is practically a contradiction. I swear sometimes it\u2019s the only word she knows, and I just want to smack her sometimes and yell at her to shut up and perhaps even turn her brain off. \\n\r\nCharacters also gets a 2.5, just because I would like to be nice.\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy watching this anime at all. Firstly, the episodes are too short, and yet about a minute out of each of them is wasted on the super strange opening and ending. The plot goes wishy washy all over the place, and concepts are introduced only to be forgotten in the next moment. The episodes are so badly planned out as well - most of them spend a whole three minutes showing the sister eating the brother as he cries out in pain. There is a lot of the sister eating people. \\n\r\nI understand that this is supposed to be horror and psychological. That\u2019s why I wanted to watch it. It honestly sounded interesting and I honestly started watching it without prejudice, thinking that surely it mustn\u2019t be all that bad. I\u2019m so sorry to say that I was wrong. It is psychological to the point that it is deeply disturbing, and I find myself shaking. That is just a no. \\n\r\nI would give enjoyment a 1. The thing is that, I did watch the first few episodes in a row. I found it intriguing. That would deserve at least a 2. But once it passed the ninth episode, I honestly questioned whether I should watch any more. I didn\u2019t want to, to be honest, but since I had already come so far, I thought that I might as well finish it. (Note: As of yet, I haven't actually finished it) \\n\\n\r\nI honestly didn\u2019t want to give this such a bad score. I honestly didn\u2019t. But, all I\u2019ve got to say is that if you\u2019re going to make an anime, might as well put in some effort. This was dreadful. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nSound: 2.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 2.5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.6/10 (rounded to a 3)\\n\\n\r\nIf you look at my anime list, you\u2019ll see that I tend to give anime good scores. I want to. Sure, I won\u2019t dish out 10s easily (in fact, I don\u2019t believe I ever will) but I\u2019m not harsh either. I\u2019m willing to accept imperfections. \\n\r\nThis is truly a new low, which is really a pity. So, take my advice: the cover art for this anime is better than the anime itself. Don\u2019t watch it, save yourself the pain.",

If it is yes, you might give this a try.\r\nFirst of all, the story. This anime really doesn't explain you anything. It's just a vague mess of (censored) gore, (censored) cannibalism and (censored) fighting. It's kind of funny, tough since they even censored a knife at one point, yes. A knife. And to censor it they used a ray of light that... covered atleast 30% of your screen...?\r\nThen the characters, to keep itbrief: It's just as vague as the story. Apparently the main characters are a brother and sister, the latter occasionally eats her brother, yes. Eats. I won't tell you about the other characters since they are just as vague and even harder to describe for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very bad, there aren't many movements and the characters are poorly drawn. I do like the opening art, but the opening is just a mere slide-show. The opening might even be the best thing of the whole anime since the OP-song is good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI only watch this anime because it's kind of enjoyable to watch, since I'm one of those persons who can watch something when its 'So bad it's good', but if the episodes where longer than 5 minutes I would have dropped this right away.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(I'm Dutch and this is my first review here, please don't mind my grammar mistakes)",

(I was in the mood for some violence) I am saying this to tell you that when i sat down to watch Pupa i was wanting and expecting violence.\r\nSTORY\r\nPOSITIVES\r\nI thought it was genuinely sweet how the brother and the sister cared so much for eachother. If you watch the last episode first, it shows this pretty well.\r\nI also think that their relationship with each other was an interesting take on the disease they both had and how they dealt with it.\r\nSTORY\r\nNEGATIVES\r\nTherewere many aspects of the story that were . . . . inconsistent or missing. Firstly, both of them have the disease but only one of them shows the symptom of craving human flesh.\\n\r\nNext, the dog at the very beginning of the show was never explained. The little girl had the disease since birth so what was the relevance of the dog? Why did THAT trigger what it did?\\n\r\nAlso, these siblings had been together through thick and thin. They had abusive parents and led a very harsh life. So why is it that neither of them had realised they had regenerative abilities until they were in highschool. Why did neither of them seem to eat people before the start of the show?\\n\r\nJust the fact that everything starts when it does is just convenient to the plot.\\n\r\nMoving away from the siblings, another one of the main plots involving the witch is never followed up on! I genuinely wanted to know where that was going! Maybe to know to witches backstory too! Maybe if the show was 2, 22 minute OVAs and not 12, 2 minute mini-sodes, it wouldve been better in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\r\nAny show that has very little / no censorship gains bonus points with me as well because when i watch a horror, i want to see the blood and gore. Good job Pupa!\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nNEGATIVES\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty un-inspired and alot of looping of animations was used to cut costs.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\r\nNothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nNEGATIVES\\n\r\nNothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\r\nSome people may think that the overly devoted siblings troph are un-inspired and annoying. I think its sweet especially with the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nNEGATIVES\\n\r\nThe characters relationship means very little unless you watch the last episode and even then, it still may not satisfy many viewers.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nPOSITIVES\\n\r\nI went in wanting violence and really didnt care much about the story.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nNEGATIVES\\n\r\nI was still left disappointed at the end. I wish there was more really.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nPupa is something you may watch if you are looking for excessive violence, into cannibalization in your shows, don't care much about story, and/or want a very fast show to watch. I fell under every single on of those categories so i enjoyed it enough. Im glad i watched it but i won't be watching it again. If there was more to it, i would've given it a much higher rating. Too bad they leave you hanging on so much.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like this review, check out some of my others! Tell me what you think! ^_^",

There is a woman who wants to have a ghoul baby but then you never hear from her again. The brother beats up a guy that come out of nowhere and then you never know why he attacked them in the first place. Stuff like that... There is also non-incest, incest. What I mean by that is the fact that they don't have sex, but they might as well be. The brother kind of lets his sister eat him, knowing thefact that their both ghouls. He regenerates so every so often so when she's hungry she just... eats him. They make it look sexual instead of messed up. The only thing I honestly enjoyed is the art styles' color. The animation itself isn't great but the contrast was beautiful to look at. I would pass on this one, but if your an anime buff and \"have to watch them all\" you'll be pleased to know the episodes are only a few minutes long.",

I noticed many reviews here on MAL with extremely low ratings and decided to watch it because I had 38 minutes to waste on a terrible full length story. Instead I actually enjoyed it.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nIn my opinion the pacing was perfect. In fact there were times when I thought it was a little slow. Honestly if it was a 20 minute series I wouldn't have been able to sit the whole thing especially since I'm not fan of horror or gore as well.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nThe watercolor background visuals were nicelydone and the highlight was probably the cute designs of the Hasegawa siblings. I only gave it an 8 because I have high standards, also there were times when the flow of animation was off.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nIt was a laugh the way they could make a scene that should be appalling seem very sweet with a playful soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nNothing to do with complex character development, but at the same time I didn't expect any in the first place. I have to say that the way the author brings out their 'ugliness' is probably the reason why I rate this aspect so high. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nAs someone who isn't a fan of gore, I couldn't give this a full 10 but it was definitely enjoyable. Wouldn't watch it again, although trying to figure out what happens next kept me going.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 \\n\r\nIts not for everyone, probably aimed at the minority of people who enjoy this kind of content and it does a great job for that minority. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Just want to make a statement that before and while writing this review, I was clearly at my peak of boredom at that time; therefore my score is quite exaggerated. I don't particularly like the series and remain neutral to it even now, but there's nothing wrong to how twisted it is.",

            "content": "I thought I just had to write a review for Pupa.\r\nWarning: May contain spoilers because if i didn't spoil, I can't say what I really, really want to say. Haha.\r\nIf you're reading this review you have probably already read some other reviews of this. If you haven't, then... Nothing much. xD\r\nPlot 2/10:\r\nThis anime is about a brother and a sister, Hasegawa Utsutsu and Hasegawa Yume. One day, Yume sees a red butterfly and she turns into a monster that eats flesh. And Utsutsu turned into a guy who can't get killed even if his sister eats him. Or get killed.\r\nSounds interesting, doesn't it? Well toobad it's not good. Not at all. I guess you can't expect anything from an 4 minutes anime but I expected it to be REALLY good. I was one of the many people who was looking forward for this anime. I got really disappointed. Story looks fine, but later it doesn't make any sense at all, nothing gets resolved and The End!\\n\r\nEverytime I watch an episode of Pupa, I always wonder if i've missed like 2 episodes. \\n\r\nIf you don't believe it's really that bad, go ahead and watch episode 6. Consists of 2 minutes when they show you Yume eating her brothers flesh while saying \"Onii-chan\" like 16 times. Oh and not to forget \"Niku\" and \"Oishi\" too. \\n\\n\r\nArt 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't really...good. The background looks like it's made with crayon pen. The reason I'm giving it a 3/10 is because I'm not too picky with the art. In some parts, it really looks pathetic.\\n\r\nThey censor every single thing, even a knife in one episode and the next episode they didn't even bother to censor dead bodies. So normal knives are worse than dead bodies? Censor logic. \\n\r\nAnimation is weird and so is the rest of the anime anyway but I'll write more about that below. \\n\\n\r\nSound 2/10:\\n\\n\r\nWeird soundtracks in every friggin episode. It feels like they just made people compose some music and than they just put it somewhere in the episodes. It would've been better even without sound. \\n\r\nThe seiyuu's are descent but everytime I hear Yume say Onii-chan I really just wanna slap her or something. Probably because of episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10:\\n\\n\r\nThey're all so weird. Utsutsu have a sister-complex. Okay, you can have that but why don't you just buy some meat from the convience store? You let your sister eat yourself and you don't even seem to care.\\n\r\nAnd Yume, I feel bad for your poor Onii-chan. If you really wanna eat his flesh so much, at least cut off his hand and eat the hand than gicing him 100x as much pain.\\n\r\nAnd I laugh at how they don't even find a way to make her normal again, and I feel like Utsutsu is like \"Yume, Onii-chan is a masochist so I want you to keep eating my flesh instead of you being normal again\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10:\\n\\n\r\nDidn't enjoy this at all. I couldn't even bring myself to laugh at this anime. And I didn't enjoy one single bit of it. Some episodes were decent but almost all of them were crap. I could write paragraphs and paragraphs about episode 6 and how I reacted to it. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most pathetic anime I've watched. I don't even wanna call this an anime. I don't even know why I kept watching this until the last episode. Wish there was \"I survived Pupa 2014\"-shirts, I'm sure they would sell well. I woudn't recommend this to anyone, but if you really have like NOTHING to do and want to check out this MASTERPIECE done buy the awesome Studio DEEN, then go ahead and watch it. You'll waste 48 minutes of your life though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow thank you for reading and goodbye.\\n",

Sounds pretty good? Welp. Pupa kinda screwed itself over by not really being scary. \r\nOne reason being; it tried to be dark but was more like it was just...dark. A lot of the time the coloration of the Anime just seemed gloomy with it's deep colors and itdidn't really bring out the chills (for me a least). \\n\\n\r\nThe next reason, it went by so quickly. Yes, it is a four minute per episode anime, but you still needed to feel some kind of chill or some kind of fear within each episode. Pupa made it more in a funny way when a character got cut up, or someone got hurt in some way. I spent more time laughing than enough time cringing at the graphic attacks that were going on.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I do say there is something about this anime that will make you want to keep watching it, I can't put my finger on it, but the characters can some-what charming in an odd way, it just gonna make you want to watch it.

            "content": "Pupa.\r\nWhere do I start?\r\nFrom the first five minutes of this 40-minute-long mess, everything screams 'mediocre'. The art is mediocre, the sound is mediocre, the whole thing is just 'eh'. Unfortunately, it couldn't stop there. No, it had to go SUB-'eh'.\r\nThe concept of Pupa had some potential, but the execution was so poor that any chance of me enjoying it went right out of the window. How they thought they could get away with trying to weave a complex narrative (which I'm sure the manga had) into 40 minutes is beyond me, but they decided they were going to try and sunk time and money intothis trash anyway. Having such a short anime leaves absolutely no time to flesh out the characters (unintentional pun about flesh), and they all turn out bland, with the air of \"We never got around to finishing his character development so we just sort of left him in the awkward middle stage.\". Every single plot point is rushed to no end, every scene is an exposition scene, nothing the characters do make any sense but, oh, it probably did in the manga!\\n\\n\r\nBoth of the MCs are complete morons and watching them is like watching someone with Multiple Personality Disorder argue with himself. All of the characters are so forgettable I can't even remember their names or faces, and I only watched this anime a week ago! I can still remember every character from Code Geass, because the narrative taught you everything about these unique characters. I could still tell you who Dragomir Gorgovitch from Harry Potter is, and he's only mentioned ONCE by one character and never seen, because the story of Harry Potter was complicated and interesting and memorable. But I have no goddamn clue who the main character from Pupa was called because he was an empty slate the writers forgot to write anything on.\\n\\n\r\nMost of this anime's downfalls come from the fact that Pupa the manga was not made to be a 40-minute long series. You want to know another series about the same length? Boku no Pico. AND THIS ANIME IS WORSE THAN BOKU NO PICO BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT THE MEDIUM. Boku no Pico had this simple story -- there's this kid called Pico. He looks like a girl -- he isn't. There's this guy called Mokkun. He thinks Pico is a girl -- THERE, WE'RE DONE. You can explain the plot in five minutes, and that's perfect for an OVA. I'm not saying Boku no Pico is good, I'm just saying that the writers had brains enough to write a story that works in an OVA for their OVA anime. It would seem to make sense, right? It would be obvious to ANYONE, right?\\n\r\nNOPE.\\n\r\nBecause somehow, Tomomi Mochizuki (the director of this trite) decided that he would adapt a story-heavy, world-building-reliant manga and cram all of the necessary exposition (which could be cleverly spread out thinly across several episodes if they were to make this, say, a 12-episode series) into 40 minutes, leaving no time for actual scenes. A scene is when something is happening, but something only happened in Pupa for five goddamn seconds, and it barely made any sense anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is a prime example of HOW NOT TO ADAPT A MANGA, and something everyone should watch if they want to see an example of how badly you can transfer from one medium to the other. If this anime had explained the story well enough, I might give it higher scores, but as it is it's just an anime that has only one redeeming feature:\\n\\n\r\nNot being as bad as Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3 - Poor\\n\r\nArt - 5 - Mediocre\\n\r\nSound - 4 - Decent\\n\r\nCharacter - 1 - Pathetic\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2\\n\r\nOverall - 2 - Dreadful",

The story is anybodies guess, for some reason there are witches, and demons, despite 'pupa' meaning bug or parasite, they should've went with aliens it would make more sense. It's hard to look at the average art style, you know, with all the grotesque organ-eating happening. Thesoundtrack is alright by itself, though I had to look it up to remember it. I'd say I feel sad for the kids and their abusive parents, but they are essentially gods with regenerative powers so they'll get over it eventually. \\n\r\n  Stay away at all cost. Though you're probably interested in it by this point, and curiosity is a powerful demon, just at least know what you're getting into, and have a bucket nearby for the throwup.",

            "content": "The first time I watched pupa, it was on a day I'd stayed home from school and gotten ill. I binged the whole series in one sitting and passed out without giving it another thought (it's possible, the entire series only goes for around 50 minutes).\r\nIf it isn't obvious, I just brushed the existence of this anime off as an extremely strange, dark fever dream (it would not be the first). Months passed, and eventually, I got curious about whether or not the series actually existed. To my deepest regret and confusion, it did. \r\nNow that my pointless flavor text is out of the way,my proper review:\\n\\n\r\nPupa, in theory, sounds like it holds a gritty and morbid storyline that many other series' lack the guts to imitate. It sounds like it has potential. It sounds like it could lead to something unmistakably memorable and no doubt horrifying, or at least psychologically scarring. However, the execution of this anime is unbearably terrible. I haven't read the manga, so I can't really compare it to it, but the way everything is haphazardly crushed into small 4-minute episodes is disappointing. It feels as though we are only getting teasers of a full series, and even if played all together in compilation the storyline is jaggedly arranged. They could accomplish what they did in 6 of the episodes in just one full-length one. \\n\\n\r\nNow, aside from that, I do have to say that some of the character designs are especially ridiculous. It's not that they're over-the-top (except for one character, who looks like some sort of weird Schrodinger's cat witch thing) but they try to achieve simplicity in their designs and still stand out, and fail. It ends up with them wearing their designer's try-hard effort to create an original character on their sleeves. Even the way their backstory, at least in the anime, is executed just ends up coming across as cringy.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it's worth noting that this anime has incestuous undertones if that isn't your thing (it isn't really something that I enjoy seeing). The original storyline makes it seem like it's intended to be a play on the sis-con concept by completely juxtaposing it, but ends up playing into it in certain scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime in general just feels alien to watch, it doesn't drag you in or relate you to the characters (but how can it, really, with only 4 minutes to show for?) and is absolutely appalling in quality.\\n\\n\r\nAll this aside, of course, this anime is amazing. It's amazing not because it's a beautiful, quality anime that tells an intricate and heartbreaking story that drags you along for a ride, but for the complete opposite reasons. It's so bad, that it's absolutely hilarious. I recommend everybody watch this solemnly for the fact that, if you can stomach it yourself (the gore isn't too explicit and most of it is censored, but some of the 'eating' scenes are extremely laughable in their intimacy), watching the reactions of your friends as you force them at gunpoint to binge the entirety of Pupa with you is an experience you won't want to miss.",

            "content": "Okay. I never thought I'd actually write a review, but this anime genuinely annoyed me with how bad it was; I love psychological horror, I love gore, and I genuinely thought that an anime with these kinds of themes would be impossible for me to hate. How wrong I was.\r\nFor starters, the story seems to be set up in the opening episodes... and then spend the rest of the series ignoring any idea of a coherent story, and just as it seems they're going to actually go along with an interesting plot, it jumps around and ends up in a completely random place next episode.\r\nCarryingon with this, even though it has been cut down from its original concept of 23 minute episodes down to around 4 minutes, it still can't find anything to really do except repeat the same content over and over, despite having such little time to fill.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't really have any development, and what little they do seem to have, is rushed and not properly explained. That's not even considering the characters that look as if they're going to play major roles, and then are just never heard from again for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe simple, base elements of the story are poor as well; all they'd have to do to give it some interest was to keep the blood and gore as it was, but it seems that if it wants to fail, it'll go all the way. The gore is either censored to hell by being blacked out, or shown from angles so they can hide it, which only serves to rob the viewer of the ability to just enjoy it for pure gore value.\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive qualities of the anime were the opening title song, which I thought was pretty catchy, and the art style, which I enjoyed. However, the opening title theme cannot come close to redeeming the anime, and the art style was hindered when most of the graphic scenes were predominantly blacked out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, especially compared to the excitement I felt from reading the synopsis before watching, the anime is a huge disappointment for me. I had absolutely no enjoyment while watching it crumble and fall apart as it went on, nor do I hope that anyone makes anything remotely as bad as this in the psychological horror genre again; if it was any other genre, I'd probably find how bad it was amusing, but I can't forgive it for trying to fit into the horror genre. I never wish to watch it again, and the only use it has served me is to make already great existing psychological horror anime seem even better by comparison.\\n",

            "content": "The majority of the viewership that Pupa has attracted has come out of morbid curiosity. It has a reputation for ineptitude, and it's interesting to see just how bad an anime can be. It's difficult to recommend that anyone watch it in service of any other motivation. It's not really the funny kind of bad that justifies an \"ironic\" viewing, and it's too short and segmented to even satisfy the masochistic. What's funny is that it's even kind of disappointing in terms of how bad it is. A lot of the time, it's merely boring.\r\nIf it has any value at all, it's exclusively for twogroups: MAL users like myself who want an easy 1/10 to lower their mean score (thus making them look more discerning,) and animation students trying to learn by negative example. Works this bad do not occur by accident. Like the mutants Pupa portrays, they can be dissected and understood - if they do not devour us first.\\n\\n\r\nIn theory, Pupa is a psychological horror work which deals with themes including child abuse, abandonment, mal-adaptive and co-dependent coping mechanisms, incest, and scientific amorality. I won't say that it's impossible to write a good story with those themes in the format of twelve three-minute episodes, but I imagine it would be very difficult. With a total runtime of thirty-six minutes there isn't enough time to explore any of these ideas in depth, and cutting that tiny runtime into distinct episodes compounds the issue. The show was made to give the individual episodes a degree of self-contained development, which meant that it couldn't combine more than one to portray the characters' pasts or their current actions in detail - it moves on from each of these subjects in the span of three minutes. \\n\\n\r\nThe format is even more antithetical to horror, which lives and dies on the elements of immersion and the cyclical build-up and release of tension. The three-minute short format is better suited to light comedy or the slice-of-life genre, which this show meaninglessly reverts to for its final episode. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the characters never escape from being one-dimensional. The male lead is devoted to his sister, the sister is devoted to him in turn, and there's a third character who is consumed entirely by scientific curiosity, but she doesn't actually matter. That's all there is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's impossible to be invested in the characters' situation when we have so little time to know them. In the second episode, when we've had less than six minutes with the two of them, the boy confronts his sister in her monster form and attempts to calm her down. Something like this could be emotionally resonant if the viewer cared about the characters. But essentially opening the story with it removes any possible impact.\\n\\n\r\nLet us not be unduly kind to Pupa by claiming that the choice of format was its only bad decision. It's completely inept as a story too. Entire episodes (of which there were none to spare,) are dedicated to side-plots which then vanish, never to return. There is no apparent connection between the characters and the setting. Although an uncontained parasitic \"disease\" infects people and turns them into monsters, there is no reaction from the outside world. The siblings display obvious signs of disease but continue to go to school with no notice from their classmates. There is no discussion of missing persons reports or increasing suspicion and paranoia even as the corpses pile up. This is partially explained by the mad scientist character \"covering up\" the rampages of the infected, yet a third party learns of it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe siblings' disease is poorly understood: the scientist character explains that it grants regenerative abilities at the cost of insatiable cannibalistic hunger, but the latter never manifests itself in the boy. This is never explained, because it is a contrivance designed to force a particular conclusion: that the boy will allow his sister to continuously feed on him.\\n\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Pupa isn't a story, strictly speaking: it's a premise. The girl feeding on the boy over and over to maintain her existence is both the starting and ending point of the series. This isn't because it has a cyclical story. It never moves away from that point. The plot elements which do appear are illusory, because they don't cause any change. They come and they go, and the girl keeps eating the boy. This is perhaps the most fundamental failure possible for any story.\\n\\n\r\nIt makes sense to assume that Pupa was made with some kind of fetish appeal in mind. During the \"feeding\" sequences, the characters' pained vocalizations vaguely resemble sexual moaning, for instance. That would explain why the premise is contrived toward cannibalism. I don't think that even a fetishist would be satisfied with this anime, because the art and animation are terrible and it constantly censors itself: neither the gore nor the \"feeding\" are shown - they're covered with black or white splotches. There is almost no movement at any point in the show. It only qualifies as animation by the most lenient possible standard. The censorship serves as a convenient method of reducing the budget, I imagine. The artwork itself is basic and perfunctory. The result of all this is that the violence and gore are completely unimpactful, further ruining Pupa's chances as a horror anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an explanation behind all of these problems: indifference. No one on Pupa's staff cared about it as a project, I suspect. They were slogging through their jobs for a paycheck, and in turn the audience felt as though they were slogging through the show out of masochism. I'm inclined to think the artist behind the original manga is a bit of a hack. The story is poorly thought out and the artwork relies heavily on effects like super-deforming the characters - which reduces the necessary effort of drawing them. The psychology is basic to the point of being hackneyed and the parent figures are cartoons. I think laziness is the real reason for all of this. The creators chose cliches that they thought would appeal to people, slapped them together with minimal artwork, and told themselves it was good enough. The result is plain to see.",

The fact that episodes are a mere 2 minutes long (technically they are roughly 4 minutes but it has an intro and outro) does not do this anime any justice at all.

The only thing positive about the sound is the voice acting, but with the way the story is and whatever lines they are delivering, it isn't too engaging.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [3/10]:\\n\r\nThe two main characters are brother and sister and the audience quite literally gets no time to learn much about either of them. Both the brother and sister have some type of genetic mutation as a result of a new disease and honestly should be a really cool factor of the anime but instead serves almost no purpose toward character development at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [3/10]:\\n\r\nDo not watch this anime. Although it is only about a half hour in total run time that would be a complete half hour wasted. Watching a single episode of any other good anime or just reading a book would be a better use of your time.

            "content": "Pupa is one of those animes that you could stomp on and you wouldn't feel bad for doing it. I was actually excited for this anime, it looked great, but...what the hell happened? This wasn't what I was expecting at all. This show was like trying to catch fish, but they have no bait, no hook, nor even a fishing pole they are just using their hands and hoping to get lucky.\r\nNow let's get on to the review and skip the metaphors\r\nPupa was made by Studio Deen (That I've heard makes terrible anime adaptions, not most but few bad ones) about two teens, brother andsister, who are both orphans of a terrified-of-her-own-daughter mother and an abusive father. They have no one to help them on their long journey ahead. On her way home, the sister is told to \"Don't look at the red butterflys\" but ignores the fact and looks at them anyways. This ends up turning her into a man-eating-monster and feeds off of the human flesh. As well, her brother gets the virus and instead of becoming a monster, he is able to regenerate his body no matter how bad the damage. He could be dead and come back to life!\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\r\nThe story is confusing none the less. It's like they looked through the Pupa manga and flipped to a random scene in the series and animated it. What makes it even worse is that the show is 4 minutes each episode, you could go look away and miss literally the whole episode. Reading the manga would make more sense than watching the anime adaption. (There is even an episode that literally is just watching Yume eat her older brothers flesh, THAT'S IT)\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\r\nNow, this is one of the two things I liked about the anime. The art was great in my part and it could have been used better than what was made here. It uses the colors so great in each scene to really make you feel uncomfortable or what the main show was supposed to be, scary! \\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\r\nThis is the other thing I liked about the show. The opening wasn't bad as I expected, it was something kind of catchy. The ending wasn't really a favorite for mine but none of the less, the sound was average for me!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nLike I said before, they literally flipped through the Pupa manga and picked a random scene! Each episode brings someone new into the series who only appears for half or the full thing (2-4 minutes) and they are never seen again!   Our first two and the main characters through this series are Utsutsu and is little sister, Yume. Usutsu is the type that will do anything for his sister to keep her happy and alive. Yume is the little helpless sister who ends up eating her brothers flesh almost everyday! Then we have all the side characters who aren't show at all and are just characters who pop in and pop out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nThis show was terrible and probably the worst anime I have ever seen since this day. I sadly got excited over this anime that turned out to be just...terrible. If you have plans on watching this anime just don't do it, unless you are wanting to waste time, I would ignore this anime completely!\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating on this show is a good 1/10 since the very first episode. I know Studio Deen has made some good anime, but don't make another one similar to how bad this was!",

            "content": "Story:\r\nDue to the length of the episodes and the subject matter, there isn't enough time to find characters believable, relatable, or even likeable. It's a series of events loosely connected with no honest links between them, and some \"arcs\" being forsaken midway for the sake of getting out as much as possible within the 12 episodes. A lot of what takes place is merely excepted due to the fact that you're watching it, and not because it's coherent.\r\nArt:\r\nI enjoyed the style of animation used. It was as though it was drawn with pastel but enhanced digitally. It feels rustic, yet fresh. Nothing was particularly amazingabout the animation, and I felt as though some of the backdrops were kind of stupid, but I don't think there's anything wrong in this department.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe timing for the songs made light of certain situations. It became clear that this anime isn't taking seriously the content within it. It's exploitation of the inappropriate content within it, glorifying it for a crowd that is very, very small.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one song that was stupid, 2 that I thought were ok. I may even add one of them to a playlist of mine on Youtube.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe absolute worst part of Pupa. The characters are deplorable. What starts out as somewhat believable turns into a fetishistic relationship. Our main leads are sick in the head, and this is beyond their cannibalistic tendencies. Perhaps if they didn't find joy or comfort in it, then it would be understandable.\\n\\n\r\nThe 'antagonist' is a poorly designed witch-esque character that has no personality other than being a scummy human being, and her 'character arc' is cut short before anything of interest comes of it. It's terrrible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI don't feel like I wasted my time, but I feel like I sat through an intense lecture detailing what NOT to do in like, any story related situation. Maybe if the world could set laws and then allow for some sort of realism to take hold, I could have found some interest within its run-time, but due to it's exploitation and completely offensive nature, I couldn't wait until I was finished.\\n\\n\r\nEven if this anime had been a full length 12 episodes, it's very likely it wouldn't have broken the 6 barrier. Incestual cannibalism is only attractive to a small demographic, and anyone else rating it would find it an interesting trope and nothing more. Beyond that, I'm sure the story has very little to offer when it comes to valuable themes, messages, or events.\\n\\n\\n\r\n((If you liked this review, friend me for new reviews on other works, both manga and anime!))",

That was a sign that I should've stayed away from it from the start but as the saying goes, curiosity killed the cat.\r\nLet's just start by saying the concept is really awesome. Well... it's interesting to say the least. That's all I can really say about it and the short run time for this anime doesn't exactly help thefact that this anime is supposed to be a deep psychological anime. There's a lot to fit in to 4 minutes of absolute garbage.\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna cut the review off here because i haven't really actually finished the anime itself but for God's sake believe me when i say everything about it is lackluster and that is just me being nice. If I were to be angry critic man... it's terrible and that's all that needs to be said.

The only thing I remember is \"Don't look at the Red Butterflies!\"\r\nArt:\r\nThis is an area where I actually have to disagree with people, I actually quite like the art style presented in this anime, it's incredibly stylistic and as a result it looks quite alright. HOWEVER I will admit that this didn't save the animefrom looking ugly in some shots, especially since an anime about gore is CENSORED.\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI don't remember a single good sound asset in this anime, the only thing that was even remotely salvageable was that damn theme song. The OP is very catchy and I really wish it wasn't because that kind of earworm..edness is wasted on an otherwise completely forgettable amount of performances and ambiance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSo the saving grace here is that at least I haven't forgotten about who the characters were... sort of. \\n\r\nThe girl is a cannibal... okay.\\n\r\nThe boy can regenerate his body... okay.\\n\r\nOh.. an uncomfortable almost-sex-not-really-sex scene between them..\\n\r\nThe villain is pregnant?

How many more creatures don't we know of? Why do we exist? And ofcourse, the most important of them all: Why was Pupa created? We may never know, but we may as well disect it apart. Grab your stuffed bears and try not to get eaten, this is my review of Pupa.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nA virus breaks out, called Pupa. It makes people regenerate themselves, but inreturn they have a unbearable hunger that can only be fed by people. Yes, with Pupa you become a unstoppable canibal. A brother and a sister both get the virus and now they have to survive... by eating eachother (and I am not even joking). Strangely, the biggest flaw I have is that the idea is not explored enough. Like in episode... 4 (I think) they show a woman who has baby who was infected by the virus. Why couldn't have something like that? Imagine having every new episode focussed on how someone else is effected by the virus, with only the brother and sister constantly returning. Instead, they chose to focus only on the brother and sister (except for episode 4 and 12) and it comes out pretty shallow. Also, episode 12 is a shit ending. Why have all this gore and then suddenly have a heartwarming ending? That completely breaks the whole tone of the series!  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10  \\n\r\nTo be honest, even though it is very gory and heavily censored, I still kind of like the animation. It is definitely one of the better looking 3 minutes series I have watched. Animation is fluid and I kind of like the art style. Too bad for the censoring.. maybe it is good I didn't see that gory shit. Idk I can't decide.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10  \\n\r\nAAAAAAAAAAAAH FUCK THAT OPENING. EVERYTIME I HEAR IT MY EARS PUKE!  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nThere are two main characters: ''Onee-chan'' Utsutsu, who only wants to protect her sister and even sacrificises himself for her, and Yume, a sister who loves her brother so much that she can't stop eating him. Also, she has this habit to constantly, and I mean, CONSTANTLY, call his brother ''Onee-chan'' and IT CREEPS ME OUT! This cast is just nothing.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10  \\n\r\nI had a mixed experience: One moment I was disgusted by the gore, then suddenly laughing by a unintionally funny line and then just being bored. It was a rollercoaster of emotions\u2026 but the kind of rollercoaster you talk with your friends about how it makes you sick.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nI don't know if I should recommend it. It is exactly on the line of ''So bad it is good'', ''So bad it is bad'' and ''Mediocre''. If you want a gore fest, then go ahead. If you want an anime that is enjoyably bad... then you are gonna be dissapointed.  \\n\\n\r\nI just started my bad-anime marathon and I already struck gold.",

So I guess I did get what I came for. Let's talk about Pupa, a hilarious piece of incest ecchi with enough hilariously stupid drama to fill an entire high school and then some.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is that Yume, the sister gets infected by the Pupa virus that forces her to eat flesh, lest she become a huge-ass demon. Her brother gains regenerative powers from exposure to the virus as well, and so he offers himself to be eatenby her voluntarily. Meanwhile, a woman named Maria seems to be orchestrating events. Angst and unintentional comedy ensue.\\n\\n\r\nDoes that sound simple enough? Good, because the story never evolves beyond that premise. Everything mentioned above happens, but they never happen in a way that makes sense. Yume is genre blind and stupid so she got infected by the virus and never notices the creepy-ass woman who obviously caused her to have the infection. Utsutsu, the brother, acts weak and weepy when he has regenerative powers. Yume and Utsutsu get bullied by a fucking switchblade. By a dude who knows both of them have superpowers. Also, they portray domestic abuse so bad it actually becomes comedic. Yeah.\\n\r\nEverything that isn't part of the premise's logline is pure idiocy. This show has no worth outside of its premise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is barely passable. The animations have no major gaping holes.\\n\r\nHowever, what goodwill the artists deserve for making a passable artstyle gets nuked into oblivion by the terrible, terrible censoring and terrible, terrible choreography. Even if you get your hands on a decensored version it won't help much. I know it's part of the aesthetics, but every time those fucking teddy bear segments come on I have the urge to stamp something into the ground. Terrible, terrible visual direction and presentation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nApparently, human flesh makes squishy noises whenever you bite them. Eating human also surprisingly sounds like sex noises (more on that later).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nUtsutsu has a hero complex yet cannot fight against a bully despite having Wolverine powers. Yume never once thinks about ripping Maria or the bully's head off and feasting on their delicious, juicy intestines even though she does that with armed soldiers. Maria has enough edge and pretentiousness to calculate \u03c0 to 20000 decimals. Everyone else is mostly irrelevant, and the most sympathizable character is Maria's assistance who seemingly wants her in the sack.\\n\r\nEvery character here is butchered beyond belief. Cardboard cut-outs would be better -- at least they don't reek of formaldehyde-smelling stale angst. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nRemember how I said there would be attempts at drama and attempts at gore?\\n\r\nWell, the only reason there is drama is that there are no people with the sufficient mental capacity to actually solve the fucking problem. Child services don't exist, the fucking demon can't rip off a puny little head (or even attempt to do it), and the decision to let Yume eat his body is treated by Utsutsu with all the gravity of giving your sister a drink out of your milk tea.\\n\r\nThe gore? It's just them having sex with a bit of red. No, I'm serious, when Yume is eating him, it either looks like she's giving him a blowjob or they're copulating and she just likes biting while doing so. \\n\r\nGood gore potential wasted on PG13 sex. Miserable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBut hey, it does almost everything wrong. So you know what that means: it's one of those stupid-ass anime that's perfect for generating a quick laugh via its sheer stupidity during a night's out with your so-called friends. \\n\\n\r\nIf all else fails, at least the teddy bear sections can be used as a litmus test for acceptance of cringe comedy.\\n\\n",

            "content": "**Mild content spoilers to follow**\r\nListen--I'm not one to go out of my way to post reviews, especially ones that require an account, but this anime literally left me feeling like I needed to take a month long shower.\r\nI'd been recommended this series from several places who all claimed it was a wonderful show, full of plenty of horrific visuals and bordering on the edge psychological horror. A good, dark show great for when you need to satisfy a little morbid curiosity. I've been dying for another show that'll give me the heebie-geebies, so I was willing to give this one a shot.\r\nLittle did I know.\r\nNow,I don't know if this is specifically the anime's fault or if the source material's like this as well (I haven't given much thought to the manga yet), but you know how a lot of times you can kind of tell if a show's made with a particular--ahem--\"interest\" in mind? Well, this show pretty much screams at least several versions of that. It's one thing to have gratuitous gore or a character in debilitating pain, it's another to have an entire plot that basically centers around \"school age character is repeatedly, slowly, and agonizingly torn apart with pretty obvious sexual undertones, now in sister complex flavor.\" \\n\\n\r\nPretty much every episode they pull out the nasty, nasty sound effects and unbearably long scenes of both characters moaning and gasping while one gets eaten alive. The first time it happened, I was already uncomfortable, but by the eighth time we're shown up close, intimately animated sequences of a kid swallowing freshly bitten off human flesh with no real reason other than \"because,\" you start to get a little irritated and disgusted.\\n\\n\r\nNot even kidding, as the other reviews also state, one episode is literally just one kid being eaten, graphically, while screaming and gasping, for a full 3 or so minutes while the voice over pulls out the old \"onii-chan\" to make sure you knew this had some kind of undertone in case you didn't know already. It makes you wonder if someone walked into the writer's lounge like, \"Consider,\" and then proceeded to pitch their kink fantasy to the entire room.\\n\\n\r\n\"High school pain gorn. High school pain gorn, with sister complex, the series.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe borderline guro aside, there's just nothing else to support the story (which is part of the reason why this thing seems to scream \"kink service\" as strong as it does). Characters are two dimensional and annoying at best, and nine times out of ten you'll find yourself yelling at the screen, \"How in the world is that supposed to make sense!?\" \\n\\n\r\nI mean, and this is even without discussing the pacing/plot disaster this show's in. Pretty much every other review hits it spot on in that you can't properly convey a horror atmosphere when you've only got 4 minutes an episode, 2 of which are taken up by opening and closing. And without any way to make any kind of plot development DURING an episode, it's no wonder the focus of the story jumps around like something out of middle school fan fiction.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you're thinking about watching it for the art style instead, don't bother. Poor animation that only seems to bump when it comes to another close-up of someone eating meat, and a decidedly bright, saturated color palette that definitely does not help the already lacking atmosphere. When it finally comes time to try to \"convey the mood,\" expect only dark gradients overlaid on the screen, pretty much blotting out most details.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the feeling I got starting this series is like the feeling you'd get if you were promised a five star meal and were greeted instead with a piece of pre-chewed ground beef, courtesy of a guy hovering in the corner, waiting for you to eat it with baited breath and a web cam.\\n\\n\r\nNasty.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even waste your time unless you've got a thing for some twisted kind of cannibalism fan service.",

            "content": "Oh god, why. I saw an article about animes that are so bad they're good. I was curious and decided I could take a shot. \"Pupa\" was featured on the list, so I thought \"Hey, I like gore! And it says it's good!\" I thought about it and looked it up. \"Just 12 episodes? That are barely four minutes each? That's great for binging...\" \r\nLess than five minutes later, I was watching the first episode, and boy, I have never made a bigger mistake in anime choice. This was terrible. \r\nI expected it to be more interesting because of the fascinating summary and the premiseof the show, but I think the way the anime was made drowned out any semblance of plot there may have been. \\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, the story; it starts off with two siblings catching a disease. *no spoilers* but after things go awry, the show turns to gore and 'scientific experiments' and cannibalism. Usually, I can stomach these things pretty easily, but the way this was presented makes it difficult. There really was no story. I can't explain to you what happened, and I basically just watched this. There was no atmosphere (which this genre really needs) and the episodes seemed to focus less on storyline and more just explaining the sad angsty abusive backstory of the MCs and then show the girl eating her brother. I felt like I was watching some kind of hentai-- that's how loose the plot was, and how heavy the vore is. \\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad. I heard some other people didn't like the sketchy way the backgrounds were drawn. I admit, it looks unfinished, but it was different, and I liked it for that reason alone. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound I hated, mostly because of creepy, almost incestual-feeling mutterings of 'Onee-chan' and stomach-turning slurping and chewing noises that made me feel sick. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are basically nonexistent. Even after literally just watching this, I can't remember the names of a single character or anything more than basic details of what they looked like. None of them had any character traits other than the lady with the black hat being evil, and male MC loving his sister, and his sister being hungry. Literally no other character than that. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this. I thought I might, but all factors considered, it was terrible. I made the mistake of watching this while eating, and I still feel nauseous while thinking about it. Some other people advised not to watch this if you have a weak stomach--- I advise you not to watch this if you HAVE a stomach. It's terrible, and I've a child pretty much raised on gore and violence movies. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: are into vore, are into incest, like the idea of torture, like shorter anime\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: have a weak stomach, don't like gore/vore, don't like incest, don't like horror, want something long or psychological \\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

Well...on a side note, if you were preparing popcorn for a Pupa marathon, the anime is in total only 48 minutes long. \r\nBetter go watch a good movie then waste your time on this.\r\nThe story summary was actually interesting, but don't let it fool you. The anime is confusing and rushed as hell, and just picks random scenes out of the manga. Every episode is only 4 minutes long (Thus, 48 minutes in total) so there is not much space forthe plot if the opening and ending already take a half of the time. Also, the censoring in this anime is over 9000. (Sorry, bad reference and I should feel bad) Usually this doesn't bother me so much, but here they literally censored everything. But since you can watch it uncensored, I won't take any points from the final verdict for that. But basically, about what is every episode then? Yume eating her 'Onii-chan', in a very sexual way. Utsutsu, her Onii-chan, doesn't mind that and only wants her to be happy. The characters in general have as much personality as a shoebox, even with all these completely unnecessary and confusing flashbacks. Honestly, this whole anime is just about Yume and her brother. Other characters just randomly pop up and serve no purpose. Sound is ok, opening and ending song might be the best thing in this anime. Art is not special, the colors used are really unfitting, and animation is pretty bad and re-used a lot.\\n\r\nPretty much this anime is cannibalistic soft porn. Even when it is almost that, you can't enjoy this. Even when this anime is only 48 minutes long, you waste your time by watching this. Avoid this, and trust me, it's normal this has such a low rating.",

            "content": "Pupa is uncomfortable at best and irritating at worst. I say uncomfortable at best, because that's what I want a horror anime to make me feel. Some horror anime do this well, such as Higurashi. Make no mistake by recommendations, this anime is not one of them. \r\nOriginally this series aired censored. I watched the first two episodes that way and dropped it, picking it back up later when it was released uncensored. I don't believe in judging a series on it's censored versions. Each episode is a short four minutes, so I picked it up and watched it as if it were an OVAinstead. I find this format works better, and even found myself questioning why the studio didn't just release it as such. \\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is nice to look at about 40% of the time, but the other 60% is absolutely terrible. The only reason I particularly found interest in the 40% of good was because I like the watercolor look they chose to use throughout. Any time the animation did any sort of movement, it was jaunty and muted. I might as well have been looking at paintings telling the story. \\n\\n\r\nI don't often write reviews for MAL, but Pupa warranted a response. This was an anime I was quite looking forward to that really dropped the ball. There were scenes that were unwatchable not because they were horrific, but because they were needlessly dragged on throughout an episode. When you only have four minutes, wasting that four minutes on scenes that looked like they were just copypasted over and over was useless. This led to a lack in an easily followed storyline, because some episodes were made to shock, but others were there to give vague information on what I assume the manga made out to be a very good story, from what I've heard of it. I can't imagine trying to keep this story in my head from week to week, as forgettable as they made it seem. I was so unaware of what was going on in most of the series even watching it all at once because there was zero transition, even when I had to stop and click on the next episode. Settings and locations changed with no warning, large amounts of time passed. There are even plot points that are started but never touched on again. \\n\\n\r\nAt some points they tried to add comedy into an episode for no reason at all. It broke what little mood and immersion they had going for the series immediately. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to recommend this to anyone, even fans of the genre. It's not bad to spend around 40 minutes on, I guess, but I certainly won't be rewatching it.",

            "content": "Wow. My rating of 6 should not be sticking out this much. \r\nI have a unique philosophy where if a sucky anime didn't waste a ton of my time, I wouldn't be as harsh on it. This is not the case. Pupa is an extremely short anime consisting of 12, 4-minute long episodes that ends very abruptly and without closure. Keep this in mind right now: This anime is NOT for everyone. It is mindless, eccentric in almost everything it does and portrays. Most of all, it is haphazardly brutal and brilliantly gory. The likes of which even made me, a lover of Elfen Liedand Blood-C , cringe. \\n\\n\r\nStorywise, I honestly have no clue what's going on, but I don't really care either. You're not here for the story. If you are, move on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are mediocre at best. For such a short series, I think they did OK with them. But if you're looking for Evangelion or Clannad status characters, just drop this anime now. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to nit pick much at the details much, but the art and sound were surprisingly good for an anime that's scoring 1's like Steins;Gate is scoring 10's. The art blended well with the gore and atmosphere, which was a problem I had with Corpse Party - nice looking characters too. Soundtrack was repetitive, but of decent quality. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching (almost) every second of this. I repeat: This anime is a Gore lover's DREAM.  I'd go as far as saying only those with stomachs conditioned to adore the bloody brutality of this anime should watch it. You will not gain anything else from this anime.  But be prepared to spectate the suffering of a young girl and her older brother. \\n\\n\r\nDon't let all these scores of 1's deceive you. \\n\r\nOk maybe they do have some justification. This anime is ridiculously fast paced and it has nothing to show for it. If there's a plot, I'm not seeing it. It has no ending, and the characters are worth f*** all. But none of that matters. You're not here for any of that. All you (should) care about is the delicious, rapturous, mindless gore that is Pupa. \\n\\n\r\nPupa is short and sweet. Nothing else. Blink and you'll miss it, or the small qualities that helped make it good. At less than hour long overall, Pupa was an anime destined for widespread failure. But in the eyes of few like me, Pupa was another crown jewel to be added with the likes of Hellsing Ultimate and Another. One thing you must do however: Watch this UNCENSORED. This is a given. I cannot stress this enough. I recommend Youtube for this. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, just trying it wouldn't hurt either --- just to see what the fuss is about from your own point of view. \\n",

            "content": "I never thought it would be possible for me to finish a entire anime in 30 minutes......Well I spoke too soon.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe main plot of the story seemed very interesting to me, and I couldn't stop watching it. But the thing that set me off was the fact that the plot didn't go nowhere. 4 minutes per episode (including the op and ed) is not enough to develop a entire story. I've heard great things about the manga. I've also heard how the adaptation randomly throws around moments from the manga to create one HUGE scrambled mess. \r\nArt: 8/10\r\nI've got to give the anime goodcredit on it's artwork, as that is what mainly drawn me into the anime. The scenes were Yume is eating her brother were ABSOLUTELY FUCKING DISGUSTING.  But the artwork in these scenes were amazing, and made the moments way more creepy (especially because of the blood and guts.)\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nHonestly at first I didn't pay attention to the music as I was gagging at the fucking Eating scenes. But looking back, the music was pretty descent. The Opening and Ending were really good in my opinion.\\n\r\n Characters: 3/10\\n\r\nThe characters were one of the worst fucking parts of the story. Let me end it off with this...\"Onii-Chan..Onii-Chan...Onii-ch-\"-SHUT THE FUCK UP YUME!\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nPersonally, I kinda liked it at first. But then I realized how fucking stupid I am. I watched it again and nearly threw up my KFC I had earlier that day. I thought the story was rushed...wait what story. Yume was annoying as fuck. And the entire thing made no sense.\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Pupa is a horrible mess that was scrambled up. I think that the anime was made just to be an advertisement for the manga. Maybe the Manga will be better, well guess I better read it. Hopefully one day they'll remake this series and make it actually good. \\n",

Lots of plotholes, not much of a development in the plot, lots of parts left unexplained,etc. \r\nArt: 2\r\nNot much to say about art, all anime have good animation, but, if you look at the yearit was created in (2014-2015), the animation is comparatively shit.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is kind of catchy. There is nothing else really in the sound section.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pathetic, pathetic i tells ya. The main characters are sh*t, the side characters are sh*t, your waifu is sh*t. Enough joking though, the main characters, a pair of brother and sister, are seriously disappointing, even worse than the chaos;head mc. There isn't much character development except for the part where the brother, taking advantage of his regenerative abilities, lets his sister eat him (oh my, that's naughty!) and the sister saying 'onii-chan, onii-chan'  between bites and the brother moaning like he is havin' s*x. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nNone, just no enjoyment whatsoever,probably except for the gory scenes, there is nothing, no feels, no comedy, no romance, no oppai, nothing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Petition to MAL for zero rating pending. For the time being, 1\\n\\n\r\nI will still kind of recommend this anime though, cuz your anime watching experience might never be complete until you watch the best as well as the worst of anime, and well, Mars of Destruction along with Pupa are probably the worst there is.",

            "content": "Let\u2019s tell all the readers the painful truth.\r\nPupa is a legendary series that portraits the loveliest beauty full of thorns and tears. Certainly the series failed at all of aspects. The series only sole existence is just for showing the ugliness of how human brain can work, which makes Pupa a good example. This series definitely cannot be described easily as the show itself represents the hidden beauty of sickening gore. While on other hand, the idea is seriously insane. Every minute in the series, the story become so dark as it was fallen to the stage of despair, unhappiness, madness and even downright unpleasant.I cannot afford to see the series until the end. Rather, I force myself to see a living hell the series try to show. Clearly, that is the most braves suicide attack I\u2019ve ever done. It's more than a reason to hate this unreasonable and brainless series. In short Pupa is nothing special except its horrifying gore with ridiculous plot and story. Still, we\u2019ve got quite a ride that goes up and down when watching this series. Up because we thought the series might be change and getting better each episode. Down because what we\u2019re expecting will never happen. Worse, the series give a truly magnificent experience, enough for each of us to vomit and trauma. \\n\\n\r\nThe series duration is 4 minutes per episode; they do not have much time to develop a magnificent story but successful organized a living hell in a way. Honestly, there none other series that is able to compete with Pupa. Way to go Pupa. You\u2019ve teaches us what it is a truly nightmare. Let us wholeheartedly love Pupa forever.  \\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nThe story itself is very sickening. Not biased with the others gore series, they come out with a new dazzling concept that makes us enticed at first. Unknowingly, it is a clear trap to brainwash us. Pupa also gives us a new experience to be felt and it is indeed quite a ride. Pupa is about a lovely young girl named Yume whose got infected by mysterious Pupa virus; turn her into disgusting monster which feed on humans. While on other hand, Yume older brother Utsutsu also has been infected after letting Yume feast on his flesh. Surprising, Utsutsu is not dead but rather awaken fast regenerative abilities. Looks like the series is so interesting, but who would have thought this series is actually rotten to the core. Our normal sense is already strangle very hard just to get pass each episode. But, this nightmare is just a new beginning. Before you even realize it, the story is already messed up and twisted.  \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a fan of gore, I like it very much. But Pupa is not about the pure gore, rather an idiocy and meaningless gore. The violence in this series is a torture. Who\u2019s the victim? Who else if not us. Put aside the storyline, we are the one who suffer the most. The most things I can never stand in this series are the lovely love scenes between Yume and Utsutsu. I rather call this cannibalism moment. The cannibal one is Yume and the victim is Utsutsu. Surprisingly, I still have awareness when finishing the series. I wish I can scream for someone to gouge our eyes out than watching this pitiful scene. Because we clearly only can sit there and watch this horrifying scene. And so this series become more memorable by Yume and Utsutsu cannibalism scene. Yume does a good job showing her affection towards her older brother. This is only one of a thousand from the ugliness Pupa try to show. \\n\\n\r\nThe action is not really fantastic but rather acceptable for the wholesome series. The general setting and each place design captures the perfect atmosphere to give us a goose bump. The depth of horror, gore and adding the dark feeling together makes the series achieve a new stage of admiration. Watching it alone in the dark can beat any horror and ghost story I\u2019ve watch. Pupa does not take the story of tales and folklore, rather creating a new tales of horror folklore in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation\\n\r\nThe animation quality is really nothing outstanding. This animation is considered average since their main aim is the story itself. But, they do not take it lightly and this is proven as some scenes were very well designed. For the theme song, it was so loud with nothing of lyric to be learned. This one without exception is really awful. Listen to this song every day probably can shorten your life spans. With remorse, I\u2019m also could not defend this one aspect. Beside the main theme, sound effects are in the opposite direction, and are really impressive. I still can hear clearly in my mind how Yume consuming Utsutsu flesh. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe character designs are very unique. I personally love both Yume and her older brother Utsutsu. They play their characters performance very good. Basically, Yume's personality is pure and nice but fully changes upon being infected. This is the starter of plot twist. Her lust and desire certainly the one manipulated herself. The hunger she feels is beyond normal. She is hungry not for normal food but human flesh. From adorable little sister, she was turn into some ugly monster being. Holly shit! \\n\\n\r\nUtsutsu, who saw his sister's condition, aid her as a black sheep. Currently, he is undeniably immune to diseases and cannot be killed physically. So he will became her little sister human meat supply. For me, this is totally another insane plot twist. This is clearly not love, but pure madness.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one other character who really takes my interest. Her name is Imari Ai, a genius yet insane in a way who\u2019s working behind the scenes. Upon seeing Ai, I can immediately sense such a tense dark aura surrounding her yet mysterious in a way. But the only one of her purpose in studying Pupa virus is none other because she wants to give birth of a monster such as Yume currently being right now. What a pity, she is already beautiful and cute but her image is being torn apart when she was pregnant a monster. Ironically, this is definitely not a beauties, I rather prefer to call it as one of ugliest and disgusting aspect that should be exterminate. This series also contains excessive amount of violence. Please give this some thought first before deciding to watch the series. If I were you, I rather choose any other series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\nI would never want to watch the series again, or continuation for this series. I still can exactly remember each scene from episode 1 to the end. Could you believe it? We tend to forget any anime series slowly by slowly in times, but it is total opposite direction with Pupa. Pupa also shows what it really is being thrown into a world of depressing, dark future as well as what is the truly of unpleasant sightseeing. At this living hell, we crawled as fast as we can to run from this living hell world, but we are just going to be thrown again each times. Ironically, Pupa also leaves many mysteries in the series left unresolved. This will be a pain in the eye for any anime fans. The ending for Pupa is also absurd. This adds more suffering to the already existing pain we\u2019ve feels.  In a one of thousand miracles, Pupa has come to enlighten our day with the true definition of depression. \\n\\n",

Not the greatest, but definitely not the worst. It excels in being something different.\r\nFor the art, its not great, but for a 4 minute animes, it is leaps and bounds better then Chitose Get You! and Sparrow's hotel. You can't really compare 1 5-min anime to 24 minute animes by Bones, or Trigger.\r\nSound: The chewing is unsettling and the OPand ED's are good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter takes a hit, just because of the run time. Can't flesh out a character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is high just because of the premise. How many other animes are their that have cannibalism as a theme? \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the scores for this animes are horribly underrated. This anime coming out is a feat, as it deals with cannibalism. Its 4-mins long, and will have 12 episodes. 48 minutes isn't a long time. Try it, and you may enjoy it.",

            "content": "First of all, this is my first review ever, although I felt like I really needed to let my opinions out on this anime.\r\nThis review will not contain any spoilers, even though it's a 35 minute long anime, so they wouldn't change things much.\r\nSo, I've watched this anime without reading the manga, which is said to be good, but I don't honestly see why people hated it so much. Now, I've watched the entire anime all at once, and I guess that's probably the reason why I didn't dislike it as much as others have. \r\nThe thing with this anime is, the story is kindof a mess, I felt like a few things were left undeveloped and some characters were not even slightly introduced, but I have to say it was enjoyable to watch nontheless.\\n\r\nThe thing that got me disappointed the most is the ending to the whole story, which I'm not going to spoil, but I'm going to say that, it would've worked as a special episode in my opinion.\\n\r\nAfter reading this short introduction to what this anime basically is about, now you might be wondering: \"Then why the hell did you give it a 6 out of 10 rather than a 1 or 2, just like most other people did?\". The answer's simple. I found it enjoyable in its shortness. I feel like there was a lot of potential in the anime that was left unused, but having seen it all at once due to its shortness made me somewhat enjoy it. It was full of surprises due to how truly undeveloped a few things were, and I feel like it could've been a good short anime, one that could've worked well if a few things were just cleare enough.\\n\r\nWhat I'm going to say I probably enjoyed a lot more than others have is the animation and overall style of the image. It wasn't anything fancy, quite basic but nice for a short anime like this, and what I really loved is the opening, which features a background song that is stuck in my head, while there's just a bunch of sliding images in the opening, which I don't really like but it's alright I guess.\\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed reading this review and found it helpful, or used it as a reference to develop your own thoughts on this anime, sorry if I may have made any review-noob mistakes;\\n\r\nHave anice day!\\n\\n\r\nNickSharpx",

            "content": "Pupa. What a wonder this show is. To think it was actually animated is amazing to me. It is quite possibly one of the worst anime I have ever seen in my life, and I\u2019ve seen Mars of Destruction. This review is me taking apart Pupa scene by scene for one of my friends. They hated it as much as I did, so I\u2019m like \u201cfuck it I\u2019ll just write about how bad it is\u201d.  This spoils literally the entire plot. \r\nPlot: 1/10\r\nWe start off the plot with Yume walking home and she runs into this super creepy looking and totally not suspicious woman.The woman looks at her and acts supper creepy and says \u201cgo home little girl lest the red butterflies get you\u201d so she decides to go look at the red butterflies instead of hurrying home. A dog explodes for some reason and turns her into this insect pokemon thing. At least I think that\u2019s what happens. We are then treated to the most heavy-handed depiction of abuse I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s basically like when your mother force-feeds you cough medicine, except instead of making you better, it makes you want to kill something. Some things happen and the big brother decides to go talk to his little sister who is apparently hungry for human flesh. But why does it have to be human flesh? Can it just be meat in general? Can Onii-chan just like buy her a shitton of KFC and let her have that? Or maybe some cows? Oh well. She eats him and then we get this graphic of her in some abstract place being like \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat people. I can\u2019t help it. I don\u2019t want to do this\u201d. I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re supposed to feel sad, but all I can feel is \u201ccome on let\u2019s get on with the story\u201d. I feel nothing for these characters because they have no character. Her brother comes up behind her and is like \u201cdon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll protect you\u201d and all that stuff that anime characters say. We then cut to her in an alley eating him and she\u2019s a human again with no explanation. I assumed this was a dream sequence or something since they were in some kind of abstract place but no, it\u2019s real life. Wish they\u2019d clarified that a bit earlier, so it wouldn\u2019t be so fucking confusing. If you\u2019re wondering how this is \u201chelping\u201d her, well, apparently he has regenerative abilities. We learn it\u2019s because of the \u201cpupa virus\u201d that give you regenerative abilities but at the cost of insatiable hunger. Again, why can\u2019t they just go to fucking McDonalds and order like a million Big Macs? I\u2019m sure there\u2019d be people who\u2019d be willing to help pay or donate if it meant not eating actual people. Did the writers forget that there\u2019s other kinds of meat besides human meat. Real predators in real life don\u2019t eat just one kind of meat. Oh well, if she could eat other kinds of meat we wouldn\u2019t be able to have her big brother be her source of food. Also about her transforming back to a human. She has like 5 bodies inside of her right now. She used to be enormous, so it didn\u2019t matter that much, but she just shrank a lot. You\u2019d think her stomach would be smaller right? So why isn\u2019t she like \u201coh fuck I\u2019m so full blaarghhhh\u201d? We then see a flashback of Yume\u2019s mother being like \u201cshit I\u2019m going to have another baby. I need to kill this monster\u201d. Why does she think it\u2019s going to be a monster? She has nothing to base this off of. She even pulls her son away from his sister because she\u2019s supposedly a monster. She seems pretty innocent so far. I mean, she was born with all her teeth, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019re fuckin monster teeth. They look like ordinary teeth. How is this \u201cdeclaring herself a monster\u201d. This makes no sense at all. And the mother thinks she\u2019s watching her every move. Maybe the mom is just paranoid. You know, most mothers love and protect their children. Why is she so sure this child is a monster and not her other child? Oh well, she kills her child with a box cutter and it\u2019s a good thing the baby didn\u2019t cry or scream or anything and alert people to the fact that she was being sliced open. We then have a montage of the baby growing up and eating birds and all that great stuff and the mom basically goes crazy and is like \u201cplease hurt me. I like pain\u201d. Like wtf why is this woman allowed to have children? The next episode starts out with the most erotic \u201cI\u2019m about to eat your guts out\u201d scene I\u2019ve ever seen. At first I thought this scene was supposed to be serious, but then we get this fucking up-beat waltz playing and it just completely shatters any semblance of seriousness the scene had. I don\u2019t know who's idea it was to include that, but it was a bad one. Next we learn about that creepy woman in black. She\u2019s a pretty generic character, just like all the other characters in this show. She says \u201cget the egg cells from Yume as well as the sperm we collected from Onii-chan\u201d. But when did they collect these? How did they collect these? I guess it doesn\u2019t matter enough for them to tell us. After all, why do that when we can have another scene of erotic eating :D\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the bath scene where we learn that Maria, the creepy woman in black, is apparently giving birth to these creatures. Does this mean that she\u2019s Yume\u2019s mother? Also with her belly, she\u2019s at least 8 months pregnant. When did she get pregnant? She didn\u2019t have that huge-ass belly when Yume and Onii-chan met her in episode 1. Whatever. We begin the next episode by having Onii-chan and Yume going to school. You\u2019d think that if she\u2019s a man-eating monster, they\u2019d want to keep her in the fascility with her brother so she doesn\u2019t eat anyone else. Seems like school would be a pretty dangerous place. What if she goes berserk and starts eating people like she did in episode 1? Come to think of it why hasn\u2019t she transformed into that pokemon she was in episode 1? When and why did she change back to a human, and why hasn\u2019t she turned back into the pokemon since then? They\u2019re intercepted by this creepy looking guy who\u2019s obviously crazy as fuck and he takes Onii-chan to an abandoned warehouse and starts stabbing the hell out of him while Yume stands and watches uselessly. Hey remember how you used to be a giant monster pokemon? It\u2019s a shame the plot forgot you could do that, it\u2019d be super easy to get out of this situation. Instead they get captured and taken to this medical facility where Onii-chan is being disected. They administered anesthesia but aparently the virus neutralized it because of course it did. After all, it wouldn\u2019t be horrifying enough if it didn\u2019t hurt. They are removing organs and placing them on this tray and every organ looks like some kind of abstract piece of meat. In fact, they look like the exact same thing his back muscles are made out of. I think the author doesn\u2019t know how to draw organs, so he just decided to draw pieces of meat and hoped the audience wouldn\u2019t notice. On another note, don\u2019t you think these doctors are enjoying this a bit too much? I don\u2019t hear anybody complaining or souding like they\u2019re sickened by what they\u2019re doing. Psychopathy is not this common. You\u2019d think at least ONE of them would have an issue with disecting a human being? Laws are in place to prevent doctors and scientists from doing this. This is the same problem I had with Charlotte and Ajin (although that handled it a little better). And when they brought out the fucking chainsaw I just burst out laughing. I don\u2019t think the author was taking this seriously in any way at all. \\n\r\nNow that Onii-chan is captured and being tortured, NOW she can transform again. Or at least grow tentacles? Why didn\u2019t she do this earlier? All the conflict could have been avoided. Whatever. Now we\u2019re seeing Onii-chan and it looks like he\u2019s escaped or something. But how? His sister didn\u2019t do it, since she was looking for him. It shows the doctors all dead. Did he kill them? He\u2019s been shown to have no supernatural powers aside from regenerations so far. If he did have them and we just didn\u2019t know about them, why did it take him so long to use them. In fact, why didn\u2019t he know he had regeneration abilities until episode 2? He\u2019s supposedly had them all his life. Has he never scraped his knee or cut himself or broken a bone or anything? Oh well. He and his sister a reunited happy ending to an episode yay. Next we have\u2026 holy shit it\u2019s another erotic eating scene with immersion-breaking waltz music. This time they\u2019re in the PE shed. Seems like it would be really easy to be found out there, not to mention getting blood all over the equipment. After she eats him we get this moment that I think is supposed to be heartwarming where Onii-chan is like \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad getting eaten by my little sister. I love my little sister\u201d, but it just comes off as creepy. And that may as well be the final episode. The next one is pointless so I\u2019m not going to talk about it. It\u2019s just stupid. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10 \\n\r\nThe characters were boring and had no character. I don\u2019t even remember the big brother\u2019s name. This series is so bad\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: 3/10\\n\r\nThe art was not great, but not bad. I liked the unfinished coloring style. The character designs were meh and the artist didn\u2019t know how to draw body parts as was evidenced by the fact that every muscle looked the same as the organs. The music was also pretty okay. It wasn\u2019t memorable, but it fit the scenes and the mood. Except for that fucking waltz music\u2026\\n\\n\r\nYou're welcome Nova.",

            "content": "I first heard of Pupa when I came on here looking for Recommendations for Tokyo Ghoul, the plot seemed really \r\ninteresting and as a huge gore fan I thought I would give it a shot despite the bad reviews and let me just go \r\nahead and say the bad reviews where right. \r\nAs for the storyline, the plot itself was very good and had tons of potential and apparently the manga is more \r\nor less what it should be while the anime itself was made to be made as short as possible. The anime seemed very \r\nrushed as if the episodes only being four minuteslong ( Litterally three minutes if you where to take out the \\n\\n\r\nthirty second opening and thirty second end scene ) was not enough to tell you. Add all of this up and you get \\n\\n\r\nan odd anime that makes completly no sense and just seems like an attempt to satisfy horror fans while doing the \\n\\n\r\nexact opposite.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also no character developement whatsoever besides the occasional flashbacks to when the brother and \\n\\n\r\nsister where younger and they explain how they where abused. The characters in this anime seem to just \"Appear\" \\n\\n\r\nwith a name ( if lucky ) and not much more. \\n\\n\r\nIt had a lot of gore but they censored most of it with a huge black blurry line and the little bit they did show \\n\\n\r\nseriously lacking. They even went as far as censoring a random bad guy pulling a knife and the same bad guy \\n\\n\r\nholding a knife to Yumi's throat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI would give this anime a zero if I could. I would not recommend it. Maybe they will do a reboot where the \\n\\n\r\nepisodes are thirty minutes long and go more by the manga instead of by four minutes and cramming everything in \\n\\n\r\nand I can give it a much higher rating but until then it will feel like nothing more than a incest-vore anime \\n\\n\r\nand the worst anime I've ever seen by-far.",

            "content": "Well, I think we can all agree that this indeed was a thing that happened.\r\nPupa has gained notoriety for its awful quality, but in truth, there's really nothing in it that should spark such outrage or woe.  We're not talking about a highly anticipated anime, announced with fanfare as a long-awaited adaptation of universally acclaimed manga and featuring an all-star cast and production crew.  No.  Pupa was a barely passable manga by some guy you've never heard of with no noteworthy fanbase that Studio Deen, in their infinite wisdom, decided to green light.   They waffled around for a while abouta budget and structure, ultimately deciding to fling out a supbar budget in 3-minute installments.  Should we be surprised that it was the anime equivalent of accidentally sitting on your own testicles?  This outcome was as predictable as the ending of Co-Ed Dorm Orgy Jamboree 17.  Spoiler: Everybody came.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway.\\n\\n\r\nI feel it should be said that not everything in Pupa was an utter trainwreck.  There were some things done right.  Instead of focusing on the negative, I'll try to highlight the, er, highlights.\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nStory - 2/10\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nThere is something here that could arguably be called an interesting premise under heavy influence of narcotics and sleep deprivation.\\n\\n\r\nA cute, doe-eyed teenage girl turns out to be the demons and develops a craving for manflesh.  We're treated to some backstory, where certain circumstances have driven her to undying (huehuehue) love for her older brother.  Her brother, in turn, feels a strong sense of duty towards his sister.  It's rather touching, really.  Literally.\\n\\n\r\nYeah.\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nArt - 3/10\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever been to an art museum and looked a piece that you didn't immediately understand? You tried tilting your head, squinting, and scratching and sniffing to derive hidden meanings?\\n\\n\r\nWell, this isn't one of those times.  If you hate vague and indecipherable art, you will probably not want to kill yourself after looking at the images in Pupa.  There's no doubt about it.  Two arms.  Two legs.  A face.  Those are definitely people.  Human people.  The artist's intention was clear and effectively conveyed.\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nSound - 4/10\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nAs a music enthusiast, I can say with resolution that there was indeed all evidence pointing to the existence of a soundtrack.  I would surmise that a musician was brought into a recording studio and hit keys on a variety of instruments, producing notes in a succession that one might call music.\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually not awful.  The music is good enough that you forget it exists.  I marathoned the show, so I was treated to the opening song every four minutes for the better part of an hour.  At the time, I thought \"hey, this 30 second tune is actually kinda catchy.\" Of course, I completely forget what it sounded like now, a few hours later.  I think there was a guitar involved?  I believe the word \"Pupa\" was repeated while the title card helpfully flashed on the screen.  I also recall a piano piece used a couple of times throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nCharacters - 1/10\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nR.I.P. Yamamoto :'(\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1/10\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nIt's the anime that has everybody talking about how shitty it is! Join in on the fun!\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nOverall - 2/10\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most important things about this anime is that it opens so many questions.  Perhaps the sadists involved in this piece had intended for a sequel, or perhaps to draw interest to the manga (I haven't read it, but I can only assume that it provides an answer or two).\\n\\n\r\nIf you sit through this series, you'll be asking yourself a lot of questions, such as:\\n\\n\r\n1) Why was the mother hospitalized?\\n\r\n2) What the shit is up with that dad, for real?\\n\r\n3) What?\\n\r\n4) What did this shit have to do with any of that shit?\\n\r\n5) What happened to the pregnant lady?\\n\r\n6) Why?\\n\r\n7) What happened to the girl's monster form?\\n\r\n8) Wait, go over the effects of that virus one more time?\\n\r\n9) Actually, never mind, I don't want to know?\\n\r\n10) These aren't even questions anymore, but I'm still baffled?\\n\\n\r\nLook forward to Pupa 2: Onii-Chan's Giving Birth, Probably",

Which, honestly, isn't a big deal, but I'll try not to. First off, twelve episode series (not that bad) but four minutes in length for each episode. Not the worse thing until the realization that it is trying to be more serious and dark. Not only does it fail to set this mood, but instead I found myself grinning to the incestuous dialogue (like \"parts of me were sliding down her throat\").  The premise is not bad, heck I daresay interesting, but with such poor execution, I could not take it seriously.  Not to mention the cliche characters(the brother looks like every other male protagonist  subtract black hair). All of this bundle together makes my enjoyment less than zero, because I really want to love it. As I said, an interesting premise, but the short episode length decimates any chance of setting it up properly. \\n\r\nThe one good thing about Pupa is the art. I do enjoy the art style (hence the 7), it did a good job of taking my attention away from the horrible-everything-else. Alas, its not enough to save this show. \\n\r\nOverall, an interesting premise with poor execution. The art style is good (in my opinion), however the awkward dialogue along with the poor characters and very fast-paced story telling, makes me hate this show. \\n\r\nOne final note: each episode is three minutes taking out the intro and outro, therefore the entire anime takes only half an hour to watch, so I still recommend you watching it.

An exaggerated gore accompanied by a preposterous attempt at making cannibalism look sexual sufficed to put me at my tether. Pupa could have won me over if the revelation was not a deep-dyed one liner. Four minutes runtime per episode for a horror anime was a conspicuous miscalculation. An anime which was theorized to leaveme thrilled and aghast with its grotesque supernatural and slaughter turned out to be \"unintentionally\" yet absurdly funny. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not surprising at all to see an anime like pupa with an average animation plus a nonsensical cringe as its only \"points\" to meet its inevitable fate of being hated by the maximum.

That's what it's like sometimes when you love someone so much. Well I'm not sure why I interpreted it that way, but I think it has something to do with the fact that I really really really  tried to like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6\\n\r\nThis anime deserved so much less for reason I will now mention, but I gave it a 6 because I actually enjoyed watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS!!!\\n\\n\r\nso much potential, such a good looking plot, so many ways they could go right with this... and they go wrong.\\n\r\nwhen I finished this I had to make sure that I wasn't missing any episodes, because it just... finished.\\n\r\nThe ending made the entire anime POINTLESS.

You might say, but let me explain.\r\nAside from, the incest, I like the concept of the show, if it was longer I feel like it could've been interesting. When I watched this I was disgusted for sure. Turning to my best friend watching it with me and going, \"ew, well that happened\" \r\nBut I'm serious, if this was a 24 episode, 25 minute length series, and it got serious developments, plot twists and the what nots it could've been SOMETHING at least, instead of a notorious half anhour sitting of pure uncomfortableness. But then again if it was going at the rate it was, it still would probably not be good. \\n\\n\r\nAside from that, sound, eh it's ok, I've heard worse. Art? I actually like the art style, it reminds me of Wolf Girl Black Prince a little bit. But there was some weird parts in the anime (ASIDE from the incest cannibalism) where sometimes they would censor a gore scene, but then another rolls around and it doesn't? Inconsistent censoring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you may as well watch it, honestly with you reading this review, you almost certainly already heard of the horrors of Pupa. I did too before I watched it, and compared to other things I've watched, it actually isn't that...disturbing. But maybe you're not like me, maybe you're squeamish or you've been dared to watch this, I don't know. But in the long run you may as well watch it, but only to say you've watched it. There isn't anything fulfilling about this anime. There was a very slim chance, but still a chance of it being an ok horror anime, but it isn't. So go watch it and thank the anime gods that it will only take you around half an hour to complete it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "As of today, Pupa is my second least favorite anime I have ever watched. \r\nStory (1)\r\nThe story begins with a brother Utsutsu and his sister Yume coming home from school. Yume is infected with the Pupa virus that turns her into a monster that can only survive by eating human flesh. Her brother also has the virus that allows him to instantly heal.\r\nA woman named Maria captures the siblings for research. She persuades Utsutsu to forever act as food for Yume so she won't have to kill. This leads to gory scenes of watching Yume eat her brother. Also there are a few scenes ofUtsutsu being tortured. While he can quickly heal, it does nothing to rid him of the pain. I personally found both of these instances uncomfortable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no real plot. The story itself is confusing. Later in the anime it is told through the mother that Yume has always eaten raw animals. It's never revealed if this actually happened, or a part of her hallucinations. There are lots of subplots that never go anywhere, such as Maria randomly being pregnant that is never mentioned again. The reason for the virus is never explained, nor why Maria is so interested in researching these kids. \\n\\n\r\nThen the last episode is in no way relevant to the rest of the story.\\n\\n\r\nMostly I feel that this is just gory and disturbing just to be gory and disturbing. What more there is no message in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the episodes are extremely short, I finished watching the series confused as to what actually happened. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1)\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this anime are unlikable and have no development.\\n\\n\r\nI think Utsutsu was meant to be portrayed as literally self-sacrificing. He endures all this suffering without ever fighting back, or searching for another alternative. Other than caring for his sister, nothing is known about the guy. He has no personality, a very bland character.\\n\\n\r\nYume is unlikable as possible. She greedily feasts on her brother and never once thanks him or shows remorse for hurting him or killing the other characters in this story.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other character in Pupa has no personality and pretty much nothing is known about them. It is hard to relate to a character when the audience is given no information on them.\\n\\n\r\n Art (4)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not bad.\\n\\n\r\nI like the use of the color red here. It's interesting how the backgrounds and clothing are neutral which better displays the red butterflies, the blood, and what I assume is Utsutsu's birthmark. \\n\\n\r\nSomething I feel is clever is the use of the teddy bears. Several times violent scenes are shown through the teddy bears that represent a particular character. For instance, the Yume teddy is shown eating stuffing from the Utsutsu teddy. Had all the gruesome moments been shown with the stuffed animals, I feel it would have been much more effective.\\n\\n\r\nSound (4)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is decent. I don't have any complaints or compliments here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was uncomfortable to watch. It's disturbing and had it not been so short, I would not have been able to finish it. It was a horrible experience and I will never watch this anime again.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion (1)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is confusing. There is no plot. It's gruesome, disturbing, and uncomfortable to watch. The characters are unlikable and have no development. The art is okay, but not enough to make up for everything else.\\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this to anyone.\\n\\n\r\n1/10",

But I really think it should because everyone needs to be told what bullshit they r getting involved in.\r\nParticularly there's only one thing to say about this show: horrible! It sucks however hard I tried to sympathize with it. The story is like a mess: two siblings have some probs with their father being violent, and then the little sis turned into a monster after seeing red butterflies. Then, she ate her bro. I was thinking what's the point of having a little girl eat her brother and suddenly, the public toilet (?) scene came right away with the answer!I know I'm a little dirty-minded but the bro sounded like he was having some yaoi stuff in his belly. And the girl? She didn't even think about her bro getting hurt and keep calling his name like a drunkard while topping him! It's just gross! They even have a whole episode that has sis-chan on top of her nonstop-moaning bro in a bed, half of their clothes was off! Seriously I couldn't understand what this show was talking about! Child abuse? Nope, it's just some meaningless details added to make them more miserable. Brohood? Meh! Only masochists and hentai old men can think of that as love. Anyway, at last I saw the pregnant woman (?) and was completely grossed out. I'm not going to spend 20 mins of my life to watch the rest of this bullshit. The reason why I continued was simply curiousity.\\n\\n\r\nSis-chan's voice is very irritating. The op is bearable. I can't remember the ed. There's no memorable soundtracks (this's good because they shouldn't be wasted in such terrible show).\\n\\n\r\nGraphic is the worst. Though it's 2014, I wonder if they did it intentionally.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, as above, psychos.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10. I totally understand why the statics go down like a pyramid. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: don't watch this kind of show unless you're looking for something stupid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Pupa is a good story, a good manga from what I hear, and Studio Deen put a lot of time and effort into making something good. Then, the censors happened and a regularly timed show that followed the manga got turned into a 4 minute per episode mess of over censoring and incoherence. \r\nThe real shame is that this show could have been great. The art is really well done, the sound is great, hell they even went as far as to record actual eating noises for some of the sound effects. But I don't think you can blame the director, Studio DEEN, or thesource material for the complete fail that was this anime. That all goes on the censors. \\n\r\nI've heard people discuss whether the over-use of censoring was a way of DEEN \"sticking it to the man,\" or that the random time jumps and incoherence was also part of the studio fighting back against being forced to censor a show they did not want to censor.\\n\r\nWhen you consider Sakura Trick, it makes some sense. That show is also a Studio DEEN show, also aired winter 2014, and also has some pretty mature themes, but it was able to air un-cut, in full, while Pupa was relentlessly chopped up, to the point where there's some scenes that are almost entirely censors. \\n\r\nI would have given this a 1/10, but the art and sound were really well done. I'd love to get a hold of the un-cut full episodes of this, because I feel like it might be worth watching. Sadly, what was aired, is not worth your time, other than for a quick laugh at the comments in the forums.\\n",

            "content": "I will be honest, really honest! I actually started this anime because of the curiosity. (after seeing so many people who rated this anime really badly) I thought ...\r\n*before watching*\r\n\u2326 \"Whoa, is it really THAT bad?!\" \r\n*after watching*\r\n\u2326 \"No\"\r\nSo, my review may sound strange if you compare it to others' reviews. However i think this anime worth a try. It's not perfect or great but still... \r\nThe anime itself has a strange way of storytelling so you may hate it, or you may like it. Depends on your taste.\r\nYou know, each episode is like 4-5 mins, so it's easy to handle each episode. Anyways, let'sstart reviewing each section!\\n\\n\r\n\u2701---------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u272dStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, you must know that the anime is made to \"advertise the manga\". So don't expect a \"really detailed\" story. It's more like an introduction or a trailer. Because of skipping some parts of the story, you may have some difficulty to understand what's going on. There is no real ending of the story. So you are left empty-handed. \\n\r\nIf you plan to watch this anime, after watching it you must read the manga for the REAL story.\\n\r\nLike watching a movie after a trailer. \\n\\n\r\n\u272dArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nReally, i really like the character desings, it's detailed and looks pretty cool. The animation of the anime is kinda similar to \"Usagi Drop\"s animation which is a style that i like.\\n\\n\r\n\u272dSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending songs are not that bad, they were fine. \\n\\n\r\n\u272dCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nC-H-A-R-A-C-T-E-R-S!! The only thing that bothered me! They weren't unique. A cute/shy acting little sister and a \"I will protect you until the end\" brother. These are our main characters. Nothing more nothing less... No development. \\n\r\nBy the way these characters' relationship seems like an incest relationship however it's not quite but borderline incest I would say. \\n\\n\r\n\u272dEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the anime that much since there wasn't actually a story. However anime isn't that bad so i didn't drop the anime and i watched it until the end.\\n\\n\r\n\u272dOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLike i said before, this anime isn't a great anime but worths a try. The only purpose is advertising the manga. \\n\\n\r\n\u2701---------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI am sure you haven't heard or expected that this anime has a manga. So i think the producers made their adversiting in a way and they did succeed. (by gaining so many hate. XD) Still i don't hate this anime, it has its unique way.",

I did not care for the MAL story plot provided. \r\nNot the type of thing I like watching, but it wasnt deserving of all the 1 ratings you see. Maybe I'm just too lienient on myratings? Idk. The anime was enjoyable enough, it wasnt painful to watch, wasnt fantastic either. It doesnt deserve all the hate it got. \\n\r\nEach episode is really only 3 minutes long. I didnt mind watching it but my biggest problem is that every question is left unexplained. The anime juat leaves you hanging to figure out all the questions yourself. Besides that, everything else is fine. Well minus the cannibal x incest thing and the gore and creepy teddy bears.",

I was expecting such a thrilling manga to have a regular length anime. Anyways, besides the fact that this anime is a short, I really enjoyed how everything was fast and picked up really quickly. The illustrations were unique and it caught my attention. But, that's probably all I liked about Pupa the anime.",

The animation is decent and the directing is pretty good . The opening was    gorgeous and the backgrounds were just lovely.\r\n-Music is allright . While the tracks themselvesare good , they repeat them so much it gets kinda distracting and sometimes the music doesnt fit with the mood.\\n\r\nCons: \\n\r\n-The story was dreadful. If this was a 90 minute movie I could consider Pupa okay at best , but instead we have : subplots that go absolutely nowhere , a galore of plotholes , flashbacks that end way too early and unexplained character motivations. The 4 minute runtime was definetly among the biggest problems of the show . This is a show that seriously needed to be 2 times longer in lenght. Not helped by the fact that the story itself was very poor .\\n\r\n-The characters dont have enough screen time . Other than the 2 main characters and the sorta villain Ai Imari and the main characters mother, none of the other characters have slightest amount of depth , personality or reason for there actions . The show doesnt even explaind the main characters fathers reason for his cruel behavior (wich I wont spoil) and as a result, it just created 11 more layers of cunfusion.\\n\r\n-The gore . I know this is an odd thing to conplain about , but the way this show handles all the violence , makes elfen lied seem like Jin roh the wolf brigade . To put it out simply some of the most famous scenes in the show are played in a very calm and semi-erotic tone .Wich is wierd considering SPOILER ALERT!!!!!                                                            all that is happening in those scenes is just one character slowl eating another character from multible parts of his body .Besides that all the other gore is kida silly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: \\n\r\nIm not gonna lie , despite the show making me feel uncoftorable , I was kinda glad I saw it. Dont get me wrong its a terrible show but at the same time it was a short and memorable experience. You can find the show uncensored on youtube and with your own risk , check it out and you might find something special.",

            "content": "Anime Series Review No.7\r\nWe got this hyped anime series in the year 2013 title PUPA where lots of anime fans and manga fans alike expected this series to be a decent blood gore and horror which I also expect back in those days but yeah anime got delayed but that\u2019s not the problem for this series but the biggest problem that this anime have is the studio who adapted it. Feel free to read my review if you guys want to know why I solely blame the studio and not the original source material.\r\nPlot (3/10)\r\nReason why the plot is train wreck\r\n- 4 minute duration \r\n-Turbo Fast Story Progression\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s the reason why the plot is a train wreck because the short amount of time minus to the opening and ending that lasted half a minute each and we can get a story that is too fast that it\u2019s be too late before you can take it seriously and understand the plot. Horror anime series don\u2019t work that way. If the studio have proper brains they have just made 3 episode or 2 episode Ova with additional fillers to better explain the plot and we will get a anime OVA worth the average plot than this failed anime adaptation we get from a studio who invested there money to lesser content series for the major cash grab. Making PUPA a potentially good anime to be hated for failed adaptation which the studio is the one reason to be blamed in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10)\\n\r\nProblem why the characters is harder to be liked\\n\r\n- The short duration of the series give very small time for the character to be introduced properly\\n\r\n- The focus is just solely in the siblings but still poorly presented to juice them out to be likable.\\n\r\n- Side characters are just plain food and butchering material to decorate the blood gore scene.\\n\\n\r\nAs I did my best to understand the characters from the anime I can\u2019t. But there\u2019s a good side story I liked which explain why the siblings act\u2019s parents acting violently against them but still the duration is too short to explain everything. The anime did explain some part where the manga didn\u2019t in the characters but that\u2019s still not enough cause the manga can fill it up with just one volume or few pages in a chapter.\\n\\n\r\nSound (2/10)\\n\r\nNothing Bad in particular to say about this part but I still I dislike it. I dislike the background music cause it\u2019s meaningless cause of the duration of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt(4/10)\\n\r\nIssues\\n\r\n- Censored Blood Gore is annoying especially if the show duration is also annoying nothing to appreciate anymore. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is blood gore if that\u2019s not presented well and then the show is pointless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10)\\n\r\nI would not recommend this show for the purpose that I don\u2019t want people to waster their precious 48 minutes in this anime. Guys I will tell you I just waited for the uncensored version to come out for I won\u2019t be enjoying it a single bit. There are a lot of better anime there to worth investing your time with but not this anime. Trust me guys.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It starts out as mysterious and then Yume and Utsutsu get a virus called Pupa. Yume becomes a flesh eater while her brother has regenerating powers, allowing for Yume to control the virus within her by feeding on him. Horrible anime plotting. \r\nThe art is actually kinda cute, especially when the characters are shown as teddy bears. I guess it isn't really a horror anime...more like pain mixed with fluff.  \r\nI'm going to skip thesound and go into character. I think their back stories are pretty interesting, but the rest of it isn't as entertaining. They are slowly exposing who they really are, but it's also confusing and, as I've said many times, horrible. \\n\r\nBasically, I don't really see this as an award winning anime and it deserves the 3.5 star rating it currently has.",

            "content": "Story: 2/10\r\nHow do I begin? I guess I'll start with it's biggest flaw. Each episode is only four minutes long (three if you subtract the intro and outro). This adds up to about 36 minutes of material. A little bit more than one episode of a normal anime. This is a downright embarrassment to the Pupa manga. I heard that this show ruined the series for a lot of people who loved the manga. If I had read this after reading the manga, I'd probably give it a two or even a one.\r\nMaybe you're asking why it's so bad that the episodes are so short.This is terrible because it rushes the story along, leaving out tons of material from the manga. The concept of Pupa is interesting, which may be the only reason Story has a two instead of a one. I'll read the manga and hopefully have a better experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound was fine, didn't really have a problem with either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n You don't develop any feeling towards the characters or get to know them. You might want to feel sympathy for the main protagonists, but you don't know anything about them. You don't feel any type of connection to them. There is absolutely no character development in this anime. You get the basic backstory and that's it.  You don't learn anything else about the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I enjoyed about Pupa was... hmmmm... there has to be something... oh, there were boobs in episode seven. I guess that counts for something... but it's still too unenjoyable to earn a two. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a poor excuse for an adaptation. who thought that four minute episodes was a good idea? Why leave out so much material? Was it too much money or work to make it at least decent? This could've been a very popular show if it was done right, but sadly it was executed poorly, earning itself a three. Like I said, if I had watched this after reading the manga, I would probably be giving this a two, maybe even a one. You got lucky, Pupa.",

            "content": "This show is barely an anime, and deserves to be called nothing more than a piece of garbage.\r\nI was online, looking for some good horror animes to watch. Someone thought to suggest Pupa, and I was a bit skeptical but looked into it anyway. I mean, what would I lose? Well, I was definitely wrong. My dignity? Pretty sure I lost that the moment I turned on the first episode of this hot mess. Usually, I would have a fit if an anime were only four minutes per episode. Anime deserves so much more! 24 minutes an episode is barely enough. But with Pupa, Iwas more than relieved to see that there were only four minutes per episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite being awful and lacking a lot of everything, Pupa had a plot, just not a good one. Whoever thought that incest and cannibalism went together probably didn't have too much of a brain. Actually, maybe this person's idea was good, but it just didn't translate too well on paper. Forget it, I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it. It's just bad. Not only was the plot bad,but it was never fully explained. Maybe because there were only four minutes to an episode?\\n\\n\r\nArt 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis will probably be the nicest thing I have to say about Pupa, but the art wasn't horrible. It wasn't amazing either, but it wasn't horrible. \\n\\n\r\nSound 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, the awful sounds of a young cannibal eating her brother's flesh, what could be better? Probably anything. Every time she was about to eat him, I would cringe and just wait for it to be over. It's rare that I have a problem with the sounds that a gruesome anime has in it, but this was something else. Something that I never want to hear again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy watching this tale of two siblings' rather awkward interactions? No, I did not. I did not enjoy hearing this little girl lustfully crying out \"Onii-chan\", each time she took a bite of his flesh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOh how I wish I could rank this show lower than a 1. Pupa does not deserve my recognition and I really suggest you avoid it at all costs.",

            "content": "Now, At first, upon seeing the art style(that cute imouto!), I was very excited about this anime, so I immediately went to watch it. And my! was I not disappointed! Yume(the aforementioned little sister) is indeed adorable!\r\n...\r\nAnd that is about the only thing this anime got right.\r\nPupa Pew-pa\r\nnoun\r\nan insect in its inactive immature form between larva and adult, e.g., a chrysalis.\r\nEmphasis on \"inactive\" and \"immature\", a very apt description of this anime, making the title completely spot-on.\r\nStory:1\r\nWell, the story is simple: ...Read the synopsis, it's there.\r\nSo anyway, it seems pretty clear and easy to follow, but the show makes it unnecessarily complicated with it's ridiculouslyaimless narrative whose only purpose is to shock the viewer. First, it starts by showing us the transformation, wherein the transformed creature literally bursts out of victim, seemingly killing them, monster starts eating everybody, then next thing you know, she's back to her normal, naked self.\\n\\n\r\n\"Wait, What?\" (image: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16634176/random/zetsuenwtf.jpg ignore the caption) was the only thing I could say, \\n\\n\r\nBut wait! it gets worse! the anime then proceeds to alternate between gross out blood and gore, Vorarephilia, and generic, exaggerated child abuse flashbacks, and is pretty inconsistent and secretive about the effects and nature of the pupa virus(hint: withholding information does not make a good mystery, we should at least know how it works, you can leave out where it came from and other details). And that's just the tip of the iceberg, so how about what's underwater? There unfortunately lies the root of this whole mess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo explain, Stories have something called \"concept\" and \"premise\".\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Love Live: School Idol Project's concept is\\n\\n\r\n\"Girl discovers that her school is scheduled to be shut down, so she capitalizes on a new bandwagon within schools in order to save hers.\"\\n\\n\r\n the premise is\\n\\n\r\n \"Girl discovers that her school is closing down, and to do so, the school must attain a certain quota of enrollees to keep itself running.so she decides that she has to prevent that, but she just can't think of anything that would attract students. Just as she was about to give up, she then discovers a new trend on other schools: School Idols, which seems to attract students to schools who have them, this gives the girl 'the best idea she ever had', and the journey begins.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo in other words, concept is \"the basic idea of the story\", while  premise is \"the specific execution of the concept\", so how the concept is explored and done, together, they're what makes the story unique.\\n\\n\r\nPupa unfortunately fails on both account. its concept is \"person contracts a virus, turns into a monster\" with the premise being... essentially just that, until it arbitrarily decides to backtrack and change things here and there,(the virus was already there at birth, guy somehow gets a virus for no reason, they were abused as children because the virus, they were abused at the request of someone, etc) Seemingly unable to decide how to go about it's established premise.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, the \"human turns to monster because reasons\" premise isn't too bad (see Ergo Proxy, or heck, even The Hulk and Dr Jekyll and Hyde, which are both a variation of it) but with Pupa's inconsistency and confusing narrative, it obviously sets itself up for failure.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's even worse than all of these, is that underneath it's premise, is a generic child abuse story featuring sociopathic abusers and abusees, with the theme of... it's not really clear what the theme is, when there seemingly is no message other than \"man-meat tastes good\" and \"we must pity sociopathic killers because the ones abusing them are worse\". Really though, who am i kidding, this show is devoid of any meaning whatsoever. or if it had one, it surely did a terrible job getting it across.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 4\\n\\n\r\nthe art is decent. everything is colored as if it were done with colored pencils, giving the anime a sort of \"childish\", innocent look. contrast with it's dark, bloody content, it makes for a pretty good juxtaposition of opposites...\\n\\n\r\nexcept the art team screwed up in the design department. The monster design looks pretty lame, even \"ugly cute\"(like PvZ zombies) and not intimidating at all, this may be intentional because of who transforms, but it surely waters down the supposed transformation of a person into a horrid creature. the environments were all pretty standard, with only Maria's inner sanctum standing out in it's uniqueness(the statues were a nice touch). The characters were drawn in the most \"anime-ish\" way possible, so you can be forgiven if you mistake any of the characters here for someone else(Hey, Utsutsu! what are you doing in Yumekui Merry?).\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\\n\r\nGood voice acting on all the female characters(Yume swallowing, Yume being cute, Maria's lady tone, Sachiko's cold tone) (and utsutsu being protective, the rest of the men are forgettable) are unfortunately wasted on this drivel. the death screams are not too cheesy. The music, on the other hand, though completely forgettable, are fitting at least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\\n\r\nThere are no characters in this story. only personality-less archetypes, or \"cardboard cutouts\" as some would call them(damn, Nagi no Asukara raised my bar high! and i mean both my bars). There's the battered Aniki who swears to mamoru his sibling, the battered imouto who is a moeblob, the sexy femme fatale with an agenda(when have they never had an agenda?), the guy in shades who is an assistant, the abusive megane father, the submissive mother, and the generic faceless soldiers and generic faceless mad doctors. I think that's everyone. Literally EVERYONE here has generic flaws and goals. Of course, it would have been better if these flaws and goals were expanded upon, they would have seemed more unique, but with less than 5 minutes to tell each episode, it simply isn't possible... then, could they have just made these people less like puppets playing their roles and more like people acting out their instinct? Maybe, but of course, this seems to be yet another intentional flaw, but doesn't work because there's nothing likeable about ANYONE here... except Yume's cuteness, which Saya of Saya no Uta surpasses eitherway.\\n\\n\r\nBut... characters don't normally need intricate backgrounds to be likeable, just a clear personality and standout characteristic makes them seem more appealing, if not realistic. e.g. an abusive person who comes up with unique ways to torture someone can be likeable for his creativity. if you've read Mai-chan no Nichijou(aka Mai-chan's Daily Life, read it for the meme), there's this \"President of 'A' Country\" who invented an AAAAAWWWWRRRIIGHT way to inflict psychological and physical harm to a pregnant person, all while smiling like an child playing with his toys. he's a horrible person, but he's likeable for his unique methods. basically it's like \"admiring the villain's for being an entertaining villain\" in a way. I mean who doesn't like The Joker of Batman? Zod of Superman? Lordgenome of TTGL? Majin Boo of DBZ?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nOK, here comes the weird part: I actually had fun watching this show! remember the zetsuenwtf(from Zetsuen no Tempest) pic above? I had that expression the entire time I was watching(marathon) this miniseries. so at the very least, there is entertainment value on this. I was mostly having fun watching Yume eat in the most suggestive and seductive way(I was about to have dinner when marathoning the show, figured I needed an appetizer, it worked, sorta). and on Maria's crazy ramblings and standing around. The rest of the show though... I'd rather forget since it's mostly just pictures of bloody dismembered bodies, seriously. all the budget went into Yume eating.\\n\\n\r\nThis should have been titled \"Isshoni Eating: Nantaimori with Yume-chan\" with all the blood and gore removed and replaced with sweets, and Yume eats on the audience's naked body using her mouth and this would easily be a 10/10 slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo why would anyone watch this, anyway? if they got reeled in by the cute imouto, they're in for some treat. if you expect anything more than \"cute girl\", you're in for a huge disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nverdict? 3 if calculated, but that would be too generous since the only element I liked is the imouto, so 2.",

            "content": "I heard how bad it was, which is probably why I decided to watch it. Also, marathoning the series would only be like 30 minutes of my time. So at like 1 am today, I started Pupa. \r\nI will be the first to admit that I am absolutely a biased reviewer. I like pretty art and style-content dissonance, which is why my evaluation is all over the place. Nevertheless, I will try to explain myself.\r\nThe 3-minute format, predictably, was a disservice to a horror piece like this. It's simply not long enough to be truly tension-building. Also, the episode content was all over the place.There was a loose sense of continuity, and the series ended on something that felt like a mid-season filler. Plot points were thrown in and then abandoned, so I wasn't really sure where the story was going and what it was doing.\\n\\n\r\nI actually liked the art style. While the big-eyes thing is usually not my deal, I think the innocence the style conveyed contrasted nicely with the (attempted) horror. I liked the watercolor-y background, and the character designs weren't the worst. Also, the teddy bear imagery was a good inclination at the innocence of these kids. Likewise, the music wasn't too bad either. I like the innocence in the sound that contrasted with the content. However, the munchy-munchy sounds were gross and way too wet.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were weak at best. They were reduced to an imouto-oniichan complex with some cannibalism thrown in. They never developed beyond the siscon relationship, which came out of nowhere after the first couple of episodes and dominated the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThere was way too much crammed into 3 minutes. If this was mindless vore and cannibalism, I would have been fine. Even the oversexualized take on the cannibalism would have been fine. However, the incest completely ruined it. Sexualized incest has its place, and it isn't in a vore/horror 3-minute short that doesn't even have time to develop itself.. Also, the censorship sucked, plain and simple. Sometimes, more than half the screen got blocked out. If you're gonna advertise as a vore or horror, you've gotta deliver, especially since that's all the series has going for it.\\n\\n\r\nI told myself that, even if it was bad, at least it was only 30 minutes of my time. 30 minutes is way too much time for this trainwreck, but at least I'll understand why people hate it so much. Given a full 24 minutes per episode and removal of all censorship, the series might have saved itself. Maybe.",

Mains are mostly undeveloped as well, however they get SOME credit since they are shown to care about one another a lot, and given reasons as to why they do.\r\nThose are the main two objective issues with the show. The few reasons I find that others can't find ANY enjoyment in the short series are simply that the show handles taboo topics veryheavily.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the siblings show a VERY close relationship to one another, possibly incestuous even, but never shown directly on screen, so it's hard to tell.\\n\r\nHowever, *SPOILER ALERT* their sperm and egg cells are combined to make a \"monster child\" that we never see in the show. Said child is not made through the consent of our main characters and is made without their knowledge.\\n\r\nEven so, the relationship is there, and clearly affects motives of the two characters, and I completely understand the hate for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe other taboo subject that is obvious and an extreme deal-breaker for many, is the cannibalism. The main characters both play a large role in this, making it especially hard to swallow *wink wink*.\\n\r\nThe girl eats human flesh, tearing others apart at times with her monstrous powers. The boy gets eaten by her, since his powers allow his body to constantly regenerate.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the cannibalistic subject matter was not too much for me to handle personally, I can absolutely see why it could be for others, it's quite disgusting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the reason I found this mildly entertaining, is because the art style is good, the music is fantastic, and the premise is really cool to me (even if it went a bit wasted due to the very short run time.)",

Well animated, even. Heck, the soundtrack was kinda cool and VAs weren't fucking annoying as hell.\\n\\n\r\nAs a not necessarily relevant point, I'm 104% sure there is a vast amount of people getting off to this shit. For every one of my \"nopes\", there's a person getting a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nIt's been much too many years since this aired, so there's little point in trying to point out how not-entirely-horrible this one is but I guess i just wanted to put it out there. Not so bad. Short enough to be worth a watch.\\n",

Unfortunately this anime is incredibly poorly done. Everything seems so incredibly rushed- i mean did they really think they could make a decent anime with 4 min episodes? \r\nThe story  just wasn't there. The episodes ended so fast and just jumped to another random spot in the next one there's no keeping up. There are so many unanswered questions and it's extremely frustrating. It feels like I'm watching a recap / summary ofwhat each episode should have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty unique imo. I kinda liked it actually.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters... I don't even know who some of them are supposed to be. Another result of these 4 minute episodes that have absolutely no time to explain anything at all. There's so much stuff going on it's hard to keep track of everything. I really REALLY wished they went more in depth on the characters' backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nI somewhat enjoyed this anime I honestly think everyone's being a bit too hard on it. It's not the worst thing in the world. I would actually recommend watching it seeing as how it's not even an hour long to watch the entire thing. I had such high hopes for this and was incredibly disappointed. But don't get me wrong, it was pretty interesting to watch.",

I didn't have any expectations for this because I haven't heard of this show/manga before and since it was 4 minutes per episode, I thought \"Eh what the hell, why not?\" I heard the manga is decent but I can't confirm that myself since I never read it. Also fun fact: in Polish the word Pupa means bum. Bum as in Ass. Anyway... \r\nStory: 2 \r\nThe story was confusing and all over the place. All I got from it was that there is a girl that is a flesh eating monster andshe keeps feasting on her onii-chan so that she doesn't harm anyone else (I guess?). The story, as I mentioned before, is a mess and I don't get it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nMeh, it's ok I guess. It was not horrible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nAgain meh. The Opening and ending songs are nice, and the voice acting in general was fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nThe character development is non existent and the main characters act the same throughout the show. You will not feel any sort of attachment to the main characters what so ever. It's only established that they are siblings that are on another level of close and that the little sister likes to feast on her big bro's flesh and that the big bro is like eat me all you want. Also he is a monster too so his flesh grows back.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 2\\n\r\nIt's bad, very bad. But it sounds ok and it visually looks like some effort was put into the art at least. It was very gory, but scary? Nah, It was forgettable and could probably only scare a kid. I recommend you watch it, as much as I recommend you watch boku no pico. So I don't recommend it.\\n\\n",

Apparently not a great adaption so maybe get the manga after.\r\nThe story is very minimal, like the studio clearly only wanted the most shocking bits and got rid of everything in-between. There's clearly sexual allegory that was desired but maybe not effeciently told. Art is fine, generic. Sound was eh. Dissonant soundtracks are neat but this was a bit blatant. Character was meh.I dunno, I still liked it. It's a wild and creepy ride that, while I wouldn't go on it again, I'm glad I didn't pass up.",

            "content": "It feels weird to write my very first review on what I'd like to call, one of the most disappointing shows I've ever watched. The title itself felt interesting and needless to say, it was a recommendation from one of my friends. I watched and tried my very best to find in myself some sort of appreciation for the anime but very unfortunately, I didn't. Regardless of how new I am in the world of anime, it was clear in my senses that Pupa would always be one to include in the list of worst anime.\r\nStory - 2\r\nThe story revolves on the supposed struggle oftwo siblings as the older brother watched his younger sister become a flesh-eating monster and how their life became miserable after that. The story is decent at this part, as the premise was simple and can set the atmosphere for the series of events to come. The problem was how to develop the story and lay out the details of that struggle. I am that type of viewer who does not really care about how unique the story is or how interesting the concept of the anime is; what I want is for the anime to successfully tell me how things happened in a clear and artistic way. This is where Pupa sucked the hardest. The story was very sloppy and unclear, different events with no clear explanations were showed wihout creating any real difference in the main storyline, and jumps from one event to another were made with previous events left unresolved, not to mention that those events weren't foreshadowed in the first place. In fact, there was no clear resolution at the end of the story. That's what was most frustrating. It merely showed a bunch of moaning and biting and blood splatter and gross scenes which don't even make sense. If you look at the scenes assuming that you don't know the anime, you would notice that the foundation that connects the story is the fact that a girl has monstorus flesh eating powers and she has this sister-complex brother who would do stupid pointless things to protect him. It even felt like the story was written for the sake of the anime having a story. So basically, the premise was decent but it was utterly wasted.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3\\n\r\nThere was no character development, that's all. Based on the resolution of the story, the only personality prominent is the sister complex of the brother and the helplessness of the sister. Other characters which could have been significant and created an impact to the storyline were also wasted. The struggle of the characters meant nothing because they always \"went with the flow\" rather than puller of strings of the plot. However, am I the only one who finds Yume hot? But that does not change my view of the characters: WASTED.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound - 4\\n\r\nNothing to say about it, because I really don't care about it. Let me just say that the animation was inconveniently unique and the sound mostly consisted of blood splatter and biting and moaning sounds. However, it was decent enough to jive with the atmosphere Pupa is trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nEverything had the potential to be developed. I felt disgusted with the way they handled the rest of the show. It was shit, honestly.",

Well, now that I've thought about it the gory aspect went from ballsy to just kind of stupid. I thought it would turn out to be that series that has a bunch of disturbing content and then tells a good story, but it really doesn't. Though I assume this is a \"go read the manga\" sort of thing if I want to know how this series ends, well I'll go read that, but if a companyis going to pull that sort of thing, then why don't you just go and read the manga instead of watching the anime. There were so many questions I had that I wanted answered, but they never will be, unless I read the manga. But the ending was just so bad, and was an insult to the people that had become invested after sitting through that sixth episode. It was also much too rushed, and they didn't explain why characters were being attacked, and all those little things that actually make a series good. But what pissed me off the most is that this series had unused potential, it could have been amazing, but it failed to do so.\\n\\n\r\nThe good. The music and art were amazing, I have to give it that. I could find myself really enjoying the music, well, the half minute long opening theme, but since the episodes are so short, it counts for pretty much the whole soundtrack, but the other music generally fit with the scenes they were in. And I really enjoyed this style of art direction.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nIf you have nothing else to watch it's fine, if not just for the art direction and soundtrack. But the story, character development, and my overall enjoyment were pretty low.\\n\\n\r\n6.3/10",

The censored version is stupid, but thankfully uncensored version didhave, but not really much appealing.\\n\\n\r\nThey also make use of the sound effect well, but mostly used was when the person eating something *gory* stuff. Voice actor is ok, but sometimes overused. Always hearing Onii-Chan, and something like that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is forgettable. The only i remember is the Brother, Sister, a Black Clothing Girl, Sister turn Monster, uh.... i don`t know. Most of the characters aren`t even explaining though. Like a Talking Bear.

Some parts are really messed up, I was excited for this for ages, I thought it would be like Another but with monsters, I hadn't read much into it, as I just let the anime artwork decide how soon I want to watch it, along with a short description maybe. The episodes are like 4 minutes long, which I did not expect :s Some bits are a little awkward to watch, especially episode 7. I think you should give it a try, as the episodes are really short, I got caught up to all 7 currentlyout today, you may like it if you are into weird, extremely fast paced anime series with very little development, it won't make you want to tear out your eyes anyway.\\n",

            "content": "How exactly does one describe Pupa? Perhaps as the anime equivalent of a shock site? Or maybe Aki Sora meets Elfen Lied with a bit of Tokyo Ghoul thrown in for good measure? \r\nOne thing is for certain: Pupa had a lot of potential. A previous work by Studio Deen, the first season of Higurashi, is in the top 10 horror anime on all of MAL. The storyline stood out looking at a seasonal chart before it aired, and the artwork is pretty great.\r\nHowever...\r\nSTORY (3/10):\r\nPupa was given less then an hour to tell its story, and it's clear from the get-go the series simply doesn'twork in this format. Entire episodes seem wasted, and it seems like every episode ends right before things might get interesting. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that Pupa is based off a five-volume manga, which is a bit longer then what less then an hour can properly adapt, and that this manga has a significantly higher score then the Pupa anime (as of this writing).\\n\\n\r\nART (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nIf you can give Pupa credit for anything, it's the artwork. This series looks really nice. The facial expressions for the characters are spot-on, and I love the unique format the show's backgrounds took on. I also thought the teddy bear scenes worked well for the series portraying its more grimdark/extreme moments.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I must take a few points off for the ridiculous extent of the gore at times (it sprays literally everywhere), as well as some ridiculous fanservice (\"Okay, this scene has some skeevy undertones, but it seems like it's being played for horror...and now 3/4th of the screen is a bent over short-shorts closeup. Isn't this girl like 12?\")\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and music are decent to pretty good, but I really could have lived without the sucking sounds as Yume eats her brother several times. They're cringy and unpleasant.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that Pupa suffers from due to its short length is that there's no time to become attached or interested in any of the characters. The series focuses a lot on the abuse the main characters received as children, however I had to learn reading online that the manga fleshes out the father character significantly, and explains a bit as to why he is the way he is. Pupa leaves out several details from its manga like this that are quite important.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe feeling you'll get after watching Pupa will probably be of disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: is Pupa a highly flawed, disappointing anime? Yes. However, is it the worst anime ever? Probably not. There are worse. Trust me.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nCONTENT ADVISORY: Pupa features frequent graphic violence, over-the-top gore, mature themes, and lots of pseudo-sexual scenes between a brother and sister. Mature audiences only.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I only watched this anime for the guro. I'm a fan of erotic gore, and that is what I got. I also began with very low expectations anyway, since I've heard about how bad this anime is, so this may be a more positive review.\r\nStory: 1\r\nEach episode was only 4 minutes, which was too short for a 12 episode anime that seems to be aiming to be serious and dark to develop a story. I have never read the manga, and I couldn't understand what was going on. I'm still wondering where and why that guy tortured thebrother and . . . how did Maria (if it was her, anyway) get sperm and egg cells from the brother and sister! Why would she impregnate herself with the monsters. . . ? I did find the end episode to be quite adorable, though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the overlay of the paint brushes, and I also really liked the look of the characters, even if some may argue most anime characters look like it. I cringed anytime the sister was eating. It just looked . . . really bad to my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, which was dark, artistic, and stylized, was one I never skipped. I adore it! I dislike the ED, however.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't develop; they stay the same, for the most part. The brother and sister's relationship just throws incest fanservice at you. A lot of characters are useless; we don't learn anything about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs aforementioned, I came to this anime expecting guro, and that's what I got. Blood, guts, torture, it's all there. Lots of screaming. While the plot content may have not been enjoyable, the mindless fanservice, of a very special kind, was entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters don't even bother to stand up to fall short, but the guro and incestous undertones willl probably entertain at least someone. If that's your thing, check this anime out! If not, stay far away.",

            "content": "There are a couple reasons why I felt compelled to make Pupa my first review on MAL. After hearing many choice words about this anime, I thought I should watch it myself, it being only twelve 4 minute episodes and me appreciating a good psychological horror. Seeing how low it was rated and it being compared to Mars of Destruction, I had very low expectations. However, I was somewhat surprised at the storyline which performed well delivering a disturbing horror piece despite its poor execution in areas.\r\nThe story, which succeeded in supplying me with the disturbing, terrifying, and intriguing horror I was looking for mostlikely fell short to many viewers because it requires thought and piecing together a puzzle. The episodes seemed jumbled and out of order in many places, which to me added a little more to the psychological aspect. The beginning few episodes went with the kind of jump scare horror reaction at the end with something bloody happening, the middle a disturbing look at the life of these siblings living with the Pupa virus, and the end the ambiguous conclusion followed by an odd final episode apparently showing an event from the childhood of Utsutsu and Yume. YES, the story was hard to follow at times, but I also felt it supplied what I was looking for from the genre. (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fine, and nothing special. More expressive and abstract at times, sometimes the characters looked weird. I felt it worked with the psychological aspect with the show. I enjoyed the creative use of teddy bears in place of characters in certain scenes. In terms of the gore, it was up to par and sufficiently disturbed me. (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting seemed forced and oddly clashing at the beginning. However, over the course of the show I either got used to it or it improved. The background music is hardly worth mentioning, although I enjoyed the OP. Some of the sound effects, although not excellent really came through at delivering a disturbing atmosphere, especially when Yume feeds. The sexual atmosphere created this way was amazingly creepy and disturbing especially with the incest undertones. (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were lacking somewhat; if you could piece things together you get the sibling's past, but at times you wondered why a character was even in this anime, as they seemed to have no connection to the storyline. I don't know. If I re-watch it someday, I might catch on more. In terms of the romance some people describe, I did feel emotions between the siblings; the characters weren't flat 2-D cutouts. (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, considering my enjoyment of this anime, I give it a 4 out of 10. If you enjoy any type of psychological horror like H.P. Lovecraft or just slasher and gore and don't mind a little cannibalism/incest, look past its obvious flaws and give Pupa a try. I felt this anime met its goals of leaving me with a feeling that would be expected from watching any psychological horror genre. If you get too in depth, it is very creepy, if you take it on the surface, it is still weird and chilling. One thing I recommended is watching this over the course of a day or two, don't drag it out as you lose enough between some episodes and will get lost more easily. There is something that can be taken from this show if you are willing to go out there and get it.",

A sister having to eat the flesh of her brother to remain in control, that is an excellent premise.\r\nThis is of course however ruined by the run time ~4 minutes an episode. That's roughly 1 minute less an episode than Hetalia, and Pupa's opening credits are longer so that's even less run time. To compare Hetalia to Pupa is kind of an uneven argument since Hetalia is a Comedy and Pupa is a Horror, but you can get some form of entertainment from hetalia maybea cheap laugh but it did more than Pupa did. And most of it is censored, because flesh eating, they couldn't even throw us a bone with some kind of gore.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is if the episodes came out weekly (They may have, not sure) that makes it difficult to truly be interested when you get barely any information from each episode, as if getting one word of a sentence a week. You just don't care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul has a similar premise to this (Only episode 2 has aired at the time of this review) but as a traditional 23/24 minute run time we're getting more character development, story development and the lore of the world in general.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary: Avoid Pupa at all costs, it's a waste of: Time, memory, breath, battery power and internet history.\\n\r\nWatch Tokyo Ghoul instead, it does this ALOT better\\n",

I was so hyped for this anime, since a friend recommended it to me 2 months before the first episode was released, the story looked interesting and i was looking foward to it.\r\nWhen i watched the first episode, i felt really confused, and i knew that this series was going to be so bad, i dropped this anime for like 6 months and then started watching it again for the sake of thisreview, so yhea...\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: The story was really bad, Yume and Utsusu, two bullied siblings that got infected from a virus named \"Pupa\", and now Yume needs to eat humans in order to satisfy herself.\\n\\n\r\nBut then it goes everywhere, from a girl that wants to do experiments with them, to another organization that wants to use their powers to \"upgrade\" mankind, and a simply thief that wants to kill them, Oh! and a simple episode dedicated to Yume eating her own brother while saying \"Onii-chan\", that's it, Tata!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: These things are all messed up: \\n\r\nYume; She is the only character that turns into a monster, and therefore she needs to eat humans to fill her hunger, and then all she does is eat her brother's insides, all the rest of the series, ugh.\\n\r\nUtsusu; This is probably the lamest brother i have ever seen, instead of finding a cure, he decides to transform his own body into the daily lunch of his dear little sister, so she can't eat anyone else, lame and poor writing...\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast dies between 3 seconds after it's appearance, there is a mad girl called Maria (i think) that uses the sperms of Utsusu and the ovule of Yume (Don't know how did she get them) to get pregnant, so she can give birth to a demon, well too bad because it's the last time we see her.\\n\r\nAnd the mother, that tried to kill Yume when she was a baby because we learn that she was already infected, and the father is just a bad father.\\n\\n\r\n--So yhea, the show is all about Yume eating her brother's flesh.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Simple music made with simple instruments, the music repeats itself in every episode, i only heard like 6 differents songs through the series, and the sound effects are nothing special, they even used the sound effect from Sunrise intro, lol\\n\\n\r\n*OVERALL: Pupa is a terrorific series, just don't watch this anime if you don't want to get disappointed, or you can just simply watch it to laugh because how poorly is made, and after completing it and realizing that you could have spent all that time to make yourself a sandwich.",

It also has some secret organizations but who cares, the story is awlful, who would watch this for anything other than the bizarreness?? \r\nAbout the art... The gore is kinda ok, but the background art looks like it was made by my grandfather. He had no arms. The only point I think is really good is the soundtrack, I enjoyed the BGM. The rest is...A monster girl eating her own brother and blood and worms and what the hell did I just watch.\\n\\n\r\nListen to me, watch this one (uncensored!!!!!) in the night, like 2 a.m., get a drink and relax.

            "content": "When I heard of Pupa I was actually a little excited because of the manga. However I soon realized Pupa was only going to have 12 episodes each with 4 minutes, less if you skip the openings and endings. I deeply regret watching it. The MAL rating system of 1 for 'appalling' accurately describes Pupa.\r\nStory-0.5\r\nThe story started out okay but went downhill after episode 4 or 5. It ended without an explanation and left me with many questions and plot holes. The order was confusing and four minutes is simply not enough for a horror anime that had more potential. Anybody else wonder what happenedto the pregnant lady?\\n\\n\r\nArt-2.5\\n\r\nThe art was poor for our generation but not much to comment about. However it lacked colour. The bloody scenes defied gravity and the scenes kept repeating. The anime had too many censored scenes for a horror/physiological.\\n\\n\r\nSound-3.5\\n\r\nThe opening and ending may possibly be the only pros about this anime. However compared to the other anime that aired during the season, I can only give Pupa a participation award.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-0.5\\n\r\nWhere do I start? There was absolutely no character development until the last episode and I don't think it should even count. Utsutsu's 'scar' on his face is never explained either. It's your typical story where the brother would do anything for his little sister. With a little twist where the imouto eats her brother's meat and of course he can regenerate because that is how science works.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-0\\n\r\nOut of all the anime I have watched so far in my life, Pupa is the only one I regret. I started it a few months ago and dropped it after episode 4 seeing how bad it was. However as the optimist I am, I decided to continue it hoping to find some character development and an interesting plot. What did I find? Nothing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-1.4\\n\r\nI can definitely say that Pupa is the worst anime I have ever watched. Pupa is essentially an exceedingly friendly sibling relationship and lots of cannibalism. On a side note, an excellent to get fit would be to do a push-up every time you hear \u201conii-chan\u201d. Watch Pupa at your own risk.\\n",

            "content": "ALRIGHTY XD REVIEW #2!!! LEGGO. \r\nI would like to start by providing a HUGE warning for the faint-hearted. I.e; People who dislike the sight of blood, twisted story lines, or simply dislike psychologically inept characters. Ultimately, that's all this anime is. A orgy of everything you could possibly consider morally wrong, combined with a massive blood bath of the like. However, I loved it. Take that as you will. \r\nFirst off, the story. Despite my love of mass murder, action, and blood, the plot line was a bit confusing at first. In the first episode, you automatically jump into a school setting, then to apark, where the seemingly sweet and innocent sister, transforms into some sinister, demonic, murderer. WAIT- what? Was my first reaction, however in later episodes it goes on to give a somewhat detailed synopsis of the main sibling's tragic, abused background. Although I enjoyed the feel of the story, my main issue is the half-heartedness  evident throughout the plot. Characters like the researcher Maria-san, and her crew were introduced, leaving the watcher obviously expecting a relevant contribution to the plot, but you're left hanging. It seems as if the creators had an idea they started on, that could've been promising, but sort've left it hanging dry, making you think,\" Uhm, what was the point of that?\" Senseless obstacles can sometimes be entertaining, but in this case, the creator's habit of jumping around without fully developing a point would have to deduct points from the ultimate enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was very good! Modern, and the animation itself was well done, as well as intricately paid attention to. You can especially see this in scenes where Yume is feasting on flesh, as not only is her expression not neglected and left blank, but as her jaw moves through a chewing motion, her expression follows suit. Small details such as this make for better quality. Nevertheless, the censors on objects such as the blades, or knives is puzzling, and irritating. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was appropriate for the scenes, such as darker music would be paired with murderous scenes to provide a more eerie feel. However at some parts, too many background noises were apparent, taking away from what was actually happening on screen. Also, in a sentimental scene, which is crucial, the background music was too loud, overpowering the scene itself, when it should be there for support, and as a gentle accent to the character's actions. \\n\\n\r\nI feel as if the characters were well developed, due to the fact that the watcher is easily able to see what caused a certain action. The blatant appearance of cause and effect, is extremely well played out, but at the same time not overdone. You don't get the feeling the creators were merely adding things as a bonus, but it flows, and fits well with plot. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, what I DIDN'T like, and the reason certain categories were deducted points although my commentary is positive, is the justification for Yume's insatiable hunger, thus forcing her to feed off of her brother, Utsutsu. The creators attempted to create a strong bond between the siblings, Utsutsu, being the type to do anything for his sister, even sacrificing himself as live bait, which fit well with the main themes. Nonetheless, in scenes where Yume was feeding off of Utsutsu, it was HIGHLY UNNECESSARY to create such sexual imagery, and eroticism. It completely contradicts the main point of the story, and does NOT help the plot whatsoever. Additionally, in episode 12, when Utsutsu states,\" I love Yume's erotic face when she's done eating. Being live bait isn't so bad.\", was just downright disturbing. We've had 12 episodes of full-on hardcore killing as a product of a vicious virus, and all of the sudden it turns into some romantic duty of a loving brother in an incestuous relationship?!? No. Unneeded, and uncalled for. \\n\\n\r\nDespite that, I did enjoy this anime. Again if you enjoy action, and gore as much as I do, this is an anime for you!!",

First of all, if you've never read the manga, do not watch it. Because you won't understand and will hate it. After reading the manga, you can enjoy this pretty small anime, acclaimed by critics. The opening and ending song are just awesome and soft, and for me the animation was a gift for those who read the manga, like having the \"taste\" of a real anime. After all, Sayaka Mogi is anew mangaka, and as I searched (not sure) this was his first manga. I think it was proposital to do not explain all in the anime, otherwise the animation wouldn't have 4 minutes of duration~ hope you guys enjoy pupa",

            "content": "(The text is available in English and Portuguese.)\r\nENGLISH - INGL\u00caS\r\n   It was already expected that by the rating of the anime and by the \"Reviews\", that would come a bad thing. Unfortunately, it is part of the life of an anime fan, to judge such work not by its cover, but by its real potential without precepts. The anime fails on almost all the categories that I find useful for creating a full experience. The first one, for sure, is the \"Plot\". I finished seeing this excrement  without understanding what it is, a sister feeding on her brother? The sister who turnsin a monster and her brother tries to help? I have no idea what it is ... Apparently neither the synopsis on the app in which I saw the anime knew, cause it was said that the brother was aiming to restore his sister to normal ... Was this shown in the work? It was not! Now, we are going to the \"Plot Development\", and I have nothing to say, it was practically the worst thing I've ever seen in my life, I do not understand the existence of so many holes and holes in development. If I wanted to, I could finish \"Review\", because \"Pupa\" failed in the most important topics. The characters had something to deliver, but they delivered nothing, interesting characters thrown in the trash and with no function or development. This applies even to the protagonists, whose they were the most developed, and even being the ones that made the most progress, they managed to be a failure, showing a past full of holes to \"fill\" in an anime in which each episode has 4 (Four) minutes.\\n\r\n   We managed to find something not so flawed. We're talking about Dubbing. I consider the only point where they really succeeded in being good, the voices of the protagonists and the extras were not weak, they were normal, but what really caught my attention were the desperate shouts in scenes of torture. At least in that, they went well. I felt in an endless agony to hear (Spoiler) the protagonist's flesh being torn with the teeth of his \"little sister\", or even in the scene when the scientists plucked their organs. (End of Spoiler). Another point that was lousy but was not the worst is the topic of \"Openings and Endings\". I swear the opening is cool, but it was introduced randomly when the episode began. Not only does it seem, as it should be a cut song, where they picked up the chorus and smashed it. Already its finalization is a normal basic song that I did not see problems.\\n\r\n   Now we come to the topic of \"Graphics\", and try to guess what the result? Horrible too! They tried to create something a bit more \"Dark\" and they really succeeded, but something a little darker does not mean that it should have a crappy and rotten animation as was \"Pupa\". The anime \"Steins Gate\" managed to create a more \"Dark\" environment in a splendid way. Another that also achieved such feat was the new film \"Fate Heaven Feels\". Of course such a \"Type Moon\" work has enough money to play great graphics and so on, but the ambience in the anime itself has been turned to a dark sphere. The following topic would refer to \"OVA's / Fillers\", but they do not have the name \"OVA\", but rather as a normal episode. I'm talking about the last episode, which came to be interesting, showing how the sister got that little flower that is in your head, but try to guess again! It was horrible and badly applied, not to mention that other character that appears, whose has 3 (Three) sisters, if I am not mistaken. For what reason did they show it if they had no premiss, to develop it? They only created their existence in this work, to give the \"tickets\" to the lottery. I would rather not have been created if I were to appear in such a work.\\n\r\n   We're nearing the end. Now the last topic. I'm talking about \"Soundtrack\". Well, I say it was not the worst or the best. It was there when it needed to, to make the scenes more interesting. Even so, the soundtrack\u2019s rating weighs because of the flaws in the other categories. So thanks me for giving it a rating 4 (Four).\\n\\n\r\nPORTUGUESE - PORTUGU\u00caS \\n\\n\r\n   J\u00e1 era esperado que pela nota do anime e pelas \u201cReviews\u201d, que sairia da\u00ed uma coisa h\u00f3rrida. Infelizmente, faz parte da vida de um f\u00e3 de anime, julgar tal obra n\u00e3o pela glosa, e sim pelo seu real potencial sem preceitos. O anime falha em praticamente qualquer aba em que considero \u00fatil para a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma obra. A primeira, com toda certeza, \u00e9 o \u201cEnredo\u201d. Eu terminei de ver esse excremento sem entender do que se trata, uma irm\u00e3 se alimentando do irm\u00e3o? A irm\u00e3 que vira monstro e o irm\u00e3o tenta ajudar? Eu n\u00e3o fa\u00e7o ideia do que seja... Aparentemente nem a sinopse do aplicativo na qual eu vi o anime sabia, pois foi dito que o irm\u00e3o tinha como objetivo restaurar sua irm\u00e3 ao normal... Isso foi mostrado na obra? N\u00e3o foi! Agora,  estamos partindo para o \u201cDesenvolvimento de Enredo\u201d, e eu n\u00e3o tenho nada a dizer, foi praticamente a pior coisa que eu j\u00e1 vi desenvolverem na minha vida, n\u00e3o compreendo a exist\u00eancia de tantas falhas e furos do desenvolvimento. Se eu quisesse, j\u00e1 poderia terminar a \u201cReview\u201d, pois \u201cPupa\u201d falhou nos t\u00f3picos mais importantes. Os personagens tinham algo a entregar, mas n\u00e3o entregaram nada, personagens interessantes jogados praticamente no lixo e sem nenhuma fun\u00e7\u00e3o ou desenvolvimento. Isso se aplica at\u00e9 mesmo aos protagonistas, em que foram os mais desenvolvidos, e mesmo sendo os que mais tiveram um progresso, conseguiram ser uma falha, mostrando um passado cheio de furos para \u201cencher lingui\u00e7a\u201d em um anime em que cada epis\u00f3dio tem 4 (Quatro) minutos.\\n\r\n   Conseguimos achar algo n\u00e3o t\u00e3o falho. Estamos falando da \u201cDublagem\u201d. Eu considero o \u00fanico ponto em que realmente conseguiram ser bons, as vozes dos protagonistas e dos figurantes n\u00e3o chegaram a ser fracas, foram normais, mas o que realmente me chamou aten\u00e7\u00e3o foram os gritos desesperadores em cenas de tortura.  Pelo menos nisso, eles foram bem. Me senti numa agonia sem fim ao ouvir (Spoiler) a carne do protagonista sendo rasgado com os dentes de sua \u201cirm\u00e3zinha\u201d, ou at\u00e9 mesmo na cena quando os cientistas arrancavam seus \u00f3rg\u00e3os. (Fim do Spoiler). Outro ponto que foi p\u00e9ssimo, mas n\u00e3o foi o pior \u00e9 o do t\u00f3pico de \u201cOpenings e Endings\u201d. Eu juro que a abertura chega a ser legal, mas ela foi introduzida aleatoriamente quando come\u00e7ava o epis\u00f3dio. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 parece, como deve ser uma m\u00fasica cortada, onde eles pegaram o refr\u00e3o e botaram porcamente. J\u00e1 sua finaliza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma m\u00fasica b\u00e1sica normal que n\u00e3o vi problemas.\\n\r\n   Agora chegamos no t\u00f3pico de \u201cGr\u00e1ficos\u201d, e tente adivinhar qual o resultado? Horr\u00edvel tamb\u00e9m!  Tentaram criar algo um pouco mais \u201cDark\u201d e realmente conseguiram, mas algo um pouco mais sombrio n\u00e3o quer dizer que deva ter uma anima\u00e7\u00e3o cagada e podre como foi o de \u201cPupa\u201d. O anime \u201cSteins Gate\u201d, conseguiu criar um ambiente mais voltado para o \u201cDark\u201d de uma forma espl\u00eandida. Outro que conseguiu tamb\u00e9m tal proeza, foi o novo filme \u201cFate Heaven Feels\u201d. \u00c9 claro que tal obra da \u201cType Moon\u201d,  tem bastante dinheiro para bancar \u00f3timos gr\u00e1ficos e etc, mas o ambiente no anime em si foi voltado para uma esfera sombria. O t\u00f3pico a seguir, seria referente aos \u201cOVA\u2019s/Fillers\u201d, mas n\u00e3o possuem, n\u00e3o ao nome de \u201cOVA\u201d, mas sim como um epis\u00f3dio normal. Estou falando do \u00faltimo epis\u00f3dio, que chegou a ser interessante, mostrando como a irm\u00e3 conseguiu aquela florzinha que fica em sua cabe\u00e7a, mas tentem adivinhar novamente!  Foi horr\u00edvel e mal aplicado, sem contar aquele outro personagem que aparece, que tem 3 (Tr\u00eas) irm\u00e3s, se n\u00e3o me engano. Por qual motivo mostraram ele, se n\u00e3o tinham como premissa, desenvolv\u00ea-lo? Apenas criaram sua exist\u00eancia nessa obra,  para dar os \u201cpapeizinhos\u201d para o sorteio. Eu preferiria nem ter sido criado, se fosse para aparecer numa obra dessas.\\n\r\n   Estamos chegando ao final. Agora, o \u00faltimo t\u00f3pico. Estou falando da \u201cSonoplastia\u201d, no caso, a trilha sonora do anime. Bem, digo que n\u00e3o foi das piores e nem das melhores. Ela esteve l\u00e1 quando precisava, para deixar as cenas mais interessantes. Mesmo assim, a nota da \u201cSonoplastia\u201d pesa por causa das falhas das outras abas. Ent\u00e3o, agrade\u00e7a por eu ter dado uma nota 4 (Quatro).",

            "content": "What can I say that hasn't already been said a thousand times? There's no beating around the bush, Pupa is an awful anime. It even has a reputation of being one of the worst anime of all time, which I agree with. It's so devoid of positive aspects I'm convinced the only reason people were able to finish it at all was the series's short length.\r\nArt: This is one of the better aspects of the show and it's still awful. The character designs are mediocre but the backgrounds look like a watercolor painting by a preschooler. It clashes horribly with the much more neatly animatedcharacters and is a general eyesore. The worst thing about the visuals though is the censorship. People watch trashy horror movies for the ridiculous gore. Removing it takes all the fun out of it. And Pupa is incredibly inconsistent with censorship. A pile of dead bodies is ok but a knife isn't.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say here. Voice acting, ost, and the opening and ending were all mediocre at best but there's not much to complain about either.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Wait, you're telling me this anime had a plot? To me it just looked like a bunch of vaguely connected, disturbing, and nonsensical scenes tied together. There isn't even a real conclusion and viewers are left with far more questions and answers. I dislike endings that don't leave anything at all to the imagination but you have to give the audience something. They watched your show till the end and expect something for it. Trying to comprehend this anime's story is frustrating to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Honestly, the only notable characters are the main brother/sister duo. And they have no personality. None. The brother is the typical \"sweet, protective onii-chan\" and his sister is just the helpless and adorable younger sister. That's all there is to them. I couldn't even tell you their names.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Don't watch this anime. It would only take up about 50 minutes of your time but that time could be spent doing something much better. Like reading a book. Drawing. Watching a superior anime. Masturbating. Just do something else unless you want a perfect example of how not to make an anime. Pupa is a trainwreck from start to finish and is not worth your time.",

Mainly because of the art.\r\nIt's not as bad as people claim it to be. There's a ton of overreacting, as usual. I see absolutely nothing wrong with the art or sound compared to other anime. I personally actually liked both (voices and art) just fine. There's not much of a plot, but other than that I'm not sure why people are hating on it somuch. Probably because it is strange. In a way it kind of reminded me of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul (haven't finished season two because it is terrible in my opinion), which seems to do some much better because...? The epic fight at the end?\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, myanimelist.net wants unreasonably long reviews so I'm going to have to type some more. I definitely feel like this anime had potential to be something better (like Shiki), but just wasn't well planned out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5 (Mediocre)",

Eventually, I became happy about this. I was forcing myself to watch it.\r\nThe anime had me interested once I read the summary. But, I was actually surprised and a bit disappointed when I started the anime. The plot was somewhat confusing and everything just felt like a jumbled mess. Despite that, I was still able to understand a bit. This fact is what saved this anime.\r\nThe art's not bad and neither is the animation. The way thecharacters are suck though. Utsutsu is an ok character. I like how he goes to extreme lengths for his sister. Yume was ruined for me. That one scene when she kept saying \"onii-san... onii-san...\" instantly got on my nerves. At that point, I couldn't even say that I liked her. Nothing in the anime redeemed her. In my opinion, she wasn't even interesting. She can have a few sympathy points because of the situation she's in though...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I hardly remember the other characters. That one woman was somewhat interesting but we didn't get to learn much about her. Also, I wish that we could've learned more about Utsutsu and Yume's parents.

            "content": "Right before I began watching Pupa, my biggest concern was that it wouldn't be very good considering every episode is around 3 minutes worth of content (4 minutes if you include the credits). Strangely enough, it managed to deliver bite sized depictions of the most twisted scenarios you could imagine, strong enough to make me have to drop the show after watching episode 8. It wasn't a scary show per sei, but it was very unsettling, more so than I usually can handle (I'm not exactly a lightweight when it comes to horror, but since the show cuts everything so much to the point, there'svery little time to mentally prepare yourself if you're bingewatching the show).\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the negative reviews here on MAL, I don't think Pupa is a bad show. Yes, there's hints of incest, among other seriously messed up topics. Up until episode 8, you never thought things could get any worse and yet they do, not for the story itself but for the actual topics they address. Of course, one of the biggest downsides is the length of the episodes, despite how well they made use of the time. Nothing ever feels like it flows smoothly, instead it feels like you're getting glimpses into this messed up world Pupa revolves around, which isn't bad, but it doesn't make much for an actual story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think if you enjoy gore and horror you'll probably enjoy watching Pupa. The show isn't for the faint of heart, and even some horror lovers like myself will have to tap out early since this show actually managed to make me want to hurl at some of the scenes, but that only goes to show how much of an impression it will leave on you. So, if this sounds like the kind of thing you'd find interesting, don't get discouraged by the negative reviews. Pupa isn't a perfect show, but it's not the worse thing out there either.",

(4 minutes-opening and ending).\r\nThere's no way you can fit a story, character development and answers to every question in an anime this short, so I'll judge it by what it is instead of what we want.\r\nSo like I said, the story is barely there, no character development and none of the questions get answered. The art isn't bad, I like the opening and the idea is pretty good, it's just lacking depthon pretty much everything.\\n\\n\r\nI have 2 major problems with this anime: \\n\r\n1.The length of the episodes; They should've madefull, 20+ minute episodes or a movie out of it and it would've been better. \\n\r\n2. Censorship; I couldn't find an uncensored version anywhere and they censored the most ridiculous stuff...I wanna see what's going on in any anime I watch!!\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I don't think anime's bad FOR WHAT IT IS. It could've been more if they made longer episodes, or a movie out of it because it's a waste of a good concept.",

The episodes were only 5 Minutes long + OP and ED. So, you couldn't see that much per episode. The episodes also hadn't really a connection to each other, it was like \"new episode, new story, new time\". \r\nThis review contains some spoilers!\r\nWell, this anime is about a girl named Yume Hasegawa, which eats blood and all the other things from humans. She just eats humans. On the other side, there's her brother named Utsutsu Hasegawa. He isn'tlike his sister, but his wounds heal after a very short time, so she eats her brother. Then there are many other people, like a black dressed woman. Then people kidnapped them and hurted her brother. I still don't really understand what all those people wanted from them. I guess the scientist wanted to do some experiments on them. The others wanted to kill them? Well, I watched this anime 2 months ago and I wont watch it again. \\n\r\nThe music was also not so good, but I like the OP of Pupa. \\n\r\nFor the art I give 3 points. It wasn't that bad, I liked the art, but it didn't fit to the anime itself. It was like you were in an museum, looking at several pictures with the same art. \\n\r\nI didn't really liked this anime, even if the story was pretty good. I'll give 2 points for this anime. \\n",

And after biting my lip through such a disastrous show, I understand why. \r\nAlthough you can easily finish this anime in such a short span of time as the episodes are only five minutes long, it doesn't make it less painful. It's like deciding to run a mile on a bed of cacti rather than walk. Yeah, it makes the pain go away faster, but by the end you're still bleeding and crying and cussing up a storm.\r\nAnd while I've never read themanga, I have heard from fans of the manga that it is not as bad as this. It's no \"Cowboy Bebop\" or \"Fullmetal Alchemist\", but it serves a purpose and caters to fans who enjoy horror manga. And hey, at least the manga knew how to go from point A to point B instead of just pooping out scenes willy nilly. So if you are a fan of the manga, I deeply apologize that this is the anime adaptation that you have received. I imagine this is the same disappointment and disgust if a new film adaptation of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" cast Pauly Shore as Atticus Finch.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I detested Pupa, I can't give it a 1. It's still not the worst thing I've ever seen. To a lot of people, yeah, this is probably the worst. But to me, I think there's worse out there. I think it's because I still hold onto hope that maybe someday, a brave soul will scoop the Pupa manga into their arms and give fans the adaptation they deserve. Until that day comes, avoid this like the bubonic plague.",

So I decided to watch all twelvr episodes....and the only thing I was happy about was that I didn't eat anything during the entire time, because I know for a fact I would have puked.\r\nFor one thing, the story is all over the fucking place. Like literally all over the place cause it jumps back and forth and back and forth through random things and barely explains anything if not everything. I justsat in the chair watching on my Ipad constantly trying to figure out what was even going on in this crapfest. Granted it only had 4 to 5 minutes at best for each episode so they couldn't tell a full story, but my god!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters....I just have 4 letters that I could use for them. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK! The characters have zero. I repeat zero character development. If there was some, I definitely didn't see. It wws basically the cliche caring brother whose sister is a demon child and loves eating him while saying \"Oni-chan, Oni-chan, Oni-chan\" Over and over again. I wanted to rip my ears off and wanted to bang my head against a freaking wall after hearing that over and over and over. And her brother just lets her eat him. Oh and I should add he has regenerative powers, so he is a demon child like him to. And their relationship is way beyond the sibling level. There are side characters in it, but who honestly cares about them? Who honestly gives a damn\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation and sound...eh. The art is average at best and the sound...I have heard worst so it is okay for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would not recommend this to anyone. Like I said the episodes were like 4 minutes long at best and they jumbled it up all over the place that it isn't even funny. I haven't read it, but you might as well read the manga since it goes mr in depth on the story and explain things better. Or that's what I heard atleast. But go check it out",

Since having 3-5 minutes to adapt the entire manga is going to turn into an awful adaptation (they should've either go for a movie adaptation or keep insisting on having 12 episodes).\r\nBut even then, having to read the manga to even understand the plot of it doesn't excuse the bad adaptation. Since the adaptation should at least begood on it's own merits and have the same explanation as in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe bare minimum of a plot that i got from this the following: \\n\r\nThe sister becomes infected by the pupa virus, which seems to turn people into monsters due to an infected puppy and some red butterflies, but then it turns out that she was actually a monster from the very beginning, which is a very stupid twist and a serious plothole. Then the brother becomes infected because the sister ate him and for some reason the virus got into him even if the rest of the people who got eaten by her didn't have the virus.\\n\r\nMaybe it was because the scientists tried to help the brother with a drug, but that doesn't give a good explanation of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus in order to protect her sister and because he didn't want her to eat more innocent civilians he becomes food for her.\\n\\n\r\nThen a lot of filler happens (onii-chan no niku or her eating her brother, the worst filler they could've ever put and could've adapted more stuff in it) then another medical corporation kidnaps both of them and they decide to experiment on the brother by removing parts of his body, then he kills them and him and her sister reunite, go back to school and he still let's the sister to eat him instead of finding out the purpose of the virus or if they even care to go back to normal. And instead of ending there they just add another filler episode of him winning a prize.\\n\\n\r\nThat's a very shitty plot if you ask me. And if we add the scenes of cannibalism \"incest\" (which was not pleasant to look at all), the filler episodes and the fact that most of the things aren't explained properly, then we have one of the worst animes of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing I can say about it is that this can serve as an example as to how not to adapt a manga .\ufeff",

Characters and plot points are introduced, then forgotten without explanation. Some people may like that, but i found it disappointing when thingsstart getting interesting and then a plot line is dropped.\\n\\n\r\nIt was touching to see the relationship of the two main character siblings., how they stand up for each other through hardship and trials. Unfortunately, the little sister has not much to say and doesn't seem to think much at all.\\n\r\nI thought it was interesting how by depending on each other, they literally have a symbiotic relationship by the end, by endlessly regenerating his body, he can feed his little sister without her having to kill innocent people!\\n\r\nIt sure gets points for originality.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the art was fairly decent, not QUALITY by any means.",

You also can't figure out what to watch next so you could use a horror \"snack\" of 4 min episodes.\r\n2) You are tickled by the absurdity of some anime. The gratuitous violence and psuedo-sexual brother-sister relationship is hilarious.

            "content": "I've never written a review before but I thought I'd give my input on this anime thus far.\r\nI feel as though this anime has received low ratings because it is not what people had originally expected it to be.  The episodes are very short, about four minutes long.  It's almost as if you're just skipping through a long episode of something to get the gist of it.  Because of this, there isn't much time to develop background details or characters, making the show bland.  I'm sure that if the episodes were as long as a regular anime, this anime would bea lot better.  There is an interesting plot to it, if you're into creepy psychotic things.\\n\\n\r\nIt makes me sad that the art is so bad.  The blood is too fake looking and the backgrounds are pretty terrible at some points.  Though, at other points the art is alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are nice.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is sort of a disappointment, but I can also imagine it to be an awesome anime if the episodes were long enough to put in detail.  To enjoy this anime you need to use your imagination, I suppose.",

            "content": "If you have a strong constitution, please do not shy away from this anime. I find that it is a much under-rated show, and with it only being a total of less than 45 minutes, even if you are a bit weak-stomached you can still make it through. \r\nIt may be that I went into watching this anime with absolutely the worst expectations that I could have, but in the end I really enjoyed watching Pupa. I found the story to be entertaining and captivating, with the art and sound to be a bit more than fair. I would have liked to have seen morecharacter development as we see the reference of where Maria thinks that the children would really like to meet their actual parents. Also would like to see where the story line would have gone with the monster that Maria is breeding. In addition to seeing the story continued, the other aspect that could be improved on would be that the story is a bit discontinuous, but I have seen animes that are much more disjointed.",
