            "content": "TLDR: Skip to final paragraph.\r\nWater\u2019s bottom, many people, drowning, giant cow-tits\u2026transmission died. \r\nClearing out the elephant in the room. Nikola Tesla never had an illegitimate child as he was a virgin who devoted his love towards a peculiar pidgin. What if I told you he did father a child, and this child capable of being a poltergeist, has managed to possess someone all this time. Occultic;Nine is a show that explores the occult and probes into the spirit realm. The series scrutinises paranormal activities and tries to rationalise it in a scientific manner, hence tries to inform us that anything can be disproven my science.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine had one of the worst opening episodes that I\u2019ve experienced in a long time. The pacing was frenetic in the sense that it was uncontrolled and hard to follow. How on earth do you adapt a whole light novel volume into a single episode? The standard is usually 4 episodes per volume but this series is purposely shooting itself in the leg by having the nerve to do this. This series is a combination of the Tatami Galaxy and Durarara at its finest. The lightspeed dialogue combined with a relatively large cast has conceived a child in the form of Occultic;Nine. The child inherited some of the undesirable genes and turned out inferior to its parents. I\u2019ll explain why.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is pretty much focused on the detection of ghosts, material or not. Material ghosts are detectible with the latter being unrecognisable. Gamon Yuuta, our high school NEET runs a blog dedicated on the occult, only to find himself caught up in a crime scene. The murder of professor Hashigami, a leading researcher in the occult field, causes panic for our distressed main character who flees from the scene to avoid getting prosecuted. Good move there as Japan\u2019s judicial system is seriously flawed.\\n\\n\r\nThe murder wasn\u2019t the main incident of the show. An intentional mass suicide of 256 people in Inokashira lake sets the precedent for what entails later. The discovery of the corpses in the morgue reveals a shocking truth. The concept of being alive while looking at your own corpse seems alien to most folk. This sounds contradictory but bear with me as the show does explain the circumstances later down the road. The situation is that some of our main cast are alive without feeling dead, the idea of being conscious after parting with the material body can only be explained through science.\\n\\n\r\nNow talking about the main cast, the series does switch around from person to person giving different perspectives. Our main character Gamon Yuuta is being instructed by a voice from a radio. This reliance on a tool indicates that he can\u2019t get things done properly. I compare it to stabilisers on a bike, which is what this character is going through. He doesn\u2019t have any independence and his actions are limited.\\n\\n\r\nNarusawa Ryouka known as Ryo-tas by Gamon is a person whose physical traits defies the laws of motion. Her breasts are so unsightly, that every time she makes an appearance which is usually accompanied by a silly dance. She is literally known as the big-boobed girl who serves no purpose until later on where her character becomes the focus and not her melons.\\n\\n\r\nHashigami Sarai is the son of the murdered researcher and just like his father exhibits an extreme amount of intelligence which is not normal for his age. The knowledgeable Sarai is able to deduce problems and other riddles in the blink of an eye, which to me is just incredible. Geniuses exist but even then, he struggles on some occasions making it somewhat realistic.\\n\\n\r\nAikawa Miyuu is a high schooler who is extremely skilled in fortune telling. She has built up a reputation due to the fact of making correct predictions. She is a character for the audience to relate to as she doesn\u2019t comprehend scientific jargon just like myself. Her quirk is surprisingly useful when it comes to putting the pieces together. These four characters are the most important to the series with others such as Minase Ria getting their own screen time but aren\u2019t worth talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is produced by A-1 animation, which in recent times has gotten quite some stick for churning out series like the Asterix War. The art style is a breath of fresh air with the character designs being relatively unique. The only downside is Ryo-tas whose has been fetishized with enormous breasts. No fricking way is it breast hypertrophy. The animation as expected from this studio is relatively good with most scenes being aesthetically pleasing and generally fluid. It would be a stain on the studio\u2019s portfolio if it did have poor animation but I\u2019m glad it met my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing and is composed by Yokoyama Masaru (Your Lie in April, Plastic Memories) with it just adding to my immersion to certain scenes. The mix of electronic and contemporary rock music through auto-tuned measures immediately catches my attention by sending a statement. The use of casual jazz music in the downbeat scenes is a good indicator for the tone shifts. Lastly, the music is great at setting up a creepy atmosphere with extensive use of fading in/out and selective piano compositions. The music used generally follows a certain tempo to match the timing of certain segments, this is useful for scene transitioning and makes for some good cinematography. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR-\\n\r\nThe first episodes annoyed me initially but this show manages to redeem itself as it goes on. The mystery regarding the incidents are cleared up in a way you wouldn\u2019t expect. The plot twists cannot be understated with it being interlinked with events. They may not all have a direct relation but by following the lines you gradually see the bigger picture. I would definitely recommend this series for those willing to give it a few episodes. In food terms this is slow cooking, which is higher praised than the generic fast food shit.\\n",

            "content": "\"What is a nightmare? The dictionary tells us it a terrifying dream, a nightmare, nightmare, nightmare...\"\r\nOccultic;Nine is a nightmare.\r\nSteins;Gate is a great anime. It deserves most of the praise it gets, aside from being a tad overrated. In order for me to review the trash that is Occultic;Nine, we need to address Steins;Gate first. Steins;Gate was a series that gave new ideas to the anime world, time travel- something that hadn't been done much. It was popular, and deserved, and still deserves, to be. It launched a multitude of spinoffs set in the same universe, such as Chaos;Head. Chaos;Head may have not been a masterpiece,but it could still hold a candle to SG. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine cannot. Occultic;Nine is something that wants to bank off the success of a series like SG by introducing new ideas. I must admit, the ideas in ON are good ones. I see all the time people defending ON like \"It isn't as bad as people say!\" Yet, it's much, much worse. See, the reason people seem to be defending this (at least from what I've seen) isn't because it's a good show. It's because they enjoy the ; universe and will blindly defend anything from it. Now, I'm not saying I dislike the ; universe- I expressed my opinions on SG and CH. By the way, Robotic;Notes was ok, nothing special. So, let's see why ON is a misrable, mislabeled, shitty shadow of the original Steins;Gate and it's spinoffs.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for ON deserves a 3 at best. ON's most glaring problem is it's pacing. This pacing is pretty much why it flops the most. The show has absolutely no rhyme or reason to it. The first episode was very, very rushed. From what I read it adapted more than 400 pages worth of material in the first episode. I barely knew each character until at least episode 5, and half of them weren't too interesting (but more on that later). \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the scenes in ON seem pointless and come in with more importance towards the later events of the show. The foreshadowing, I feel, was not done well. For example, (spoilers, if you care to watch this trainwreck) The owner of the cafe the main protagonists go to is a huge antagonist- this happens in episode 11, and from what I can tell, it wasn't hinted at more than maybe once. Yeah, they do show a creepy man with a mask chasing around our MC, but in no way could we tell it was the gay bartender. It just threw the series off point, with things that just fade away.\\n\\n\r\nI felt as if I couldn't take the show seriously at points. For example, one of the most important characters (spoiler again) is quite main, but is shown mainly as a comic relief character until around episodes 10-12. She's Tesla's daughter- and, once again, is given no hint towards. Not to mention her character design can barely be taken seriously. Another point, is there's a very important weapon in the show that most of the latter half revolves around. It looks like something from Toy Story. Quite laughable for a 'serious' series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I mentioned sometimes things in this show 'fade away' I meant that some parts of the series ARE pointless. In the third episode there's an incest subplot which I couldn't care less about, since that's why I didn't watch this show. Anyway, turned out the girl's brother was the grim reaper, or devil, or shinigami, or whatever. And... there's really no point to it. It's just- there. I don't feel it advanced the plot at all. There's also an albino kid who kills someone and in the last episode of the series he is forgotten about. As you might be able to tell by now, this show is very, VERY edgy. Just for the sake of it. I almost cut myself watching this show. Rather, this show made me want to slit my wrists.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the last episode, that and the first episode were the worst of all. The last episode was so anticlimactic it made me regret going through 12 weeks of pain watching this show. In the end (spoilers) the girl with basketball tits helps our pathetic  MC out, and he destroys the main antagonist's base with the power of imagination. Yes, you heard me, the power of imagination. I believe Spongebob Squarepants has done an episode like this before.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was nothing horrible, not really much to touch on. I felt a lot of the character designs were bland at best. (Except for that one ridiculous looking girl, I don't even know what was up with that) The settings were also ok, I guess? Not much to put down but not much to praise.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also fairly weak. The intro grated against my ears and I skipped it every single time. The sound effects during the show were dull. When ever they did that retarded \"WOO WEE OOOO\" sound effect you knew something 'spooky' was going to happen. The ending was alright, but forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also ON's weakest point. Most are forgettable or boring. In fact, I don't remember any of the names, and I had to look them up for this review. I confused Gamon and Shun for about 6 episodes. They introduced so many characters at once that I didn't even remember the names until they started killing them. Not like I care to remember them. The characters are all connected though the \"256 incident\" which was a mass suicide. By the time episode 12 was over, I wanted to be the 257th person to kill themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might be able to tell, I did not enjoy Occultic;Nine. It was too fast paced for its own good. Every time someone said a sentence someone else said something, and it gave me a headache. Like, these people, talked at lightning speed, and talked over each other at times. Oh, I am not stupid by any means, but I think this is too much for the average person. Not that thinking is bad, but it takes a while to process what happens after episode. And not in a good way, like SG did. SG made me WANT to watch the next episode, not kill somebody out of frustration.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch Occultic;Nine if you value life.\\n\\n\r\n0.5 of fucking 10.",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD!\r\nWell, well... Here we are at the end of the Fall season; hyped animes, some satisfying, some disappointing ones keep ending one by one. From the creator of Steins;Gate, director of Your Lie in April and well-known studio A-1 Pictures, Occultic;Nine can be placed in all these categories. I am really confused and have really messy opinions about this anime so I hope I can explain them properly.\r\nGenres: Mystery, Sci-Fi, Supernatural, Thriller\r\nPros:\r\n-Unique style of pacing\r\n-Really interesting story\r\n-Mysterious ambience\r\n-Somehow loveable characters\r\n-Music and art\r\n-Good use of science materials\r\nCons:\r\n-Extremely fast talkings and pacing\r\n-Not enough screentime and developments for characters\r\n-Plotholes\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nOccultic Nine's story is like a puzzle. First,you have puzzle pieces and a few places to put them but the rest of it is dark and empty like space. You understand nothing don't know what to do, but when you put one piece to its place, then you achieve to unlock other places. So more you understand something, there comes more to understand.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, first of all the anime introduces (well, not really) us the characters and tons of pointless talkings. And at the end of the episode real story starts off with a crime mystery. First the pacing seems really fast but when you get into the story and get used to the style of anime it feels more acceptable. The actual problem of pacing and talkings are being too fast is not like ''Oh I can't understand anything'', the problem is watchers live too much emotional and situational changes in a very little amount of time. You don't have time to laugh, upset, stress, surprise or even think about anything. But this is why I said ''unique style of pacing''. After sometime you start loving it, how all those things happen in one episode. Until the last 2 episodes, it was okay but I wish it was 3 episodes, not 2. So that we can understand the story better, feel all the emotions and maybe they can cover the plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about plotholes, they're not killing the story. First ''mutual recognition''. I was just thinking about how can it possible that Yuta has the key, they answered it with ''mutual recognition''. It was an impressive and somehow logical answer to me, but when he get back the key and come back after Ryo-tas kissed him, it lost its magic and caused plenty of question marks. It really should have had a better explanation. The second one is Nishizono Ririka. What do we know about her? Almost nothing. How can she know and draw all the things? Why and how did she disappear at the end? These are probably the biggest questions of the story. If it was 3 episodes, maybe they could explain her too.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I want to say about the story, is really impressive. It tries to handle occultic science, supernatural powers (like Myu-pom's vision) and time travelling. It has a mysterious ambience from beginning to the end and did a great job answering the questions (except the ones I told) by using scince. It has cliffhangers, and a really important plot twist that changed the story's course. But if you watch the first episode properly, there's a chance of predict that plottwist (except the one about Ryo-tas)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI am really affected by the art, especially using of light and shadings. It makes you live all that dark, bloody and scary moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks are amazing and thrilling. The opening and ending are awesome, too. (I won't write so much things about art and sound since they're mostly subjective and don't know what to write about them.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so diffrent each other. They're all special, generally energic and intelligent. Anime told us most of their backstories but still characters did not have enough screentime and because of that  their developments are not completed either. Since the pacing is too fast and anime focuses on the story this was a possible situation. Gamotan, Ryo-tas, Myu-pom and Sarai's developments were kinda ok but others (Again, especially Nishizono Ririka) are not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWe can say that most of the people didn't like at least the first episodes of the anime by looking at the score (it fell to even 6.59), but I enjoyed it from beginning to the end. Ryo-tas' breasts are bigger than Everest, they're talking too fast so it's hard to catch, pacing is too fast, characters are a little bit childish, first episode is really messy (even that nothing happened)... These are acceptable reasons why people hated it but still I found it enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSo here is my thoughts about O;N, had a lot of potentials and used most of them. As I said, it would be better if it was longer, even 1 more episode. I hope you liked the anime and my review :)",

            "content": "Light novels have been a popular adaptation these days, there are dozens of anime that have been adapted from this. It has been one of the best solutions to decrease the over-dominance of manga in the past. It's a good strategy, though. But I should say that \"adapting literature into an anime is not an easy work\".  \r\nWhy? Because the director has to adjust a hundred pages of story into a fit 24 minutes per episode in a limited one-cour (or two-cour if they lucky to have that time), with the same feeling & content of the literature itself. Many anime failed to bringthis to the screen.  And what I thought about Occultic; Nine is similar as I stated above. Occultic; Nine has failed to wrap both story and characters in its adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nThe story somewhat brings us into certain cases of death with many supernatural elements haunt them. The story tries to persuade us to see from a different perspective in supernatural things, the 'there is nothing that can't be proved by science' theme is actually a neat theme, in my opinion, it has its own noteworthy in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that disturbs me is the pacing. After 8 years I watch Japanese anime, I've never seen a character talks like it has been fast forwarded 2x by a remote. It is really ruined the entire feels about the anime. I could see that sometimes I must rewind the minute bar in order to understand the story. Another cancer that this anime has is the ineffective information dumping. The story struggles to throw much information to make us more understand. But what we got is an enormous endless wave of information with fast forwarded dialogues and heavy feelings which make the story's full of plot holes. \\n\\n\r\nI could honestly say that the ending is not so good at all. It felt really rushed and poorly wrapped episodes of calamity and ends with an all-happy cliche nonsense ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is in the hand of one of the most prestigious studios in Japan, the A-1 Pictures. Is not that because I hate the story (or the studio), but the art itself failed to bring a meaningful contribution to the anime. It was poorly done, it just like the characters has been blended with the color of the background, like it has the same texture. It is really different from other works that the studio has done in the past, really less-colorable with dark colors has been the dominance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, from what I saw is also has been poorly-handed, especially our main character, Gamon Yuuta. It still follows a 'hero wannabe' stereotype character that hasn't have a single meaningful character development. Other characters are cookie cutter, almost seems to be random & feels a lack of originality. Villains felt one-dimensional, without having a single purpose on their actions. The problem is the anime was too busy to bring us it world building while abandoned the in-depth character development, which makes it more vulnerable. \\n\\n\r\nThe only fairly accepted elements is the sound settings. Both opening & ending are lovely to hear. While I can't say anything except 'disappointed' for the voice actors & their fast forwarded role. I never heard such character talks like that before.\\n\\n\r\nWhile in some minutes, I found out that this anime actually succeed in bringing mystery elements, I felt the mystery thingy in my mind, thirst to make me wanted to know what's comes up next. While in some minutes, I felt the 'rushed' things is also annoying. In the same time,  it makes you want to continue it or dropped it in a weird mixture of feelings.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, watching Occultic; Nine is one of the worst ways to end a year. It is obviously not recommended if you seeks a deep sci-fi/mystery anime. It leads our mind to a desperate situation where you struggle to understand it but the story doesn't give you any chance to understands it, a total wasted potential because of a bad execution. It just another pitiful attempt to adapt a light novel.",

            "content": "As you can probably guess by the semicolon in the title, Occultic;Nine is another entry from the Science Adventure franchise, except this time it's based on a two-volume light novel series written by that other semicolon writer not named Naotaka Hayashi. Not that it really matters too much because the basic plot is pretty much the same as all the other semicolon entries: a bunch of professional adults go apeshit for no reason other than they're bastards and try to take over the world through some specific scientific area that's been weaponized, and end up involving a bunch of eccentric young teenagers or college studentswho just so happen to have an interest in said field, as well as wield the only (nerdy) means that are capable of defeating said organization. And since this is a semicolon anime, that means all the characters are either a NEET or a cosplayer or an idol or some irritating \"man, we sure love anime\" trope that is about as un-relatable and accurate in regards to portraying the human being as Steven Seagal in every single movie he's ever made or been in. Which makes even less sense here because the other entries have been all about technology, so they'd all somewhat fit in Japan's electric town. But Occultic;Nine is more about the supernatural, which isn't an otaku-bait subject at all, so having everyone be a nerd is as jarring as all those fanservice-y characters in those Zero Escape games.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Zero Escape, it seems that the writers of this series are friends with the guys who made the Nonary games, because this show borrows a lot of storytelling devices from stuff like 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward. You've at least heard of those games, right? Those handheld sci-fi mystery visual novels that raise so many questions to the point of frustration, only to info-dump the answers to you at the very end to the point of tedium whilst being obsessed with the number \"nine\"? They're tolerable to get through when you're actually playing them, but outside of the interactive medium, they're a fucking grind - something the writers of this show seemed to miss entirely when they somehow mistook that Punchline anime as VN-to-anime genius.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine also differs from the other SciAdv entries in that it tries to mask the slow-ass pacing that generally happens with light/visual novel adaptations in that it borrows heavily from Ryogho Narita's style of writing, particularly Baccano with the multiple character jumping through different seemingly unconnected phases of the mysterious incident. This may seem like a compliment at first, but I think most of us who didn't have the nails lodged in their brains required to acknowledge Durarara!!x2 as \"not absolutely cancerous\" can see at this point that Baccano's style of storytelling hasn't aged well at all. Because over-the-top characters with no personal flaws, interesting philosophies, or reason to be in the story other than to be cool whilst backed by an energetic presentation trying desperately to cover up for the lack of plot progression is about as entertaining as watching bird competitions where the competitors ate Chinese food during the pre-competition feeding time. And it doesn't help when that presentation is applied to a plot that is about as over-complicated and impenetrable as a steel wall with candy canes of fifty different colors painted all over it.\\n\\n\r\nGetting past the presentation is a tall task in of itself due to how much of a tonally inconsistent joke it is. For one thing, this show has constant hyper-stylization all through its run time that never calms the fuck down - playing ill-fitting music every time a murder happens to the point that it resembles a Green Day soundtrack in an Anne Frank movie. The animation itself is of decent quality when the show bothers to take a break from cutting to a new scene every two seconds, but it's also horribly mismatched. Having the characters make exaggerated faces with the show's sketchy style every time an important dramatic scene occurs to the point that you'd swear everyone in this show was horribly miscast. And they never blend in well with the realistic-looking backgrounds, looking more out of place than an animated character from Coonskin dancing on the set of How I Met Your Mother.\\n\\n\r\nNot helping at all is that Occultic;Nine has what is possibly the worst directing/cinematography in an anime I've ever seen. A majority of the screen time consists of long long LONG scenes of characters sitting/standing around in one place delivering boring exposition that is almost completely unnecessary to understanding what's going on, and often brings up more questions than it does answers. And because the director of this show lost all his talent after making Your Lie in April, he somehow approved the idea of a drunk cameraman doing the shooting for this show, because 90% of the show is shot in an angle. Most of the times, it'll be dutch. Sometimes, it'll be upside down or sideways. There's one time when the camera just spun around for no reason and gave me a headache in the process. This is not how you make dialogue more engaging. You know what you do to make dialogue more engaging? Write some actual good dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the dialogue, in addition to having some of the worst directing in an anime ever, I think Occultic;Nine's writing was the product of some bet with the Kingdom Hearts guys to see who can make their audience slice their ears off or turn off the subtitles the fastest. Not only do these characters not shut the fuck up, but when they're not delivering exposition against dull still backgrounds regarding Nikola Tesla and how the story intends to rape his corpse, they're prolonging scenes with quips consisting of nothing but explaining the logistics of some minor thing or engaging in otaku dialogue in a show that has nothing to do with otaku. There was one exchange in Episode 5 when the character kept saying the word \"pukey\" for like five minutes because they wanted their conversation to be \"cute\" for no reason whatsoever. And even earlier in the episode, one of the main characters info-dumps a lot of signs regarding how Gamon is lying to him from the amount of time his eyes wandered to his facial expressions, even though I don't care how he knows since everything about Gamon's personality should make that obvious. Yes, the dialogue is that bad.\\n\\n\r\nDoesn't help that even by the standards set by the specific visual novel company's previous track record, the nine characters that make up this show are all just completely unlikeable, Rewrite-style. It's like they were written by someone who forgot that the pre-requisite for wanting to see how everything connects together in a mystery show as it goes on is to have individual character stories that can stand on their own do most of the leg work in regards to telling the story. For example, there's this one girl who was so delusional about her brother's death that she ended up living with his corpse for a year until the neighbors realized that onii-chan was starting to smell a bit. You'd think this would give an insight into some serious psychological issues or play a vital role in what exactly the fuck is going on, and you'd be more wrong than a typical 4chan commenter. It's never brought up again, all it did was make the girl creepy without giving me a reason why I'm supposed to care that she's creepy. And just to put the cherry on top, she has no literally no purpose in the main plot at all. I've seen teen stereotypes in 80s slasher films that were more three-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, when compared to the villains of this mess, Jason Vorhees might as well be any of the characters that Gary Oldman played in his career. I know the evil organizations in these series tend to be a load of crap, but I think Occultic;Nine was trying to out shit the Sinister Six with the motivations it gave its antagonists. Without spoiling anything major, the evil SERN replacement that looms over this show's shadow wants to control the rich in order to rule the world for no other reason than because they're nameless bastards. You're probably thinking at this point that this sounds like a shitty comic book plot, and it is; but somehow things get even dumber when it's revealed how they're going to accomplish their master plan. Someone want to explain to me who's providing the funding for these guys and their convoluted plans? Because I think Akihiko Kayaba from Sword Art Online presented a more engaging business plan in regards to his quest to kill off Japan's youth.\\n\\n\r\nOh and for the love of god, ENOUGH WITH THE GODDAMN TIME-TRAVEL/ALTERNATE WORLD SHIT, ALREADY! From Higurashi to Clannad to Madoka Magica to anything written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, I am fucking sick of visual novel companies/writers using it. It was old when those products did it, and as of this point, it's pretty much just a dead corpse kept in cold storage with people fighting over who gets to unfreeze it next. Occultic;Nine doesn't even make good use of it. It's only hinted at through a few characters whose sole purpose are to be McGuffins, and then used as a last-minute deus ex machina for its finale, which is pretty exposition-heavy for an episode that's supposed to conclude things with a bang. But even if the creators had fixed the infamous pacing problems that turned many people away to start with, that still wouldn't have fixed Occultic;Nine's biggest problem: it fucking sucks.\\n\\n\r\nI mean between the numerous plot points borrowed from every visual novel ever, horrible motivations driving the characters forward, and awful humor that couldn't make Barney fans laugh, the shit-ass production of this show just twists the already-deep knife wound so hard the blood fucking explodes. What on earth does this show have to offer anyone? What exactly is it about? When the mystery is over and the answers are revealed, what then? How does this show have anything to do with the occult? You'd think a show called Occultic;Nine would pay more than lip-service to its many practices, but it never does. Instead it does what every awful mystery show does: bait the viewers with questions throughout the entire journey whilst having that bait be the substance rather than everything surrounding it, answer only a few of the questions tediously at the last minute, and have said answers be unsatisfying dogshit.\\n\\n\r\nWell fuck you, Science Adventure guys. And fuck you too, A-1 Pictures. This anime was like a magazine collage that was fed through a shredder and had to be put back together ten minutes before the actual deadline!",

The writer has seriously been thinking about pretty acceptable theories (and using ones that already exist). This makes the paranormal activities in this serie more realistic, just like he did with the time travel theories in Steins;Gate. It is really funny how some small jokes refer to certain moments in Steins;Gate. But don't get me wrong, because this serie on it's self isreally good. \r\nI love the way things are being made mysterious and every strange thing you see has a meaning. Itkeeps your attention and lets you puzzle with the characters.\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nYes, the characters. I must say that the characters are a really important thing but that they are not special. The story behind the characters is good and sow are theiractions, but they are not that special furthermore. I think theyused just some stereotype characters and merged them with the amazing plot, which made it pretty succesfull. The serie contains a lot of characters, but you should bear with it because otherwise it will ruin the story.\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art was done really well and detailed, which is important in these types of series where you need eye for detail. The intro music is pretty good and the other sounds/music in the serie is pretty good too.\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this seriea lot and I hope you too!!! Every week I have been waiting for he episode to come online. If you still have to watch this I recommend you to watch 2 episodes per day, max. 3... to enjoy it the best!!!",

            "content": "I just read something saying that the world from Occultic; Nine is the same world that Steins Gate used as well as Chaos Head.  I haven't watched any of those two, but it's nice to know that a series I love is based in the same world as two other anime on my to watch list.\r\nNow for specifics on Occultic; Nine.  I'd have to say that the story was interesting, although it was  a bit rushed.  The dialog was very fast and you ca tell that the scenes went by quickly.  Even with the fast pacing, I still really likethe idea the show had; having nine people become ghosts and be all specifically linked to a certain blog was quite interesting due to all the weird supernatural phenomenon that occurred.  \\n\\n\r\nI'll admit that characters are really all that developed.  Each of them did fit their role though and everyone of them actually did something to help advance the plot that can only be fulfilled by them; a side character was not randomly chosen to perform a task that a main character could've done.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound weren't the best either, but they did fit well into the show.  I do like the opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Occultic; Nine can seem like a mess, but it was quite enjoyable.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out at first, but I became really interested in seeing how it would unfold by the third week or so. I'd recommend this to sci-fi fans who won't the fact that it will seem rushed.",

            "content": "Intro \r\nEvery year you wound encounter an anime thats a little different to what you would usually find in a given season. In this season this will be occultic nine. Adapted from the light novel series of the same name \r\nSo then lets get started \r\nOccultic Nine has a rather unique story in that it combines the traditional evil organisation/corporation's evil plot with the occultic which in this case deals with the use of spirits. The story combines the elements of these two type of story types with elements of mystery into one storyline that is full of twists and unexpected revelations. Indeed while thestory can be difficult to understand at first and indeed this is one of the complaints that i have seen other viewers have expressed the story does become clearer as anime goes on. The story of occultic nine follows the lives of nine characters that in normal life situations would not have likely have met each other but are drawn together when they discover the evil plot and that they have all been affected by it. One of the things that i like about the story for occultic nine is that it brings people with sometimes differing personalities together and force them to work together to hunt down the truth while at the same time allowing them to expand their knowledge on what they think is real. All in all i thought that the story behind occultic nine while certainly slow to start got better as it went on. \\n\\n\r\nYuta Gamon voiced by veteran voice actor Yuki Kaji of Accel world and Attack on Titan fame who is usually referred to as Gamon in the series is one of the main characters of the series. A high school student like Ryouka and Miyu Gamon is a self described Neet that runs his own blog that centers on the occultic and the paranormal that he calls Kiri Kiri Basara. Gamon has a rather simple outlook and view to his life in that he wants to merely run his blog in peace and live off the money that he runs from that while at the same time looking for interesting strange and paranormal phenomenon. Personality wise Gamon changes quite a bit in the course of the series so much in fact the its almost like he's a different person. In the early parts of the story Gamon is laid back and cowardly and cares little for others and only cares about the blog and himself and at the same time gets scared rather easily when confronted by the unknown. However this changes after he begins to unravel the truth in that he becomes a more determined and serious person that while still getting scared at times has learned to not let that affect him as much. Gamon also become braver and closer to his friends and more than willing to protect them which is a far cry from when his character was first introduced. I thought that Yuki Kaji did a great job portraying Gamon and his character is arguably one of my favorites on this show. \\n\\n\r\nRyouka voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte Fame is one of the main characters of the show. A high school student like Gamon Ryouka is Gamons best friend and indeed only friend at the beginning of the story. Ryouka is a affiliate of the blog that Gamon runs and is one of the reasons why its popular. One of Ryouka's most prominent traits is the size of her breasts which is often used for comical effect within the series. Personality wise Ryouka is a bit of a ditz but nonetheless has a kind and caring personality and it is apparent that she cares about Gamon as a friend. Around halfway through the series Ryouka's personality changes due to to her being possessed by the spirit of the granddaughter of a  well known inventor and real life persona that changes her personality. Here Ryouka/Aveline  is a more serious person and a more driven one that while still caring of Gamon and co is also determined to stop the main enemy plot. This leads to her trying to decide on what actions to take for the endgame which i thought was well done. Ayane Sakura i felt did a great job portraying Ryouka here. \\n\\n\r\nMiyu voiced by veteran seiyuu Hitomi Yoshida of the Digimon adventure tri fame is one of the main characters of the show. A high school student like Gamon and Ryouka Miyu is relatively popular due to her beauty and personality and is also a well known fortune teller that makes use of tarot cards to divine fortune and as a result she has a rather large fan club following her despite only being a first year. Personality wise Miyu is a kind and caring person that cares about her friends but at the same time is fearful of the occult and things that she doesn't understand. Miyu's friendship with her best friend Chizu who she calls Chi chan forms one of the foundations of her personality and also forms one of the sub arcs of the main story. When Chi vanished without a trace Miyu's personality changes and she becomes more withdrawn and depressed which is different to her usual positive self and at the same time she becomes obsessed to discover what happened to Chi. Though the arc ended with a sad fate for Chi Miyu at least found out what had happened and from that become a stronger person that become braver and at the same time caring towards her friends. \\n\\n\r\nSarai voiced by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa is one of the main characters of the show. A university student unlike Gamon Sarai is also a realist that believes only in the facts that he sees in front of him and as such being confronted with the paranormal which itself is difficult to prove as there is no proven facts about it proves challenging for him to understand. Sarai is the son of Professor Hashigami a renowned and respected professor that was well respected within his field and is indeed a character central to the overall plot of the series. Sarai is a serious, intelligent and clear headed person and indeed among the cast along with Touko is the main brains within the cast. Sarai's relationship with his father is one of the main points of his character and seeing him try and understand the reason why his father decided to look into Paranormal and how he was connected with the main plot was actually quite hearwarming to see especially when it become apparent that his father was trying to stop the same plot that Sarai and co was. Another aspect of Sarai that was interesting was his relationship with Gamon. As a realist Sarai did not agree with Gamon on a lot of things including Paranormal and as such they are often at each others throats due to their differing viewpoints and beliefs. However as the series progresses and Gamon and Co discover more paranormal Sarai is forced to admit that even in life there are things that define common sense and ultimately results in Sarai actually calling Gamon his friend that opened his eyes. \\n\\n\r\nTouko played by veteran seiyuu Shizuka Itou is one of the main characters of the show. A veteran reporter for a famed occultic magazine Touko is a highly motivated person that does her best to determine the truth behind the paranormal that she discovers. Like Sarai Touko is a bit of a realist but she is more willing to believe in something that can't be proven by facts if the theory behind them is sound. Being a reporter Touko crosses paths with many of the main cast before she too is dragged into the plot by the machinations of the villain. Personality wise Touko is a determined, efficient and focused person that is serious about her job and at the same time is also a smart and freethinking person that is not afraid of thinking outside of the box. Despite her rather serious nature Touko does care about her subjects and friends which is best seen in her interactions with Miyu in the aftermath of Chi's disappearance. In the cause of the series Touko develops a catchphrase of sorts in which she mutters the words Ascension whenever she discovers something and when something becomes clear in her mind. This i found to be quite amusing. In the course of the series Touko develops a good working relationship with Sarai as they are often out together looking for clues and at the same time she also makes friends with Miyu which i found to be nice. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna voiced by veteran seiyuu Satomi Akesaka of Gate fame is a support character of the series. A special agent of the FBI despite being a high school girl Asuna shows up near the halfway point of the anime having been sent to replace her sempai Morisaki who had vanished during the course of his investigation. As expected of a detective Asuna is a perceptive, inquisitive and intelligent person thats also logical and dutiful. Asuna both respects and admires Morisaki a great deal and her reasons for investigating the case is as much as in finding out what had killed him as it is in finding out exactly what is going on. Not merely being content with examining evidence at the station Asuna also goes into the field quite often and as such crosses paths with the main cast when she encounters Gamon. Despite being confronted with a case that deals that the paranormal that is well outside of her expertise Asuna was able to determine the various connections that linked the various cases together something that local police had trouble in doing which ultimately led her to assisting the main cast in stopping the evil plot. Apart from having great deduction and investigation skills Asuna also has some sort of power in that she is able to see the last few moments of someones life as a movie. This i found to be quite interesting and actually made her character stand out more.\\n\\n\r\nAria voiced by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of Sword art online and High school of the dead fame is a main character of the series. A teenager that practices the art of Black magic in which she can place curses on someone by using a piece of their hair. Before becoming her current self Aria whose real name is Rin Minase was a somewhat rich girl who lived with her brother Takaharu in a large house within the city. As a result Aria had a rather close relationship with her brother that many mistake as incest but this is far from the truth as Aria saw him as parent figure that was the only person that cared for her. The shock of brothers death that resulted from a botched operation was the result of a kidney transplant ultimately drove Aria over the edge where she become Aria who is able to speak to the devil. Like Ririka Aria does factor in the main plot but only provides advice to the main cast indirectly. \\n\\n\r\nRirika voiced by veteran seiyuu Mamiko Noto of  the Persona 3 movies is a renowned Dojin manga artist that seems to have the ability to predict the future. Her manga's serve as a central plot element within the show. Ririka is familiar with Professor Hashigami's work and is also familiar with Sarai as they both go to the same university. A mysterious, intelligent and mature person Ririka is an interesting character in that while she certainly knows more about the events that are going on she doesn't do anything to either help or hinder the villains and indeed seems content to wait and see what happens instead. Indeed Ririka like Aria only provides indirect advice to the main cast. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nI felt that the character designs for the main characters was well done and detailed and that the environments were well designed and executed. Animation i felt was well done especially with all the occultic scenes. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nThe music for the series i felt was nicely done and i liked both the ending and opening themes that i felt set the mood for the series. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\r\nVoice acting in general i felt was good with Ayane Sakura, Yuki Kaji and Hitomi Yoshida deserving praise as i felt that they managed to portray their characters pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nOccultic nine i felt was an interesting series as it combined the traditional evil corporation troupe with the paranormal and though it wasn't perfect by any means i quite enjoyed the story that i found to be both interesting and at the same time kinda disturbing. Animation and art i felt was reasonably good as was the music and voice acting. With regards to the characters however i felt that not all the characters were given enough character development. Certainly the main investigation team of Gamon, Sarai, Miyu and Ryouka were given great character development but the characters of Aria and Ririka both of which were voiced by veterans were not and apart from having a good backstory which even Ririka lacked they were not featured in the main plot that often. I felt that the story could have been expanded to include them in and give them a bigger role than what they had in the current story.\\n\\n\r\n Apart from that however i quite enjoyed the story of occultic nine which mixed the evil corp troupe with the paranormal. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Occultic;Nine is the newest entry in the semicolon universe among other titles such as the beloved Steins;Gate, the not-so-beloved Chaos;Head, and the no-one\u2019s-quite-sure-how-to-feel-about-it Robotics;Notes. For most people browsing sites like anichart and putting upcoming seasonal titles into their proverbial shopping cart, any show that has a semicolon in its name immediately gets thrown in the basket thanks to its storied legacy. As of late however, it\u2019s easy to lose faith since the majority of the semicolon titles have come with mixed reception. Fall 2016 has rolled around, and the first semicolon entry since 2012 unveiled itself as Occultic;Nine. 2016 was, in many people\u2019s eyes, anoverall weak year for non-sequel anime, so many saw Occultic;Nine as the last bastion of defense of 2016 before going into the new year. In many minds, this begged a controversial question filled with a lot of expectation and (in some cases, hesitant) excitement: would Occultic;Nine be a Steins;Gate or another Chaos;Head?\\n\\n\r\nAs the final minutes of the 12 episode long series come to a close, I unfortunately have to conclude that Occultic;Nine falls under the latter category. While it has its fair share of interesting and cool moments, the majority of the show is marred and sabotaged by its overall abhorrent pacing and sloppy execution.\\n\\n\r\nUpon watching Occultic;Nine for the first time, the most immediate aspect of the show you might notice is the blindingly fast dialogue. In moderation, this style of narrative isn\u2019t automatically terrible; it can be considered a stylistic choice to help support the atmosphere of the show. Unfortunately, the dialogue speed feels less like a stylistic choice and more of way of squeezing as much content as possible within a given time frame, and it remains consistent in all 12 episodes of the show. The result is a sloppy, exhausting mess that drags down nearly every other element of the anime, including character development, setting, and plot progression. But it\u2019s not simply the dialogue speed that\u2019s the problem; it\u2019s the little breathing room in between each line in the next, and this dramatically affects the immersion and effectiveness of the show. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are talking about what they ate that morning or revealing important plot elements to the viewers, each line of dialogue falls directly over the next and this continues until each episode concludes. The viewer is given almost zero time to absorb any information at all and it becomes difficult to distinguish what is fluff and what is important. Because the dialogue moves at such unrealistic speeds, the scenes and characters seem more unnatural, almost as if they\u2019re reading lines from a script. Any build-up effectively gets ruined, and any investment diminishes even at reveals or character development. In addition, quick dialogue is often times a specific character quirk meant to tell us about a character\u2019s personality. In Occultic;Nine, everyone shares this unnatural quality which greatly homogenizes the already bland cast.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just the dialogue that moves unnaturally either. The plot jerks around at different speeds, often spending either way too much time in extraneous details or suddenly advancing the plot with no warning at all. While the first episode pushed the plot forward a little by unveiling a murder scene in the final moments, not much actually occurred in the show until around episode 6; until then, the show was mostly exposition. Aria is one such example; her exposition occupied an entire episode, yet she remained relatively uninvolved with the story even at the end of the 12 episodes. Now it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing to give more exposition to side characters, but it is when it comes at the expense of the main plot. In the latter half of Occultic;Nine, scenes would sometimes jerk from one to another, and often times I would bear witness to a scene where I had no idea what was going on. The most noticeable moment of this to me was when a scene shifted from our cast of main characters to suddenly the board meeting of villains (unveiled for the first time) with zero transition or exposition. It\u2019s disorientating for no reason and made the show not only feel rushed but also unnecessarily confusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story on average isn\u2019t well-polished either. While there\u2019s grounds for a relatively interesting and creative plot, it\u2019s watered down by the amount of telling over showing. Occultic;Nine at its base is supposed to a thriller, and most tend to stay more dynamic in order to keep the viewer invested. Occultic;Nine rarely does that, and most of the plot isn\u2019t explained through action but through dialogue (and like I said earlier, the style of dialogue is horrendous). As another friend of mine put it, \u201cthe show is all exposition,\u201d or in other words, rather than letting the plot itself do the talking, it\u2019s often the characters that have to explain the plot and pseudo-science toward us, which 80% of the time is mostly just unnecessary filler to justify the hazy connection between hard science and spiritual superstition. To elaborate on this further, the reason why I say that that the explanations are usually unnecessary justifications is because despite how fervently the anime might try to insist scientific jargon, a lot of the time it invalidates itself, often through the use of deus ex machina plot devices (one such example is Gamon magically sprouting wings under the validation that he is in fact a ghost, the possibility conveniently unveiled to him only at the final episode of the show). Finally, as you might expect from the dialogue, the show ends blindingly fast, riddled with more loopholes than a Starbucks Wi-Fi network. What happened to Ririka? Who is the mastermind that orchestrated this phenomenon? What on earth happened to the other 250 victims? Many large questions are still left unanswered if not straight up forgotten, which is incredibly frustrating and borderline unforgivable for a narrative that claims to be a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, in my opinion, are painfully bland as well. Both Touko and Sarai are incredibly dull characters that fulfill the same role, that being the smart and composed type. Ryo-tas served mostly as a nonsensical background distraction (which was occasionally charming but overall dismissible) who eventually turned into an equally nonsensical character (Tesla\u2019s daughter) with no unique personality with her appearance having about as much effect as a shallow plot device. Miyuu is an overall boring personality with no qualities that make her stand out from the rest of the cast. And Shun is an incredibly boring character who seemingly knows pretty much everything for no reason, often deflating otherwise interesting conflicts with randomly obtained knowledge. Gamon is actually not a bad main character since he serves as an everyman in this cast of characters and bizarre setting. Ultimately however, he\u2019s shoved with conveniently tied character traits that make him artificially special instead of naturally developing his own character to connect with the viewers as an everyman type should. The antagonists in Occultic;Nine are also insultingly boring. They have zero connection to any characters of the plot and as a result only fulfill the role as a vague, stereotypical organization that the main characters are tasked to defeat. The aspirations are as usual the most boring possible, which is to expand their businesses and create profit. Their designs are laughably typical, simply looking like corporate CEOs and businessmen. Most other solid thriller shows have interesting villains, whether it\u2019s something as simple as being visually striking or psychologically threatening or slightly more complex as being relatable and empathetic or sometimes a little mix of both. Occultic;Nine\u2019s villains are none of this, and it makes the story much harder to be invested in.\\n\\n\r\nTo give credit where credit is due, I do think Occultic;Nine did a few things right. The show on average was consistently well-animated, and the majority of the character designs and settings are aesthetically pleasing and occasionally unique (save for Ryoka\u2019s unrelenting force that is her stupidly massive chest). There are even a number of well-executed shots throughout the entire anime. In particular, the scene where Gamon stares over his lifeless body was particularly brilliant and awesome. And the overall set-up for the plot isn\u2019t necessarily bad. As much as I\u2019ve harped on it, combining hard science fiction with the supernatural has the potential to be interesting due to how contrarian they are, and the duality of characters being both dead and alive in a single show hasn\u2019t been explored as deeply in narratives as it can be. It\u2019s not necessarily that the plot is bad, it\u2019s more that it was executed poorly.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sure most of us that were hoping for another installment of the semicolon series were looking for another Steins;Gate since a lot of us want to relive those thrilling 24 episodes that we experienced way back in 2011 over again. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine is anything but that, delivering a sloppy and mediocre experience for those that have stayed dedicated to the series. With Chaos;Head and debatably Robotics;Notes, Occultic;Nine is a third strike, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who will dismiss the next semicolon anime when browsing for things to watch in future seasons.",

            "content": "\"Let me be a hero!\" - Gamon (Episode 12)\r\nThis is one of those anime where there are going to be alot of haters and alot of praisers I think. There are going to be people that will say... \"This anime is too confusing, I have no idea what is happening, my brain is killing me.\" and people who are like... \"This anime is so smart with it's story, it totally makes sense... omg, give me more plz!\" To me, this anime does start out very very confusing, then I was like... DAMN!!! Let's get to the pros and cons of things.\r\n*\r\n*\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nCons:\r\nOh What aRush! - Ok, the main problem is in it's first 3 episodes in this anime and it's how rushed and fast everything is going. It was very hard to tell what was happening because 1... The dialogue was going so fast that I had to pause alot of times, take a breather, and read the subtitles again. 2... It felt more rushed then Sword Art Online, I couldn't tell at all what this anime was even about in it's first 3 episodes. At least in SAO, the rushed mess that that anime is, you would already know what it's about...  but  in this anime, you'll have a hard time understanding anything. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nWow!... What a Twist! - This anime started to become slower at episode 5. At episode 4, I knew, I finally get to know what it's about, and things start to make sense to me. Even the dialogue was a bit slower actually. Some will say it's still fast but I noticed a change of pace in the dialogue... That's probably just me idk. Anyway, the story was no longer too complicated to me, and when things started to pick up and become interesting, I was enjoying watching these later episodes. This story has alot of neat surprises that are dark and intriguing. You get to know why and how this mass suicide happened. I love these types of stories so much, it does remind me of Steins;Gate a little. It's also fun to make your own theories for later episodes. The last episode was actually just good, it wasn't anything too spectacular until the last couple scenes.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n*Can you repeat that again please? - The character, they talk too fast for me, especially in the early episodes, they were talking like freaks. A lot of times the characters would talk over other characters. Where I have to pay attention to what both of them are saying. Again though, to me, they're talking has slowed down a bit in the later episodes but still though. \\n\\n\r\n*Big Melons - So there is this one main female character whos, and you probably already know about this... It's that girl Ryouka. Her tits are just too big, like idk how she is even standing, dancing, and running around. They're bigger than the girls breasts from Highschool of the Dead I believe, and it's just too much. It's pretty unnecessary, It's very distracting.... Like i know there is alot of fan service in alot of different anime, even anime that aren't ecchi anime, but this is seriously dumb.\\n\\n\r\n*Annoying - Sometimes, Gamon can be pretty dumb and annoying. In the very first episode, he picks up a knife that has blood all over it, and he acts like he doesnt notices it. He finds it, starts playing with it, then finds a dead body 10 seconds later, then finally realizes he's got blood all over the palm of his hand. Also, this dudes panics are so annoying sometimes, that's when he never stops talking and slows down. Like, yeah I would be spooked if I was in his situations too, but still, this guy needs a fucking chill pill. He's also the least interesting character in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n*Personality - Yeah, alot of these characters are pretty damn interesting though, even Ryouka, you might think she's just there for laughs and giggles but no, she adds alot to the story in this anime. And that surprised me, when she showed her true self to Gamon, that blew my fucking mind. Also, the detective dude, Shun, has such a funny personality, I like how he gets into everyones  business, sometimes making jokes at them, annoying them, scaring them, and sometimes just having a normal conversation. He's such a funny dude, he's me laugh quite a bit here. Other characters I find interesting is Aria, who talks to that ghost looking dude, she's pretty cool. Also Touko is a very good character, I like how serious she can be, and she's always seems to make really good choices too. \\n\\n\r\n*Development - Most of these characters had some pretty decent development here. Like Aria, we get to see alot of her past with her and her brother. And we get to see why she is who she is now. We get to learn Sarai's past a bit, with him and his father. Ryouko actually had some major development, in the later episodes. And it was all surprising to me, something that happened to her that I never saw coming. Miyuu gets some development as when she loses he friend. And also the gay bartender gets some good development, we learn alot about him in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPros :\\n\r\nI gotta say, I was a huge fan of the art and animation of this series. IT had it's own unique style and it's a style I really like. I also love the character designs. Most of them, because...well... ya know lol... All of the character designs were pretty unique as well. I haven't notices any derps on the characters faces either. The artist really paid close attention to detail, even on the things you won't notice in a scene, and I'm a big fan of that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPros: The Op and Ed was nothing too special, it was just... good. I wasn't loving it, I wasn't hating it... I just kinda like it. The OST was pretty good. Had some pretty spooky sounds in scenes where things were getting... ya know, pretty spooky, and those sounds were nice to my ears actually, I liked those sounds lol. And sounds that were not so spooky were ok as well. No big complaints here. It was all just slightly above average. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI gotta say though, despite the complaints I had with this series, I enjoyed this anime a ton. I loved the twists, I loved the nasty reveals of the characters, I love the development of the characters, and I love the interesting story. Story is only a 7 becasue of it's major issue in the first few episodes, I can't give it any higher than that even though I loved it, because of the huge rush. But yeah, I definitely enjoyed this anime, again it's not for everyone, some people aren't going to get it, and will probably drop it before things get intense... but it's whatever.\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving this anime a strong 8 to a light 9. Thanks for reading this, have a good one guys :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What does the latest offspring of the Semi;Colon family bring? The most contentious aspect of O;N is its nonlinear narrative. The premise is interesting. O;N takes place in Japan, where nine individuals are linked through strange happenings and phenomenons. Through exploration and newly acquired knowledge, the horrifying facts begin to be disclosed. After the immense information dump of its introductory episode, the show toned down and plateaued into something more understandable, but the pacing still needs work. Pacing is another glaring attribute. If a show is only getting 12 episodes there is the tough decision on how much it needs to cover. The way O;Npresents its exposition, characters, and story can hardly be described as gutsy or unique. These two factors can make or break a show, depending on how it affects the previously mentioned categories.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here\u2019s how issues stem from its pacing and storytelling and how it impacts the characters. O;N\u2019s narrative is disjointed, constantly switching between plot lines and characters. The plot is bestrewed among a flock of characters whose introductions are hastily presented. None of them are given enough time to be fully realized. With a large cast and an eerie story about strange things happening in a busy city, it feels incoherent and convoluted, rather than complex and compelling. Even with the later episodes, there\u2019s not enough flavor from these characters. The characters suffer because of the constraint of telling a big story in 12 episodes. Every character's perspective is needed to learn about their relevance to the plot and because of constant switching between characters, characters do not feel as fleshed out as they should be. Sure we learn more about someone\u2019s backstory or personal feelings, but the show moves so fast that we are never given anytime to explore them. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the explanations behind the incidents may sound scientific and impressive, but they are ultimately nonsensical statements. For some people, they would just take the clarification as is and not think too much about it. The show definitely wants you to, with the evidently complex techno babble, but the conclusions are straightforward and simple. I don\u2019t expect a show to have a scientific explanation for everything. I don\u2019t expect a pseudo-sci-fi anime to make things understandable and be scientifically accurate, but I still question O;N\u2019s continued insistence on providing prolonged pseudo-scientific explanations. It\u2019s perfectly fine if it scientifically accurate, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves, characters repeating dialogue about \u201cscandium\u201d is utterly pointless and time-wasting. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the prolonged dialogue scenes, the cinematography is awful. In fact, it\u2019s the worst cinematography in a show I've ever seen. Scenes are shot at incredibly unnecessary angles. Sometimes, it would be at a long shot, at a random angle, upside down, or even sideways. In episode 6, the camera spun around for no reason as two characters talk. It wasn\u2019t like it was intentionally done to reveal something either. The director must have thought: How can I make these scenes more interesting? I KNOW, let\u2019s just have the angles, transitions, and cuts be as random as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and aesthetic is much more serviceable than the jarring characters and story. The animation remains consistent. Character designs are all peculiar in a good way. It has its own trademark style that makes it distinctive from others. (I personally don\u2019t like the way their noses look.) It captures a silly, yet brooding atmosphere The colors are vibrant. I would've never guessed this was animated by A-1 pictures. Not much can be said about the sound. Its music is hardly noticeable and it neither adds nor detracts from the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you were turned off by the first episode, chances are you\u2019ll like the later episodes a lot more. If O;N had 20+ episodes, it could have benefited from having more episodes. Characters could\u2019ve been given more time to develop. (A good example would be the albino kid). Fast pacing, exposition dumps, and pointless dawdling ruined it for me. Perhaps the light novels would be better to read, but with rumors of it being cancelled, O;N may never see the light of day.",

            "content": "Occultic;Nine might as well be LA's most indecisive anime for Fall 2016 and with good reason...LA had no idea what was going on...no actually that's not quite right, LA \"struggled\" to fit the pieces together. Mind you, it took LA 10 episodes before LA FINALLY knew where Occultic;Nine would be good or bad and when the plot fragments finally blended together into a cohesive narrative.\r\nFor what Occultic;Nine has for \"science\" as this is a part of the ; Science Adventure visual novel series, what the science themes are \"Nikola Tesla's experiments\", nonetheless what it also has are Japanese horror stories, fortune telling, precog, a clandestineorganization, seeing the \"devil\", detective work through pschyometry, mass suicides...you can already tell what the problem is right?...THERE'S JUST TOO MANY IDEAS all jumbled up with one another. At least Chaos;Head had one theme, about delusions, Steins;Gate had time travel, Robotics;Notes had robots. Occultic;Nine feels like it wanted EVERYTHING to do with occult and nothing about it at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine's characters are at best have inconsistent character development for when the plot demands it, such as Yuuta Gamon voiced by Yuki Kaji an occultic blogger, Ryouka Narusawa voiced by Ayane Sakura his assistant, Touko Sumikaze, a journalist to an occult magazine and Ririka Nishizono voiced by Mamiko Noto a doujinshi author that makes future predictions. Occultic;Nine however isn't exactly character-focused as the major plotlines and the occult drives these character forward into finding out just what the hell is going on. The only other character that actually seemed to get proper character development were Aria and Kiryuu Kurenanino voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro and Kishou Taniyama respectively as well as  Miyuu Aikawa voiced by Hitomi Yoshida a clairvoyant and in finding her friend Chizu Kawabata voiced by Maria Naganawa, but once their development comes to pass, Aria and Miyuu gets hardly gets mentioned again and Miyuu's arc blends in with the the main gang afterwards. Shun Moritsuka voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara and Asuna Kisaki voiced by Satomi Akesaka, both detectives, along with Sarai Hashigami voiced by Kaito Ishikawa a son of a scientist and Touko Sumikaze really relays crucial information to the main gang as their function. Again the plot moves the characters forward, not the other way round (though ONE character becomes the exception later on). LA's favourite character would just go to Touko Sumikaze voiced by Shizuka Ito only because she seemed one of the more level-headed characters and probably remembered her for her catchphrase \"Ascension!\", second would easily go to Ryouka Narusawa, NO not because of her *ahem* \"defining feature\", but for voice actor Ayane Sakura and later events that focus on her and the impact she has to the plot in greater detail.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so Occultic;Nine pacing is at best what would happen if you merged SHAFTian animation with Durarara!!'s plot pacing with how it to tie all the characters together, at times Occultic;Nine will throw us a bone with expositional episodes, the problem is your suspense of disbelief if you can actually handle this. LA kinda did through trying to tie all the plot lines together and how it concerns the characters involved, but some of plot twists are hard to grasp or believe, the main one for LA being the clandestine organization and their plan which both becomes cliche and confusing. But for such a fast paced anime for fast speaking expositional characters, LA can see WHY it was soo fast paced at the very least, there were LOTS of material for the audience to grasp onto and see how the \"fragments\" would fit in through it, if it didn't, the 12 episode runtime wouldn't just be enough. Sure the fragmented nature of the anime makes it even worse and extremely confusing what's going on, but once the plot twists resolves and blends how the plot is \"back on track\", makes the fast pacing more or less compensation for that.\\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of plot twists, the plot twists felt like it had an impact on the viewer, not so much the characters themselves (Yuuta and Miyuu excluded), as once they realize the plot twists themselves, it just like a normal thing to them and they don't budge or react as much kinda dampening the effect of revealing the plot twist when the character reactions are just like \"meh\". The only leeway LA can guess is that the main cast has dabbled in the occultic thus it IS just a normal thing to them, but then the characters who are more level-headed grounded characters didn't freak out during their revelations, instead the character who are more crazy does. GAAAA...either way something LA had taken notice to.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by A1-Pictures, again it felt like SHAFTian animation but with differing character designs across the board along with differing styles to match it at the same time, the animation wasn't annoying for the most part as it did bring in the cohesiveness of what was going on and really reigned in the occultic atmosphere it needed with it's grunge black colorings and bolded and light-toned character designs to make things even more crazy to say the least. If anything the animation was pretty decent overall and it's fast pacing added to the animation frantic stylings too, the animation by A1-Pictures was very good all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting really needed to be in game and it's one of the better aspects LA saw in Occultic;Nine, reason being because of all the expositional info dumping through ALL characters, the entire cast essentially speedread their lines along with their emotional impact to boot, this voice cast DID AMAZING because of it. If LA would hone in on one voice actor, it would go to Ayane Sakura, let's just say SHE HAD RANGE and still kept the frantic pacing of the anime pretty much for LA, LA's favourite voice actor in Occultic;Nine. But overall, excellent voice casting to fit it's style it needed to bring out.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending really did feel like it reigned in it's themes (after LA tried to analyze the ending for 20 minutes after the final episode anyways) though it finally narrowed down all the themes it had down into one BIG goal that Yuuta and Ryouka had to pull off, but this BIG GOAL was what reigned in the cohesive narrative together albeit a few loose ends never told to us by the end of it and left in a both good climax but anti-climax afterwards due to how it \"just ended\" with no proper epilogue to see what the hell happened to the rest of the characters be it minor or not. It was a climax because of all the attention to the BIG goal and how to get there and let it be accomplished, the anti-climax happened straight after the conclusion of the BIG goal. LA didn't know how to feel about it....satisfied?...but wanted more?...is probably the best way to say it.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine, is most definitely an anime you NEED to watch more than 4 episodes before casting your vote in as to what you think about it, all due it's fragmented storytelling along with it's many many MANY plot twists that goes along with it makes it a rather hard anime to pin down whether it was good or not. Hell as LA said it took LA 10 out of the 12 episodes before LA could tell and from LA's perspective, Occultic;Nine is a decent anime overall for LA, having the plot twists handy to get you re-invested towards what the hell is going on and thinking about the suspension of disbelief \"theories\" and either accepting it or not and sure many people might get heavily disappointed or annoyed by it's frantic pacing, lacking character development and the more obvious response of \"what the f- is going on?\", but seriously, LA will say this, if your gonna watch Occultic;Nine, it's definitely one of those animes that you need to keep your investments in check as the reward in staying and not passing judgement to an anime soo quickly, might bring great satisfying rewards later on and that was what LA got, not so much from the ending as it still left questions after it's resolution but the rest of them makes for an interesting anime nonetheless. Not the best from the Science Adventure series LA has seen, but an interesting confusingly fragmented as all hell narrative with a crazy cast of character in an even crazier \"take it or leave it\" suspension of disbelief and some decent production values to go along with it.",

            "content": "Honestly, for all the people saying this show is a nightmare, you're clearly wrong. It isn't a nightmare. Unless you can't read fast enough. In that case, \r\ndon't watch this show and watch something else.\r\nOkay, if you cannot catch onto details quickly, this show will SHOVE ITS ASS UP YOUR FACE. If you don't want to be extremely confused, watch it with a friend or don't watch it at all(or go on reddit).\r\nThe show has some problems with pacing. It's paced quickly, which is a problem to some people. However, the pacing eventually slows down so that you can actually pay attention.\r\n(By the way, forthat one reviewer that says that \"the first episode adapted 200 pages, so it's terrible, you're dearly wrong. First of all, the first light novel did NOTHING except establish characters.Who wants 2 episodes of NOTHING? Plus, the first episode skipped some material. STOP LISTENING TO WHAT OTHERS THINK AND READ THE LN.)\\n\\n\r\nOk, let's begin the review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story was great. It had a lot of potential. The pacing ruined it a bit, but it still was a great story. The characters interacted a lot. The events of the story make sense and the twists are completely random. If you love a good mystery anime, watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and character designs in this anime are wonderful. The character designs by Pako are unique, stylish and represent the characters of the show. The animation is fluid and aims to get your attention. Its unique shots make you either get grossed out or you get a earful of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nOk, the main complaint of the art that people have is that Ryo-tas has GIANT BOOBS. Okay, no. First of all, the light novel did this, so don't blame the anime. Second, what is wrong with having big boobs. You people make it seem terrible to have big breasts. Just stop.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the art is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great. They add music to dialouge and that makes those long talking scenes more interesting. The music is creepy, mysterious and really sets the mood. However, sometimes they use the same soundtrack over and over again, so that's why it's a 9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nOk, this is the low-point of the series. The characters are not well-developed, except for the main protag and his sidekick, Ryo-tas. If they integrated the character's backstory into the anime then it would be much better. Don't expect any \"great\" characters in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nThis series was very enjoyable. It was fun to make theories and see if they were true or not. I loved making theories and testing them out. The pacing was bad, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis show was good. It had pacing issues, but if you can handle that, it's a show to watch.",

            "content": "Occultic Nine is another dark anime involving mind bending story and so to say, mind bending timeline. You need to pay really big attention with the timeline, especially when the DATE appearing on the screen (3rd of March is the main date where everything is start happening).\r\nOk, back again to the topic. Honestly, the concept of the story is really great, mystery keep happening the entire series and I always have this feeling of want to know what gonna happen on the next episode with STRONG curiosity.\r\nThe only hard time I have finishing the series is catching up with the SCREENWRITING. Yes, the screenwriting...if youdon't know what is screenwriting, in short it is the dialogue. I am not a native Japanese and I DON'T like watching dubbed anime so I have quite hard time following the barrage of the subtitle while trying to catch up with what's exactly going on. It seems like the series cramped screenwriting of 24 Episode series into 12 Episodes series. EVERYBODY talk WAAYYYYY too fast and I feel like watching the anime on a rollercoaster. Seriously...it's a high speed train, the paces can feel like out of hand, some episode was feels really fast that I don't even feel ...\"What? Did I just finish a 20 Min worth of Episode...what?\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first time I met this kind of story so I could say that it's kinda original and fresh. I love it from the bottom of my heart but since this rollercoaster series going full speed from the start up to the very last episode but BOOM! the last episode was stopping in a FULL BREAK and I feel like ...errghh,,,what's the term of it..ah! yeah right! I feel like WHIP LASHED! That's the perfect word. Imagine you ride a rollercoaster and then suddenly its stop after running 100km/h. No no no, not that I don't like the ending (or so I wish it have a better ending but it doesn't) The way the story closed looks like it will have 2nd season or something so yeah...it is a bit hanging. So in summary, Occultic Nine leave me WHIP LASHED HANGING *lmao *cry\\n\\n\r\nThe art & animation? Always love Studio A1 and I will say EVERYTHING is IDENTICAL with SHELTER (that MV of Porter Robinson song) except that SHELTER have much better animation detail but that doesn't mean Occultic Nine not good, in fact thumbs up with the art, I enjoyed it so much (Just try to adapt with those nose drawings, it's a tad odd but yeah..it is odd). It is exactly like SHELTER but with far darker ambience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. The entire series is filled with tons of type of character (except lollicon and tsundere) and all of them coming from different background, not knowing each other and then one by one introduced to each other through a perfect chain of events and all great. Secret after secret, mystery after mystery, why after why revealed one by one and connected to each other finishing the puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I would suggest is try to open your mind to the logic, flip your head a bit because this series is good in term of mind bending. It is filled with rationally impossible theories (something beyond science yet the entire series is close to science) so I would say Occultic Nine is involving Sci-Fi genres in the process.\\n\\n\r\nI am excited the entire series due to the lively ambience combo Ryotas and Gamotan and I enjoy the rollercoaster. I like the theme song and the soundtrack as well, it is not boring by any means. I found Occultic Nine pretty similar with Durarara in a lot of ways with ADDITIONAL SPEED and MIND BENDING SCI-FI.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I think Occultic;Nine is one of the most underrated anime of this season. \r\nAfter the first disastrous episode, most of the people dropped it and said that was a great mess, considering his older brother Steins;Gate,made by the same creator...but I think they were only hasty conclusions. This series have a lot of potential,even considering its defects.\r\nStory 7/10 :\r\nOne of the most interesting things of this work, with its fast-paced rythm and brilliant developement,that will blow your mind in each episode. Too bad for the reduced amount of episodes, which didn't allow the plot to develop...and felt that was a bit too rushed. Also,the firstepisode, which has summed up an entire novel in only 25 minutes(more or less), didn't introduced the characters well and made the entire plot really confused since his first steps. OC;9 is like a puzzle: we collect each piece,episode by episode, until we get to the ending, which leaves us all with a permanent doubt, even if all the mysteries were solved.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 :\\n\\n\r\nSimply magnificent, as I expected from the director of Shigatsu Wa Kimi no Uso, which had a great art direction, such as this series. It makes you enjoy and live every single moment with its colourful graphics and innovative shots, the major quality of Occultic;Nine. Every single scenario is original and well detailed, resulting a real treat for the eyes. And here, nothing else to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a drug. Even if I'm writing a review and I have to concentrate, it continues to ring out in my mind. Kanako Ito confirms herself as a great singer, with her enchanting and clean voice, that makes this song more beatiful. The ending is also great, which is made by Asaka, a young singer(only 17 years old) in her first work...hope she will do more songs. Then, I think the soundtrack is good...it accompanies every single moment brilliantly and creates a nice atmosphere, a priority in this type of anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode introduced them badly, and even in the last steps some members of the crew suffered the poor characterization. This problem wouldn't exist if there were more episodes(24,for example)...you can't introduce 9 important characters in half an hour...what a crazy choice! Hower, I admit that their design is attractive and they interact very well with each other during the course of the series. Ryoutasu remains the best with her lively and irreverent nature, but also Gamon does his figure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 :\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. The episodes are well structured and the plot makes this journey more interesting,together with the great art direction. It was a really pleasure to follow it, my confidence has been rewarded. The only problem is always the same, and I'll repeat it ad nauseam: the episodes were too few!\\n\\n\r\nConcluding my review,I would like to give you an advice: don't trust the ridiculous score, this is a worth watching anime, especially if you love mysteries and mind-blowing plots.",

It's a really interesting style and there are a lot of interesting shots.\r\nThe characters were also well done and developed, though the way they designed Ryouka's character is rather... questionable. The rest of the characters all look great though.\r\nThe story is by far the most interesting part of the show. It's a mystery with a bit of a thriller-aspect to it (like the SciAdv series by the same author), and I personally found it very engaging. I would say that the pacingis slightly off in some parts; the last episode in particular had way too much going on in it.\\n\\n\r\nFor me though, the greatest issue I had with this entire show was the speed of the dialogue. I'm sure if I was fluent in Japanese, this show would be a point higher for me, but since I'm not, the speed at which they talk sometimes leaves you having to rewind, pause, and then read the subtitles again. Maybe I'm just not a fast enough reader, but anyways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a pretty engaging show if you don't drop it after the first few episodes because of the pacing and the speed of the talking.",

            "content": "TLDR: Skip to final paragraph.\r\nWater\u2019s bottom, many people, drowning, giant cow-tits\u2026transmission died. \r\nClearing out the elephant in the room. Nikola Tesla never had an illegitimate child as he was a virgin who devoted his love towards a peculiar pidgin. What if I told you he did father a child, and this child capable of being a poltergeist, has managed to possess someone all this time. Occultic;Nine is a show that explores the occult and probes into the spirit realm. The series scrutinises paranormal activities and tries to rationalise it in a scientific manner, hence tries to inform us that anything can be disproven my science.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine had one of the worst opening episodes that I\u2019ve experienced in a long time. The pacing was frenetic in the sense that it was uncontrolled and hard to follow. How on earth do you adapt a whole light novel volume into a single episode? The standard is usually 4 episodes per volume but this series is purposely shooting itself in the leg by having the nerve to do this. This series is a combination of the Tatami Galaxy and Durarara at its finest. The lightspeed dialogue combined with a relatively large cast has conceived a child in the form of Occultic;Nine. The child inherited some of the undesirable genes and turned out inferior to its parents. I\u2019ll explain why.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is pretty much focused on the detection of ghosts, material or not. Material ghosts are detectible with the latter being unrecognisable. Gamon Yuuta, our high school NEET runs a blog dedicated on the occult, only to find himself caught up in a crime scene. The murder of professor Hashigami, a leading researcher in the occult field, causes panic for our distressed main character who flees from the scene to avoid getting prosecuted. Good move there as Japan\u2019s judicial system is seriously flawed.\\n\\n\r\nThe murder wasn\u2019t the main incident of the show. An intentional mass suicide of 256 people in Inokashira lake sets the precedent for what entails later. The discovery of the corpses in the morgue reveals a shocking truth. The concept of being alive while looking at your own corpse seems alien to most folk. This sounds contradictory but bear with me as the show does explain the circumstances later down the road. The situation is that some of our main cast are alive without feeling dead, the idea of being conscious after parting with the material body can only be explained through science.\\n\\n\r\nNow talking about the main cast, the series does switch around from person to person giving different perspectives. Our main character Gamon Yuuta is being instructed by a voice from a radio. This reliance on a tool indicates that he can\u2019t get things done properly. I compare it to stabilisers on a bike, which is what this character is going through. He doesn\u2019t have any independence and his actions are limited.\\n\\n\r\nNarusawa Ryouka known as Ryo-tas by Gamon is a person whose physical traits defies the laws of motion. Her breasts are so unsightly, that every time she makes an appearance which is usually accompanied by a silly dance. She is literally known as the big-boobed girl who serves no purpose until later on where her character becomes the focus and not her melons.\\n\\n\r\nHashigami Sarai is the son of the murdered researcher and just like his father exhibits an extreme amount of intelligence which is not normal for his age. The knowledgeable Sarai is able to deduce problems and other riddles in the blink of an eye, which to me is just incredible. Geniuses exist but even then, he struggles on some occasions making it somewhat realistic.\\n\\n\r\nAikawa Miyuu is a high schooler who is extremely skilled in fortune telling. She has built up a reputation due to the fact of making correct predictions. She is a character for the audience to relate to as she doesn\u2019t comprehend scientific jargon just like myself. Her quirk is surprisingly useful when it comes to putting the pieces together. These four characters are the most important to the series with others such as Minase Ria getting their own screen time but aren\u2019t worth talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is produced by A-1 animation, which in recent times has gotten quite some stick for churning out series like the Asterix War. The art style is a breath of fresh air with the character designs being relatively unique. The only downside is Ryo-tas whose has been fetishized with enormous breasts. No fricking way is it breast hypertrophy. The animation as expected from this studio is relatively good with most scenes being aesthetically pleasing and generally fluid. It would be a stain on the studio\u2019s portfolio if it did have poor animation but I\u2019m glad it met my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing and is composed by Yokoyama Masaru (Your Lie in April, Plastic Memories) with it just adding to my immersion to certain scenes. The mix of electronic and contemporary rock music through auto-tuned measures immediately catches my attention by sending a statement. The use of casual jazz music in the downbeat scenes is a good indicator for the tone shifts. Lastly, the music is great at setting up a creepy atmosphere with extensive use of fading in/out and selective piano compositions. The music used generally follows a certain tempo to match the timing of certain segments, this is useful for scene transitioning and makes for some good cinematography. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR-\\n\r\nThe first episodes annoyed me initially but this show manages to redeem itself as it goes on. The mystery regarding the incidents are cleared up in a way you wouldn\u2019t expect. The plot twists cannot be understated with it being interlinked with events. They may not all have a direct relation but by following the lines you gradually see the bigger picture. I would definitely recommend this series for those willing to give it a few episodes. In food terms this is slow cooking, which is higher praised than the generic fast food shit.\\n",

            "content": "\"What is a nightmare? The dictionary tells us it a terrifying dream, a nightmare, nightmare, nightmare...\"\r\nOccultic;Nine is a nightmare.\r\nSteins;Gate is a great anime. It deserves most of the praise it gets, aside from being a tad overrated. In order for me to review the trash that is Occultic;Nine, we need to address Steins;Gate first. Steins;Gate was a series that gave new ideas to the anime world, time travel- something that hadn't been done much. It was popular, and deserved, and still deserves, to be. It launched a multitude of spinoffs set in the same universe, such as Chaos;Head. Chaos;Head may have not been a masterpiece,but it could still hold a candle to SG. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine cannot. Occultic;Nine is something that wants to bank off the success of a series like SG by introducing new ideas. I must admit, the ideas in ON are good ones. I see all the time people defending ON like \"It isn't as bad as people say!\" Yet, it's much, much worse. See, the reason people seem to be defending this (at least from what I've seen) isn't because it's a good show. It's because they enjoy the ; universe and will blindly defend anything from it. Now, I'm not saying I dislike the ; universe- I expressed my opinions on SG and CH. By the way, Robotic;Notes was ok, nothing special. So, let's see why ON is a misrable, mislabeled, shitty shadow of the original Steins;Gate and it's spinoffs.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for ON deserves a 3 at best. ON's most glaring problem is it's pacing. This pacing is pretty much why it flops the most. The show has absolutely no rhyme or reason to it. The first episode was very, very rushed. From what I read it adapted more than 400 pages worth of material in the first episode. I barely knew each character until at least episode 5, and half of them weren't too interesting (but more on that later). \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the scenes in ON seem pointless and come in with more importance towards the later events of the show. The foreshadowing, I feel, was not done well. For example, (spoilers, if you care to watch this trainwreck) The owner of the cafe the main protagonists go to is a huge antagonist- this happens in episode 11, and from what I can tell, it wasn't hinted at more than maybe once. Yeah, they do show a creepy man with a mask chasing around our MC, but in no way could we tell it was the gay bartender. It just threw the series off point, with things that just fade away.\\n\\n\r\nI felt as if I couldn't take the show seriously at points. For example, one of the most important characters (spoiler again) is quite main, but is shown mainly as a comic relief character until around episodes 10-12. She's Tesla's daughter- and, once again, is given no hint towards. Not to mention her character design can barely be taken seriously. Another point, is there's a very important weapon in the show that most of the latter half revolves around. It looks like something from Toy Story. Quite laughable for a 'serious' series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I mentioned sometimes things in this show 'fade away' I meant that some parts of the series ARE pointless. In the third episode there's an incest subplot which I couldn't care less about, since that's why I didn't watch this show. Anyway, turned out the girl's brother was the grim reaper, or devil, or shinigami, or whatever. And... there's really no point to it. It's just- there. I don't feel it advanced the plot at all. There's also an albino kid who kills someone and in the last episode of the series he is forgotten about. As you might be able to tell by now, this show is very, VERY edgy. Just for the sake of it. I almost cut myself watching this show. Rather, this show made me want to slit my wrists.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the last episode, that and the first episode were the worst of all. The last episode was so anticlimactic it made me regret going through 12 weeks of pain watching this show. In the end (spoilers) the girl with basketball tits helps our pathetic  MC out, and he destroys the main antagonist's base with the power of imagination. Yes, you heard me, the power of imagination. I believe Spongebob Squarepants has done an episode like this before.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was nothing horrible, not really much to touch on. I felt a lot of the character designs were bland at best. (Except for that one ridiculous looking girl, I don't even know what was up with that) The settings were also ok, I guess? Not much to put down but not much to praise.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also fairly weak. The intro grated against my ears and I skipped it every single time. The sound effects during the show were dull. When ever they did that retarded \"WOO WEE OOOO\" sound effect you knew something 'spooky' was going to happen. The ending was alright, but forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also ON's weakest point. Most are forgettable or boring. In fact, I don't remember any of the names, and I had to look them up for this review. I confused Gamon and Shun for about 6 episodes. They introduced so many characters at once that I didn't even remember the names until they started killing them. Not like I care to remember them. The characters are all connected though the \"256 incident\" which was a mass suicide. By the time episode 12 was over, I wanted to be the 257th person to kill themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might be able to tell, I did not enjoy Occultic;Nine. It was too fast paced for its own good. Every time someone said a sentence someone else said something, and it gave me a headache. Like, these people, talked at lightning speed, and talked over each other at times. Oh, I am not stupid by any means, but I think this is too much for the average person. Not that thinking is bad, but it takes a while to process what happens after episode. And not in a good way, like SG did. SG made me WANT to watch the next episode, not kill somebody out of frustration.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch Occultic;Nine if you value life.\\n\\n\r\n0.5 of fucking 10.",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD!\r\nWell, well... Here we are at the end of the Fall season; hyped animes, some satisfying, some disappointing ones keep ending one by one. From the creator of Steins;Gate, director of Your Lie in April and well-known studio A-1 Pictures, Occultic;Nine can be placed in all these categories. I am really confused and have really messy opinions about this anime so I hope I can explain them properly.\r\nGenres: Mystery, Sci-Fi, Supernatural, Thriller\r\nPros:\r\n-Unique style of pacing\r\n-Really interesting story\r\n-Mysterious ambience\r\n-Somehow loveable characters\r\n-Music and art\r\n-Good use of science materials\r\nCons:\r\n-Extremely fast talkings and pacing\r\n-Not enough screentime and developments for characters\r\n-Plotholes\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nOccultic Nine's story is like a puzzle. First,you have puzzle pieces and a few places to put them but the rest of it is dark and empty like space. You understand nothing don't know what to do, but when you put one piece to its place, then you achieve to unlock other places. So more you understand something, there comes more to understand.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, first of all the anime introduces (well, not really) us the characters and tons of pointless talkings. And at the end of the episode real story starts off with a crime mystery. First the pacing seems really fast but when you get into the story and get used to the style of anime it feels more acceptable. The actual problem of pacing and talkings are being too fast is not like ''Oh I can't understand anything'', the problem is watchers live too much emotional and situational changes in a very little amount of time. You don't have time to laugh, upset, stress, surprise or even think about anything. But this is why I said ''unique style of pacing''. After sometime you start loving it, how all those things happen in one episode. Until the last 2 episodes, it was okay but I wish it was 3 episodes, not 2. So that we can understand the story better, feel all the emotions and maybe they can cover the plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about plotholes, they're not killing the story. First ''mutual recognition''. I was just thinking about how can it possible that Yuta has the key, they answered it with ''mutual recognition''. It was an impressive and somehow logical answer to me, but when he get back the key and come back after Ryo-tas kissed him, it lost its magic and caused plenty of question marks. It really should have had a better explanation. The second one is Nishizono Ririka. What do we know about her? Almost nothing. How can she know and draw all the things? Why and how did she disappear at the end? These are probably the biggest questions of the story. If it was 3 episodes, maybe they could explain her too.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I want to say about the story, is really impressive. It tries to handle occultic science, supernatural powers (like Myu-pom's vision) and time travelling. It has a mysterious ambience from beginning to the end and did a great job answering the questions (except the ones I told) by using scince. It has cliffhangers, and a really important plot twist that changed the story's course. But if you watch the first episode properly, there's a chance of predict that plottwist (except the one about Ryo-tas)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI am really affected by the art, especially using of light and shadings. It makes you live all that dark, bloody and scary moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks are amazing and thrilling. The opening and ending are awesome, too. (I won't write so much things about art and sound since they're mostly subjective and don't know what to write about them.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so diffrent each other. They're all special, generally energic and intelligent. Anime told us most of their backstories but still characters did not have enough screentime and because of that  their developments are not completed either. Since the pacing is too fast and anime focuses on the story this was a possible situation. Gamotan, Ryo-tas, Myu-pom and Sarai's developments were kinda ok but others (Again, especially Nishizono Ririka) are not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWe can say that most of the people didn't like at least the first episodes of the anime by looking at the score (it fell to even 6.59), but I enjoyed it from beginning to the end. Ryo-tas' breasts are bigger than Everest, they're talking too fast so it's hard to catch, pacing is too fast, characters are a little bit childish, first episode is really messy (even that nothing happened)... These are acceptable reasons why people hated it but still I found it enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSo here is my thoughts about O;N, had a lot of potentials and used most of them. As I said, it would be better if it was longer, even 1 more episode. I hope you liked the anime and my review :)",

            "content": "Light novels have been a popular adaptation these days, there are dozens of anime that have been adapted from this. It has been one of the best solutions to decrease the over-dominance of manga in the past. It's a good strategy, though. But I should say that \"adapting literature into an anime is not an easy work\".  \r\nWhy? Because the director has to adjust a hundred pages of story into a fit 24 minutes per episode in a limited one-cour (or two-cour if they lucky to have that time), with the same feeling & content of the literature itself. Many anime failed to bringthis to the screen.  And what I thought about Occultic; Nine is similar as I stated above. Occultic; Nine has failed to wrap both story and characters in its adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nThe story somewhat brings us into certain cases of death with many supernatural elements haunt them. The story tries to persuade us to see from a different perspective in supernatural things, the 'there is nothing that can't be proved by science' theme is actually a neat theme, in my opinion, it has its own noteworthy in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that disturbs me is the pacing. After 8 years I watch Japanese anime, I've never seen a character talks like it has been fast forwarded 2x by a remote. It is really ruined the entire feels about the anime. I could see that sometimes I must rewind the minute bar in order to understand the story. Another cancer that this anime has is the ineffective information dumping. The story struggles to throw much information to make us more understand. But what we got is an enormous endless wave of information with fast forwarded dialogues and heavy feelings which make the story's full of plot holes. \\n\\n\r\nI could honestly say that the ending is not so good at all. It felt really rushed and poorly wrapped episodes of calamity and ends with an all-happy cliche nonsense ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is in the hand of one of the most prestigious studios in Japan, the A-1 Pictures. Is not that because I hate the story (or the studio), but the art itself failed to bring a meaningful contribution to the anime. It was poorly done, it just like the characters has been blended with the color of the background, like it has the same texture. It is really different from other works that the studio has done in the past, really less-colorable with dark colors has been the dominance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, from what I saw is also has been poorly-handed, especially our main character, Gamon Yuuta. It still follows a 'hero wannabe' stereotype character that hasn't have a single meaningful character development. Other characters are cookie cutter, almost seems to be random & feels a lack of originality. Villains felt one-dimensional, without having a single purpose on their actions. The problem is the anime was too busy to bring us it world building while abandoned the in-depth character development, which makes it more vulnerable. \\n\\n\r\nThe only fairly accepted elements is the sound settings. Both opening & ending are lovely to hear. While I can't say anything except 'disappointed' for the voice actors & their fast forwarded role. I never heard such character talks like that before.\\n\\n\r\nWhile in some minutes, I found out that this anime actually succeed in bringing mystery elements, I felt the mystery thingy in my mind, thirst to make me wanted to know what's comes up next. While in some minutes, I felt the 'rushed' things is also annoying. In the same time,  it makes you want to continue it or dropped it in a weird mixture of feelings.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, watching Occultic; Nine is one of the worst ways to end a year. It is obviously not recommended if you seeks a deep sci-fi/mystery anime. It leads our mind to a desperate situation where you struggle to understand it but the story doesn't give you any chance to understands it, a total wasted potential because of a bad execution. It just another pitiful attempt to adapt a light novel.",

            "content": "As you can probably guess by the semicolon in the title, Occultic;Nine is another entry from the Science Adventure franchise, except this time it's based on a two-volume light novel series written by that other semicolon writer not named Naotaka Hayashi. Not that it really matters too much because the basic plot is pretty much the same as all the other semicolon entries: a bunch of professional adults go apeshit for no reason other than they're bastards and try to take over the world through some specific scientific area that's been weaponized, and end up involving a bunch of eccentric young teenagers or college studentswho just so happen to have an interest in said field, as well as wield the only (nerdy) means that are capable of defeating said organization. And since this is a semicolon anime, that means all the characters are either a NEET or a cosplayer or an idol or some irritating \"man, we sure love anime\" trope that is about as un-relatable and accurate in regards to portraying the human being as Steven Seagal in every single movie he's ever made or been in. Which makes even less sense here because the other entries have been all about technology, so they'd all somewhat fit in Japan's electric town. But Occultic;Nine is more about the supernatural, which isn't an otaku-bait subject at all, so having everyone be a nerd is as jarring as all those fanservice-y characters in those Zero Escape games.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Zero Escape, it seems that the writers of this series are friends with the guys who made the Nonary games, because this show borrows a lot of storytelling devices from stuff like 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward. You've at least heard of those games, right? Those handheld sci-fi mystery visual novels that raise so many questions to the point of frustration, only to info-dump the answers to you at the very end to the point of tedium whilst being obsessed with the number \"nine\"? They're tolerable to get through when you're actually playing them, but outside of the interactive medium, they're a fucking grind - something the writers of this show seemed to miss entirely when they somehow mistook that Punchline anime as VN-to-anime genius.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine also differs from the other SciAdv entries in that it tries to mask the slow-ass pacing that generally happens with light/visual novel adaptations in that it borrows heavily from Ryogho Narita's style of writing, particularly Baccano with the multiple character jumping through different seemingly unconnected phases of the mysterious incident. This may seem like a compliment at first, but I think most of us who didn't have the nails lodged in their brains required to acknowledge Durarara!!x2 as \"not absolutely cancerous\" can see at this point that Baccano's style of storytelling hasn't aged well at all. Because over-the-top characters with no personal flaws, interesting philosophies, or reason to be in the story other than to be cool whilst backed by an energetic presentation trying desperately to cover up for the lack of plot progression is about as entertaining as watching bird competitions where the competitors ate Chinese food during the pre-competition feeding time. And it doesn't help when that presentation is applied to a plot that is about as over-complicated and impenetrable as a steel wall with candy canes of fifty different colors painted all over it.\\n\\n\r\nGetting past the presentation is a tall task in of itself due to how much of a tonally inconsistent joke it is. For one thing, this show has constant hyper-stylization all through its run time that never calms the fuck down - playing ill-fitting music every time a murder happens to the point that it resembles a Green Day soundtrack in an Anne Frank movie. The animation itself is of decent quality when the show bothers to take a break from cutting to a new scene every two seconds, but it's also horribly mismatched. Having the characters make exaggerated faces with the show's sketchy style every time an important dramatic scene occurs to the point that you'd swear everyone in this show was horribly miscast. And they never blend in well with the realistic-looking backgrounds, looking more out of place than an animated character from Coonskin dancing on the set of How I Met Your Mother.\\n\\n\r\nNot helping at all is that Occultic;Nine has what is possibly the worst directing/cinematography in an anime I've ever seen. A majority of the screen time consists of long long LONG scenes of characters sitting/standing around in one place delivering boring exposition that is almost completely unnecessary to understanding what's going on, and often brings up more questions than it does answers. And because the director of this show lost all his talent after making Your Lie in April, he somehow approved the idea of a drunk cameraman doing the shooting for this show, because 90% of the show is shot in an angle. Most of the times, it'll be dutch. Sometimes, it'll be upside down or sideways. There's one time when the camera just spun around for no reason and gave me a headache in the process. This is not how you make dialogue more engaging. You know what you do to make dialogue more engaging? Write some actual good dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the dialogue, in addition to having some of the worst directing in an anime ever, I think Occultic;Nine's writing was the product of some bet with the Kingdom Hearts guys to see who can make their audience slice their ears off or turn off the subtitles the fastest. Not only do these characters not shut the fuck up, but when they're not delivering exposition against dull still backgrounds regarding Nikola Tesla and how the story intends to rape his corpse, they're prolonging scenes with quips consisting of nothing but explaining the logistics of some minor thing or engaging in otaku dialogue in a show that has nothing to do with otaku. There was one exchange in Episode 5 when the character kept saying the word \"pukey\" for like five minutes because they wanted their conversation to be \"cute\" for no reason whatsoever. And even earlier in the episode, one of the main characters info-dumps a lot of signs regarding how Gamon is lying to him from the amount of time his eyes wandered to his facial expressions, even though I don't care how he knows since everything about Gamon's personality should make that obvious. Yes, the dialogue is that bad.\\n\\n\r\nDoesn't help that even by the standards set by the specific visual novel company's previous track record, the nine characters that make up this show are all just completely unlikeable, Rewrite-style. It's like they were written by someone who forgot that the pre-requisite for wanting to see how everything connects together in a mystery show as it goes on is to have individual character stories that can stand on their own do most of the leg work in regards to telling the story. For example, there's this one girl who was so delusional about her brother's death that she ended up living with his corpse for a year until the neighbors realized that onii-chan was starting to smell a bit. You'd think this would give an insight into some serious psychological issues or play a vital role in what exactly the fuck is going on, and you'd be more wrong than a typical 4chan commenter. It's never brought up again, all it did was make the girl creepy without giving me a reason why I'm supposed to care that she's creepy. And just to put the cherry on top, she has no literally no purpose in the main plot at all. I've seen teen stereotypes in 80s slasher films that were more three-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, when compared to the villains of this mess, Jason Vorhees might as well be any of the characters that Gary Oldman played in his career. I know the evil organizations in these series tend to be a load of crap, but I think Occultic;Nine was trying to out shit the Sinister Six with the motivations it gave its antagonists. Without spoiling anything major, the evil SERN replacement that looms over this show's shadow wants to control the rich in order to rule the world for no other reason than because they're nameless bastards. You're probably thinking at this point that this sounds like a shitty comic book plot, and it is; but somehow things get even dumber when it's revealed how they're going to accomplish their master plan. Someone want to explain to me who's providing the funding for these guys and their convoluted plans? Because I think Akihiko Kayaba from Sword Art Online presented a more engaging business plan in regards to his quest to kill off Japan's youth.\\n\\n\r\nOh and for the love of god, ENOUGH WITH THE GODDAMN TIME-TRAVEL/ALTERNATE WORLD SHIT, ALREADY! From Higurashi to Clannad to Madoka Magica to anything written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, I am fucking sick of visual novel companies/writers using it. It was old when those products did it, and as of this point, it's pretty much just a dead corpse kept in cold storage with people fighting over who gets to unfreeze it next. Occultic;Nine doesn't even make good use of it. It's only hinted at through a few characters whose sole purpose are to be McGuffins, and then used as a last-minute deus ex machina for its finale, which is pretty exposition-heavy for an episode that's supposed to conclude things with a bang. But even if the creators had fixed the infamous pacing problems that turned many people away to start with, that still wouldn't have fixed Occultic;Nine's biggest problem: it fucking sucks.\\n\\n\r\nI mean between the numerous plot points borrowed from every visual novel ever, horrible motivations driving the characters forward, and awful humor that couldn't make Barney fans laugh, the shit-ass production of this show just twists the already-deep knife wound so hard the blood fucking explodes. What on earth does this show have to offer anyone? What exactly is it about? When the mystery is over and the answers are revealed, what then? How does this show have anything to do with the occult? You'd think a show called Occultic;Nine would pay more than lip-service to its many practices, but it never does. Instead it does what every awful mystery show does: bait the viewers with questions throughout the entire journey whilst having that bait be the substance rather than everything surrounding it, answer only a few of the questions tediously at the last minute, and have said answers be unsatisfying dogshit.\\n\\n\r\nWell fuck you, Science Adventure guys. And fuck you too, A-1 Pictures. This anime was like a magazine collage that was fed through a shredder and had to be put back together ten minutes before the actual deadline!",

            "content": "'Occultic;Nine proves that Steins;Gate wasn't just luck, but that there's a genius writer behind this...'\r\nThe story of Occultic;Nine is just excellent. The writer has seriously been thinking about pretty acceptable theories (and using ones that already exist). This makes the paranormal activities in this serie more realistic, just like he did with the time travel theories in Steins;Gate. It is really funny how some small jokes refer to certain moments in Steins;Gate. But don't get me wrong, because this serie on it's self isreally good. \r\nI love the way things are being made mysterious and every strange thing you see has a meaning. Itkeeps your attention and lets you puzzle with the characters.\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nYes, the characters. I must say that the characters are a really important thing but that they are not special. The story behind the characters is good and sow are theiractions, but they are not that special furthermore. I think theyused just some stereotype characters and merged them with the amazing plot, which made it pretty succesfull. The serie contains a lot of characters, but you should bear with it because otherwise it will ruin the story.\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art was done really well and detailed, which is important in these types of series where you need eye for detail. The intro music is pretty good and the other sounds/music in the serie is pretty good too.\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this seriea lot and I hope you too!!! Every week I have been waiting for he episode to come online. If you still have to watch this I recommend you to watch 2 episodes per day, max. 3... to enjoy it the best!!!",

            "content": "I just read something saying that the world from Occultic; Nine is the same world that Steins Gate used as well as Chaos Head.  I haven't watched any of those two, but it's nice to know that a series I love is based in the same world as two other anime on my to watch list.\r\nNow for specifics on Occultic; Nine.  I'd have to say that the story was interesting, although it was  a bit rushed.  The dialog was very fast and you ca tell that the scenes went by quickly.  Even with the fast pacing, I still really likethe idea the show had; having nine people become ghosts and be all specifically linked to a certain blog was quite interesting due to all the weird supernatural phenomenon that occurred.  \\n\\n\r\nI'll admit that characters are really all that developed.  Each of them did fit their role though and everyone of them actually did something to help advance the plot that can only be fulfilled by them; a side character was not randomly chosen to perform a task that a main character could've done.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound weren't the best either, but they did fit well into the show.  I do like the opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Occultic; Nine can seem like a mess, but it was quite enjoyable.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out at first, but I became really interested in seeing how it would unfold by the third week or so. I'd recommend this to sci-fi fans who won't the fact that it will seem rushed.",

            "content": "Intro \r\nEvery year you wound encounter an anime thats a little different to what you would usually find in a given season. In this season this will be occultic nine. Adapted from the light novel series of the same name \r\nSo then lets get started \r\nOccultic Nine has a rather unique story in that it combines the traditional evil organisation/corporation's evil plot with the occultic which in this case deals with the use of spirits. The story combines the elements of these two type of story types with elements of mystery into one storyline that is full of twists and unexpected revelations. Indeed while thestory can be difficult to understand at first and indeed this is one of the complaints that i have seen other viewers have expressed the story does become clearer as anime goes on. The story of occultic nine follows the lives of nine characters that in normal life situations would not have likely have met each other but are drawn together when they discover the evil plot and that they have all been affected by it. One of the things that i like about the story for occultic nine is that it brings people with sometimes differing personalities together and force them to work together to hunt down the truth while at the same time allowing them to expand their knowledge on what they think is real. All in all i thought that the story behind occultic nine while certainly slow to start got better as it went on. \\n\\n\r\nYuta Gamon voiced by veteran voice actor Yuki Kaji of Accel world and Attack on Titan fame who is usually referred to as Gamon in the series is one of the main characters of the series. A high school student like Ryouka and Miyu Gamon is a self described Neet that runs his own blog that centers on the occultic and the paranormal that he calls Kiri Kiri Basara. Gamon has a rather simple outlook and view to his life in that he wants to merely run his blog in peace and live off the money that he runs from that while at the same time looking for interesting strange and paranormal phenomenon. Personality wise Gamon changes quite a bit in the course of the series so much in fact the its almost like he's a different person. In the early parts of the story Gamon is laid back and cowardly and cares little for others and only cares about the blog and himself and at the same time gets scared rather easily when confronted by the unknown. However this changes after he begins to unravel the truth in that he becomes a more determined and serious person that while still getting scared at times has learned to not let that affect him as much. Gamon also become braver and closer to his friends and more than willing to protect them which is a far cry from when his character was first introduced. I thought that Yuki Kaji did a great job portraying Gamon and his character is arguably one of my favorites on this show. \\n\\n\r\nRyouka voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte Fame is one of the main characters of the show. A high school student like Gamon Ryouka is Gamons best friend and indeed only friend at the beginning of the story. Ryouka is a affiliate of the blog that Gamon runs and is one of the reasons why its popular. One of Ryouka's most prominent traits is the size of her breasts which is often used for comical effect within the series. Personality wise Ryouka is a bit of a ditz but nonetheless has a kind and caring personality and it is apparent that she cares about Gamon as a friend. Around halfway through the series Ryouka's personality changes due to to her being possessed by the spirit of the granddaughter of a  well known inventor and real life persona that changes her personality. Here Ryouka/Aveline  is a more serious person and a more driven one that while still caring of Gamon and co is also determined to stop the main enemy plot. This leads to her trying to decide on what actions to take for the endgame which i thought was well done. Ayane Sakura i felt did a great job portraying Ryouka here. \\n\\n\r\nMiyu voiced by veteran seiyuu Hitomi Yoshida of the Digimon adventure tri fame is one of the main characters of the show. A high school student like Gamon and Ryouka Miyu is relatively popular due to her beauty and personality and is also a well known fortune teller that makes use of tarot cards to divine fortune and as a result she has a rather large fan club following her despite only being a first year. Personality wise Miyu is a kind and caring person that cares about her friends but at the same time is fearful of the occult and things that she doesn't understand. Miyu's friendship with her best friend Chizu who she calls Chi chan forms one of the foundations of her personality and also forms one of the sub arcs of the main story. When Chi vanished without a trace Miyu's personality changes and she becomes more withdrawn and depressed which is different to her usual positive self and at the same time she becomes obsessed to discover what happened to Chi. Though the arc ended with a sad fate for Chi Miyu at least found out what had happened and from that become a stronger person that become braver and at the same time caring towards her friends. \\n\\n\r\nSarai voiced by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa is one of the main characters of the show. A university student unlike Gamon Sarai is also a realist that believes only in the facts that he sees in front of him and as such being confronted with the paranormal which itself is difficult to prove as there is no proven facts about it proves challenging for him to understand. Sarai is the son of Professor Hashigami a renowned and respected professor that was well respected within his field and is indeed a character central to the overall plot of the series. Sarai is a serious, intelligent and clear headed person and indeed among the cast along with Touko is the main brains within the cast. Sarai's relationship with his father is one of the main points of his character and seeing him try and understand the reason why his father decided to look into Paranormal and how he was connected with the main plot was actually quite hearwarming to see especially when it become apparent that his father was trying to stop the same plot that Sarai and co was. Another aspect of Sarai that was interesting was his relationship with Gamon. As a realist Sarai did not agree with Gamon on a lot of things including Paranormal and as such they are often at each others throats due to their differing viewpoints and beliefs. However as the series progresses and Gamon and Co discover more paranormal Sarai is forced to admit that even in life there are things that define common sense and ultimately results in Sarai actually calling Gamon his friend that opened his eyes. \\n\\n\r\nTouko played by veteran seiyuu Shizuka Itou is one of the main characters of the show. A veteran reporter for a famed occultic magazine Touko is a highly motivated person that does her best to determine the truth behind the paranormal that she discovers. Like Sarai Touko is a bit of a realist but she is more willing to believe in something that can't be proven by facts if the theory behind them is sound. Being a reporter Touko crosses paths with many of the main cast before she too is dragged into the plot by the machinations of the villain. Personality wise Touko is a determined, efficient and focused person that is serious about her job and at the same time is also a smart and freethinking person that is not afraid of thinking outside of the box. Despite her rather serious nature Touko does care about her subjects and friends which is best seen in her interactions with Miyu in the aftermath of Chi's disappearance. In the cause of the series Touko develops a catchphrase of sorts in which she mutters the words Ascension whenever she discovers something and when something becomes clear in her mind. This i found to be quite amusing. In the course of the series Touko develops a good working relationship with Sarai as they are often out together looking for clues and at the same time she also makes friends with Miyu which i found to be nice. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna voiced by veteran seiyuu Satomi Akesaka of Gate fame is a support character of the series. A special agent of the FBI despite being a high school girl Asuna shows up near the halfway point of the anime having been sent to replace her sempai Morisaki who had vanished during the course of his investigation. As expected of a detective Asuna is a perceptive, inquisitive and intelligent person thats also logical and dutiful. Asuna both respects and admires Morisaki a great deal and her reasons for investigating the case is as much as in finding out what had killed him as it is in finding out exactly what is going on. Not merely being content with examining evidence at the station Asuna also goes into the field quite often and as such crosses paths with the main cast when she encounters Gamon. Despite being confronted with a case that deals that the paranormal that is well outside of her expertise Asuna was able to determine the various connections that linked the various cases together something that local police had trouble in doing which ultimately led her to assisting the main cast in stopping the evil plot. Apart from having great deduction and investigation skills Asuna also has some sort of power in that she is able to see the last few moments of someones life as a movie. This i found to be quite interesting and actually made her character stand out more.\\n\\n\r\nAria voiced by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of Sword art online and High school of the dead fame is a main character of the series. A teenager that practices the art of Black magic in which she can place curses on someone by using a piece of their hair. Before becoming her current self Aria whose real name is Rin Minase was a somewhat rich girl who lived with her brother Takaharu in a large house within the city. As a result Aria had a rather close relationship with her brother that many mistake as incest but this is far from the truth as Aria saw him as parent figure that was the only person that cared for her. The shock of brothers death that resulted from a botched operation was the result of a kidney transplant ultimately drove Aria over the edge where she become Aria who is able to speak to the devil. Like Ririka Aria does factor in the main plot but only provides advice to the main cast indirectly. \\n\\n\r\nRirika voiced by veteran seiyuu Mamiko Noto of  the Persona 3 movies is a renowned Dojin manga artist that seems to have the ability to predict the future. Her manga's serve as a central plot element within the show. Ririka is familiar with Professor Hashigami's work and is also familiar with Sarai as they both go to the same university. A mysterious, intelligent and mature person Ririka is an interesting character in that while she certainly knows more about the events that are going on she doesn't do anything to either help or hinder the villains and indeed seems content to wait and see what happens instead. Indeed Ririka like Aria only provides indirect advice to the main cast. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nI felt that the character designs for the main characters was well done and detailed and that the environments were well designed and executed. Animation i felt was well done especially with all the occultic scenes. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nThe music for the series i felt was nicely done and i liked both the ending and opening themes that i felt set the mood for the series. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\r\nVoice acting in general i felt was good with Ayane Sakura, Yuki Kaji and Hitomi Yoshida deserving praise as i felt that they managed to portray their characters pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nOccultic nine i felt was an interesting series as it combined the traditional evil corporation troupe with the paranormal and though it wasn't perfect by any means i quite enjoyed the story that i found to be both interesting and at the same time kinda disturbing. Animation and art i felt was reasonably good as was the music and voice acting. With regards to the characters however i felt that not all the characters were given enough character development. Certainly the main investigation team of Gamon, Sarai, Miyu and Ryouka were given great character development but the characters of Aria and Ririka both of which were voiced by veterans were not and apart from having a good backstory which even Ririka lacked they were not featured in the main plot that often. I felt that the story could have been expanded to include them in and give them a bigger role than what they had in the current story.\\n\\n\r\n Apart from that however i quite enjoyed the story of occultic nine which mixed the evil corp troupe with the paranormal. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Occultic;Nine is the newest entry in the semicolon universe among other titles such as the beloved Steins;Gate, the not-so-beloved Chaos;Head, and the no-one\u2019s-quite-sure-how-to-feel-about-it Robotics;Notes. For most people browsing sites like anichart and putting upcoming seasonal titles into their proverbial shopping cart, any show that has a semicolon in its name immediately gets thrown in the basket thanks to its storied legacy. As of late however, it\u2019s easy to lose faith since the majority of the semicolon titles have come with mixed reception. Fall 2016 has rolled around, and the first semicolon entry since 2012 unveiled itself as Occultic;Nine. 2016 was, in many people\u2019s eyes, anoverall weak year for non-sequel anime, so many saw Occultic;Nine as the last bastion of defense of 2016 before going into the new year. In many minds, this begged a controversial question filled with a lot of expectation and (in some cases, hesitant) excitement: would Occultic;Nine be a Steins;Gate or another Chaos;Head?\\n\\n\r\nAs the final minutes of the 12 episode long series come to a close, I unfortunately have to conclude that Occultic;Nine falls under the latter category. While it has its fair share of interesting and cool moments, the majority of the show is marred and sabotaged by its overall abhorrent pacing and sloppy execution.\\n\\n\r\nUpon watching Occultic;Nine for the first time, the most immediate aspect of the show you might notice is the blindingly fast dialogue. In moderation, this style of narrative isn\u2019t automatically terrible; it can be considered a stylistic choice to help support the atmosphere of the show. Unfortunately, the dialogue speed feels less like a stylistic choice and more of way of squeezing as much content as possible within a given time frame, and it remains consistent in all 12 episodes of the show. The result is a sloppy, exhausting mess that drags down nearly every other element of the anime, including character development, setting, and plot progression. But it\u2019s not simply the dialogue speed that\u2019s the problem; it\u2019s the little breathing room in between each line in the next, and this dramatically affects the immersion and effectiveness of the show. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are talking about what they ate that morning or revealing important plot elements to the viewers, each line of dialogue falls directly over the next and this continues until each episode concludes. The viewer is given almost zero time to absorb any information at all and it becomes difficult to distinguish what is fluff and what is important. Because the dialogue moves at such unrealistic speeds, the scenes and characters seem more unnatural, almost as if they\u2019re reading lines from a script. Any build-up effectively gets ruined, and any investment diminishes even at reveals or character development. In addition, quick dialogue is often times a specific character quirk meant to tell us about a character\u2019s personality. In Occultic;Nine, everyone shares this unnatural quality which greatly homogenizes the already bland cast.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just the dialogue that moves unnaturally either. The plot jerks around at different speeds, often spending either way too much time in extraneous details or suddenly advancing the plot with no warning at all. While the first episode pushed the plot forward a little by unveiling a murder scene in the final moments, not much actually occurred in the show until around episode 6; until then, the show was mostly exposition. Aria is one such example; her exposition occupied an entire episode, yet she remained relatively uninvolved with the story even at the end of the 12 episodes. Now it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing to give more exposition to side characters, but it is when it comes at the expense of the main plot. In the latter half of Occultic;Nine, scenes would sometimes jerk from one to another, and often times I would bear witness to a scene where I had no idea what was going on. The most noticeable moment of this to me was when a scene shifted from our cast of main characters to suddenly the board meeting of villains (unveiled for the first time) with zero transition or exposition. It\u2019s disorientating for no reason and made the show not only feel rushed but also unnecessarily confusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story on average isn\u2019t well-polished either. While there\u2019s grounds for a relatively interesting and creative plot, it\u2019s watered down by the amount of telling over showing. Occultic;Nine at its base is supposed to a thriller, and most tend to stay more dynamic in order to keep the viewer invested. Occultic;Nine rarely does that, and most of the plot isn\u2019t explained through action but through dialogue (and like I said earlier, the style of dialogue is horrendous). As another friend of mine put it, \u201cthe show is all exposition,\u201d or in other words, rather than letting the plot itself do the talking, it\u2019s often the characters that have to explain the plot and pseudo-science toward us, which 80% of the time is mostly just unnecessary filler to justify the hazy connection between hard science and spiritual superstition. To elaborate on this further, the reason why I say that that the explanations are usually unnecessary justifications is because despite how fervently the anime might try to insist scientific jargon, a lot of the time it invalidates itself, often through the use of deus ex machina plot devices (one such example is Gamon magically sprouting wings under the validation that he is in fact a ghost, the possibility conveniently unveiled to him only at the final episode of the show). Finally, as you might expect from the dialogue, the show ends blindingly fast, riddled with more loopholes than a Starbucks Wi-Fi network. What happened to Ririka? Who is the mastermind that orchestrated this phenomenon? What on earth happened to the other 250 victims? Many large questions are still left unanswered if not straight up forgotten, which is incredibly frustrating and borderline unforgivable for a narrative that claims to be a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, in my opinion, are painfully bland as well. Both Touko and Sarai are incredibly dull characters that fulfill the same role, that being the smart and composed type. Ryo-tas served mostly as a nonsensical background distraction (which was occasionally charming but overall dismissible) who eventually turned into an equally nonsensical character (Tesla\u2019s daughter) with no unique personality with her appearance having about as much effect as a shallow plot device. Miyuu is an overall boring personality with no qualities that make her stand out from the rest of the cast. And Shun is an incredibly boring character who seemingly knows pretty much everything for no reason, often deflating otherwise interesting conflicts with randomly obtained knowledge. Gamon is actually not a bad main character since he serves as an everyman in this cast of characters and bizarre setting. Ultimately however, he\u2019s shoved with conveniently tied character traits that make him artificially special instead of naturally developing his own character to connect with the viewers as an everyman type should. The antagonists in Occultic;Nine are also insultingly boring. They have zero connection to any characters of the plot and as a result only fulfill the role as a vague, stereotypical organization that the main characters are tasked to defeat. The aspirations are as usual the most boring possible, which is to expand their businesses and create profit. Their designs are laughably typical, simply looking like corporate CEOs and businessmen. Most other solid thriller shows have interesting villains, whether it\u2019s something as simple as being visually striking or psychologically threatening or slightly more complex as being relatable and empathetic or sometimes a little mix of both. Occultic;Nine\u2019s villains are none of this, and it makes the story much harder to be invested in.\\n\\n\r\nTo give credit where credit is due, I do think Occultic;Nine did a few things right. The show on average was consistently well-animated, and the majority of the character designs and settings are aesthetically pleasing and occasionally unique (save for Ryoka\u2019s unrelenting force that is her stupidly massive chest). There are even a number of well-executed shots throughout the entire anime. In particular, the scene where Gamon stares over his lifeless body was particularly brilliant and awesome. And the overall set-up for the plot isn\u2019t necessarily bad. As much as I\u2019ve harped on it, combining hard science fiction with the supernatural has the potential to be interesting due to how contrarian they are, and the duality of characters being both dead and alive in a single show hasn\u2019t been explored as deeply in narratives as it can be. It\u2019s not necessarily that the plot is bad, it\u2019s more that it was executed poorly.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sure most of us that were hoping for another installment of the semicolon series were looking for another Steins;Gate since a lot of us want to relive those thrilling 24 episodes that we experienced way back in 2011 over again. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine is anything but that, delivering a sloppy and mediocre experience for those that have stayed dedicated to the series. With Chaos;Head and debatably Robotics;Notes, Occultic;Nine is a third strike, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who will dismiss the next semicolon anime when browsing for things to watch in future seasons.",

            "content": "\"Let me be a hero!\" - Gamon (Episode 12)\r\nThis is one of those anime where there are going to be alot of haters and alot of praisers I think. There are going to be people that will say... \"This anime is too confusing, I have no idea what is happening, my brain is killing me.\" and people who are like... \"This anime is so smart with it's story, it totally makes sense... omg, give me more plz!\" To me, this anime does start out very very confusing, then I was like... DAMN!!! Let's get to the pros and cons of things.\r\n*\r\n*\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nCons:\r\nOh What aRush! - Ok, the main problem is in it's first 3 episodes in this anime and it's how rushed and fast everything is going. It was very hard to tell what was happening because 1... The dialogue was going so fast that I had to pause alot of times, take a breather, and read the subtitles again. 2... It felt more rushed then Sword Art Online, I couldn't tell at all what this anime was even about in it's first 3 episodes. At least in SAO, the rushed mess that that anime is, you would already know what it's about...  but  in this anime, you'll have a hard time understanding anything. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nWow!... What a Twist! - This anime started to become slower at episode 5. At episode 4, I knew, I finally get to know what it's about, and things start to make sense to me. Even the dialogue was a bit slower actually. Some will say it's still fast but I noticed a change of pace in the dialogue... That's probably just me idk. Anyway, the story was no longer too complicated to me, and when things started to pick up and become interesting, I was enjoying watching these later episodes. This story has alot of neat surprises that are dark and intriguing. You get to know why and how this mass suicide happened. I love these types of stories so much, it does remind me of Steins;Gate a little. It's also fun to make your own theories for later episodes. The last episode was actually just good, it wasn't anything too spectacular until the last couple scenes.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n*Can you repeat that again please? - The character, they talk too fast for me, especially in the early episodes, they were talking like freaks. A lot of times the characters would talk over other characters. Where I have to pay attention to what both of them are saying. Again though, to me, they're talking has slowed down a bit in the later episodes but still though. \\n\\n\r\n*Big Melons - So there is this one main female character whos, and you probably already know about this... It's that girl Ryouka. Her tits are just too big, like idk how she is even standing, dancing, and running around. They're bigger than the girls breasts from Highschool of the Dead I believe, and it's just too much. It's pretty unnecessary, It's very distracting.... Like i know there is alot of fan service in alot of different anime, even anime that aren't ecchi anime, but this is seriously dumb.\\n\\n\r\n*Annoying - Sometimes, Gamon can be pretty dumb and annoying. In the very first episode, he picks up a knife that has blood all over it, and he acts like he doesnt notices it. He finds it, starts playing with it, then finds a dead body 10 seconds later, then finally realizes he's got blood all over the palm of his hand. Also, this dudes panics are so annoying sometimes, that's when he never stops talking and slows down. Like, yeah I would be spooked if I was in his situations too, but still, this guy needs a fucking chill pill. He's also the least interesting character in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n*Personality - Yeah, alot of these characters are pretty damn interesting though, even Ryouka, you might think she's just there for laughs and giggles but no, she adds alot to the story in this anime. And that surprised me, when she showed her true self to Gamon, that blew my fucking mind. Also, the detective dude, Shun, has such a funny personality, I like how he gets into everyones  business, sometimes making jokes at them, annoying them, scaring them, and sometimes just having a normal conversation. He's such a funny dude, he's me laugh quite a bit here. Other characters I find interesting is Aria, who talks to that ghost looking dude, she's pretty cool. Also Touko is a very good character, I like how serious she can be, and she's always seems to make really good choices too. \\n\\n\r\n*Development - Most of these characters had some pretty decent development here. Like Aria, we get to see alot of her past with her and her brother. And we get to see why she is who she is now. We get to learn Sarai's past a bit, with him and his father. Ryouko actually had some major development, in the later episodes. And it was all surprising to me, something that happened to her that I never saw coming. Miyuu gets some development as when she loses he friend. And also the gay bartender gets some good development, we learn alot about him in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPros :\\n\r\nI gotta say, I was a huge fan of the art and animation of this series. IT had it's own unique style and it's a style I really like. I also love the character designs. Most of them, because...well... ya know lol... All of the character designs were pretty unique as well. I haven't notices any derps on the characters faces either. The artist really paid close attention to detail, even on the things you won't notice in a scene, and I'm a big fan of that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPros: The Op and Ed was nothing too special, it was just... good. I wasn't loving it, I wasn't hating it... I just kinda like it. The OST was pretty good. Had some pretty spooky sounds in scenes where things were getting... ya know, pretty spooky, and those sounds were nice to my ears actually, I liked those sounds lol. And sounds that were not so spooky were ok as well. No big complaints here. It was all just slightly above average. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI gotta say though, despite the complaints I had with this series, I enjoyed this anime a ton. I loved the twists, I loved the nasty reveals of the characters, I love the development of the characters, and I love the interesting story. Story is only a 7 becasue of it's major issue in the first few episodes, I can't give it any higher than that even though I loved it, because of the huge rush. But yeah, I definitely enjoyed this anime, again it's not for everyone, some people aren't going to get it, and will probably drop it before things get intense... but it's whatever.\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving this anime a strong 8 to a light 9. Thanks for reading this, have a good one guys :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What does the latest offspring of the Semi;Colon family bring? The most contentious aspect of O;N is its nonlinear narrative. The premise is interesting. O;N takes place in Japan, where nine individuals are linked through strange happenings and phenomenons. Through exploration and newly acquired knowledge, the horrifying facts begin to be disclosed. After the immense information dump of its introductory episode, the show toned down and plateaued into something more understandable, but the pacing still needs work. Pacing is another glaring attribute. If a show is only getting 12 episodes there is the tough decision on how much it needs to cover. The way O;Npresents its exposition, characters, and story can hardly be described as gutsy or unique. These two factors can make or break a show, depending on how it affects the previously mentioned categories.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here\u2019s how issues stem from its pacing and storytelling and how it impacts the characters. O;N\u2019s narrative is disjointed, constantly switching between plot lines and characters. The plot is bestrewed among a flock of characters whose introductions are hastily presented. None of them are given enough time to be fully realized. With a large cast and an eerie story about strange things happening in a busy city, it feels incoherent and convoluted, rather than complex and compelling. Even with the later episodes, there\u2019s not enough flavor from these characters. The characters suffer because of the constraint of telling a big story in 12 episodes. Every character's perspective is needed to learn about their relevance to the plot and because of constant switching between characters, characters do not feel as fleshed out as they should be. Sure we learn more about someone\u2019s backstory or personal feelings, but the show moves so fast that we are never given anytime to explore them. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the explanations behind the incidents may sound scientific and impressive, but they are ultimately nonsensical statements. For some people, they would just take the clarification as is and not think too much about it. The show definitely wants you to, with the evidently complex techno babble, but the conclusions are straightforward and simple. I don\u2019t expect a show to have a scientific explanation for everything. I don\u2019t expect a pseudo-sci-fi anime to make things understandable and be scientifically accurate, but I still question O;N\u2019s continued insistence on providing prolonged pseudo-scientific explanations. It\u2019s perfectly fine if it scientifically accurate, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves, characters repeating dialogue about \u201cscandium\u201d is utterly pointless and time-wasting. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the prolonged dialogue scenes, the cinematography is awful. In fact, it\u2019s the worst cinematography in a show I've ever seen. Scenes are shot at incredibly unnecessary angles. Sometimes, it would be at a long shot, at a random angle, upside down, or even sideways. In episode 6, the camera spun around for no reason as two characters talk. It wasn\u2019t like it was intentionally done to reveal something either. The director must have thought: How can I make these scenes more interesting? I KNOW, let\u2019s just have the angles, transitions, and cuts be as random as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and aesthetic is much more serviceable than the jarring characters and story. The animation remains consistent. Character designs are all peculiar in a good way. It has its own trademark style that makes it distinctive from others. (I personally don\u2019t like the way their noses look.) It captures a silly, yet brooding atmosphere The colors are vibrant. I would've never guessed this was animated by A-1 pictures. Not much can be said about the sound. Its music is hardly noticeable and it neither adds nor detracts from the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you were turned off by the first episode, chances are you\u2019ll like the later episodes a lot more. If O;N had 20+ episodes, it could have benefited from having more episodes. Characters could\u2019ve been given more time to develop. (A good example would be the albino kid). Fast pacing, exposition dumps, and pointless dawdling ruined it for me. Perhaps the light novels would be better to read, but with rumors of it being cancelled, O;N may never see the light of day.",

            "content": "Occultic;Nine might as well be LA's most indecisive anime for Fall 2016 and with good reason...LA had no idea what was going on...no actually that's not quite right, LA \"struggled\" to fit the pieces together. Mind you, it took LA 10 episodes before LA FINALLY knew where Occultic;Nine would be good or bad and when the plot fragments finally blended together into a cohesive narrative.\r\nFor what Occultic;Nine has for \"science\" as this is a part of the ; Science Adventure visual novel series, what the science themes are \"Nikola Tesla's experiments\", nonetheless what it also has are Japanese horror stories, fortune telling, precog, a clandestineorganization, seeing the \"devil\", detective work through pschyometry, mass suicides...you can already tell what the problem is right?...THERE'S JUST TOO MANY IDEAS all jumbled up with one another. At least Chaos;Head had one theme, about delusions, Steins;Gate had time travel, Robotics;Notes had robots. Occultic;Nine feels like it wanted EVERYTHING to do with occult and nothing about it at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine's characters are at best have inconsistent character development for when the plot demands it, such as Yuuta Gamon voiced by Yuki Kaji an occultic blogger, Ryouka Narusawa voiced by Ayane Sakura his assistant, Touko Sumikaze, a journalist to an occult magazine and Ririka Nishizono voiced by Mamiko Noto a doujinshi author that makes future predictions. Occultic;Nine however isn't exactly character-focused as the major plotlines and the occult drives these character forward into finding out just what the hell is going on. The only other character that actually seemed to get proper character development were Aria and Kiryuu Kurenanino voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro and Kishou Taniyama respectively as well as  Miyuu Aikawa voiced by Hitomi Yoshida a clairvoyant and in finding her friend Chizu Kawabata voiced by Maria Naganawa, but once their development comes to pass, Aria and Miyuu gets hardly gets mentioned again and Miyuu's arc blends in with the the main gang afterwards. Shun Moritsuka voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara and Asuna Kisaki voiced by Satomi Akesaka, both detectives, along with Sarai Hashigami voiced by Kaito Ishikawa a son of a scientist and Touko Sumikaze really relays crucial information to the main gang as their function. Again the plot moves the characters forward, not the other way round (though ONE character becomes the exception later on). LA's favourite character would just go to Touko Sumikaze voiced by Shizuka Ito only because she seemed one of the more level-headed characters and probably remembered her for her catchphrase \"Ascension!\", second would easily go to Ryouka Narusawa, NO not because of her *ahem* \"defining feature\", but for voice actor Ayane Sakura and later events that focus on her and the impact she has to the plot in greater detail.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so Occultic;Nine pacing is at best what would happen if you merged SHAFTian animation with Durarara!!'s plot pacing with how it to tie all the characters together, at times Occultic;Nine will throw us a bone with expositional episodes, the problem is your suspense of disbelief if you can actually handle this. LA kinda did through trying to tie all the plot lines together and how it concerns the characters involved, but some of plot twists are hard to grasp or believe, the main one for LA being the clandestine organization and their plan which both becomes cliche and confusing. But for such a fast paced anime for fast speaking expositional characters, LA can see WHY it was soo fast paced at the very least, there were LOTS of material for the audience to grasp onto and see how the \"fragments\" would fit in through it, if it didn't, the 12 episode runtime wouldn't just be enough. Sure the fragmented nature of the anime makes it even worse and extremely confusing what's going on, but once the plot twists resolves and blends how the plot is \"back on track\", makes the fast pacing more or less compensation for that.\\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of plot twists, the plot twists felt like it had an impact on the viewer, not so much the characters themselves (Yuuta and Miyuu excluded), as once they realize the plot twists themselves, it just like a normal thing to them and they don't budge or react as much kinda dampening the effect of revealing the plot twist when the character reactions are just like \"meh\". The only leeway LA can guess is that the main cast has dabbled in the occultic thus it IS just a normal thing to them, but then the characters who are more level-headed grounded characters didn't freak out during their revelations, instead the character who are more crazy does. GAAAA...either way something LA had taken notice to.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by A1-Pictures, again it felt like SHAFTian animation but with differing character designs across the board along with differing styles to match it at the same time, the animation wasn't annoying for the most part as it did bring in the cohesiveness of what was going on and really reigned in the occultic atmosphere it needed with it's grunge black colorings and bolded and light-toned character designs to make things even more crazy to say the least. If anything the animation was pretty decent overall and it's fast pacing added to the animation frantic stylings too, the animation by A1-Pictures was very good all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting really needed to be in game and it's one of the better aspects LA saw in Occultic;Nine, reason being because of all the expositional info dumping through ALL characters, the entire cast essentially speedread their lines along with their emotional impact to boot, this voice cast DID AMAZING because of it. If LA would hone in on one voice actor, it would go to Ayane Sakura, let's just say SHE HAD RANGE and still kept the frantic pacing of the anime pretty much for LA, LA's favourite voice actor in Occultic;Nine. But overall, excellent voice casting to fit it's style it needed to bring out.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending really did feel like it reigned in it's themes (after LA tried to analyze the ending for 20 minutes after the final episode anyways) though it finally narrowed down all the themes it had down into one BIG goal that Yuuta and Ryouka had to pull off, but this BIG GOAL was what reigned in the cohesive narrative together albeit a few loose ends never told to us by the end of it and left in a both good climax but anti-climax afterwards due to how it \"just ended\" with no proper epilogue to see what the hell happened to the rest of the characters be it minor or not. It was a climax because of all the attention to the BIG goal and how to get there and let it be accomplished, the anti-climax happened straight after the conclusion of the BIG goal. LA didn't know how to feel about it....satisfied?...but wanted more?...is probably the best way to say it.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine, is most definitely an anime you NEED to watch more than 4 episodes before casting your vote in as to what you think about it, all due it's fragmented storytelling along with it's many many MANY plot twists that goes along with it makes it a rather hard anime to pin down whether it was good or not. Hell as LA said it took LA 10 out of the 12 episodes before LA could tell and from LA's perspective, Occultic;Nine is a decent anime overall for LA, having the plot twists handy to get you re-invested towards what the hell is going on and thinking about the suspension of disbelief \"theories\" and either accepting it or not and sure many people might get heavily disappointed or annoyed by it's frantic pacing, lacking character development and the more obvious response of \"what the f- is going on?\", but seriously, LA will say this, if your gonna watch Occultic;Nine, it's definitely one of those animes that you need to keep your investments in check as the reward in staying and not passing judgement to an anime soo quickly, might bring great satisfying rewards later on and that was what LA got, not so much from the ending as it still left questions after it's resolution but the rest of them makes for an interesting anime nonetheless. Not the best from the Science Adventure series LA has seen, but an interesting confusingly fragmented as all hell narrative with a crazy cast of character in an even crazier \"take it or leave it\" suspension of disbelief and some decent production values to go along with it.",

In that case, \r\ndon't watch this show and watch something else.\r\nOkay, if you cannot catch onto details quickly, this show will SHOVE ITS ASS UP YOUR FACE. If you don't want to be extremely confused, watch it with a friend or don't watch it at all(or go on reddit).\r\nThe show has some problems with pacing. It's paced quickly, which is a problem to some people. However, the pacing eventually slows down so that you can actually pay attention.\r\n(By the way, forthat one reviewer that says that \"the first episode adapted 200 pages, so it's terrible, you're dearly wrong. First of all, the first light novel did NOTHING except establish characters.Who wants 2 episodes of NOTHING? Plus, the first episode skipped some material. STOP LISTENING TO WHAT OTHERS THINK AND READ THE LN.)\\n\\n\r\nOk, let's begin the review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story was great. It had a lot of potential. The pacing ruined it a bit, but it still was a great story. The characters interacted a lot. The events of the story make sense and the twists are completely random. If you love a good mystery anime, watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and character designs in this anime are wonderful. The character designs by Pako are unique, stylish and represent the characters of the show. The animation is fluid and aims to get your attention. Its unique shots make you either get grossed out or you get a earful of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nOk, the main complaint of the art that people have is that Ryo-tas has GIANT BOOBS. Okay, no. First of all, the light novel did this, so don't blame the anime. Second, what is wrong with having big boobs. You people make it seem terrible to have big breasts. Just stop.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the art is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great. They add music to dialouge and that makes those long talking scenes more interesting. The music is creepy, mysterious and really sets the mood. However, sometimes they use the same soundtrack over and over again, so that's why it's a 9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nOk, this is the low-point of the series. The characters are not well-developed, except for the main protag and his sidekick, Ryo-tas. If they integrated the character's backstory into the anime then it would be much better. Don't expect any \"great\" characters in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nThis series was very enjoyable. It was fun to make theories and see if they were true or not. I loved making theories and testing them out. The pacing was bad, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis show was good. It had pacing issues, but if you can handle that, it's a show to watch.",

            "content": "Occultic Nine is another dark anime involving mind bending story and so to say, mind bending timeline. You need to pay really big attention with the timeline, especially when the DATE appearing on the screen (3rd of March is the main date where everything is start happening).\r\nOk, back again to the topic. Honestly, the concept of the story is really great, mystery keep happening the entire series and I always have this feeling of want to know what gonna happen on the next episode with STRONG curiosity.\r\nThe only hard time I have finishing the series is catching up with the SCREENWRITING. Yes, the screenwriting...if youdon't know what is screenwriting, in short it is the dialogue. I am not a native Japanese and I DON'T like watching dubbed anime so I have quite hard time following the barrage of the subtitle while trying to catch up with what's exactly going on. It seems like the series cramped screenwriting of 24 Episode series into 12 Episodes series. EVERYBODY talk WAAYYYYY too fast and I feel like watching the anime on a rollercoaster. Seriously...it's a high speed train, the paces can feel like out of hand, some episode was feels really fast that I don't even feel ...\"What? Did I just finish a 20 Min worth of Episode...what?\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first time I met this kind of story so I could say that it's kinda original and fresh. I love it from the bottom of my heart but since this rollercoaster series going full speed from the start up to the very last episode but BOOM! the last episode was stopping in a FULL BREAK and I feel like ...errghh,,,what's the term of it..ah! yeah right! I feel like WHIP LASHED! That's the perfect word. Imagine you ride a rollercoaster and then suddenly its stop after running 100km/h. No no no, not that I don't like the ending (or so I wish it have a better ending but it doesn't) The way the story closed looks like it will have 2nd season or something so yeah...it is a bit hanging. So in summary, Occultic Nine leave me WHIP LASHED HANGING *lmao *cry\\n\\n\r\nThe art & animation? Always love Studio A1 and I will say EVERYTHING is IDENTICAL with SHELTER (that MV of Porter Robinson song) except that SHELTER have much better animation detail but that doesn't mean Occultic Nine not good, in fact thumbs up with the art, I enjoyed it so much (Just try to adapt with those nose drawings, it's a tad odd but yeah..it is odd). It is exactly like SHELTER but with far darker ambience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. The entire series is filled with tons of type of character (except lollicon and tsundere) and all of them coming from different background, not knowing each other and then one by one introduced to each other through a perfect chain of events and all great. Secret after secret, mystery after mystery, why after why revealed one by one and connected to each other finishing the puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I would suggest is try to open your mind to the logic, flip your head a bit because this series is good in term of mind bending. It is filled with rationally impossible theories (something beyond science yet the entire series is close to science) so I would say Occultic Nine is involving Sci-Fi genres in the process.\\n\\n\r\nI am excited the entire series due to the lively ambience combo Ryotas and Gamotan and I enjoy the rollercoaster. I like the theme song and the soundtrack as well, it is not boring by any means. I found Occultic Nine pretty similar with Durarara in a lot of ways with ADDITIONAL SPEED and MIND BENDING SCI-FI.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I think Occultic;Nine is one of the most underrated anime of this season. \r\nAfter the first disastrous episode, most of the people dropped it and said that was a great mess, considering his older brother Steins;Gate,made by the same creator...but I think they were only hasty conclusions. This series have a lot of potential,even considering its defects.\r\nStory 7/10 :\r\nOne of the most interesting things of this work, with its fast-paced rythm and brilliant developement,that will blow your mind in each episode. Too bad for the reduced amount of episodes, which didn't allow the plot to develop...and felt that was a bit too rushed. Also,the firstepisode, which has summed up an entire novel in only 25 minutes(more or less), didn't introduced the characters well and made the entire plot really confused since his first steps. OC;9 is like a puzzle: we collect each piece,episode by episode, until we get to the ending, which leaves us all with a permanent doubt, even if all the mysteries were solved.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 :\\n\\n\r\nSimply magnificent, as I expected from the director of Shigatsu Wa Kimi no Uso, which had a great art direction, such as this series. It makes you enjoy and live every single moment with its colourful graphics and innovative shots, the major quality of Occultic;Nine. Every single scenario is original and well detailed, resulting a real treat for the eyes. And here, nothing else to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a drug. Even if I'm writing a review and I have to concentrate, it continues to ring out in my mind. Kanako Ito confirms herself as a great singer, with her enchanting and clean voice, that makes this song more beatiful. The ending is also great, which is made by Asaka, a young singer(only 17 years old) in her first work...hope she will do more songs. Then, I think the soundtrack is good...it accompanies every single moment brilliantly and creates a nice atmosphere, a priority in this type of anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode introduced them badly, and even in the last steps some members of the crew suffered the poor characterization. This problem wouldn't exist if there were more episodes(24,for example)...you can't introduce 9 important characters in half an hour...what a crazy choice! Hower, I admit that their design is attractive and they interact very well with each other during the course of the series. Ryoutasu remains the best with her lively and irreverent nature, but also Gamon does his figure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 :\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. The episodes are well structured and the plot makes this journey more interesting,together with the great art direction. It was a really pleasure to follow it, my confidence has been rewarded. The only problem is always the same, and I'll repeat it ad nauseam: the episodes were too few!\\n\\n\r\nConcluding my review,I would like to give you an advice: don't trust the ridiculous score, this is a worth watching anime, especially if you love mysteries and mind-blowing plots.",

It's a really interesting style and there are a lot of interesting shots.\r\nThe characters were also well done and developed, though the way they designed Ryouka's character is rather... questionable. The rest of the characters all look great though.\r\nThe story is by far the most interesting part of the show. It's a mystery with a bit of a thriller-aspect to it (like the SciAdv series by the same author), and I personally found it very engaging. I would say that the pacingis slightly off in some parts; the last episode in particular had way too much going on in it.\\n\\n\r\nFor me though, the greatest issue I had with this entire show was the speed of the dialogue. I'm sure if I was fluent in Japanese, this show would be a point higher for me, but since I'm not, the speed at which they talk sometimes leaves you having to rewind, pause, and then read the subtitles again. Maybe I'm just not a fast enough reader, but anyways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a pretty engaging show if you don't drop it after the first few episodes because of the pacing and the speed of the talking.",

Drawings on faces, thematic color palette etc. It was unique (apart from a pair of huge bewbs). \r\n**Sound**\r\nNot a mess, andnot unique either (6). I began to think some guy is up and creating OSTs for modern anime series. They all sound like some particular one person. I will not remember any of OSTs from this show. Even Chaos;Head's tense OST was good.\\n\\n\r\n**Characters/CD**\\n\r\nDUDE, WHAT THE HELL! It was a mess, really. You can see those guys in every series. Starring;\\n\\n\r\n - Mr NEET Talker (Gamon Yuuta)\\n\r\n - That Girl You Know Loving Cats (Aikawa Miyuu)\\n\r\n - Mrs. Silence (Kurenaino Aria)\\n\r\n - The Guy Who is Fun At Parties (Hashigami Sarai)\\n\r\n - Party Pooper (Moritsuka Shun) (Seriously, this guy appears INTO every conversation)\\n\r\n - My Ulti is My Bewbs (Narusawa Ryouka)\\n\r\n - I Drew You All Bitchez (Nishizono Ririka)\\n\r\n - Ascention (Sumikaze Touko)\\n\r\n - LGBTi At The Same Time (Izumi Houhei)\\n\r\n - I Use My Power and Wait 4 Cooldown (Kisaki Asuna)\\n\\n\r\nCD awards:\\n\\n\r\nThe Most Original Character: 404 Not Found\\n\r\nThe Most Annoying Character: Narusawa Ririka\\n\r\nThe Coolest Character: Well...\\n\r\nThe Most Hopeless Character: Aikawa Miyuu\\n\\n\r\nWhich is, character development is shit in this show.\\n\\n\r\n**Enjoyment**\\n\r\nGood (7). Why? Because I could not find any other better shit in this season.\\n\\n\r\n**Overall**\\n\r\nGood (7). Yes, the show was down, but they tried to fix something up on process. They slowed the pace down in middle episodes. They show'd another characteristic of Narusawa just to say \"Hey, we are trying.\". So, yeah.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, it is just waste of tiem.",

            "content": "Occultic nine...i asked my self why this anime had this name,but till the last episodes you don't get the meaning behind that name,is it a bad thing? No of course not.\r\nHowever Occultic nine didn't impress me that much and now i will tell you why.\r\nThe story is centered around events that have as first topic the occult and paranormal.\r\nOur protagonist Gamon Yuuta tries to make profit out of those events by running a blog on the internet,where oftenly he makes fun of those facts.\r\nHe appears as a classic nerd and aside of his partner Ryouka Narusawa,he doesn't really have friends,he spends most of the timeinside a caf\u00e8 called Blue Moon,ran by a strange man called Kouhei Izumi.\\n\r\nBut one day Yuuta will get caught inside a nasty situation,and from that point the whole story will start.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much the initial plot without any spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk on how the story will develop without any spoiler,i will explain it in a 'technically' way.\\n\r\nFirst of all the first episodes are very fast paced and i had a really terrible time to keep track of what's going on,till a point where i thought to just drop the anime.\\n\r\nBut i'm glad i didn't,i saw some people giving this anime a 2 or a 10,and i think that's wrong.\\n\r\nThere's a lot of good things in this anime as much as bad things,however now back to the story.\\n\r\nThe start felt very rushed and until the half of the anime you don't really get the idea of where the story is going,it's filled with a lot of mystery and i wanted to see what's really behind it,but i ended up getting a little disappointed on that,because i had a lot of answers but most of them weren't answered,the story has some really INTERESTING plot twists and it really surprised me how things turned out,and the best episodes are where this plot twists happen.\\n\r\nI am confident that i'm a really smart person and i didn't see that coming,even if i noticed something was off.\\n\r\nBut after that everything takes another turn of events and becomes a little clich\u00e8,and loses all those points it acquired with the previous twist. But aside of that i think the story is well thought and if i happen to find the novel i will certainly read it.\\n\\n\r\nYes i didn't read the novel.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some Steins gate references which made me think that it's in the same univerve and there's a connection somehow between the two series. \\n\r\nI am a big fan of Steins gate so that's another positive point from me.\\n\\n\r\nAlso i'm a big fan of horror and this anime even if not labelled as,it has definetly some traits and moments of horror,which are like the strawberry on top of the cake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the staff.\\n\r\nThe characters are what i liked the most,they aren't that much ''all round'' and they feel like they're the usual clich\u00e8 group characters:\\n\r\nThe hero,the one who doesn't believe anything,the calm one,the busty  girl,the creepy girl and super creepy girl,and the charismatic one,and the cute one.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where i felt splitted in two halfs,the characters are good and interesting but they're not used very well,let me explain what i mean:\\n\r\nThere are some characters that appear too much and others that need more screen time,and no don't tell me that it's because they're secondary characters.\\n\r\nIf you look the character page for this anime,you'll see that those i mean now are all main characters,not supporting,not secondary,but main.\\n\r\nAnd by clinching what i said before there's a lot of mystery surrounding these characters,but most of the answers you will have about them,won't get answered.\\n\r\nJust like the characters,there are some things that are explained too very well and other things that aren't explained at all.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sound;\\n\r\nThe sound effects are very good and well placed but the soundtracks and music sometimes felt out of place.\\n\r\nAbout the graphic;\\n\r\nAnimations are somewhat decent,the characters sometimes look weird but i think they're meant to look that way\\n\r\nOther things:\\n\r\nSomething that i didn't mention is the show is all about occult but in the end it loses all that fog of occult it has and drops down to some sort of sci-fi,it's not a problem but the gap between those two things doesn't feel really well separated.\\n\\n\r\nConclusions:\\n\r\nThe anime despite what others might say it's enjoyable,but the beginning sadly is really awful,too fast paced and confusing,but it will pay off in the end. If you like mystery,sci-fi with a slice of horror and detective story. This is your anime,but don't get too caught because you might end up disappointed by the lack of explanations.\\n\\n\r\nPro and Cons\\n\r\n+Nice story with a great plot twist\\n\r\n+Very nice cast...\\n\r\n+Good sound effects\\n\r\n+A nice slice of horror and mystery\\n\r\n-Too short\\n\r\n-...but not used very well\\n\r\n-Awful beginning \\n\r\n-Last episode isn't that great along with ending\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Reposting after original review was taken down*\r\nOk I'll do everyone a favour and say that if you are a slow reader or if you don't like fast paced shows, DO NOT WATCH OCCULTIC;NINE. THIS SHOW DOES NOT GIVE A DAMN WHETHER YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING.\r\n*ahem*\r\nIf I were to describe Occultic;Nine in one word, it would be \"convoluted\". And don't get me wrong, for me that's not really a bad thing. It's just that there are so many things going on that it is VERY easy to get confused while watching it, the lightning fast pacing didn't help either. While this threw offa lot of people on it\u2019s first episode, making them drop the show, it actually intrigued me with it\u2019s complex storytelling and mystery aspect.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, O;9 is convoluted in terms of storytelling and that\u2019s basically because of the fact that the story (especially in the first half of the show) keeps introducing plot point after plot point after plot point. This makes the show seems really mysterious and makes you want to know what happens next and how all these things being introduced are connected with each other buuuuut the downside to this is that it leaves the story very messy and it leaves very little time for the show to explain the mysteries set up in previous episodes. Like I'm pretty sure that the main mysteries and plot points were only started being cleared up/explained in episode 8-9 and forward, leaving only 3 episodes or so to conclude everything. AND IT BARELY SUCCEEDS by rushing everything into those last few episodes. This brings me to my next major problem with the show, the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nI think Occultic;Nine has the most inconsistence pacing of any show I've watched. One episode it's extremely fast, next it's continuing at a more bearable but still fast speed, then it returns to it's original extreme speed, then it starts to slow down to a \"normal\" speed over a few episodes and eventually just doesn't care anymore and becomes like 5x times faster than it was at the start (ok that might be an exaggeration but you get what I mean). The plot's already difficult to understand by itself but O;9's fast pacing just brings a whole level of difficulty. You'll more often than not find yourself having to pausing and rewinding some episodes to re-read some lines of dialogue or exposition you missed or just couldn't understand. \\n\\n\r\nYou could just tell that the staff behind the show knew that they couldn't possibly fit the entire story properly into 12 episodes, so they decided to just cram in as much as they could into certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite how much I criticised the introduction of many plot points and the pacing, I still have give props to the story for exploring the occult from a scientific perspective. The sci-fi aspect was definitely well written and for the most part believable and was certainly quite interesting. There were some aspects of the sci-fi element that weren't explained well enough but I understand the show was tight with screen time so the staff couldn't but as long as you have a basic understanding of the scientific mechanics in this show, you'll probably won't mind.\\n\\n\r\n6.5-7/10, for the story i guess, but would've given an 8/10 for the actual plot if I looked past the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe overall aesthetic of the show is gorgeous, to say the least. I actually would\u2019ve never expected this type of art style from A-1 Pictures, maybe from SHAFT but never A-1. I loved the weird camera angles, lighting effects, character designs (except for the walking breasts) and especially the backgrounds. The artwork is colourful, imaginative and can be very disturbing when it needs to be. My only main complaints would be the messy line art, which isn\u2019t really that noticeable anyways and the way the character\u2019s noses are drawn. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, it\u2019s pretty good. The voice acting isn\u2019t really anything special, most of the voice actors fit their characters, except Ryotas\u2019 voice, I just find it really annoying for some reason. And can I just applaud some of the voice actor\u2019s for being able to talk so fast, like goddamn.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is amazing as expected of Kanako Itou &lt;3 and the ending song is great as well. The background music is less notable. There are some instances where the BGM does not match the mood with what's happening on screen, for example there might be an upbeat rock track playing over an emotional or messed up scene *coughcoughepisode1&amp;12coughcough*. But there's also other times where the BGM and sound effects really excels in matching and adding to the atmosphere of a scene *coughcoughepisode9*. The show's quite polarising with the effectiveness of the sound.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10 for the art\\n\r\n7-ish/10 for the sound\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs many of you would\u2019ve figured out just from the title, Occultic;NINE, features NINE protagonists, each with their own unique design and personalities. O;N\u2019s cast personalities is like a spectrum ranging from the abnormally hyperactive to the enigmatically creepy, you\u2019re probably gonna hate some and love some.\\n\\n\r\nMy main issue with the characters are that some of them just fail to make a presence in the show and are extremely forgettable because they don't get enough screen time and unfortunately that was the case for Kusakabe, Aria and Ririka (and that one albino kid lol). Yeah, they look interesting and all that and probably have more to them than just being creepy and mysterious but the show doesn't ever explore that other side to them enough to ever make you care about or remember them. They were relevant for like 2 or 3 things for the plot and then were just complete brushed aside. Again, this was the consequence of trying to fit a story that could easily cover 20+ episodes into 12 episodes instead, something had to be sacrificed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main group of MCs (Gamon, Ryouka, Sarai, Miyuu and Touko), they all received at least decent development so I had some emotional attachment to them but sometimes their interactions can be so hyper and high-strung it might make them annoying to watch instead.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 for Characters\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nbasically a tl;dr-\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine is a show with pretty visuals, a mysterious atmosphere and an interesting plot that leaves you wanting to know what happens next every episode but the show's abnormal pacing and it's 1-cour airing time ultimately leads to it being very rushed in certain episodes. Combine the pacing with rapid-fire dialogue and some exposition dumps and you'll be left with a very hard-to-follow show. Also as a result of the pacing, the show has to sacrifice precious screen time, that could've been used for developing characters or explaining certain sci-fi mechanics, so that it could just barely fit the entirety of the plot into 12 episodes. (but honestly it's a feat itself that A-1 could even fit everything). \\n\\n\r\nO;9 is a very hit or miss show but if you do decide to watch it, then I recommend watching up to episode 3 before deciding to continue or drop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 7.2/10\\n\\n\r\nAnyways thanks for reading this review and hope it wasn't too painful to read lol. \\n\r\nPeace out!",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe semicolon gets a bad rap.\r\nMost day-to-day people never use them in today\u2019s world of simplified, text-driven messages. They also look a little funky. (I mean, let\u2019s be honest, a period on top of a comma? Get out of here.) Even Kurt Vonnegut, the beloved and creative author of stories such as Cat\u2019s Cradle, is quoted as saying (with hyperbole and slightly out of context), \u201cAll they do is show you\u2019ve been to college.\u201d\r\nHe later goes on to say about his rule of never using them that \u201cRules only take us so far, even goodones.\u201d With this thought in mind, I\u2019ll provide the rule that I was taught which made me into a semicolon expert: Semicolons connect equal grammatical units. To go even simpler, think of the semicolon as an equals sign. That\u2019s it. So long as one remembers this rule, the semicolon should be yet another tool in thy writer\u2019s arsenal.\\n\\n\r\nI like semicolons; they\u2019re very fun to use. I don\u2019t like Occultic;Nine; its semicolon doesn\u2019t do it for me.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine follows Gamon, a NEET, blog-running high-school teenager who wants to gain money through trouncing the ghostly and the magical. His \u201cminion,\u201d Ryo-tas, dances whimsically nearby. And, when a mysterious murder drags him and others into a series of strange events, his life becomes an unexpectedly, otherworldly predicament.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough \u201cbecomes\u201d may be the wrong phrase. \u201cCareens towards\u201d is more fitting since the anime makes it its mission to go full-throttle from the get-go.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode blazes past the audience so quickly, it makes them wonder if they actually saw anything at all. It crams characters and events and premises and concepts and more characters and ideas and content and even more characters into a single episode. About as much as it could conceivably handle in twenty-some minutes. While it arguably leaves a negative first impression since proper pacing has essentially been stomped into the ground, the onslaught of information does pique one\u2019s interest.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s just the start, for the anime doesn\u2019t. Slow. Down.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining episodes do not reach the breakneck speed of the opener, but they follow the same negative charge. Explanations on pseudoscience throw jargon together. Connections between events flail about with flimsy relevance. Plot points refuse to rest long enough to earn their appreciation.\\n\\n\r\nThe most abrasive example is the characters and their conversations. They don\u2019t speak so fast that it\u2019s impossible to follow along with what they are saying, but they talk just fast enough to make their delivery and responses seem unnatural. Listen to the men of the Society of Eight Gods of Fortune cult. Either their lines are recorded on a tape recorder and slightly sped up or they are all robots with inhuman reactions. Their talks, especially when the blue-suit man gets involved, don\u2019t wait for anybody.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say that a speedy presentation is inherently bad. It\u2019s not. But, in Occultic;Nine\u2019s case, the speed not only adds an extra layer of unnecessary confusion but also fails to serve a higher purpose. That is, it\u2019s fast for the sake of being fast and not much else.\\n\\n\r\nOne can argue that the overly quick presentation does, in fact, hold a thematic purpose. Gamon and the others become astral bodies. As is explained, their ghostly forms exist in a realm where time moves at an increased rate (one day equals one minute to be precise). Sadly, this quickness not only (obviously) exists within the first episode but also in every episode \u2013 including those when they were still alive. Plus, there\u2019s that Fortune cult that houses not ghosts but rich dudes. In other words, the anime was unnecessarily quick regardless of the context, rendering this argument moot.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the content more closely, Occultic;Nine is essentially a twelve-episode exposition dump. It has the occasional tooth pull here or evil-caf\u00e9-owner skirmish there, but the show prioritizes the characters explaining their situation and what to do next at almost every turn. Even during the albino child\u2019s coercion of Myuu, which should be a tense scene, the show falls back on him talking and talking and talking before a scuffle finally breaks out.\\n\\n\r\nThe albino child\u2019s conflict also brings to light yet another problem for Occultic;Nine: bogus plotlines. Him and his kotoribakos? He sits in jail, and his boxes continue to rot. The female-doujin author? She draws a bunch intermittently throughout the season, but, in the end, she literally vanishes without doing anything. Gamon \u201closing\u201d the golden tooth-key? Just materialize it out of nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nMany events also tread into \u201cjust so happens\u201d territory. Nikola Tesla \u201cjust so happens\u201d to have an illegitimate daughter. Kiryuu, Aria\u2019s \u201cdevil,\u201d needed surgery to save his brain, and it \u201cjust so happens\u201d that Aria\u2019s brother died the same day. Kisaki, a female police officer with psychometry who shows up after half the season is over, \u201cjust so happens\u201d to enter a taxi whose driver is friends with the former proprietor of the caf\u00e9 where the gang all hang out.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, to be fair, maybe that\u2019s the point. That, like the occult, the audience must accept certain happenings as less magical and more coincidental. Unfortunately for Occultic;Nine, the show itself is not a ghostly figure. Rather, it\u2019s a real anime with real writing and real story beats that have real problems in their narrative construction.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine does introduce the concept of living. I.e., whether the physical body or the spiritual entity constitutes a state of self. However, it doesn\u2019t exactly challenge the idea. For its less about this philosophical pondering and more about the properties of scandium.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does end on a surprisingly bittersweet, possibly dark note, and it even alludes to there being more to this story than lets on thanks to an after-credits scene. But, having reached the finale and finally stopping, the show still finishes in last place despite how fast it moved.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine\u2019s obsession with speed turns into obsession of a different kind with its art and its animation. Unlike the quick presentation and the abundant exposition, though, its obsession with style stands as a positive.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s actual animation remains consistent in quality, but its higher claim to fame comes in its artistry. For its backgrounds and locales, the show adopts an interesting look centered on overly realistic depictions. A caf\u00e9 filled with mood lighting, extra tables, and a full-service bar. An office space packed with messy desks and doodads. The radio station and its technology.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime evidently goes out of its way to make the setting much more real in its delivery. Its character designs do the same. Granted, Ryo-tas\u2019s comically large, mountain-sized breasts and some of their half-drawn circle noses argue that, no, their designs move away from realism.\\n\\n\r\nBut their subtle details mixed with their plainness keep them grounded. Shun\u2019s overcoat uses a striped pattern. Touko wears glasses, she puts her hair in a ponytail while separating her bangs, and her clothes\u2019 collar has this ornate design with an added ribbon. Aria wears a fur-lined red shawl with a brown blouse underneath, and her wooden platform shoes and leg tights are likewise colored red and brown, one color for each side.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine also employs other oddities for their designs. A lot of extra creases in their clothes and contours for their faces add differing degrees of shadow that make their looks both pop and emit more of that realism.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting oddity, though, is the line work. While not scribbled, the outlines for the characters can sometimes be (using a clich\u00e9 in a literal sense) rough around the edges. It\u2019s only slightly, but these lines can have a noticeable jaggedness, a lack of rigidity in their formation. This aesthetic once again adds to the realism since the roughness helps them to mix with the hyper-realistic background art.\\n\\n\r\nThis drive for realism lends itself well to the anime\u2019s main motif. In other words, while the characters are unsure of what\u2019s actually happened and what\u2019s in fact make-believe, Occultic;Nine paints itself as realistic as possible while still maintaining its own style.\\n\\n\r\nYet the anime\u2019s strongest visual element has yet to be brought up. Arguably, it\u2019s the show\u2019s best trait period. This trait? Cinematic flair.\\n\\n\r\nJust as Occultic;Nine obsesses over its backgrounds and design details, it also obsesses over how many different techniques it can incorporate throughout its run. For instance, it loves to play with the angle of its shots. From crooked to birds-eye, from looking up to completely sideways, the anime constantly flips around its camera to its liking.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s easy, though. Indeed, the anime goes much further with its techniques. Take episode ten. As Ryo-tas reveals her identity to Gamon, her head gets huge, taking up the whole left side of the screen as Gamon remains regularly sized on the right, imposing a sense of intimidation. Or take episode six. As Shun questions Aria at her residence, the camera spins and spins until Shun chooses to spook the audience after moving a lot closer towards the screen on the final rotation.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the coolest moves, though, comes from episode nine. Myuu receives a message from the friend who she thought died, so she rushes to the location. Once there, a secret tunnel opens, and she heads down it. At this point, the anime takes on a first-person perspective. Myuu steadily moves down the hallway as she (and the audience) look around at the green, concrete walls, the creepy lighting illuminating her path. (Her heavy breathing and the spooky sounds up the scariness.)\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s still an all-important question that needs answering: Why? Why does Occultic;Nine go overboard with its cinematic techniques? Yes, they are no doubt interesting, but what purpose does angling the shot or spinning the camera serve in this instance?\\n\\n\r\nIt all comes from the content of the show itself. Namely, the gross amount of exposition. With the characters doing nothing but holding conversations, the anime is inherently forced to use excessive cinematic flair to mask the dullness permeating their talks.\\n\\n\r\nThis flair certainly impresses, but, at times, it can be distracting. All the flipping and the perspectives and the orientations nearly detract from the story as the show places more and more focus on the presentation and less and less focus on what\u2019s actually being presented.\\n\\n\r\nThus, like the overall physical-versus-spiritual motif, the anime enters a paradox. The distracting cinematic direction gets in the way of the boring exposition, but the boring exposition requires the distracting cinematic direction.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, this distraction is a welcome one since the content is often in dire straits. Plus, given that the anime at least goes this route, does all that it can to make its visuals as engaging an experience as possible, it deserves praise first and foremost.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine involves roughly seven main players from the 256 Incident: Sarai, Touko, Aria, Kisaki, Shun, Gamon, and Ryo-tas. Unfortunately, the anime\u2019s penchant for speed negatively affects the importance and the impact of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Sarai is the son of Professor Hashigami. Genetically, it makes sense that he\u2019s a smart kid. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s most of his character. He happens to have esoteric knowledge which he uses at nearly every convenient moment. From solving the secret codes attached to the victim\u2019s names to explaining the warping of time between the physical and spiritual realms, he exists within the show not as a vital actor but rather as a crux that the story needed. Lest it proceed nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nTouko is arguably worse. Where Sarai at least contributes his smarts, she contributes almost nothing. The anime doesn\u2019t go into her background, and she sits about, occasionally chiming in to remind the audience of her presence. In essence, she could be removed from Occultic;Nine altogether without affecting the story to any noticeable extent.\\n\\n\r\nAria receives a lot of attention early on. Indeed, half of episode two dedicates itself to showcasing her backstory. The bullying and creepiness she endured, and the older brother who supported her wholeheartedly. Most importantly, it also highlights her psychosis in how she, unbeknownst to her, lived with her deceased sibling\u2019s corpse for an entire year.\\n\\n\r\nAs the season moves forward, however, the audience sees less and less of Aria as she becomes increasingly irrelevant. While Gamon and the others discuss what\u2019s really going on, Aria sits in her dark room, mumbling about her brother and failing to have a stake in the narrative. Come the end, she doesn\u2019t get shot by the ray gun, meaning she remains a spirit with her \u201cbrother,\u201d but it only reinforces the notion that she is inconsequential to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAria went through a lot of trauma in the past, and Myuu goes through a lot herself in the present. She becomes incredibly depressed after learning that the evil albino kid murdered her good friend. Her conflict, though, doesn\u2019t have the emotional weight needed since the relationship with said friend was given as a quick set of scenes involving head pats, blurry pictures, and birds.\\n\\n\r\nKisaki arrives rather late into the season (officially in episode seven) as Shun\u2019s replacement. She\u2019s technically not as important of a character as the others, but Occultic;Nine fumbles with her as well. She receives one meager flashback that lasts no more than several seconds, showcasing the ridicule from those around her and highlighting the reason why she has feelings for Shun in the first place (since he was apparently the only one to be kind to her).\\n\\n\r\nFor Shun himself, he likewise doesn\u2019t have much going for him. Again, he\u2019s not as important as someone like Gamon or Ryo-tas, so it\u2019s not necessary to give him a grand character arc or a dramatic backstory. Indeed, he\u2019s one of the only characters who is adequately balanced in terms of importance and impact in that he actively takes part in seeking out clues and piecing this puzzle together while avoiding unnecessary attempts to flesh him out.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Gamon and Ryo-tas, they don\u2019t have the right execution befitting their characters.\\n\\n\r\nGamon is a self-proclaimed anti-social blogger who simply wants to make money. He gets roped into all these events, succumbing to fits of paranoia, fear, and confusion. He tries to make sense of the situation, but, the more he learns, the more he falls back into those three feelings \u2013 again and again.\\n\\n\r\nConsequently, Gamon, despite his main-protagonist moniker, floats along for most of the season, lamenting the position he never asked for let alone wanted. As such, he\u2019s not a very interesting character, and the audience cannot even call him the lens with which they view this world since many of the other characters manage to unveil more than he ever did or could.\\n\\n\r\nHe at least has a redeeming moment near the end of the season. The cast want to go back to being alive, but they also need to foil the Fortune cult\u2019s plans. Gamon volunteers to risk his (physical) life, opting to perform the final act and saving the others in the process. That is, he overcomes his paranoia and fear and confusion through the bravest feat imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nRyo-tas is, in comparison, weirdly hyper all the time. She also carries a curious gun that seems like it comes right out of an old-timey alien movie. Alongside hints that she is perhaps hiding something, the audience questions this fa\u00e7ade she appears to be putting on. Indeed, the anime later reveals who she really is: \u201cMy true identity is the astral body possessing Ryoka Narusawa\u2019s body, Aveline Narusawa Tesla.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis reveal isn\u2019t super game-changing since there wasn\u2019t much to build up to it on a narrative level. Even afterwards, it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference. She also does a whole lot of nothing throughout the season besides impersonating Ryoka. To her credit, she at least guided Gamon by also pretending to be someone named Zoko, the voice from Gamon\u2019s hand radio. So, she wasn\u2019t as worthless as some of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nBetween the lot, a possible throughput on fathers exists. Gamon\u2019s backstory involves his father, Sarai\u2019s father\u2019s death starts the whole debacle, Myuu pleads to her father when called out on her fortune-telling powers, and Ryo-tas\u2019s father is the famous Nikola Tesla whose theory forms the basis for the supernatural occurrences.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the anime not only doesn\u2019t have this throughput for all its major characters (Touko, Aria, Kisaki, and Shun have nothing specifically about fathers) but also doesn\u2019t try to explore this connection further. Gamon\u2019s radio and his childhood revolve around his father, but it\u2019s never a pivotal character trait. Sarai somewhat comes to terms with his father\u2019s choices, but a clear resolution does not come about. Myuu never mentions her father again. And Ryo-tas (i.e., Aveline) isn\u2019t given any flashbacks with Nikola.\\n\\n\r\nThus far, the characters of Occultic;Nine have been overwhelmingly subpar. That\u2019s not wholly their fault, for they are at the mercy of the story. Since the plot requires so much extra information and involves a lot of content without much substance, they lack the attention and therefore strength that they arguably deserve.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these woes, the anime at least gives them all a higher role to serve.\\n\\n\r\nSarai voices dissent. He continually tries to view their situation from a logical standpoint rather than outright accepting that their predicament derives from otherworldly sources.\\n\\n\r\nTouko is the normal one of the group. She\u2019s not the smartypants, the black-magic girl, the fortune teller, the psychometry user, the detective, the otaku, or the seventy-year-old astral spirit. She normalizes the group given how quirky the rest tend to be.\\n\\n\r\nAria represents the accepter of their situation. Where the others wish to come back to life, she\u2019s perfectly content with remaining on the spiritual side. An ending she receives since Gamon (presumably) never shot her with the special ray gun.\\n\\n\r\nMyuu gets the unfortunate position of \u201cit can happen to anybody.\u201d Someone as kind and as famous as her, with foresight powers too, receives the same treatment as the others.\\n\\n\r\nKisaki\u2019s convenient psychic ability enables her to follow the trail left by the others as they themselves try to fix their predicament.\\n\\n\r\nShun acts as the revealer. When the audience wonders about certain events or directions, he manages to find the info through his investigation skills.\\n\\n\r\nGamon demonstrates how most regular people would react if placed in the same spot. Yanking teeth, getting attacked by a gargoyle demon, seeing one\u2019s own dead body. His emotions may make him a nonexistent player for most of the tale, but they are justified.\\n\\n\r\nRyo-tas distracts the audience from the truth (through her strange behavior), provides a connection (however feeble) to the Fortune-cult plotline, and guides the rest of the cast along (but really mostly Gamon).\\n\\n\r\nThis character writing is arguably common, maybe even expected, for a show aiming at mixing together a large cast. But, given how the characters are meager at best and forgetful at worst, their personalized roles within the story at large earns them all a stronger sense of place within Occultic;Nine. A much-needed writing buff that keeps them from the depths of complete character catastrophe.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nDespite how loud the characters tend to be, the voice actors and actresses performing those roles nail them. Yuki Kaji as Gamon screams and cries without shame. Ayane Sakura as Ryo-tas speaks with a high-pitched voice as she ribbits, and she switches into peeved speech when giving orders (under disguise) to Gamon himself. And Kenjirou Tsuda as Kouhei Izumi, the caf\u00e9 owner and the unknown villain, uses an effeminate voice that fits the flamboyant murderer quite well. (An extra shout-out goes to Shizuka Itou as Touko for her \u201cAscension\u2026\u201d reaction.)\\n\\n\r\nListening to the opening track and the ending track, they come out about even.\\n\\n\r\nFor the ED, its tone has this hopeful yet melancholic sound that it blends together through strong singing, background vocals, and a charged techno foundation. The instrumentals and the beat itself are a bit uninspired, and the English lyrics don\u2019t always hit their mark (especially when they conveniently skip the number eight in their count). But its ability to sync up with the preview visuals, to give them a better sense of urgency, made for a small treat at the end of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nFor the OP, it gets at some spookiness as it starts with ominous echoes and a set of background vocalists all its own. The middle section is filled with cool guitar chords and a steady drum beat, but they aren\u2019t as powerful as the main vocalist and the off-kilter feeling. Its abrupt stop also gives it an edge since it fits the spooky approach.\\n\\n\r\nNeither the ED nor the OP stand out as very strong pieces, and the same goes for the rest of the music. It does have a lot of variety, though. Playful and jazzy. Energized and guitar-laden. Moderately paced and plucked. Violin and claps. Techno and more techno. Nothing major, but, just as the art aims for visual variety through its different techniques, the OST aims for musical mixing through its different pieces. Although these tracks lack the finesse that the techniques bring with ease.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI was liking the anime\u2019s dark atmosphere early on. The murder of Sarai\u2019s father and Aria\u2019s twisted lifestyle made for quite the grim setup. And the death of all the characters and the demented blood boxes (kotoribakos) shaded the atmosphere with even more darkness.\\n\\n\r\nYet these shadows couldn\u2019t stop me from constantly shaking my head.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are annoying. Gamon never stops yelling and being overly obnoxious in all that he does. Ryo-tas isn\u2019t being cute but instead aggravating in her ditzy behavior. Sarai refuses to accept all that\u2019s happening around him despite personally witnessing numerous pieces of evidence. Myuu walks herself into the most obvious trap possible. Aria and Touko just sit around.\\n\\n\r\nShun is perhaps the only character I tolerate. He at least tries to have fun and brings some spark to the anime that isn\u2019t bent on being annoying. But he wasn\u2019t always around, and he was semi-infallible (infallibility being a trait I absolutely loathe). So, he wasn\u2019t that welcomed, either.\\n\\n\r\nI also wasn\u2019t a fan of much of the story itself. The 256 Incident didn\u2019t make for involved drama. The whole mutual recognition plot convenience was very lame. The albino-kid plotline was pointless. Their conversations were generally dull, uneventful, or both. The Fortune cult was so disjointed from everything else, it didn\u2019t make for a compelling conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe things that I do like in the anime \u2013 Kisaki\u2019s \u201cscreenings\u201d of the thoughts she reads, the actual (loose) science backing the plot \u2013 are sadly quashed by the immense amount of annoying, boring, or otherwise grating material that this show so regularly offers.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine has visuals that deserve praise and music that passes. Unfortunately, the core of this tale contains more problems than its title can count. The narrative strings together as this wobbly, worthless mess. The characters, inevitably pulled along, don\u2019t have much impact beyond their singular roles. And the anime simply does almost nothing of interest for its entire run. The show drowns; it doesn\u2019t resurface.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, an overabundance of speed, exposition, and convenience leave the narrative gasping for breath when it eventually crosses the finish line\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, overly realistic background art, subtle stylistic choices for the character designs, and a wide array of cinematic techniques make for an engaging visual experience\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Gamon, Ryo-tas, and the other members of this large cast lack importance and impact throughout this tale, but they at least have particular roles to serve\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay OST, and good VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, too annoying and too uneventful\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "Uhg.... I actually regret watching this.\r\nThis anime looks as if someone tried to mix together durarara and stein's gate, but couldn't capture the spirit of either anime, and in the end failed miserably.\r\nThe main problem with this anime is that it is a non-stop information dump. Everybody talks at machinegun speed without ever having a break. There's barely any chance for voice actors to display emotion, and not enough time to let importance of some scenes to sink in. The plot device is fairly convoluted, the problem is that when you get past ridiulous explanation speed, and put the pieces together, the whole thing isa shallow tehnobabble with a few big names thrown in. Which effectively makes the whole thing disappointing. Add into the mix cheap plot devices made to \"shock\" the viewer, and you get an extremely shallow experience.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nQuite bad. The anime tries to follow durarara's way of storytelling, where perspectives switch often, and you eventually piece together the story from the scattered incidents presented from different perspective, but this time it doesn't really work. There's a very complicated \"reason\" behind the events of the show, however, when you piece the plot together (around 8..10 episode), it turns out to be a shallowly written technobabble with few big names thrown in, which is a huge disappointment. As I said, characters talk all the time, non stop, and there's barely a moment in the anime when someone isn't explaining something. This ruins the storytelling, because there's barely any time for voice actors to even take a breath, not to mention to expositions of some scenes, or letting some dramatic moment sink in. The story on occasion tries to throw shocking events at the viewer, but they fall flat and on occasion are completely unexplained (there's at least one gruesome scene that happens for no reason whatsoever).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is alright or on good side. It is lower detailed, but fluid modern anime style, similr to, for example, durarara. Meaning that the face is outlined with just a few lines, but not with so few details where it gets oversimplified (like in Mahouka). Animation is alright, when it happens, but there are a lot of talking scenes, it may be underutilized slightly. Some characters look nice visually, and there was at least one genuinely good looking scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharters:\\n\r\nDue to high speed of everyone talking, a lot of them barely have any window to display any personality at all. Protagonist (Yuta Gamon) has two nice moments, but everybody else despite few hints at their personality, resemble carton cutouts. Ryo-tas is genuinely annoying - I mean \"silly child like characters\" can be entertaining, but coupled with her massive, erm, \"assets\" in breast department she starts reminding me of Eiken characters. If that was their idea of what fanservice should be it clearly didn't work well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI feel like I wasted my time on this. Pacing is way too fast, and the story/puzzle behind the anime was a let down. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI think the best idea would be to skip this. Wath Durarara or Stein's Gate instead - those are much better.",

            "content": "Occultic;Nine was a show I never thought I would see.What really pulled me into watching it was the interesting character designs ,the awesome opening and wondering why everyone didn't like the show.While watching it , i understood why people didn't like it, but those reasons were different from the reason I enjoyed it.\r\nOccultic;Nine is really hard to explain, but from the title ,there are nine people and something is special about those nine people.At the beginning, there is a murder that happens but then around the middle of the show, a plot twist happens things start getting really confusing not only for the characters butalso for the audience. It got to a point in the show where I had no idea what was happening and around episode 11 i understood what was going on with these nine people until the very end of episode 12 that had the same problem I had with Plastic Memories.There was this one clip at that very end that made me scratch my head even more. The story is the weakest link of the anime by far since it entangles so many stories into one and rushes each other one to wrap up the main one.There was this whole problem with the first episode squeezes an entire light novel into the first episode, which was weird since the only thing that happens in the show is just character introduction and that's about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show was made by A1 Pictures who oddly has a track record of controversial love/hate shows in the past years, but bad story or not , A1 Pictures really can animate nicely if they want too, and this is one show that they really put effort into. It's not like Fairy Tail where they straight up butcher the animation, the animation is well done and there are some times where it seems rotoscoped.Overall the animation is nice, the style is also nice to look at, I like how the main character doesn't have the cliche spikey hair and i like they're use of colors to distinguish characters and objects from the background.Another thing worth note is the stunning view of cinematography and lighting to build tension in scenes. There are times when the camera would just flip to the side and at times it would look disorienting though.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are both well animated and nice to listen too, but the actual soundtrack is different. It may have been me but it felt like the soundtrack never changes. The techno electronic beat fits with the mystery aspect of the show, but it never seems to switch tone shifts and always sounds the same.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo address the elephant in the room, by the end of the series, I still don't understand why Ryotas' cleavage is so huge. It sounds silly but those things are way too humongous to take seriously, if they were trying to be seductive with the character it really didn't work so why they would make her chest size so comically huge?The main character is not a bland character, but he can be a bit of a crybaby, the girl with glasses says \"ascension\" a lot for some reason, the detective is annoying , that fortune teller girl should've told more fortunes, the guy with glasses is so smart that it makes me jealous, that illustrator girl is good at drawing and that crazy girl with that demon dude needed more screen time.(Im not good with names).What i'm trying to say is that they deserved a bit more screen time to completely wrap up their story before that crazy twist happened and changed everything. There is even this one girl who doesn't show up until the half of the show is over.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine would have been better if it was longer and didn't try to make everything happen at the speed of light.I like the style of the show and the opening and ending was a treat to hear and I kept up with the fast paced dialogue, but the larger problems are hard to address without spoiling the plot twist at the halfway mark. but to summarize quickly, the show should have been longer and fully flush out each character and the story surrounding it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nIf you want everything explained, get ready to be disappointed.",

            "content": "I highly recommend giving this anime a try, though it's best to give it a few episodes as the pacing in the beginning can be off putting at first. \r\nI found myself surprised by how much I enjoyed this anime. Normally I don't really like the Sci-Fi genre, but I didn't feel weighed down with this show like I normally would.  The application of science to fantasy elements was balanced and important, but none of the main characters are the scientists trying to do so. Instead, they find themselves in a predicament that pushes them to try to understand what's happening and why. \r\nAsmentioned previously, the pacing of this show was a little unique. In the first few episodes I wasn't greatly enjoying it as many elements felt a little rushed. The show doesn't only follow around one main character, but jumps back and forth between them. Coupled with the pacing, this made the show a little hard to settle into at first. However, once you get past the first episode or two I felt like the pacing really suited itself to the story and the multiple perspectives added more interest overall. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the plot goes, I think it's a lot more interesting than the summary makes it seem. When I first read the summary for this show I thought it was going to be something very different. The show is technically about a group of kids who run a blog trying to disprove the occult, but it's so much more than that. The show has one major incident dealing with the occult that the characters find themselves caught up in. As it goes on, pretty much all of the lesser incidents tie together and connect all of the elements of the story. The plot flows together, despite some apparent plot holes and issues. \\n\\n\r\nI did have a number of issues with this show that normally would have warranted a lower score, but I enjoyed it so much despite those flaws.",

            "content": "Occultic;Nine is a cool show about a supernatural conspiracy and lots of fun characters that I enjoy watching. Similar to one of my other favorites Durarara! Every character has a story to tell. Miyu Aikawa a fortune teller nearly falling apart from the futures that she see's and the repercussions of the events around her.Shun Moritsuka a genius detective underestimated by the people around him who is always a joy to watch. Ryouka Narusawa a BIG MINDED highschool freshman who plays off the other characters well... you know going around tazing people and stuff being a BIG goofball that I like.Which brings me to bringingup the fanservice in Occultic;Nine that everyone's freaking out over. In episode one Gamotan is in the cafe drinking his free water when Ryouka makes her entrance floping around everywhere making ribbit noises like a certain waifu(My Hero Academia)but not showing much more than Gamotan's and the bar tender's comical reactions. What's up with that? The reactions to the show are almost as bizarre as the show itself?!Almost as Bizarre that my favorite character Yuuta Gamon is cool.Our series main character is a NEET who runs a Occultic news blog where he gets money from side links and HIS FRIEND'S HUMONGOUS ASSETS BROOOO WOOOAHH. He starts off as a possibly selfish kid lacking in courage,who becomes a selfless hero through inspiration and encouragement from his friends.I also appreciate his relationship with his father and his Dad not being dead or a jerk. As much as I seeing dynamics with mothers as well. Speaking of Mothers in Anime Erased was a hit or miss with discussion over it even being a mystery or a thriller. I'm going to look at it from the lense of Erased being a thriller and how Occultic;Nine is even scarier.Scenes in episode 3 and when Miyu try's to search for her friend were nail bitting.The only scene in Erased that can compare is when Kayo is in the school bus and is almost seen by the killer but... IT WAS COMPLETELY RUINED WHEN SHE DID\"NT TELL THEM INTIL A WHOLE DAY AFTER BEING ASKED \"DAIJOBOU KAYO-CHAN\" no it's not it's never daijobou.....  I am the occultic I am bound by my loli plot device THIS IS MY POWER! Unlimited A-1 Pictures Shows!!!! :( The ending does suffer some issues like:What happended to the manga artist lady? What's up with the male ghostbuster kid?Even the brother and sister. Espicially the villians?Alot of comparison's have been to it and Durarara!. I would say I enjoy them both. Occultic;Nine is a 7 to a light 8 just all of Durarara! except x2 ten and maybe the first season seeing that I haven't watched it in a little while. Durarara! always starts off great and ends alright but Occultic;Nine is the opposite where it starts off ok and then becomes great. Occultic;Nine is fun bizarre show I enjoyed watching alot",

            "content": "At the start of each anime season I pick a few of the anime to watch weekly.  Unfortunately, while Occultic;Nine was able to keep me interested since episode one, it wasn't good enough to keep watching weekly and I fell behind a great deal. Having recently finished it, I'm glad that I took the time to return and watch it. It's not something to be heralded as one of the greatest anime and personally I didn't even feel as if it's something I'll be recommending to other people, but I did thoroughly enjoy parts of it. There were a lot of things I hada problem with, but at the very least, the parts I enjoyed were enough to keep me going until I finished it.\\n\\n\r\nTo get it out of the way at the beginning, I harbor a personal bias towards the art style that Occultic;Nine and other similar anime use. The overly dark tone of colors is one thing that I can get over, the the various points of view that are used to view the characters and especially the fish eyed effect that is used sometimes is just not something that I can get over. The anime isn't being shot with a camera, the different points of view aren't necessary and are really brought in when they're not need; e.g. when the cast is sitting in Blue Moon talking to each other and you as the audience is placed on the other side of the room, seeing nothing but them in a corner of the screen. The shading used for their noses, or lack thereof, was also something I didn't really appreciate, but at that point I guess I'm just being nit picky towards the artist's (or artists') art style. Other than the issues I've stated, the rest of the art throughout the series isn't something I had a problem with. It was consistent throughout it and fairly smooth. Brownie points for the important scenes being both well lit and lacking of ridiculous points of view.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the sounds go within the series, I don't have anything special to say about it. I'm not really the type of person to pay attention to the opening and ending songs, nor do I pay special attention to the music used within each individual episodes, so if it does stand out to me, I make sure to say something about it. In essence, the sound to the anime were fairly average.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some might love the variations in characters that came together in this show, I will not be one of those people. Individually the characters weren't special in much of any way and when they came together as a group, didn't offer anything to each other to get attached to any of them. The reason I watched Occultic;Nine was not for the characters, as I felt that their significance was simply to act out the story in the same way a hammer drives a nail. Sarai was fairly hard to swallow. Usually he was brusque, but was able to flip a switch at a moments notice to a different personality setting. Miyuu and Moritsuka were the easiest characters to like. Miyuu didn't give much of an opportunity to hate her either, to be fair, but she wasn't normal and nice. Moritsuka talked way too much, but at the same time, he was just interesting. The biggest problem I had with the characters was with Gamotan himself, our main character. He was whiney, but in the next scene he'd be confident, and he really had a hard time having his own personality, instead settling down to be all of them. He did his job as the main character, but it wasn't enjoyable to watch him make the journey from episode one to episode twelve.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's any reason to watch this series, it's solely contained within the story itself. The events within the Occultic;Time world would take place without real connection to the main characters and they would be forced to play catch up. Over time it felt less as if the characters mattered, and more like they were just the group that got lucky enough to be the ones we'd be forced to watch. As I said above, the characters were more of a tool to act out the story. Every time you'd believe the characters were catching up and making progress, another event would be revealed that set them back and sent you reeling. The vast scale of the events kept me watching and the thought process of the people behind these events kept me interested. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the overall story. Each individual event was important and interesting, but the story as a whole didn't make much of an impact and the ending was lackluster to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Occultic;Nine isn't something that I'll really every recommend to anyone unless I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel of the genre. The points of view were not enjoyable, the characters were annoying or plain at best, and the plot in its entirety wasn't that entertaining. Watching the show is pretty much just done to see it all play out step-by-step, which is what made it interesting at all.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: If you don't have anything else for the genre, watch it.  Otherwise, don't bother.",

I don't really do things like these ( giving reviews or being involved with anime besides watching it) but i think this anime has been rated by many users carelessly.\r\n(First paragraph contains what you may consider a spoiler but not really spoiler for the story)\r\nWhen i tried to watch this anime i was so caught up by the name and cover so i didn't even bothered to watch the PV and i watched the first episode directly. As many people say's \"First impressions lasts\", my first impressionof this anime was trash and garbage. I'm watching the first few minutes of the first episode (which is the episode that should capture my interest blah blah blah) but what i saw was an overly large pair of watermelon boobs bouncing around and around, its not that i don't love fan services but i did not considered even to the slightest that i would be shown boobs for the first episode and because of that i immediately dropped the series and scored it 1.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that i've watched several anime and whenever i searched for next anime to watch i am always seeing this anime. So one time i got really curious and decided to learn more about this anime and i learnt that it is maid by the same guy who made steins;gate (an anime that i loved the most to the point that i bought the game). So i decided to give it a try again, and now im happy to end 2016 with this very smart decision of mine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI feel that the overall score 7.1? is a clear injustice and misjudgment. The story is very interesting, if this won't get your interest i think nothing will. The story is rich, plots everywhere. Although you might really need to think hard to understand the story and go with the flow (i myself had to pause and rewind almost all the explanations just to understand it). let me just say this once but THIS IS REALLY A VERY GOOD ANIME, IF NOT THE GREATEST.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't find this anime beautiful and story rich, you are a very hard to please. \\n\\n\r\nPlease give it a chance and watch it because it is really beautiful, the fact that i wrote myself is a proof enough. Happy New Year fellow MAL people!",

The plot and the art are setup perfectly to suite a dark and eerie paranormal fiction theme but it's almost as if the writers thought they were working on a sliceoflife/comedy. \r\nAny scene that is supposed to send chills down the viewers spine doesn't. Having every character talk at x1.5 speed with no pauses leaves little to no room for the audience to feel emotions towards someone dying in the background.\r\nIt seems they were worried the anime wouldbe too scary so they made the main character a NEET whose lines consists purely of comic relief and a supporting character whose breasts are more exaggerated in size than any character this year. \\n\\n\r\nIf you plan on watching the show for its mysterious and intriguing story telling then let me stop you there. They start it with a shaky paranormal foundation and then it all falls to shit with an ending full of asspulls.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I regret watching Occultic;Nine\\n\r\nbut I am however underwhelmed and disappointed.",

            "content": "Occultic;Nine is a great Sci-fi mystery from the creators of Steins;Gate. As someone who loved Steins;Gate, this anime caught my attention a few months before it was released and it fulfilled my expectations quite well. Overall, it's not the best anime ever but, it's a good anime for general enjoyment to mystery and sci-fi lovers like myself.\r\nOccultic;Nine has some great points to its show. Its plot and story, for the most part, is great. The idea of occult and supernatural things happening with a more sinister plot behind it was fantastic. The opening and the ending songs were excellent and the art was great aswell. However, do beware when watching, as there are a few plot holes in the story and plot.\\n\\n\r\nPOTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine's development of the plot and the story could have been done much better. It was like Steins;Gate, in that the first few episodes was very confusing for the first time viewers. I, myself, rewatched episodes to make sure I didn't miss a thing. The story took more shape near the end when Tesla's daughter was inserted and everything tied together. I feel like if Occultic;Nine had another 12 episodes to work with, it would have been able to compete with its sister stories.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for the characters of Occultic;Nine. Out of the nine characters, we really only see the background of Gamon and a slight bit of Aria and Ryoka. I think left a bit of plot holes within the storyline of Occultic;Nine, as a lot of the background information is not relayed to the viewers. Like I said previously, more episodes would have most likely fixed these issues. I would have loved it if Occultic;Nine had a filler episode of some of the characters' background stories before moving on with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nLast tidbit: Did you notice that there was a Christmas tree in the opening, even though there was no Christmas episode? Some say its because it aired its final episode Christmas Eve. The things you find when looking for content to watch...",

Using the occult as its core, the characters would be all influenced or connected to different situations, \"powers/abilities\" and a super case that as we know in the Science Adventures Series, we need the spice of some mega-control corporation behind the case.\\n\\n\r\nEach character have his/her own past, with great memories and influences, some of them, or maybe, most of them, get forgotten at certain point as is needed or not, and only use character alone, but the reason is simple, to forge a story that can finish the more complete as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGMs, sounds, and voices are very delightful, you won't get boring, or at least your ears. And with the art, well, part old school, other not too much, but is OK, good, maybe not super cool, but good.\\n\\n\r\nI think with this you can get an idea of what this story is. It's a good one, of course, with its details, but well, nothing is perfect, this is a goooood example, and if you see it, well you don't gonna understand only: \"Quality over quantity\" but \"Quality over timeline\".\\n\\n\r\nThanks for read until this line, if this has been of use for you, I'm happy with it, if not, well, I'm still grateful for bear with my ideas!",

            "content": "When it comes to judging the quality of series' I've watched, one metric I use to separate the wheat from the chaff, and one that I feel is overlooked far too often, is pacing. Good pacing, in combination with the other attributes of a series, is crucial to my overall investment in said series. Take The Tatami Galaxy for example; exposition seems to fly by at first, but the viewer is often provided oases of slower-paced, thoughtful dialogue to take refuge in and reflect upon what they've been shown or told. Another example of good pacing is Aria; the series proceeds at a consistently relaxed(read: kinda slow) pace, but this leisurely feel works in tandem with the series' soothing visuals and atmosphere to create a sense of peace and revitalization within the viewer. On the other hand, bad pacing can make a series hard to keep up with if it goes by too quickly or bore you out of your mind if it *really* takes its time to get where it's going. Occultic;Nine (abbreviated O;N from now on) falls into the former category, and therein lies my main issue with the series - it largely operates on one speed, and that's breakneck. In short, O;N lacks dynamic pacing, and this can negatively effect all of the aforementioned categories by which a series is judged.\\n\\n\r\nO;N takes place in Musashino, Japan, where our nine (yes... nine) protagonists share a fascination with the occult or the science by which occult phenomena can supposedly be explained. Mysterious happenings start to occur in the city, and upon further investigation, the morbid truths surrounding these happenings begin to reveal themselves. This premise is interesting enough, but the rapid-fire manner in which the story is presented can often be vexing. Episodes skip from scene to scene and character to character without much warning, and the exposition dialogue can be quite difficult to follow if you aren't pausing once every few seconds to read the subtitles. Because of this scattered method of storytelling, you can discern that O;N is attempting to present itself like a set of puzzle pieces to be thoroughly examined and carefully put together, but instead of laying said pieces out on a table so you can get a good look at them, they're just kind of thrown past you, allowing you a fleeting glimpse of what they look like before they're halfway across the room. O;N would have done well to center its focus on one scenario at a time, allowing viewers to soak things in rather than be doomed to mutter a sheepish \"I kinda get it\" before moving on in the story. Watch the first episode for a great example of what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of O;N range from likable (Gamon, Moritsuka) to annoying (Ryo-tas) to forgettable (Sumikaze), but all suffer from the same problem that characters in similarly-paced series often do - you never really feel like you've gotten to know them. Gamon is the main protagonist of the series and thus receives the most attention, and we as viewers become comfortable with his spastic otaku personality; however, he never really seems to undergo much overall development as a person other than that, well, he knows more about what's going on as the story progresses and reacts in the way that you would expect a spastic otaku to react - with bombastic emotion. Ririka Nishizono, an artistic seer of sorts, is also a protagonist of the series, but we hardly ever see her, and as such almost no time is spent discussing who she is or how she feels about the events unfolding around her. When characters are presented in this way, as catalysts to events with little attention devoted to their personalities and backgrounds, they begin to feel like walking plot devices rather than human beings, and we can never really relate to them or find a reason to care about what happens to them. I will say that the dialogue between certain characters, especially when Moritsuka or Gamon is involved, is often clever and entertaining, one of the few things that kept me watching the show. The antagonists are a very generic bunch with very generic motives, and get around ten minutes of screentime total, which is pretty unusual and not a very good directorial choice if you want the viewer to root against them - personally, I couldn't care about them considering how little development they were given.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, O;N is presented fairly well - you can tell the artists and animators involved are dedicated to their craft, there's few to no blindingly-obvious hiccups in animation quality, and the art does a good job of capturing the dark, brooding atmosphere the series is attempting to convey. O;N's sound is nothing to write home about - the voice actors play their parts well, but the music neither helps nor harms the series much, not getting in the way but not bringing much emotion to the table either.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall impression of O;N is that it's a 24-episode series attempting to tell its story in 12 episodes, which is generally a recipe for disaster. Dialogue moves too fast, there's too much information and exposition crammed into too little space, and none of the characters ever seem to develop much, at least when compared to most other 12-episode series. The story, setting, and characters feel incomplete overall - not because the ending was horrifically unsatisfactory or anything like that, but because it feels like a bunch of details that would have fleshed everything out weren't included. Sure, we get a bunch of technobabble about how some of the occult phenomena in the series work, but little in the form of development to get us attached to anything that's happening or the people it's happening to.\\n\\n\r\nI want to make it clear that, unlike lost-cause shows that were doomed to fail from the start due to inherently flawed characters or stories, O;N had the potential to be interesting if it wasn't so tightly-packed. Rather than being able to immerse yourself in this series, you can only watch it go by at sonic speed, a blur of colors, sound and light, and imagine what it might be like if it just fucking stood still for a second.",

I liked how the direction of this anime was going but my personal opinion is that it was heading a fast pace for people to really catch up and understand what is going on. \r\nThe story has been given portrayal towards Steins;Gate. While those small gimmicks where there, it some-how felt different. But the story was with a lot of twist, there was sudden shift in direction and plot twist were frequent but with fast pace of the plot, it was really hard to enjoy the anime.Even the ending that is, ep12 felt like it hurried up too fast, with no proper direction or explanation.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall this anime is worth giving a shot, some might enjoy it cause of the story, while some might because of Ryo-tas ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really don't write reviews, but I felt like this show in particular deserved one considering the response it has gotten from most people in the community. \r\nOccultic;Nine, for lack of a better word, was a total mindfuck through and through. I almost dropped this anime after the 1st episode because of how \"all over the place\" it was. But after discovering that they squeezed an entire volume+ into the one episode, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. In fact, it actually became significantly better right from the 2nd episode on. \r\nThe mystery just kept getting thicker with each episode, thesupernatural phenomenon presented added an ominous feeling to the show, and the scientific principles surrounding said phenomenon kept me intrigued to learn the truths behind this mystery. \\n\\n\r\nNow as for the bad, like many others (basically everyone on this page lol), the pacing was pretty bunz to say the least. The show being a 12 ep season did not do the story justice, and the rapid dialogue didn't help it either. There were many times where I was genuinely lost in the story because I had no idea what was going on, and at first, I thought the reason for the fast-paced talking was to make the characters come off as more intelligent than they really were (cuz we all know when you spout facts out really quickly, you're basically a genius). It wasn't until towards the end that I realized that the production team was going balls deep to try and fit in all this plot and development into the few episodes that they had...\\n\\n\r\nThis is by far the biggest complaint for many viewers, but for me, it honestly did not bother that much. The whole reason for this review is to give credit where credit is due. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime had great character design, art, atmosphere, and sound. I appreciated all these elements despite having to deal with a \"rushed\" story. I completely see why people are disappointed. A lot of questions were left unanswered, our main character didn't get the happy ending some of us were expecting (especially after seeing how convenient the final episode was laying it out to be), and the potential for an incredible mystery was somewhat lost in order to speed up the story. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, I really enjoyed this anime to the end. I personally didn't find the final episode to be confusing at all. Instead, I thought it to be one of the easiest episodes to understand, and a perfect way to tie any major plot points that confused me. Sure the pace could have been much better with more episodes, but sometimes those things may be out of your control, and perhaps they have some sort of plan in mind if they were able to continue this story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this an 8/10. Many see this anime as a big let down, but I want to see it as an anime with the potential to provide one amazing story. It has its flaws, but I feel they're already stepping in the right direction.",

However after some time and looking back on them they seem to understand a bit more and quality is discovered as seen by the anime's rising score after it's original decline at the end of last year.\r\nIf I can sum up this whole anime is that I fucking LOVED it. The entire time I was watching this anime I was either entertained or intrigued. And I dunno know about you guys but when I enjoy something while a great story is unfolding is a perfectblend for something worthy of my 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characteristics, the anime sets up some of the cast in the first episode as rather generic archetypes with the same personality traits you've seen millions of times especially our main two leads. However, it's how the anime progressed its story and characters is what made them memorable in my eyes.  Each character has some form of dilemma and intrigue to them giving us a taste of what they would be like outside of their respective story, in fact the first episode doesn't really have some sort of huge *Shit hits the fan* type of event until the last few moments so we can all see what these characters do prior to the events taking place. You see Gamon blogging on his site and hanging out at his usual joint getting the same thing as pointed out by Kouhei the owner who is just fed up with these kids always using his place. You also see Narusawa's relationship to Yuuta in this episode being rather playful and being his \"minion\". Other characters are also set up quite nicely such as Touko and her group of journalists who want to nail a massive story for the paper.  Other characters are set up using a more mysterious and fascinating way to make us want to know more about them and just how they fit in with the story, like Moritsuka and Ririka being shrouded in mystery and their motives are unclear which gives the viewer a sense of discovery when they are revealed, rewarding them for paying attention. Later they all get their own dilemma's explored and allows them to grow towards each other on a personal level instead of them being total strangers to one another as they started at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation done by A-1 Pictures is masterfully done, with constantly moving sequences and helps along the pacing go a bit faster while catching the attention of viewers who need to watch closer. The shots also complement the show with the sense of urgency in some scenes really helped by the cinematography done by Kyohei Ishiguro who has done other A-1 greats in the past like Your lie in April. This anime surely looks amazing and sounds just as great with great sound design and soundtrack, may I also point out that this show had one of my favorite OP's of 2016, sung by Kanako Itou and her voice blended with the opening animation makes for an amazing sight.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about this show all day folks, I've only talked about episode 1 of this review and I can still go on and on but for now, let's give the big ole final verdict for Occultic;Nine is a 10.\\n\\n\r\nBTW this was my first review so why not start on one of my favorite Animes of all time.",

            "content": "What happens when you have a decent plot and you rush the show to meet the deadline? You get Occultic;Nine\r\nThis show had a lot going for it. The plot that was presented to us was intriguing enough to get people to watch the pilot and even the pilot presented a plot that got people interested. The problem? Rushed decisions.\r\nThe story of \"Occultic;Nine\" follows a group of people that are being forced to live some misterious events, while sparking a debate about whether the occultic is a thing or not. These people were all by one way or another linked to the subject and so theyall have their own opinnion on the matter\\n\\n\r\nAnd when so, when everything starts to go down, they all have different reactions and approches to the matter.This would have been fun to watch if the producers handled the topic a little diferently.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the show felt rushed. I understand making a full-25-ish-anime show is way more expensive than making a 12 episode one. But this show was really hurt by it. \"Occultic;Nine\" has a plot that required a deeper analysis, it's a show that wants to be a psychological mistery but doesn't have the time to do so. And so most of the questions the show asks are left unanswered or barely touched, and some more episodes could have fixed that.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also suffers from another problem: the pace. It started out really slow, presenting the characters and the overall mistery, making the pilot almost hurtfull to watch, only to transition to a really fast paced story, trying to accomplish too much in each episode. The characters talk WAY to fast for the conversations to be easily understandable, which can get really annoying when they're explaning the really hard parts of the plot. I can only imagine this was the attempt to fit the entire plot in 12 episodes, which they DID manege to accomplish, but not in a very good way.\\n\\n\r\nBeing reduced to 12 episode also represents another problem: Character development. Since the main cast is, well, a CAST, the shows tries to develop way too many stories at the same time. Result? None of them really has that much development. You could argue the real main characters, Gamotan and Ryotas get some and I would see your point, but in a show where the idea is to have around 8 main characters, some of them are bound to be left out. Add to that the fact that you only have 12 episodes to deliever these stories AND the main plot and you'll get almost no character background and progression.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can't hate this show. The mistery IS interesting and I maneged to put up with the fast pace and dialogue.The opening and ending songs and visuals are really good! The ending is also kind of sweet, which while not answering too MANY of the questions you might had, will cover your heart and mind and put them at ease. Until they announce season 2. (Which I hope they will.Let's hope they do a better job with it)\\n\\n\r\n\"Occultic;Nine\" is a show with a very good plot and it could have been one of the shows of the season if the producers had done a better job working on it. Since they didn't, it falls short and becomes a show of the \"It could have been great\" list. It's a real shame. I do recommend you giving it a try if you like the occultic things though. If you can get through the first episode and still want to watch the second one, you'll be fine. You probably won't love it, but I doubt you'll hate it either. Give it a try and see for yourself!",

            "content": "With the legacy of Steins;Gate behind it and a multitude of very polarized reviews, I fully expected Occultic;Nine to be one of those extremely metaphorical anime with a unique, nontraditional narrative that a lot of people just don't \"get.\" \r\nI'm fully aware of how pretentious that sounds, but not enjoying those anime isn't a bad thing in my opinion, it's just a different method of storytelling that works for some and doesn't work for others. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine is not one of those. What Occultic;Nine lacks in genuine symbolism and unique storytelling, it attempts to make up for with implausible pseudosciences, plot contrivances, unnecessary (and subsequentlyabandoned) plot threads, and what may possibly be the most abhorrent pacing and plot decisions I've seen in an anime in a very long time. \\n\\n\r\n-Story: 4/10 \\n\\n\r\nIt starts out good enough, with an interesting cast and genuinely intriguing mysteries. Though the pacing starts out as bad as it ends, I actually initially found myself drawn to the breakneck conversation speed and scene-to-scene transitions. It meant that every second of this anime was important, and there would be virtually no filler or fluff content. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine actually managed to teach just how important filler content can be, even in a 12-episode anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt really wouldn't be wrong to classify this anime as only one, really long exposition dump. Even in important action scenes, there's nonstop explanation coupled with the distracting visuals. The longer the anime runs for, the weaker and weaker the actual plot becomes. Whereas Steins;Gate devoted a large portion of its runtime to making its science at the very least plausible within the unique constraints of its universe, Occultic;Nine quite literally gave the impression of making things up as it went along. The premise seems to promise a unique, ambiguous debate between the scientific and the occult, but in reality the show is more or less \"made up science with a few  unimportant urban legends thrown in for good measure.\"\\n\\n\r\nSubplots seem to come and the disappear as quickly as they were launched into the show.  Though the anime does attempt to explain the driving forces behind the main plot, it still leaves an offensive amount of unanswered questions and unresolved character plots. Also, in the midst of its \"explanation\", several points of the plot hinge on what can only be called contrivances. Contrivances that go far beyond Deus Ex Machina and enter the territory of \"the writers honestly had no idea how to fix this mess so they just made the solution appear out of thin air.\" \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the terribly paced and inconsistent storyline culminated in an ultimately unsatisfying ending that didn't leave me wanting more, and instead just made me relieved it was finally over. I wasn't left with a desire to learn more about the characters or the world of Occultic;Nine, I was instead left frustrated and annoyed at the lack of basic storytelling integrity present all throughout this anime. \\n\\n\r\n-Art: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThough the animation and character designs are nice enough, there's often a complete disconnection between what's happening visually, and what's being said. Normally, you'd expect dialogue to frame a scene and interesting visuals used to make an otherwise boring-but-necessary conversation fun to watch, but Occultic;Nine fails in all aspects, quite miserably I may add. Exposition dumps are accessorized with awkward, disjointed camera angles and extremely forced perspective that makes the rapid expositioning even more difficult to listen to. The further you get into the show, the more its predictable and amateur visuals blend together and the easier it gets to completely tune out, which given the sheer amount of exposition present in any given scene, is not a good thing. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably my highest point of compliment, which is... sad. The opening and ending are nice enough as standalone songs and the OST does a fine job of creating the right atmosphere throughout the anime. Unfortunately, though, no tracks particularly stood out as breakout or iconic works. Good, but ultimately forgettable. \\n\\n\r\n-Character: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably where the anime falls short the most. Right away the anime introduces us to not only the main cast, but several minor characters as well.  The rapidfire pacing is what makes it possible to fully introduce so many characters at once,  but despite the information overload, only a handful of these characters actually end up being necessary. Major characters start out with important subplots that lead nowhere, and minor characters are given last-minute evolutions to major players in the events of the story. Altogether though, there is virtually no character development. The show ends with virtually the same cast it began with. This is due largely to so many characters getting very little screentime, with several of the 'major' characters getting maybe 3-5 scenes of important dialogue in the entire anime. The cast is largely held together by a few inconsequential character traits with little to no depth, which is rather unfortunate given their admittedly very interesting designs. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a longtime fan of anime, then you should know that sometimes even a bad storyline and bad characters aren't always dealbreakers. Despite everything, sometimes a show just has a certain spark, an appeal that makes it enjoyable even though by all means it shouldn't be. I was desperately looking for that piece of Occultic;Nine throughout its entire run. I really wanted to like it. I really wanted it to be a good anime. But, unfortunately (I've certainly used that word a lot), it almost totally lacked enjoyability for me. It isn't even good in a \"so bad its good\" kind of way. Sure, there are a lot of very laughable plot points, but altogether, it hardly stands as something you can use to just pass the time.",

            "content": "Alright, let's start with the story. Occultic;Nine tried way too hard to shove as much content as possible into 12 episodes. There were multiple plot lines that failed to connect in a way that made any sense or provide viewers with any form of satisfaction/understanding as to what the fuck they just watched. I'm not sure how this anime managed to be so fast paced while simultaneously having nothing happen, but it did. \r\nThe art was ok. Nothing special, nothing too awful. Except...what the fuck was up with their noses sometimes??? (seriously I can't be the only one who was thrown off by their fuckingnoses)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was completely flat. The OP and ED didn't feel like they matched whatever theme Occultic;Nine was trying to push and everything else felt very forced. \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters....oh boy. The MC is a completely useless whiny brat and his \"minion\", Ryouka, is an extremely annoying air head with unnaturally massive and disproportionate tits who is actually possessed by some important ghost or what-the-fuck-ever. Every other character is flat and forgettable with their own unimportant back stories that don't tie into the story at all. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like Occultic;Nine, I really did. But it was filled with plot holes and lacked any character development. The story jumped all over the place and it felt as though were wasn't actually a central plot. For a show that tried so hard to be \"dark\" and \"edgy\" it finished on such a strange and unfitting happy-go-lucky note that answered zero of the questions I was left with.  I did manage to find some small amount of enjoyment while watching all 12 episodes in just how ridiculously awful and try-hard it managed to be.\\n\\n\r\nI can't see anyone over the age of 13 actually enjoying this anime.",

            "content": "Did you find Occultic;Nine confusing? Relax, the characters agree with you.\r\nI will try to sump up this anime as briefly as i can. Occultic simply fails to be good, ending in the \"ok\" anime section. As the semicolon suggest, Occultic;Nine is a animation that share some similarities with Nitroplus works such as Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head, yet, it has a huge problem when it comes to narrative. The Story in the first look reseamble the Durarara!! formula, a city, a loot of characters, and they're interaction with the initial mystery, however, the story (mainly after the 7th episode) falls off pretty hard, being pushed by thischaotic fast-phase storytelling, which sounds original, but is simply confusing and pretty much unnecessary in the first place. There's a lot of stormshit theory, and the texts, dialogues and conversations are too quick, and i mean, damn quick, like, sound speed (i'm joking here, but is fast). Some terms are completely \"what?\" like the \"Ascension\" quotes, and the final part, after the mystery solved, is pretty much rushed and withouth the right impact (AKA no climax here). The ending itself is kinda of satisfatory, but the journey until there, is pretty much a mess.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really hate the characters, but i don't like them (with one exception). I mean, the main character has that classics impotency moments, but it turns out irrelevant, since he's already all right after 10 minutes, and, to be honest, he's pretty boring. Some characters like the detective Moritsuka are pretty cool to watch, and in this specific case, Moritsuka is the only character that really suits well in the fast narrative of the plot, and is convincent when it comes to be one step ahead in information terms. Besides these \"ok\" characters, the other ones like Aria, Ririka or the Kotoribako boy are underused, and i really see potential in them. Actually, Ririka doesn't have a conclusion as a character (for some reason), and that tells you a lot about the whole plot in general.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is definily the best part of Occultic. The A-1 Pictures Studio always do a good job when it comes to do standard quality animes, and here they make their name once more. The soundtrack is a little bit discreet, but is actually good, the art is fine (and pretty original) and the voices are good, well choosed and performed. The anatomy of \"Ryotasu\" is something to discuss about, but the overall animation is pretty good, and i personally liked. It's nothing amazing by any means, but it does right.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic;Nine is not really an amazing intelligent anime with the likes of Steins;Gate, but is a fine watchable experience, Especially if you're looking for supernatural (or sci-fi) experiences in japanese animation. It has some flaws (more than qualities tho), but is not really bad or awful, and it may be enjoyable for you.",

If you could get past their version of comedic relief and average attempt at sci-fi/occult, then you're looking at a pretty solid 6/10 overall series. Obviously I enjoyed watching so I ranked it 7/10. I really liked the artwork/animation style, and the characters were unique enough to pique my interest and the general story was really interesting. However, the any problems/flaws really stood out like a sore thumb. The Tesla explanation for everything was taken way to far to the point were it was not believable any more. Random characters were suddenly gifted superpowers out ofthe blue and magical solutions suddenly turned up when everyone needed help which turned this into a fantasy/magic genre for me. I wish they put more effort into tricking the audience by blurring reality and fantasy. It was a cop out to present solutions out of thin air than put more psychological development behind them. But like I said before it's a solid series. Not enough chilling psychological thriller; they went the cutesy route *sigh*. \\n",

I give a score of 10 not whenI find a series to be perfect, but for when it really captivates me.\\n\\n\r\nI will try to display information without the loops and frills people use to entertain. I'm here to inform and prove a point. Lets get to it then.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fast paced, especially the first episode. Forget the light novel, the fast pace is part of the story. I see a lot of people complaining about that. If you survive the first episode and it's + -11 characters, you'll see that story flows and you get what's going on, even if you do not understand completely all the scientific stuff. I think what really divides the final opinion watchers have is if they can take the stream of information or not. Well, I survived 3 games of Xenosaga, so this is nothing for me.\\n\\n\r\nOccultic; Nine is not a supernatural anime, it's Sci-Fi. It tries to give explanations that really make sense, instead of counting that we simply believe in it. It's not that all is scientifically accurate, it's just not like \"the big guy is green and his pants stretch, deal with it\". I give the series credit for making me think in a scientific manner.\\n\\n\r\nYes, Ryo-tas breasts are impossibly huge. But hey, it's an anime, and I respect the creator for the \"I'll do whatever I want\" factor. I do not see you complaining about the twin maids with pink and blue hair always wearing fetish clothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is awesome, the opening and ending songs are marvelous, especially the ending (I still have it playing in my head as I write). The mistery and plot twists make for a great story from start to end.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, as I said in the beginning, what really counts for me is that the story captivated me, and I would even recomend it to my friends that do not watch anime.",

            "content": "Why Myanimelist, why? Why is Occultic Nine so undervalued? I want to know how this marvelous and innovative anime is so undervalued.  I want to know when A1-pictures turned into Shaft as well.\r\nAt the beginnig I was very disguted with this Autumn season, I absolutely hated all animes of it (with the exception of a few amount of it) , until now. Bye stupid and fantastic boys that travel to another world for doing...what always it is hoped that they would do, nothing, and many other things that it does't worth to talk about. Bye stupid animes with idols and musical animes with lolis...thistime is time to talk about Occultic Nine.  \\n\\n\r\nI have to say that this anime is a surprise, not only by the quality of its art but as well by the story and how I enjoyed it. The art is very alike to Shaft's animes, the presentations with words, the way of telling us what is happening on ours tvs etc. Simply outstanding, marvelous. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very interesting, a marvelous thriller that make you want to know more and more about it and with a huge ammount of hidden details (thing that I particularly love). I put a 9 on it because this anime is pretty short and may be you need more than 3 or 4 times for understanding all the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't bad, but could be more impressive, with the exception of the openning and the ending, i can't remember any song in particular and in my opinion they could have put more effort on it.  8 is a good mark.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, well, in this i found many mistakes and many good things. Mistakes: only the stupid fanservice, what the fuck are these tits\u00bf\u00bf\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1 They were'nt normal...\\n\r\nGood things: I like very much the variety of characters, the most of them aren't cliches and have a very good personality. The kind of development of the characters is pretty nice too, It remembered me to Durarara with not only a main character, in fact I think it would be more than 5 or 6, thing that i want to thanks for, because the \"main character\" isn't very interesting XD. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you like an anime that be different to the others, this is your anime, terrifyly well drawn and with a outstanding animation, an interesting plot and more things that you will discover with the pass of the time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review have not very much mistakes because english isn't my main lenguage. I hope too that you could enjoy Occultic Nine after reading it. Bye ^^.\\n\\n\r\nMy Mark: 8.8/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First of all, I think the art was very good, and it deserves credit. So the story does. Creepy, mysterious, and relatively interesting.\r\nBut the dialogues were too fast and long, \r\nand sometimes you couldn't keep up with the script, plus it was extremely exhausting.\r\nI think that it would be better if there were some more episodes, letting the story unravel in a slower and more understandable way.\r\nI didn't find any character memorable.\r\nThe thing that annoyed me most tho,\r\n*****you don't just add huge boobs to any short slim girl. It's incredibly antiaesthetic.**** \r\nI don't know if you find it irritating in general, but this time Ijust couldn't watch this. \\n\r\nThe way she was moving, was making me nauseated.\\n\r\nAnd there can be absolutely no clothes that could fit her.",
