            "content": "Death March is an isekai series similar to One Punch Man. It focuses around an overpowered mr. nice guy Jesus named Satou who saves women from slavery among other things with the powers of an I.T. guru, and makes them his property.\r\nThe events include mr. nice guy raping and pillaging like a viking, except he does the polar opposite because he is nice. Other characters in this series are women. Slave girls 1-7 and a knight. Most of them are very much into mr. nice guy but he himself is a nice guy who doesn't use women. We shan't never know what type of aglopping sound this guy makes. \\n\\n\r\nWhat about the most common quality trait in anime: character development? Satou is already perfect so naturally, he isn't developed, but our main girls and side chicks all like Satou more at the end than in the beginning =  character development. The best part is how much this makes sense, after all, there is no reason to not like the guy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sounds follow the average production values which have been the standard for anime since 2013. Nothing to complain there. Just name your favorite hair color and there is a girl who has it. Smart choices. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, I haven't had this much fun with something that is close to unwatchable since Shingeki no kyoujin S01 aired. I highly recommend this show because it never tried to be anything, and thus didn't fail at it.",

            "content": "Man, I don't even know where to begin.  I always watch a few seasonal anime and try to follow through, regardless of whether they are good or bad.  But this show is maybe the first show to actively really bother me, and it bothers me more and more every week.  I'm basically watching it to get angry now.  And part of my frustration for the show may be misplaced because I've seen several youtubers tear apart SAO for misogyny, and yet give this show a pass, where this show is one of the most misogynistic pieces of trash I've ever seen.\r\nSo,firstly, on the surface, the show looks alright.  It is another Isekai show.  It also has a surprisingly great first episode before immediately descending into everything that follows.  It is the most ridiculous example of a power fantasy that I've ever seen.  And I am not a person that typically has a problem with power fantasies, harems, or wish-fulfillment in shows.  I get that it is fiction, and there are reasons people seek out shows like that, and I think there is a place for them.  But this show does something different and way worse.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on out, I will address specifics of the show, so SPOILER WARNING (although there has really been no plot up to the 5th episode when I'm writing the review).  A videogame designer gets sucked into a fantasy world that is reminiscent of a couple of the MMO worlds he has worked on.  And for whatever reason, he basically instantly has access to debug skills and can immediately max all of his skills, yet for some reason only ever maxes them right before he needs them.  Like, he'll have a conversation and be like 'Oh Crap, I should max diplomacy now so I can convince them', even though he may as well just make himself Superman right away.  The show gets weirdly hung up on things like turning into momentary food porn or getting oddly fixated buying new clothes and dressing up the harem girls.  It is really not focused at all and keeps bouncing back and forth between seemingly random things, yet the vibe is really all to service the idea that these harem girls are essentially pets.  From what I've seen the show's general tone is 'look how awesome and kind he is, now lets dress up these girls and feed them and let everyone know how indebted to him they are'.  But the weirdest thing is, his harem is made up of pretty much all slaves.  So, their owners are defeated (or he buys some of them), and then he doesn't free them, but he keeps them as slaves, yet the show presents this as a good/kind thing to do.  They've essentially stated that the girls couldn't handle being free, so the kind thing to do is keep them as slaves, but be nice to them and give them lots of treats.  So he orders them around and raises their skills, and buys them presents, or gives them money to buy presents, and then lets them sleep in a stable.  It is so fundamentally bizarre that all his actions keep getting presented as the noble thing.  But then things get especially weird in Episode 5 when he gets 2 more slaves who are super young, one of which is 11 and I think the other is 14. Then they go to a hotel room and strip to have sex with him, because they clearly used to be sex slaves.  He's like 'You don't need to do that anymore' and the show once again presents him as being a hero, meanwhile he's like 29 and chose not to sleep with an 11 year old.  Then in his sleep, the 11 year old casts a charm spell on him and gets on him naked because she 'apparently' got horny and wanted to service him, and the show shows him 'heroically' overpower the mind control and not have sex with a kid, and then they sleep in bed together, her naked.\\n\\n\r\nI seriously don't know what to say about this show.  It's pretty incredibly disgusting.  I'm pretty much only watching it to get angry now.  This is honestly one of the worst, most shallow, vapid shows I've ever seen in my life.",

It is irrelevant anyways!\"\r\nAfter watching the other episodes, you will realise why that is: Suzuki Ichirou, the 29-year-old hard-working programmer is on his \"Death March\" and after another hard days and nights he is going to sleep and starts to dream. \r\nThis just perfektely fits the rest of the story. If I wanted to describe the whole series with few words and without any spoilers I would say: The story is like a good dream: \r\n- happy-go-luckyall the way long\\n\r\n- generic but well-made beautiful setting\\n\r\n- the dreamer is a hero, doing hero-things\\n\r\n- meets nice people and gathers them around him\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest: This is a really simple story-concept - do not expect anything deep or outstanding. It is just a nice dream. But if you are interested in Ichirou's dream, you will get rewarded. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, always fits the atmosphere and the series in all. What I especially liked is the GUI which Ichirou frequently interacts with. They really made everything fit the fanatsy-RPG style.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtracks suit the setting very well too. I also liked the OP and ED. Don't know much more to say here though.\\n\\n\r\nThe charakters beside the MC are mainly girls admiring him - exactly like woud want them to be in your dream. Nothing deep to find here too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is what the whole anime is about. You are getting invited to Ichirou's dream and as your host he really wants to make this show comfortable and enjoyable for you. He is a really good host.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nA very well-made happy-go-lucky fantasy RPG anime with a plain story and plain characters. Offers no deepness but may be the perfekt show for you if you just want to relax and dream a bit.",

            "content": "Death March is one of the most innovative anime that I\u2019ve seen in awhile.\r\nNow wait a second, I\u2019m being completely serious here. I\u2019m not trying to coerce you into reading my review by starting off with a lame sarcastic statement. Just bear with me for a bit. Now Death March has a typical isekai plot that is generic in every sense of the word. The visuals and soundtrack are plain, and the protagonist is yet another incomprehensibly dull Kirito knockoff.  But this anime is truly unique in that out of the entire lead female cast, none of them have BIG BOOBS. That\u2019s right, allof the important girls in this show either have modest chests or are lolis. Now I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve seen a plethora of harem/eiichi/isekai/anime with a bunch of girls in them, and these shows always showcase at least one main female character with large breasts who usually ends up at the butt of at least one boob joke. Not Death March. I was honestly in shock when I discovered this, and I can say without a doubt that the lack of boobs is incredibly original for this type of anime. So if you\u2019re an avid supporter of voluptuous breast, then you\u2019d best find something else to watch. However, if you just so happen to be a lolicon, then you might actually enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, that's only if you found anything else about Death March to be good, which I unfortunately didn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nI really didn\u2019t want to dislike this anime. I actually don\u2019t go into isekai anime and think, \u201cUgh, I just know I\u2019m going to hate this because its unoriginal. I\u2019m definitely going to give it a low score!\u201d before I even watch the show. However, Death March unfortunately ended up being not only generic, but poorly executed as well. One of the biggest issues that I have with this anime is the fact that it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. As far as I can tell, there are no goals or objectives that the main character is trying to achieve, and all Death March does is showcase this dude living in a fantasy town with his loli slaves and occasionally fighting weak monsters whenever they appear. And even the enemies who are built up to be potent forces are completely owned by the protagonist, thus completely removing any sense of excitement or tension in these actions sequences, resulting in some unbelievably dull moments. \\n\\n\r\nNow before I continue to discuss the failings with the general plot execution and story elements of Death March, I\u2019d first like to address what I found to be the most monumental error of the anime, which would be the main character.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is named Kazuto Kirigaya Knockoff, or KKK for short, and he is a dude who inexplicably gets transported to a fantasy world after falling asleep at work. Wow, Death March didn\u2019t even come up with any reason at all, much less a tangible one, as to why this guy got teleported to this world. Anyway, KKK is, wait for it\u2026completely overpowered from the get-go! How exciting! This guy can literally just max out any ability instantly whenever he feels like it and seems to be invulnerable to everything. Because why would anyone want to watch a character work hard to get strong when you can just start off invincible like KKK? But he\u2019s too modest to show off his immense power, so he usually lets others fight and die during battles while he puts in minimal effort. How heroic! He also purchased all but one of the main girls as slaves but decides not to free them because in his opinion, they\u2019re all happy as slaves because he\u2019s a good master. How noble! Finally, KKK\u2019s personality is, from what I could discern, nonexistent. Seriously, his mediocrity as a character is astounding.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the female characters receive substantial development and only succeed at looking cute. If written correctly, I believe that several of these characters had the opportunity to be interesting, but their lack of growth decimated the chances of this actually happening. Let\u2019s start off by analyzing Tama, Pochi, and Liza. The anime mentions how this trio is discriminated against by the general populous for being animal girls. Now the anime could have delved into illuminating the deleterious effects that this torment had on the mentality of these girls and their outlooks on society, but of course it doesn\u2019t. The girls\u2019 only character traits are that they\u2019re nice and like to eat a lot. At least the latter ties into the fact that the girls were malnourished under their previous master. The majority of the other girls in the anime receive similar treatment from the writers, which is unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nThe girl who stood out to me the most was Arisa, whose gimmicks were kind of cute and amusing, however the comedic value of her actions, such as her sexual advancements towards KKK, were lessened due to KKK\u2019s lack of reaction towards them. In order for comedy between two individuals to truly shine, both of them have to play their part. So although Arisa\u2019s flirtatious behavior was fun, since KKK didn\u2019t actually respond to it in any way, the scenes between them lost value in my eyes. Leave it to KKK to suck the joy out of everything. \\n\\n\r\nI believe I mentioned how the slave girls love food. Well, apparently the show\u2019s creator does as well, to the point where he decided it would be a fantastic idea to insert a plethora of random showcases of a variety of exquisite dishes into the show. What basically happens is that whenever KKK sits down to eat a meal, he goes off on an unnecessary explanation of the food\u2019s properties while the anime presents viewers with an image of the food that is more intricately animated than anything else in the anime. And this happens in literally every episode. Its like I\u2019m watching a cringy, mediocre version of Shokugeki no Soma, except this anime is supposed to be about a fantasy world, not food, so these scenes that last several minutes are completely worthless. Plus, I thought that this was a medieval setting, so where the heck did all of these exotic dishes from across the globe come from? Shouldn\u2019t they just be eating hard bread or something? I had to dedicate a paragraph to this because it just seems so absurd and out of place to me for an anime that isn\u2019t about food at all to dedicate so much time to characters eating.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it seems like I ran out of things to talk about. I know I said earlier in this review that I would eventually get to discussing the plot elements of the show and why they fail, but between you and me, that was just an excuse for me to move on and talk about something else. The truth is, Death March\u2019s so called \u201cplot elements\u201d are basically nonexistent, so there\u2019s practically nothing to actually discuss. This show is simply about a guy living in a fantasy world going about his day to day life with his loli slaves. Nothing noteworthy happens, and there is zero development in the story and characters. I have to give some credit to the show though, because although it was terribly boring to watch, for some reason I stuck with it, so I guess that\u2019s something. Maybe I was just waiting to see if KKK would eventually develop an actual personality and stop being a horribly boring and annoying character.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026It never happened.\\n\\n\r\nOh well. I honestly couldn\u2019t find anything that appealed to me in this anime, but I\u2019m sure there are some isekai fans out there who enjoyed it. Maybe even you. Now that this chapter in the great bibliography of isekai anime has concluded, its time to set our sights to the future of the genre. Hopefully upcoming installations will tell a more compelling tale than Death March.",

            "content": "Before actually deciding to watch this show called \u201cDeath March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku\u201d, I have to ask a question: do you really watch a show for enjoyment or do you watch a show to get the most out of it? When I sat down and decided to give this series a try, it felt like an anime that I would not have high expectations on. The premise, character visuals, and just overall idea of it sounds like a copy-paste story you can find in almost any light novel medium these days. But for Death March, this proved to be one of the blandest animeI\u2019ve seen in recent years even compared to similar premises. It\u2019s a literal slap to the face to anyone who expect this to be better than what it looks like.\\n\\n\r\nJust for reference, I have read the light novel and keeping it up with took a lot of commitment. I\u2019m actually close to dropping the LN series but this adaptation is on another level of trash. Taking place in a fantasy setting with RPG gimmicks, we got main protagonist Ichiro Suzuki (also known as \u201cSatou\u201d in the other world). His life changes one day after getting hit into an accident and wakes up in this unknown world. Sound familiar? I swear, you can literally pick up any light novel these days with a similar premise and the set up would be something similar. In the meantime, we follow Satou\u2019s adventure as he begins to adapt with his new life.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m just going to throw it out here. This show is extremely blend in terms of storytelling. My initial impression of the first few episodes were pretty much me struggling to stay awake. Not only is Satou an uninteresting protagonist but the story itself is devoid of emotions. It\u2019s actually a bit ironic since a show like this should have colorful world fiction to make the setting feel alive. What do we get instead? A group of one dimensional characters in a blend world that felt like it\u2019s part of a video game.  Or I should say, a broken video game. A polished game would have memorable characters but you\u2019ll find none of that in this series. Main protagonist Satou is not only just overpowered but also exhibits some disturbing personality if you read between the lines. The way he speaks, behaves, and interacts with certain characters is never engaging to watch. It doesn\u2019t help that his personality is dry to the bone and seemingly always acts the same with his harem. Oh, I did just say that word. Some people may not call this a harem but to me, this series is about as harem-esque as it can get. Consisting of mainly female characters, it doesn\u2019t take long for viewers to find out that they are fond of Satou. Arisa, Pochi, Tama, Zena, Nana. There\u2019s pretty much no character development for any of the main cast. Instead, most of them are there to interact with Satou in order to put him over. The only way to say there\u2019s any development is Satou\u2019s progress as a character as he acquires more skills. Bleh.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I guess there\u2019s some hope for the main story? The series does take place in a fantasy world and that can have potential, right? Wrong. The world building in the series is incredibly underwhelming as most places look bare and feel almost identical. If you\u2019ve seen one place, it feels like you\u2019ve seen them all. Bear in mind that as the series progresses, the world of Death March never evolves just like the weak character cast. The story feels more like a slice of life with occasional fighting and drama thrown in. My main issue in the story is just how meekly it\u2019s written. Story segments feel anticlimactic and lacks substance. It doesn\u2019t connect with the characters and never makes an impact. Pacing issues also puts this show to shame from the start as it never manages to salvage itself. Also, keep in mind that the light novel series has hundreds of chapters and this is a 12-episode anime adaptation. Yes, you can guess it. This anime pretty much throws the big fat sign of \u201cbuy the light novel!\u201d My advice is don\u2019t. That money could be put into so much more value and it\u2019s a waste to spend it on this. Nonetheless, Death March loves to showcase Satou like he\u2019s some of saint in the show. And that gives me nothing more than a thumb down.\\n\\n\r\nSilver Link adapts this anime and it\u2019s sad to say but they dropped the ball. What could have been a beautiful world setting turned into mediocre junk. I\u2019ll be honest here. It\u2019s terrible. The CG is awkward along with the blend character designs. Even the main female protagonists all look like cheap cartoons made by amateurs. Most of them have the same face but with different color hair and body proportions. The fan service has incredibly cringe timings that I can\u2019t help but laugh in the wrong way. Action in the series is also poorly animated in terms of choreography and key animation. The body movements feels flat and it seems to me that this anime project was not taken seriously from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not usually one to jump on a character for their voice but my goodness, Satou\u2019s voice genuinely makes me wish they found a better VA. His voice sounds like it\u2019s putting us to sleep and lacks any personality. Even when he shows emotions, it feels incredibly forced with cheesy dialogue delivery. There\u2019s not one line in this show that I find memorable and that\u2019s because of his voice mannerisms. Sometimes, I wish there\u2019s a volume lower than mute. The theme songs aren\u2019t much better as it\u2019s incredibly generic made with lazy lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Death March was a challenge for me. What could have been a chance to showcase a watchable fantasy series turned into an abomination. By the time I finished watching this show, I felt a sigh of relief that the series ended up only receiving 12 episodes.  It should have just been left alone as a light novel instead. The adaptation has a dysfunctional story, uncharismatic character cast, and really gives isekai a bad name. In fact, I\u2019d say Death March almost made a show like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni look good.",

The entire work is a collection of bad judgment calls which worsen as the series progresses.\r\nThe main character, Satou, is without aspiration or emotion. Despite his lifelessness, he obtains wealth and power. The clear message being, he is a good guy, so the audience should go with it and follow him on his journey. \r\nAs if to immediately contradict this forcibly inserted sentiment, Satou begins collecting young sex slave girls. In fact,he treats all women as if they were dolls, dressing them up and feeding them. The sexual content with young children who act like children is unnecessary for plot or development. Arisa is a pedophile who attempts to rape a person she believes to be a 15 year old boy and the scene is glorified. \\n\\n\r\nThere should always be skepticism when labeling a work of fiction as misogynistic. The reason being, it is very difficult to know the intentions of the authors. A respectable person may write a character who does unspeakable things, and can even create redeeming message from those unmentionables. Skepticism is healthy when making an accusation. But to my surprise, Death March overshadows Terry Goodkind's \"The Sword of Truth\" in its misogynistic message. Even worse, it revels in it. The creed of sexism present in Death March extends well beyond the story, and frequently attempts to indoctrinate the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"hard\" magic/skill system of Death March grants Satou omnipotence. He is able to become skilled at anything in an instant. This includes raising his communication skills. Despite this, the dialogue paints him to be a simpleton. \\n\\n\r\nThe weak dialogue extends well beyond the main character. It does not develop the world or the characters. As such, it is unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nA general lack of care and effort places the art, animation and voice acting below average.\\n\\n\r\nI am relieved to find that no part of this series is redeemable; nothing is wasted when throwing it in the trash, where it belongs.\\n\\n\r\n1/10.",

            "content": "Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody seems almost as perfunctory as anime gets, as if to be the self-appointed embodiment of \u201canime today, 2018\u201d . By that same token, it manages to actually somewhat succeed at being incredibly basic and even generic (temporarily), because sadly, it's hard to find a show that can pull this off. Giving the finger to SAO, Re:Zero, and Isekai wa Smartphone, this is Death March\u2019s brief time in the limelight. \r\nI'm sure that at least some who are aware of my outlook on a variety of shows of Death  March's ilk are recognizing me as daft for evenglancing at this show's general direction. However, the intention goes far beyond having an excuse to malign another anime. Put it simply, I want to prove the existence of a hierarchy.\\n\\n\r\nEvery genre, and every category of entertainment has a relative and not entirely subjective hierarchy consisting of installments that are better than most, worse than the rest, or are somewhere within a grey area of sorts. Even the harem show has undisputedly better installments such as Ouran High School Host Club, and irrefutably awful ones as well, such as Isekai wa Smartphone. The school battle anime typically goes with the comparison of Chivalry of a Failed Knight to The Asterisk War for such a comparison. While some shows that are more commonly considered to be in the middle are treated like the worst of their kind, it wouldn't be fair to label them as such. Even genericism can be executed swimmingly or horrifyingly. When standards get low enough, competence can become startling. As for where this show stands in the isekai totem pole...well, an important enemy from episode 1 somehow died offscreen in the beginning of episode 2; this anime isn't exactly the savior anyone here is asking for.\\n\\n\r\nSlamming aside, this show isn\u2019t half bad. In fact at times it can be decent, even good. For example, the first 12 minutes are actually pretty great. We were shown a horrifyingly real depiction of the Japanese work industries, with people often staying for hours upon hours at their job, falling asleep there out of sheer exhaustion, not coming home for days at a time, and the workload being asinine. The directing by Shin Onima helps sell how dreary it all is, with incredibly harsh lights shining when the protagonist sits on a train to get to work in his sleepy state, and how silent everything is in the workplace in regards to background music until we transition into the primary setting of this anime. Hell, even when the surprisingly likable MC is transported to said game world setting (don't ask me how, this never makes sense no matter which anime pulls it, and most don't even explain themselves in some way), it still feels oppressive. When he first enters the game, we get to see Sato immediately become at least somewhat disillusioned with the idea of this being an ideal \u201cdream\u201d when he is attacked and writing with pain while bleeding, in a scene somewhat reminiscent of some of the better moments of Re:Zero\u2019s early portions. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there, it becomes a bit more hit and miss. While some aspects of the game make no sense (why would you need allow your character to learn language comprehension?), they did think about stuff like currency, tax, and the overall economics and societal rules in a simple and effective manner, unlike the convoluted and meaningless currency in say, Smartphone, that never gets brought up after the first instance. It somehow manages to be a pleasant watch at times, notably because of the main character, the constant music that blends in perfectly, and the occasionally pleasant misadventures Satou and his posse go through, and the surprisingly passable world-building. Sometimes, the show can feel dull and blas\u00e9, needlessly so. It doesn't help that the show does sink into some of the more loathsome temptations of its maligned brethren on occasion. It\u2019s annoying to see such practices continue since we\u2019ve come so used to the absolute bottom-tier dreck these kinds of anime shit out souleslly while removing anything they seemingly had in their LN counterpart (see Mahouka\u2019s main character as a known example of this). It does this further as it goes along too, as if the reviled temptation is increasingly difficult for them to resist. Due to this, the bare minimum of what should be considered acceptable can almost be seen as nigh-revolutionary. This really is like the \u201ctriple-A game industry\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nA large part of why this series works is Satou, our main character. On the surface, he seems like the run-of-the-mill insert, especially based on his appearance. Admittedly his reactions would be rather typical. However, he certainly isn't an awkward buffoon who only has a spine when the chips are down like most of his contemporaries are. Plus, a majority of the time, we actually see what he thinks about any given situation. It's actually rather amusing to hear him gush over every intricacy of his meals or react negatively to whatever bullshit someone gives him. Additionally, the main character often has to use his surroundings to adapt to new situations (with ease, but still, it's something) using strategies he comes up with on the fly with party members. The fact that we get to see actual strategies being employed when facing an enemy in say, a dungeon, is surprisingly not that common in MMORPG anime, if Sword Art Online has taught us anything. Him looking like Kirito in the early episodes of his show and being better at MMORPG culture and strategy than him makes him all the more glorious, especially when unlike nearly every other overpowered protagonist, he actually has a semblance of variety to his powers. To add on to how much of a cheeky fuck he is, when he wants to rename a female companion, he just translates their garbage name in Japanese, expecting no one to notice. The only real issue I have with him is that he doesn\u2019t bother leveling up his skills until the need for a specific skill becomes relevant for the first time. One could say it\u2019s so that he doesn\u2019t become boring and absurdly overpowered, but if he can do this already, and if he is already at level 310 by the end of the first episode when by the time we are \u2154 into the series, the highest leveled opponent has been level 50, then this excuse can no longer fly. That, and how he can get dull over time, though not by too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character can't carry such an annoyingly dull cast, however, as most of his posse feel less like dynamic characters, and more like largely distinct accessories for him. Obviously he doesn't feel this way about them, but as established, he\u2019s certainly less of an audience surrogate than many of his ilk. They're thankfully nowhere near as obnoxious as most female harem rosters such as Akashic Records or The Asterisk War, as none of them quite fit into the tired archetypes of harem characters. Additionally, each character is distinct from one another, unlike say, Smartphone. Not to mention that while not every female Satou collects is in love with him, it increases every so often, threatening to turn this pseudo-harem into an actual harem with leftovers. Arisa can get grating sometimes with her bullshit, making her probably the worst of the lukewarm bunch (aside from that one demon in episodes 3 and 4, whose voice was a spell meant to poison the ears), side-characters included. A majority of the villains are borderline worthless husks meant to serve as a \u201cstandard evil prick\u201d. Understandably this takes place in a video game but the antagonists really are just the Light Novel adaptation standard when they didn't entirely have to be. At least the villain in the second arc has some pretty decent and interestingly foreshadowed motivations.\\n\\n\r\nEasily the worst part, however, would be the production values. Even outside of the nice directing moments present in episode 1, and how they purposely instead sunlight saturation in certain moments of episode 2 to accentuate the wonder Satou feels about this new world he is in, there isn't much flare to speak of. The character designs look rather sharp, possibly too sharp, though improved over the original novel. Thankfully it isn't the LN standard but it's still not that pretty to look at. The action is not very well animated either. The magic spells cast have no flash or sense of spectacle like in Konosuba or Knight\u2019s & Magic. As mentioned earlier, there are some neat directing moments sprinkled throughout, but that\u2019s all they are: moments. Not all episodes even have those brief moments, and coupled together with terrible, sometimes even laughable action sequences, it\u2019s certainly little better than the rest of Death March\u2019s borderline pitiful visual presentation. \\n\\n\r\nI'm more than willing to believe that the 2D aspects were studio Silver Link and that the rest is Connect, given their repertoire and how Connect has never done a solo project. I say this because the CGI bears massive similarities to another joint project of theirs: Chaos Dragon. Thankfully there is no frame rate slow-down, aside from the CGI already having bad frame rates as is, but the CGI is both disturbingly prevalent and disconcertingly awful, with most soldiers being reduced to CGI armor models that look putrid, and many creatures being reduced to unintentional abominations due to the same hideous 3D model quality. Regardless, this show looks terrible and doesn\u2019t move well. It\u2019s a shame that somehow it\u2019s the production values that hold a light novel anime back more than anything else, as if this anime wasn\u2019t a bewildering rarity already.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is mixed as well, though it is conversely the best aspect of the show. The Opening, \"Slide Ride\u201d by Run Girls, Run!, is a damn good contender for \u201cmost generic-sounding anime OP\u201d, and needless to say, it wasn\u2019t very pleasing to listen to. The Ending theme, \"Suki no Skill\u201d by Wake Up, Girls! isn\u2019t much better, as it\u2019s another ending theme that isn\u2019t noteworthy. The rest of the music is pretty decent, actually feeling like decent video game music for once. This only applies when the characters are in the villages and not elsewhere. One minor jingle in particular even opts to make you feel like you've discovered or done something grand, and if there\u2019s one thing video game scores are fantastic at, it's giving off a sense of grandeur. The track pool even expands in the second half when things try to get more serious and full of dread and tension. There are some nice emotional tracks too, further making it a shame that the opening and ending themes that sandwich these tracks hold everything back.\\n\\n\r\nEven in this series' perfunctory existence, Death march manages to carve out a surprisingly rare niche among its contemporaries. Unfortunately, this speaks to the banality of this type of show more so than the quality of the show itself. A lot of the \u201ccompliments\u201d I gave it would be overlooked in most other shows given how basic they are for even most bad shows to accomplish. There are some genuinely nice moments here, visually, and emotionally, so to see the show succumb to temptation is aggravating. At the very least, if something like Isekai wa Smartphone was up your alley, this is worth viewing too, that way you find an infinitely superior product with a trick or two up its nonexistent sleeves. For now at least, I can say Death March thankfully didn't live up to its title in terms of viewing experience, awful finale notwithstanding, as it\u2019s surprisingly high up on this totem pole. Not bad for a modern LN Isekai title, let alone one considered part of the harem genre. It may not be good, but hey, baby steps.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the fact that people are treating this show like an endorsement of slavery is woefully disconcerting; please don't do what you tried going with Mahoutsukai no Yome.",

            "content": "Not my style. I'd recommend it to people who are fans of 'harem' & 'ecchi', but as a 'shonen'/'adventure' story it's very poor. Nothing you (probably) haven't seen many times before. Most of the show is the MC talking to the women in his harem and making them blush (seriously).\r\nThe main character is your average MC, he does good, he randomly helps people, etc. He's also absurdly OP. He struggles for a second but then levels up over 300 levels (literally), maxes out his skills and gets bottomless amounts of money. So any tension or intrigue of how he will survive is gone.\r\nThe harem dynamicsare your average harem dynamics: almost every female falls for the main character and blushes in every scene (literally). Also, the lolicon factor is HEAVY in this.\\n\\n\r\nThere's almost no action, and the action is VERY low budget. So low so that in ep 4 they showed still images of fights with monsters instead of actual animated scenes of the fights. But it simply bored me, and I just want to write this to let people know that, if you don't love harem stories and OP MCs in stories trapped in video games, this probably isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nI think most of us have memorized these type of stories along with their settings, dynamics, etc. But if this sounds fun to you, well, I hope you have fun.\\n\\n\r\nAt times I see how this show would be endearing for some people, and at the end of ep 5 there was a glimpse that there could be a half-decent plot, but that is overwritten by the disturbingly creepy pedophilic elements. It's one thing to just have kawaii little girl characters as decorations to make jokes, but it's another to have them all be in love with the MC, trying to seduce the MC, kiss  him and then sleeping naked with him in the same bed. Sorry, I'm out. \\n\r\nIt kinda even makes me embarrassed 'cause these type of things are what makes otakus seem like creeps.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to pick on the show too much because it's a low budget production, but I'm just being honest with my viewing experience.\\n\r\nAnd I've had A LOT of fun watching 'Trapped in video games' or shonens with stories modeled those type of narratives. Despite their MANY flaws, I'm a casual fan of stories like 'Gate', 'Log Horizon', 'No Game No Life', 'Re:Zero', 'Overlord', 'DanMachi', 'Hai to Gensou Grimgar', and can even overlook SAO's flaws to just have fun with the action scenes. I couldn't have fun with this.",

            "content": "The measure of an individual is what one does when in possession of true power. The greater one's power, the more options one has at one's disposal; choosing the path that benefits the greatest possible number is the noblest path when many alternatives are available, especially paths focused purely on oneself. Satou is someone who takes the high road and never strays from it.\r\n(This review is being written in response to a flood of negative reviews that completely misrepresent Death March. I am so displeased by the rating that I set up a MAL account just to write this.)\r\nWhen we acknowledge that the isekai genrehas been saturated, to say the least, we need to look for differentiating factors. A key point of differentiation is the viewpoint from which the protagonist approaches the new world to which he has been spirited away. The majority of isekais take a youthful and user-centric lens: a gamer teen or a teen / young adult hikikomori. The viewpoints inherent in such a background are limited by the age and by the mindset that said protagonists bring to their worlds. Satou comes to his new world as a builder (one of the lead programmers) and as a working adult - Death March is an isekai where the Game Master is the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nMany isekais are focused on the leveling up aspect (I have fond memories of playing games like Legend of Mir 3 and grinding away). However, what if you accidentally started out at level 310? Death March shows Satou being the coach to his party, so to speak. It's one thing to be an edgy teen trying to perfect your levels, fighting to achieve top dog status; it's a completely different story to already be on the top of the dominance hierarchy and to instead nurture the growth of others. I was a swimming instructor in high school and predominantly had a lot of female students aged 4 to 12 - watching Satou nurture his crew is the embodiment of what it means to be a teacher. Giving them room to experiment, being ever-present to back them up, and always being ready to teach through example - Satou is a man, not a boy. If you cannot relate to the MC, reflect on that.\\n\\n\r\nI picked up this anime last week when 3 episodes were available and the moment I was hooked was when it finally entered RPG mode and Satou started being a team leader. Thereafter I binged the entirety of the available manga and am now the proud owner of the 4 available light novels with the 5th pre-ordered.\\n\\n\r\nI want to close this review by mentioning the unique focus Death March places on imbuing RPG dynamics continually throughout the narrative. There are isekais that will skew towards the fantasy element, leaving the RPG elements as a backdrop; in Death March, the game elements play a central role in how Satou interfaces with the world. Death March is very precise on roles, skills, title acquisitions, the continual use of the menu etc - a detail to be appreciated by gamers and devs. As someone who has been working in tech, I can appreciate the mindset that Satou brings to acquiring new skills. This is truly a dev's mind on display - we are always reminded that this is a technologist with a Game Master interface, interacting with a fantasy-like environment.\\n\\n\r\nIn my mind, this is a solid 8/10 anime for the new perspective that it brings to the isekai genre. Don't come here for depth; don't come here for romance. Watch Death March if you want to see how level grinding, skill development, and team development look like from a coach's perspective. Watch Death March if you want to a explore the [builder] mindset, rather than the [user] mindset. Watch Death March if you're interested in exploring the isekai-context question: [How should I act if I am already the most powerful?] rather than [How can I become the most powerful?]. For, if we have not considered the endgame, we are not prepared to commence the journey. Death March is the endgame that all future isekais should consider.",

            "content": "MAL has words to match the numbers when putting up a score, but I haven't figured out if Dreadful (2) is worse than Pathetic (1) yet - This summarizes the rest of this review.\r\nTo put it short, DM (shortened for the show) is an Isekai, meaning that the story takes place in a \"new\" world rather than just having a different universal setting. There are a few Isekai animes already out, and even more mangas not yet adapted. Short story Shorter; The plot of most of the Isekai stories can be summarized to \"Guy somehow ends up in another world. The other world is afantasy world where anything from tolkien to new inventions will show up. The guy \"searches for a way to get back\" but never tries, and merely goes about \"exploring the world\" until the author runs out of ideas.\\n\r\nSimply put, if well done these stories could sometimes be entertaining, I don't have anything against them and I do enjoy a few of them; RE:monster for example.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of DM however is.. pathetic. \"A guy overworks himself, dies, ends up in a fantasy world where he instantly gets OP up until \"lvl 300\" or something by killing a bunch of lvl 50 lizards (Whoa). He sets off to explore the world and eventually get back home, but will only end up collecting a harem of underage girls.\" - If this is what you're after storywise, I won't call you stupid for being so; This kind of story appeals to quite a lot of people, and even though i'm personally not a fan and the \"plot\" can be completely described within those 4.5 lines, I shouldn't judge anyone for liking it. When I read this manga I got bored of it due to being passive, but considering that I'm laughing at the quality of the anime it proves enough to me that the story itself isn't the MOST pressing issue I had with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is horrible, low-quality blurry stillframe pictures for minutes per episode, many angles are wrong, faces look different from the same angles in different scenes, I can go on.\\n\r\nI'll also mention that the animating used for everything is as cheap as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nThe musc is just low quality, it doesn't match anything.\\n\r\nVoice acting isn't awful save for the MC and the elf guy, but the lines are.. bad. The script is simply awful.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in this show is monotone, but that's nothing you shouldn't expect from after having read my opinion of the story. Having monotone characters are sometimes a good thing, character progression is only needed for a few characters in most shows and when emphasized it often ruins the quality, but having no character diversity or progression tells me that the script is awful.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize all this yet again, this show has no highlights - it might appeal somewhat to some people for what it sets out to be, but the presentation is too bad to be praised. Personally I don't like the story very much, the script (The character lines) are edgy and unnatural, the art is low quality (low production cost), the intro, outro, SFX and \"OST\"s are low quality (low production cost) and the characters are way too bland and badly animated to make for even an acceptable harem (if you're into that).\\n\\n\r\nI will however give this show a 2 in overall ranking since I enjoyed some laughs in the animation used for the ants flying into the barrier in ep6.\\n\\n\r\nI decided a few weeks ago to watch this to the end just so that I could see how bad it would progress, and I will keep to that decision, but don't follow in my footsteps since this is a bad practise and may hurt your future unless you're hardened enough.\\n",

(Like a reverse Overlord) Instead he wants to see whats around and be surrounded by girls under the ageof 15. (Since 13+ are legal) While also talking in depth about how whatever hes eating tastes. o and the the two little animal girls favorite word is meat for some ungodly reason, its easily the most used word in the anime.(if you catch my drift, you'll understand why i think this is bad)\\n\\n\r\nThe situations they are put into are so light hearted it reminds me of Pokemon(but Pokemon is far better in general)\\n\\n\r\nThe only story I've seen the goal is to get all the little girls he can into his harem. There are episodes where they literally do nothing but talk about food for 50% of the run-time.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the MC is ultra powerful his thought process is to b-rate the weak lvl 30's then begrudgingly \"i guess i should fight but i dont want to be popular...\" (hes lvl 300+ and the highest lvl enemy hes fought was 52...) Then the proceeds to get throw for a loop by a level 41. (Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nIf you like cute stuff and dont mind just about everything else you might like this.

            "content": "Death March to a Parallel World Rapsody is very refreshing and relaxing anime, it's not great desconstructor like Konosuba or Rezero was, but it did well on what it tried to do and that is, nothing. Yes, you did not read wrong, this anime is a very simple Slice of Life on a parallel world, nothing more, nothing less. At the start of the anime, you see a little of Satou's past life, as a proggramer, to me that was actually very important and fresh, because I always found myself asking: \"what the hell Kazuma or Subaru did on their past lives\". It's just somethingthat won't matter anyway to the main plot of most isekai anime, but it's nice to see more of the character, even tough Satou may be seen as an self-insert character(to me he is, as I'm also game developer), not everyone can relate easily to him, expecially his logic. I mean, most of you would like to be some kind of overlord on another world, but to Satou and to myself as well, he did the right choice, of hiding his powers and make himself as a simple merchant. Even though he is most probably the stronger person on that world. But what he want is really enjoying a happy life with the girls he took to be their guardians. I mean, they may be his slaves as that world says, but he takes care of all of them, as if they were his child. Unfortunately the only female characters with some sort of relevance or at least a bit developed is Arisa, so I'll get to her in a bit. First of, Arisa in the inside is a grown-up woman from japan, as is Satou, so her action do make sense, even though she is in a child's body. She also is the character responsible for most perverted moments in this show. \\n\r\nAnother strong point of this anime, in my opinion, is the Art, the characters and scenery are beatifull, even though the animation lacks a lot, a few episodes had action enough to take the score down, so for the part of illustratring the scenery and characters, silver link did a well done job. The sound is also gorgeous, both OP, ED and the music at the end of episode 10 are magnific, as well as the BGS at overall.\\n\r\nYou can't say I didn't enjoy this anime because I really enjoyed it up, it was a very refreshing anime with the \"another world\" theme.\\n\\n\r\nIn overall, this anime is better appreciated if you like isekais and can get through the first episode, as it makes the anime look like another battle isekai.\\n\r\nIn summary:\\n\r\nStory 5\\n\r\nArt 9\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nCharacter 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nOverall grade: 8",

            "content": "\"Acquired Title: Buffoon\"\r\nThe anime industry is no stranger to Isekai anime. Hugely popularised by Tenchi Muyou in the previous century it has come a long way for better and for worse. Death March is another of those fantasy cliche harem Isekai with an OP MC not unlike last year's infamous Isekai Smartphone. Where was Death March different? Was it better? Is it watchable? Let us see.\r\nStarting off strong, Death March started off with a guy named Satou who is a 29 y/o programmer and is transported to a fantasy game where he becomes OP almost immediately. What I liked about the starting was that itdidn't jump off straight into the harem action and instead gave a small backstory about the MC. Sadly it was completely washed out by (guess what?) all the harem action that followed and till the end we followed one formula: Problem occurs, Satou learns of it, Satou solves it, Girl gets picked up and attracted to Jesus-kun, next episode. This formula to be honest completely exhausted my interest and dropped the score down to a 6 to which it still stands. The story I've got to say tries to be unique but since it throws all these cliche situations and doesn't stop using the same formula repeatedly it falls short of a good score. Frankly I couldn't be disappointed more than this. I had expected the story to be way better than Isekai Smartphone but even though it DID improve it didn't improve to the point I'd hoped it would. Does that make it good? No. Simply because it was too lacking in the story dept to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nDeath March mixed two things I strongly started to dislike as I watched more anime, Lolis and harems. I was a fan of the latter before but quickly lost interest due to the lack of innovation in the genre. Death March is a perfect example of that, wasted potential. It had bright looking caracters but that's all they were. Flat. No personality apart from a few unique features and a hard on attraction towards Jesus-kun for some reason. Now the show does have it's good points even though they are few in number. The soundtrack is good and nice to hear and fit the theme perfectly, quite shocking because Death March failed in almost every other aspect. It's art was vibrant and all but it's few fight scenes let me down and the fight scenes themselves felt short and half-assed. They could have done a much better job with that. \\n\\n\r\nFlat Characters, weak story, OP MC. What else is there to note about Death March? Nothing more since that's all that this and other modern Isekai anime are about. It's hard to come by good Isekai these days simply because the SAO effect is still on going and I can't wait for the next decade when hopefully this trend dies out and we get some actual innovation in the anime industry for once. Needless to say I didn't find Death March enjoyable and apart from a few minutes was boring to watch. Characters like Arisa had a lot of potential because of their \"could-be-amazing\" story especially since Arisa's backstory was quite unique and if explored could do much better but no. They had to focus in Satou's oh so powerful skills and the way he picks chicks just HAD to get extra screentime. I won't be surprised if we get an OVA and the same goddamn formula is used there as well. Mark my words, this WILL happen. You see if it doesn't. That is, if this shovelware even GETS an OVA, which unfortunately looking at Japan's taste in OP Characters is all but unapproved of.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could Death March have done better? It could have made the characters more believable and given some personality to them instead of using then as Waifu material which I'm sure the otaku masses will still gladly feed on without noticing that the characters are a textbook example of how characters SHOULDN'T be made and that Death March is such a huge tribute to last year's Isekai Smartphone. I already got started on that before so I'll try not to spew more on Isekai Smartphone. Now since I do my new format reviews, I do not do the scores until after I'm done writing but I won't be surprised if it gets a 5 or way less. Frankly if you force me to be the most conservative person out there I will say this then \"Death March could be considered mediocre since it does most of the things bad but since that's how almost all Isekai anime are like this it's considered mediocre\" since that's unfortunately the case with the anime industry today. Since when were such anime considered mediocre I'll never know, but eh, I'll have to mark it that way then else it'd be unfair to other Isekai anime like Isekai Smartphone.\\n\\n\r\nLooking for a good Isekai to watch? First off, good and Isekai have never been further apart. Now that statement was an exaggeration if I do say so myself since as with everything in this world there's always exceptions. Isekai anime weren't always as shit as they look like in this decade and you don't need me to tell you that if you are a long time anime watcher. If you ask me a recent Isekai that WAS good I'd gladly recommend KonoSuba to you not because it's just so funny and it ranks third in my favorite comedies but the fact it's a refreshing take on the Isekai genre simply because it is a middle finger to the Isekai genre itself. It parodies and takes those Isekai cliches and makes fun of them. Meanwhile another good Isekai you could watch is Isekai Seikishi Monogatari which is a Tenchi Muyou spin-off (the title I mentioned earlier) and is frankly my personal favorite Isekai since it not only has a proper centered plot but it divides the episodes into two parts the first being all the fanservice and the second being all the plot so it helps as everyone gets what they want. \\n\\n\r\nWhatever the matter. If you do choose to watch the anime I recommended or instead decide to watch Death March or Isekai Smartphone, keep in mind that this is a genre heavily influenced by the SAO effect and that it doesn't look like that effect will hold down soon. Yet there's still light at the end of the tunnel. Will we see a good Isekai sometime soon? I sure do hope so. As for now, time to wait for the second season of Isekai Smartphone (groans inside)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 4.2\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I rarely do my best girl columns since I made my new format but I'll bring it back next time since I didn't find anyone in Death March interesting. Maybe Liza was a bit fun to watch in the earlier episodes and Nana was cute but no one interested me much to call them the \"best girl\". So apologies hardcore Otakus.",

            "content": "Ok, im mad. Almost all reviews for this anime are unironical 8 out of 10's or higher. Whatever, lets get into this review. \r\nFirst of. The story, or lack thereof. There is no overall direction with it. It\u2019s not going anywhere. It\u2019s like the writers just wanted to show off cute girls and halfway through writing realized that they had to give the show some sort of substance. Any drama that is supposed to happen never carries any weight because it\u2019s never built up and whatever villain that appears doesn't have any substantial motive. It is obvious that they're there because the writers have achecklist that they must complete. The latest villain, some random mage literally tells the main characters exactly where to go. Kidnaps the newest girl that is too be added to the mc\u2019s harem. And then the mc has too work his way up a bunch of floors too finally reach the evil guys\u2019 chamber. That is such a stereotypical damsel in distress type story that i don\u2019t even know what's going on. All they need now is a tower and a dragon. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters...\\n\r\nIt\u2019s ok to just have a slice of life story that doesn't go anywhere but if you\u2019re going to do that, focus on the characters. Develop them. In slice of life the characters and how they behave in their daily life is supposed to be what carries the show. Konosuba shined in this very way. This show does not. Zena for example is so boring, bland and she actually has no defining character traits. She's just a polite girl who fell in love with our main because the plot told her too. At least the demihumans bring a little shred of comedy (even if i have seen all these types of jokes before). But that is all they are there for and since the comedy isn\u2019t anything new it gets old after a while. So the show doesn't go a more Konosuba character driven route or a more serious story driven route and as such completely falls apart. Don\u2019t halfass two things, tryhard one. \\n\\n\r\nLastly\u2026 the mc. Wow, what a disappointment. I can\u2019t even begin to express how much seeing his character turn into nothing hurt me. He started off strong, you see most anime mc\u2019s are teens. Usually around 15. So when i heard that this guy was going to be in his 30\u2019s i got hyped. I hoped this was going to bring some mature thinking too the show. I thought he, being 30 would have developed some type of character. A personality. Him being loved by a bunch of kids around the age of 15 was certainly going to be interesting. How were they gonna handle that. They didn\u2019t. The mc in this show is painfully bland with no defining personality traits whatsoever and the fact that he's an adult isn\u2019t adressed or ever even touched on. Not explored. In fact as icing on the cake they put him back into his 15 year old body when he gets teleported into the fantasy world. It is as if they wanted too really let the viewers know that this anime wasn\u2019t going to do anything different. Of course he\u2019s your stereotypical, nice guy, emotionless, always smiling, plain, bland, harem mc that you\u2019ve seen before thousands of times if you actually watch anime. \\n\\n\r\nOh and btw, the animation sucks. Don\u2019t even make me touch on the lack luster fight-scenes that more resemble still panning shots (i'm referring too later fight-scenes as the first one in episode 1 actually had actual animation and carried a little weight). Oh and btw, the show started strongly. The mc starts off with nothing in a world that he knows nothing about. He\u2019s low leveled and we actually get to see him struggle and hurt. Legitimate emotions are being brought out here and thats why im so mad that the show then turned into what it turned into. Because it started off really down to earth with the mc pulling all-nighters at his office and then actually struggling in the fantasy world if even only for like 10 minutes of episode 1. But then the mc of course reaches the max level in one fight by literally wiping out an entire army with meteors. Yeah, f\u2019ck this show. \\n",

            "content": "\u00ab I\u2019m not into loli but \u00bb Satoo, just before beginning his loli journey.\r\nDisclaimer: This review contain a lot of spoilers, if you have not seen the show, please don\u2019t, if you already have feel free to read. \r\nStory\r\nThis anime is about two things : food porn, particularly \u201cmeat porn\u201d (you didn\u2019t planned to become a vegan ? Now you will) and pedo moments. 45% of the time, characters are eating / searching for food or buying some useless things because there\u2019s a need to fill this empty anime, 45% is full of that creepy thing about those 10 years old slaves kids showing theirlove to the main character and the 10% left is about random things that happen that our hero resolve by upgrading his skills. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like the author had one thing in mind doing this anime : \u201c Ok, those prepubescent kids are in love with fan-service ? Let\u2019s make an anime where everything is about that ! We\u2019ll put some furry, with animals ears and tails, they will be able to fantasize and masturbate on it ! Make them slaves, that\u2019s more sexual. Let\u2019s give them 10 years old, no personality. Now let\u2019s make them cry every 5 minutes about how they are hungry or how much they love the main character ! That\u2019s perfect.\\n\r\n\u2026 Damn, but those characters have to do things in this world now, we need a plot\u2026 Mhhh... let\u2019s add random events that have nothing in common, btw nobody will care because they will all love that shitty sexual thing around my characters !\\n\\n\r\nThis anime have two important life lessons for you, the first is, if a woman is mad at you, just buy her stuff (like earrings and shit) . And if you face a problem, just cheat your way out of it (by upgrading your skill at the last second). The philosophical ethics is on point. And don\u2019t forget, if a 11 year girl want to fuck you, it\u2019s ok as long as she\u2019s mentally older!\\n\\n\r\nThere is no scenario: the plot for the season 1 is non existent, MC is catapulted in this new world and..  do nothing except eating, buying stuff and sheltering every loli he met. The anime try to give us some interest by suggesting the MC is the new hero who will kill the demon king (how original), but because Satoo is OP, nobody can kill him, there is no sense of danger, and therefore no progression possible, and unlike one punch man, the situation is not nearly as funny.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nI must admit the cast of characters is really diverse, you have a loli cat girl, a loli dog girl, a loli princess, a loli innkeeper's daughter. In fact Death march must really have a population problem, because 90% of the people are prepubescent girl there. There is only one and i really mean ONE other dude on this anime who have more than 2 line of dialogue (but is a clich\u00e9 btw), and he literally do nothing significant. It\u2019s like the guy behind the story had some ideas for the plot but after 5 minutes of reflexion, got bored.\\n\\n\r\nSato: your generic kirito dude, he\u2019s overpowered, he\u2019s boring as hell, he have 0 charisma ( special mention to his submissive voice who try to sound calm) and the ladies love him because he is rich and nice.\\n\\n\r\nGirl\u2019s harem: In Death March, every girl of the harem are both walking clich\u00e9(the shy one, the energetic/happy etc..) and so similar that they don\u2019t even deserve a specific description. They all are half retarded (compared to them the hero seems like a genius), in love with the MC for no reason and zero personalities (well with nearly no backstories behind it must be logical)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSatoo\u2019s seiyuu died halfway of the first episode (18:10 you can check by yourself) and was replaced at that point by someone with an oyster charisma (RIP).\\n\r\nWe will not talk about the flying enemy monster who sounds so comically bad it would be fun if this anime was a parody, unfortunately, it isn\u2019t.\\n\r\nThe accelerated voice sounds when they throw a spell is fucking weird and hurt my earring. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is ok, nothing memorable except two at the end of the Tree arc and the ending of ep 10, too bad you will only hear them once.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nYour generic fantasy universe mixed with cat girl, dog girl and even lizard girl because why the fuck not? As long as it look like a loli you\u2019re free to go. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like dragon ball super and powerpoint had a child, and that child got hit by a truck. Two frame fight, an abuse of fixed plane, blurry effect everywhere. Very weird color choice (the food look so bad, with no texture and wrong colors that it look like someone puked them). The animation is cheap and easy but unlike Mcdonalds, it doesn't feel satisfying to watch. Graphism are comparable to what was produced 10 years ago\\n\r\nLight effects are ok tho.\\n\\n\r\nCan we talk about Arisa hair color changing every scene for no reason? Or recycling of background whenever it\u2019s possible  (one of the most blatant example is when Satoo is travelling and you see the same house every 2 second)\\n\r\nThe 3d part feel out of place and is just plain ugly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAfter 5 episode of disturbing child sexualinnuendo, food and nonsense, i fell asleep several times during episode 6. So I rewound to see what I had missed and there was only loli, food, and an ants army that was useless as fuck. \\n\r\nThe first episodes, it was funny to make fun of the anime, but you know, the shortest jokes are the best. After some episodes, it became painful to watch. It was just a set of non-funny jokes used again and again until the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n\r\n Chryn and Naryun.\\n",

Another man sucked into game anime, they're probably going to mess it up, it's not going to be original...\"\r\nI'm happy to be proven wrong. The protagonist is a computer game programmer who gets sucked into some sort of game world that he seems to have help code or take part of coding. The game was a hardcore MMORPG before, but was recently patched so that it'd be more casual player friendly. He went to sleep, and woke up inthe game.\\n\\n\r\nI do enjoy this anime a lot, because it's like playing a game getting tons of hacks, and granted free-roam, free-creation, free-interactions. Makes you ponder what would you do in the situation the protagonist has found himself in? Will he desire to return to the real world? Would he want to stay in this one? Sure he's OP now, but will he continue to be OP? What happened that caused him to be here? Etc.\\n\\n\r\nIt reminds me a lot of Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, a touch of Druaga and Overlord, it's getting a little harem-like, but women flocking to powerful and rich men isn't really something that hard to believe. Often times the stories are the same, just the setting is different. I haven't enjoyed an anime like this for a long time. Not since Log Horizon, and SAO. I do spend my weeks looking forward to the next episode.",

But plot still nothing special, just a nice guy named Satoo who very overpower helping many people. Oh WOW... what a nice guy. Satoo didn't want everyone know about his super power, but look at this! I can jump so god damn high! Look at this look at this! I can do everything that I doesn'tgood at so completely perfect after one try!\\n\\n\r\nArt is mediocre,  with some CGI in it (in unimportant scene; like traveling in horse). Nothing special with combat effect. Character design not that epic. So nothing special but still 'edible'.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I hate most in this anime is character development. Yes. It seems like AI (maybe cuz it was a game). But the protagonist, it seem to usual and nothing special in him. \\n\\n\r\nBut yes, it can waste of my time quickly, I think I enjoy it!

It focuses around an overpowered mr. nice guy Jesus named Satou who saves women from slavery among other things with the powers of an I.T. guru, and makes them his property.\r\nThe events include mr. nice guy raping and pillaging like a viking, except he does the polar opposite because he is nice. Other characters in this series are women. Slave girls 1-7 and a knight. Most of them are very much into mr. nice guy but he himself is a nice guy who doesn't use women. We shan't never know what type of aglopping sound this guy makes. \\n\\n\r\nWhat about the most common quality trait in anime: character development? Satou is already perfect so naturally, he isn't developed, but our main girls and side chicks all like Satou more at the end than in the beginning =  character development. The best part is how much this makes sense, after all, there is no reason to not like the guy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sounds follow the average production values which have been the standard for anime since 2013. Nothing to complain there. Just name your favorite hair color and there is a girl who has it. Smart choices. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, I haven't had this much fun with something that is close to unwatchable since Shingeki no kyoujin S01 aired.

            "content": "Man, I don't even know where to begin.  I always watch a few seasonal anime and try to follow through, regardless of whether they are good or bad.  But this show is maybe the first show to actively really bother me, and it bothers me more and more every week.  I'm basically watching it to get angry now.  And part of my frustration for the show may be misplaced because I've seen several youtubers tear apart SAO for misogyny, and yet give this show a pass, where this show is one of the most misogynistic pieces of trash I've ever seen.\r\nSo,firstly, on the surface, the show looks alright.  It is another Isekai show.  It also has a surprisingly great first episode before immediately descending into everything that follows.  It is the most ridiculous example of a power fantasy that I've ever seen.  And I am not a person that typically has a problem with power fantasies, harems, or wish-fulfillment in shows.  I get that it is fiction, and there are reasons people seek out shows like that, and I think there is a place for them.  But this show does something different and way worse.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on out, I will address specifics of the show, so SPOILER WARNING (although there has really been no plot up to the 5th episode when I'm writing the review).  A videogame designer gets sucked into a fantasy world that is reminiscent of a couple of the MMO worlds he has worked on.  And for whatever reason, he basically instantly has access to debug skills and can immediately max all of his skills, yet for some reason only ever maxes them right before he needs them.  Like, he'll have a conversation and be like 'Oh Crap, I should max diplomacy now so I can convince them', even though he may as well just make himself Superman right away.  The show gets weirdly hung up on things like turning into momentary food porn or getting oddly fixated buying new clothes and dressing up the harem girls.  It is really not focused at all and keeps bouncing back and forth between seemingly random things, yet the vibe is really all to service the idea that these harem girls are essentially pets.  From what I've seen the show's general tone is 'look how awesome and kind he is, now lets dress up these girls and feed them and let everyone know how indebted to him they are'.  But the weirdest thing is, his harem is made up of pretty much all slaves.  So, their owners are defeated (or he buys some of them), and then he doesn't free them, but he keeps them as slaves, yet the show presents this as a good/kind thing to do.  They've essentially stated that the girls couldn't handle being free, so the kind thing to do is keep them as slaves, but be nice to them and give them lots of treats.  So he orders them around and raises their skills, and buys them presents, or gives them money to buy presents, and then lets them sleep in a stable.  It is so fundamentally bizarre that all his actions keep getting presented as the noble thing.  But then things get especially weird in Episode 5 when he gets 2 more slaves who are super young, one of which is 11 and I think the other is 14. Then they go to a hotel room and strip to have sex with him, because they clearly used to be sex slaves.  He's like 'You don't need to do that anymore' and the show once again presents him as being a hero, meanwhile he's like 29 and chose not to sleep with an 11 year old.  Then in his sleep, the 11 year old casts a charm spell on him and gets on him naked because she 'apparently' got horny and wanted to service him, and the show shows him 'heroically' overpower the mind control and not have sex with a kid, and then they sleep in bed together, her naked.\\n\\n\r\nI seriously don't know what to say about this show.  It's pretty incredibly disgusting.  I'm pretty much only watching it to get angry now.  This is honestly one of the worst, most shallow, vapid shows I've ever seen in my life.",

If I wanted to describe the whole series with few words and without any spoilers I would say: The story is like a good dream: \r\n- happy-go-luckyall the way long\\n\r\n- generic but well-made beautiful setting\\n\r\n- the dreamer is a hero, doing hero-things\\n\r\n- meets nice people and gathers them around him\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest: This is a really simple story-concept - do not expect anything deep or outstanding. It is just a nice dream. But if you are interested in Ichirou's dream, you will get rewarded. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, always fits the atmosphere and the series in all. What I especially liked is the GUI which Ichirou frequently interacts with. They really made everything fit the fanatsy-RPG style.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtracks suit the setting very well too. I also liked the OP and ED. Don't know much more to say here though.\\n\\n\r\nThe charakters beside the MC are mainly girls admiring him - exactly like woud want them to be in your dream. Nothing deep to find here too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is what the whole anime is about. You are getting invited to Ichirou's dream and as your host he really wants to make this show comfortable and enjoyable for you. He is a really good host.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nA very well-made happy-go-lucky fantasy RPG anime with a plain story and plain characters. Offers no deepness but may be the perfekt show for you if you just want to relax and dream a bit.",

I\u2019m not trying to coerce you into reading my review by starting off with a lame sarcastic statement. Just bear with me for a bit. Now Death March has a typical isekai plot that is generic in every sense of the word. The visuals and soundtrack are plain, and the protagonist is yet another incomprehensibly dull Kirito knockoff.  But this anime is truly unique in that out of the entire lead female cast, none of them have BIG BOOBS. That\u2019s right, allof the important girls in this show either have modest chests or are lolis. Now I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve seen a plethora of harem/eiichi/isekai/anime with a bunch of girls in them, and these shows always showcase at least one main female character with large breasts who usually ends up at the butt of at least one boob joke. Not Death March. I was honestly in shock when I discovered this, and I can say without a doubt that the lack of boobs is incredibly original for this type of anime. So if you\u2019re an avid supporter of voluptuous breast, then you\u2019d best find something else to watch. However, if you just so happen to be a lolicon, then you might actually enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, that's only if you found anything else about Death March to be good, which I unfortunately didn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nI really didn\u2019t want to dislike this anime. I actually don\u2019t go into isekai anime and think, \u201cUgh, I just know I\u2019m going to hate this because its unoriginal. I\u2019m definitely going to give it a low score!\u201d before I even watch the show. However, Death March unfortunately ended up being not only generic, but poorly executed as well. One of the biggest issues that I have with this anime is the fact that it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. As far as I can tell, there are no goals or objectives that the main character is trying to achieve, and all Death March does is showcase this dude living in a fantasy town with his loli slaves and occasionally fighting weak monsters whenever they appear. And even the enemies who are built up to be potent forces are completely owned by the protagonist, thus completely removing any sense of excitement or tension in these actions sequences, resulting in some unbelievably dull moments. \\n\\n\r\nNow before I continue to discuss the failings with the general plot execution and story elements of Death March, I\u2019d first like to address what I found to be the most monumental error of the anime, which would be the main character.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is named Kazuto Kirigaya Knockoff, or KKK for short, and he is a dude who inexplicably gets transported to a fantasy world after falling asleep at work. Wow, Death March didn\u2019t even come up with any reason at all, much less a tangible one, as to why this guy got teleported to this world. Anyway, KKK is, wait for it\u2026completely overpowered from the get-go! How exciting! This guy can literally just max out any ability instantly whenever he feels like it and seems to be invulnerable to everything. Because why would anyone want to watch a character work hard to get strong when you can just start off invincible like KKK? But he\u2019s too modest to show off his immense power, so he usually lets others fight and die during battles while he puts in minimal effort. How heroic! He also purchased all but one of the main girls as slaves but decides not to free them because in his opinion, they\u2019re all happy as slaves because he\u2019s a good master. How noble! Finally, KKK\u2019s personality is, from what I could discern, nonexistent. Seriously, his mediocrity as a character is astounding.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the female characters receive substantial development and only succeed at looking cute. If written correctly, I believe that several of these characters had the opportunity to be interesting, but their lack of growth decimated the chances of this actually happening. Let\u2019s start off by analyzing Tama, Pochi, and Liza. The anime mentions how this trio is discriminated against by the general populous for being animal girls. Now the anime could have delved into illuminating the deleterious effects that this torment had on the mentality of these girls and their outlooks on society, but of course it doesn\u2019t. The girls\u2019 only character traits are that they\u2019re nice and like to eat a lot. At least the latter ties into the fact that the girls were malnourished under their previous master. The majority of the other girls in the anime receive similar treatment from the writers, which is unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nThe girl who stood out to me the most was Arisa, whose gimmicks were kind of cute and amusing, however the comedic value of her actions, such as her sexual advancements towards KKK, were lessened due to KKK\u2019s lack of reaction towards them. In order for comedy between two individuals to truly shine, both of them have to play their part. So although Arisa\u2019s flirtatious behavior was fun, since KKK didn\u2019t actually respond to it in any way, the scenes between them lost value in my eyes. Leave it to KKK to suck the joy out of everything. \\n\\n\r\nI believe I mentioned how the slave girls love food. Well, apparently the show\u2019s creator does as well, to the point where he decided it would be a fantastic idea to insert a plethora of random showcases of a variety of exquisite dishes into the show. What basically happens is that whenever KKK sits down to eat a meal, he goes off on an unnecessary explanation of the food\u2019s properties while the anime presents viewers with an image of the food that is more intricately animated than anything else in the anime. And this happens in literally every episode. Its like I\u2019m watching a cringy, mediocre version of Shokugeki no Soma, except this anime is supposed to be about a fantasy world, not food, so these scenes that last several minutes are completely worthless. Plus, I thought that this was a medieval setting, so where the heck did all of these exotic dishes from across the globe come from? Shouldn\u2019t they just be eating hard bread or something? I had to dedicate a paragraph to this because it just seems so absurd and out of place to me for an anime that isn\u2019t about food at all to dedicate so much time to characters eating.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it seems like I ran out of things to talk about. I know I said earlier in this review that I would eventually get to discussing the plot elements of the show and why they fail, but between you and me, that was just an excuse for me to move on and talk about something else. The truth is, Death March\u2019s so called \u201cplot elements\u201d are basically nonexistent, so there\u2019s practically nothing to actually discuss. This show is simply about a guy living in a fantasy world going about his day to day life with his loli slaves. Nothing noteworthy happens, and there is zero development in the story and characters. I have to give some credit to the show though, because although it was terribly boring to watch, for some reason I stuck with it, so I guess that\u2019s something. Maybe I was just waiting to see if KKK would eventually develop an actual personality and stop being a horribly boring and annoying character.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026It never happened.\\n\\n\r\nOh well. I honestly couldn\u2019t find anything that appealed to me in this anime, but I\u2019m sure there are some isekai fans out there who enjoyed it. Maybe even you. Now that this chapter in the great bibliography of isekai anime has concluded, its time to set our sights to the future of the genre. Hopefully upcoming installations will tell a more compelling tale than Death March.",

            "content": "Before actually deciding to watch this show called \u201cDeath March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku\u201d, I have to ask a question: do you really watch a show for enjoyment or do you watch a show to get the most out of it? When I sat down and decided to give this series a try, it felt like an anime that I would not have high expectations on. The premise, character visuals, and just overall idea of it sounds like a copy-paste story you can find in almost any light novel medium these days. But for Death March, this proved to be one of the blandest animeI\u2019ve seen in recent years even compared to similar premises. It\u2019s a literal slap to the face to anyone who expect this to be better than what it looks like.\\n\\n\r\nJust for reference, I have read the light novel and keeping it up with took a lot of commitment. I\u2019m actually close to dropping the LN series but this adaptation is on another level of trash. Taking place in a fantasy setting with RPG gimmicks, we got main protagonist Ichiro Suzuki (also known as \u201cSatou\u201d in the other world). His life changes one day after getting hit into an accident and wakes up in this unknown world. Sound familiar? I swear, you can literally pick up any light novel these days with a similar premise and the set up would be something similar. In the meantime, we follow Satou\u2019s adventure as he begins to adapt with his new life.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m just going to throw it out here. This show is extremely blend in terms of storytelling. My initial impression of the first few episodes were pretty much me struggling to stay awake. Not only is Satou an uninteresting protagonist but the story itself is devoid of emotions. It\u2019s actually a bit ironic since a show like this should have colorful world fiction to make the setting feel alive. What do we get instead? A group of one dimensional characters in a blend world that felt like it\u2019s part of a video game.  Or I should say, a broken video game. A polished game would have memorable characters but you\u2019ll find none of that in this series. Main protagonist Satou is not only just overpowered but also exhibits some disturbing personality if you read between the lines. The way he speaks, behaves, and interacts with certain characters is never engaging to watch. It doesn\u2019t help that his personality is dry to the bone and seemingly always acts the same with his harem. Oh, I did just say that word. Some people may not call this a harem but to me, this series is about as harem-esque as it can get. Consisting of mainly female characters, it doesn\u2019t take long for viewers to find out that they are fond of Satou. Arisa, Pochi, Tama, Zena, Nana. There\u2019s pretty much no character development for any of the main cast. Instead, most of them are there to interact with Satou in order to put him over. The only way to say there\u2019s any development is Satou\u2019s progress as a character as he acquires more skills. Bleh.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I guess there\u2019s some hope for the main story? The series does take place in a fantasy world and that can have potential, right? Wrong. The world building in the series is incredibly underwhelming as most places look bare and feel almost identical. If you\u2019ve seen one place, it feels like you\u2019ve seen them all. Bear in mind that as the series progresses, the world of Death March never evolves just like the weak character cast. The story feels more like a slice of life with occasional fighting and drama thrown in. My main issue in the story is just how meekly it\u2019s written. Story segments feel anticlimactic and lacks substance. It doesn\u2019t connect with the characters and never makes an impact. Pacing issues also puts this show to shame from the start as it never manages to salvage itself. Also, keep in mind that the light novel series has hundreds of chapters and this is a 12-episode anime adaptation. Yes, you can guess it. This anime pretty much throws the big fat sign of \u201cbuy the light novel!\u201d My advice is don\u2019t. That money could be put into so much more value and it\u2019s a waste to spend it on this. Nonetheless, Death March loves to showcase Satou like he\u2019s some of saint in the show. And that gives me nothing more than a thumb down.\\n\\n\r\nSilver Link adapts this anime and it\u2019s sad to say but they dropped the ball. What could have been a beautiful world setting turned into mediocre junk. I\u2019ll be honest here. It\u2019s terrible. The CG is awkward along with the blend character designs. Even the main female protagonists all look like cheap cartoons made by amateurs. Most of them have the same face but with different color hair and body proportions. The fan service has incredibly cringe timings that I can\u2019t help but laugh in the wrong way. Action in the series is also poorly animated in terms of choreography and key animation. The body movements feels flat and it seems to me that this anime project was not taken seriously from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not usually one to jump on a character for their voice but my goodness, Satou\u2019s voice genuinely makes me wish they found a better VA. His voice sounds like it\u2019s putting us to sleep and lacks any personality. Even when he shows emotions, it feels incredibly forced with cheesy dialogue delivery. There\u2019s not one line in this show that I find memorable and that\u2019s because of his voice mannerisms. Sometimes, I wish there\u2019s a volume lower than mute. The theme songs aren\u2019t much better as it\u2019s incredibly generic made with lazy lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Death March was a challenge for me. What could have been a chance to showcase a watchable fantasy series turned into an abomination. By the time I finished watching this show, I felt a sigh of relief that the series ended up only receiving 12 episodes.  It should have just been left alone as a light novel instead. The adaptation has a dysfunctional story, uncharismatic character cast, and really gives isekai a bad name. In fact, I\u2019d say Death March almost made a show like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni look good.",

            "content": "Death March is the worst isekai of all time. In fact, I want to call it the worst show of all time. Many elements of this show have no place in fiction. The entire work is a collection of bad judgment calls which worsen as the series progresses.\r\nThe main character, Satou, is without aspiration or emotion. Despite his lifelessness, he obtains wealth and power. The clear message being, he is a good guy, so the audience should go with it and follow him on his journey. \r\nAs if to immediately contradict this forcibly inserted sentiment, Satou begins collecting young sex slave girls. In fact,he treats all women as if they were dolls, dressing them up and feeding them. The sexual content with young children who act like children is unnecessary for plot or development. Arisa is a pedophile who attempts to rape a person she believes to be a 15 year old boy and the scene is glorified. \\n\\n\r\nThere should always be skepticism when labeling a work of fiction as misogynistic. The reason being, it is very difficult to know the intentions of the authors. A respectable person may write a character who does unspeakable things, and can even create redeeming message from those unmentionables. Skepticism is healthy when making an accusation. But to my surprise, Death March overshadows Terry Goodkind's \"The Sword of Truth\" in its misogynistic message. Even worse, it revels in it. The creed of sexism present in Death March extends well beyond the story, and frequently attempts to indoctrinate the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"hard\" magic/skill system of Death March grants Satou omnipotence. He is able to become skilled at anything in an instant. This includes raising his communication skills. Despite this, the dialogue paints him to be a simpleton. \\n\\n\r\nThe weak dialogue extends well beyond the main character. It does not develop the world or the characters. As such, it is unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nA general lack of care and effort places the art, animation and voice acting below average.\\n\\n\r\nI am relieved to find that no part of this series is redeemable; nothing is wasted when throwing it in the trash, where it belongs.\\n\\n\r\n1/10.",

            "content": "Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody seems almost as perfunctory as anime gets, as if to be the self-appointed embodiment of \u201canime today, 2018\u201d . By that same token, it manages to actually somewhat succeed at being incredibly basic and even generic (temporarily), because sadly, it's hard to find a show that can pull this off. Giving the finger to SAO, Re:Zero, and Isekai wa Smartphone, this is Death March\u2019s brief time in the limelight. \r\nI'm sure that at least some who are aware of my outlook on a variety of shows of Death  March's ilk are recognizing me as daft for evenglancing at this show's general direction. However, the intention goes far beyond having an excuse to malign another anime. Put it simply, I want to prove the existence of a hierarchy.\\n\\n\r\nEvery genre, and every category of entertainment has a relative and not entirely subjective hierarchy consisting of installments that are better than most, worse than the rest, or are somewhere within a grey area of sorts. Even the harem show has undisputedly better installments such as Ouran High School Host Club, and irrefutably awful ones as well, such as Isekai wa Smartphone. The school battle anime typically goes with the comparison of Chivalry of a Failed Knight to The Asterisk War for such a comparison. While some shows that are more commonly considered to be in the middle are treated like the worst of their kind, it wouldn't be fair to label them as such. Even genericism can be executed swimmingly or horrifyingly. When standards get low enough, competence can become startling. As for where this show stands in the isekai totem pole...well, an important enemy from episode 1 somehow died offscreen in the beginning of episode 2; this anime isn't exactly the savior anyone here is asking for.\\n\\n\r\nSlamming aside, this show isn\u2019t half bad. In fact at times it can be decent, even good. For example, the first 12 minutes are actually pretty great. We were shown a horrifyingly real depiction of the Japanese work industries, with people often staying for hours upon hours at their job, falling asleep there out of sheer exhaustion, not coming home for days at a time, and the workload being asinine. The directing by Shin Onima helps sell how dreary it all is, with incredibly harsh lights shining when the protagonist sits on a train to get to work in his sleepy state, and how silent everything is in the workplace in regards to background music until we transition into the primary setting of this anime. Hell, even when the surprisingly likable MC is transported to said game world setting (don't ask me how, this never makes sense no matter which anime pulls it, and most don't even explain themselves in some way), it still feels oppressive. When he first enters the game, we get to see Sato immediately become at least somewhat disillusioned with the idea of this being an ideal \u201cdream\u201d when he is attacked and writing with pain while bleeding, in a scene somewhat reminiscent of some of the better moments of Re:Zero\u2019s early portions. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there, it becomes a bit more hit and miss. While some aspects of the game make no sense (why would you need allow your character to learn language comprehension?), they did think about stuff like currency, tax, and the overall economics and societal rules in a simple and effective manner, unlike the convoluted and meaningless currency in say, Smartphone, that never gets brought up after the first instance. It somehow manages to be a pleasant watch at times, notably because of the main character, the constant music that blends in perfectly, and the occasionally pleasant misadventures Satou and his posse go through, and the surprisingly passable world-building. Sometimes, the show can feel dull and blas\u00e9, needlessly so. It doesn't help that the show does sink into some of the more loathsome temptations of its maligned brethren on occasion. It\u2019s annoying to see such practices continue since we\u2019ve come so used to the absolute bottom-tier dreck these kinds of anime shit out souleslly while removing anything they seemingly had in their LN counterpart (see Mahouka\u2019s main character as a known example of this). It does this further as it goes along too, as if the reviled temptation is increasingly difficult for them to resist. Due to this, the bare minimum of what should be considered acceptable can almost be seen as nigh-revolutionary. This really is like the \u201ctriple-A game industry\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nA large part of why this series works is Satou, our main character. On the surface, he seems like the run-of-the-mill insert, especially based on his appearance. Admittedly his reactions would be rather typical. However, he certainly isn't an awkward buffoon who only has a spine when the chips are down like most of his contemporaries are. Plus, a majority of the time, we actually see what he thinks about any given situation. It's actually rather amusing to hear him gush over every intricacy of his meals or react negatively to whatever bullshit someone gives him. Additionally, the main character often has to use his surroundings to adapt to new situations (with ease, but still, it's something) using strategies he comes up with on the fly with party members. The fact that we get to see actual strategies being employed when facing an enemy in say, a dungeon, is surprisingly not that common in MMORPG anime, if Sword Art Online has taught us anything. Him looking like Kirito in the early episodes of his show and being better at MMORPG culture and strategy than him makes him all the more glorious, especially when unlike nearly every other overpowered protagonist, he actually has a semblance of variety to his powers. To add on to how much of a cheeky fuck he is, when he wants to rename a female companion, he just translates their garbage name in Japanese, expecting no one to notice. The only real issue I have with him is that he doesn\u2019t bother leveling up his skills until the need for a specific skill becomes relevant for the first time. One could say it\u2019s so that he doesn\u2019t become boring and absurdly overpowered, but if he can do this already, and if he is already at level 310 by the end of the first episode when by the time we are \u2154 into the series, the highest leveled opponent has been level 50, then this excuse can no longer fly. That, and how he can get dull over time, though not by too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character can't carry such an annoyingly dull cast, however, as most of his posse feel less like dynamic characters, and more like largely distinct accessories for him. Obviously he doesn't feel this way about them, but as established, he\u2019s certainly less of an audience surrogate than many of his ilk. They're thankfully nowhere near as obnoxious as most female harem rosters such as Akashic Records or The Asterisk War, as none of them quite fit into the tired archetypes of harem characters. Additionally, each character is distinct from one another, unlike say, Smartphone. Not to mention that while not every female Satou collects is in love with him, it increases every so often, threatening to turn this pseudo-harem into an actual harem with leftovers. Arisa can get grating sometimes with her bullshit, making her probably the worst of the lukewarm bunch (aside from that one demon in episodes 3 and 4, whose voice was a spell meant to poison the ears), side-characters included. A majority of the villains are borderline worthless husks meant to serve as a \u201cstandard evil prick\u201d. Understandably this takes place in a video game but the antagonists really are just the Light Novel adaptation standard when they didn't entirely have to be. At least the villain in the second arc has some pretty decent and interestingly foreshadowed motivations.\\n\\n\r\nEasily the worst part, however, would be the production values. Even outside of the nice directing moments present in episode 1, and how they purposely instead sunlight saturation in certain moments of episode 2 to accentuate the wonder Satou feels about this new world he is in, there isn't much flare to speak of. The character designs look rather sharp, possibly too sharp, though improved over the original novel. Thankfully it isn't the LN standard but it's still not that pretty to look at. The action is not very well animated either. The magic spells cast have no flash or sense of spectacle like in Konosuba or Knight\u2019s & Magic. As mentioned earlier, there are some neat directing moments sprinkled throughout, but that\u2019s all they are: moments. Not all episodes even have those brief moments, and coupled together with terrible, sometimes even laughable action sequences, it\u2019s certainly little better than the rest of Death March\u2019s borderline pitiful visual presentation. \\n\\n\r\nI'm more than willing to believe that the 2D aspects were studio Silver Link and that the rest is Connect, given their repertoire and how Connect has never done a solo project. I say this because the CGI bears massive similarities to another joint project of theirs: Chaos Dragon. Thankfully there is no frame rate slow-down, aside from the CGI already having bad frame rates as is, but the CGI is both disturbingly prevalent and disconcertingly awful, with most soldiers being reduced to CGI armor models that look putrid, and many creatures being reduced to unintentional abominations due to the same hideous 3D model quality. Regardless, this show looks terrible and doesn\u2019t move well. It\u2019s a shame that somehow it\u2019s the production values that hold a light novel anime back more than anything else, as if this anime wasn\u2019t a bewildering rarity already.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is mixed as well, though it is conversely the best aspect of the show. The Opening, \"Slide Ride\u201d by Run Girls, Run!, is a damn good contender for \u201cmost generic-sounding anime OP\u201d, and needless to say, it wasn\u2019t very pleasing to listen to. The Ending theme, \"Suki no Skill\u201d by Wake Up, Girls! isn\u2019t much better, as it\u2019s another ending theme that isn\u2019t noteworthy. The rest of the music is pretty decent, actually feeling like decent video game music for once. This only applies when the characters are in the villages and not elsewhere. One minor jingle in particular even opts to make you feel like you've discovered or done something grand, and if there\u2019s one thing video game scores are fantastic at, it's giving off a sense of grandeur. The track pool even expands in the second half when things try to get more serious and full of dread and tension. There are some nice emotional tracks too, further making it a shame that the opening and ending themes that sandwich these tracks hold everything back.\\n\\n\r\nEven in this series' perfunctory existence, Death march manages to carve out a surprisingly rare niche among its contemporaries. Unfortunately, this speaks to the banality of this type of show more so than the quality of the show itself. A lot of the \u201ccompliments\u201d I gave it would be overlooked in most other shows given how basic they are for even most bad shows to accomplish. There are some genuinely nice moments here, visually, and emotionally, so to see the show succumb to temptation is aggravating. At the very least, if something like Isekai wa Smartphone was up your alley, this is worth viewing too, that way you find an infinitely superior product with a trick or two up its nonexistent sleeves. For now at least, I can say Death March thankfully didn't live up to its title in terms of viewing experience, awful finale notwithstanding, as it\u2019s surprisingly high up on this totem pole. Not bad for a modern LN Isekai title, let alone one considered part of the harem genre. It may not be good, but hey, baby steps.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the fact that people are treating this show like an endorsement of slavery is woefully disconcerting; please don't do what you tried going with Mahoutsukai no Yome.",

            "content": "Not my style. I'd recommend it to people who are fans of 'harem' & 'ecchi', but as a 'shonen'/'adventure' story it's very poor. Nothing you (probably) haven't seen many times before. Most of the show is the MC talking to the women in his harem and making them blush (seriously).\r\nThe main character is your average MC, he does good, he randomly helps people, etc. He's also absurdly OP. He struggles for a second but then levels up over 300 levels (literally), maxes out his skills and gets bottomless amounts of money. So any tension or intrigue of how he will survive is gone.\r\nThe harem dynamicsare your average harem dynamics: almost every female falls for the main character and blushes in every scene (literally). Also, the lolicon factor is HEAVY in this.\\n\\n\r\nThere's almost no action, and the action is VERY low budget. So low so that in ep 4 they showed still images of fights with monsters instead of actual animated scenes of the fights. But it simply bored me, and I just want to write this to let people know that, if you don't love harem stories and OP MCs in stories trapped in video games, this probably isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nI think most of us have memorized these type of stories along with their settings, dynamics, etc. But if this sounds fun to you, well, I hope you have fun.\\n\\n\r\nAt times I see how this show would be endearing for some people, and at the end of ep 5 there was a glimpse that there could be a half-decent plot, but that is overwritten by the disturbingly creepy pedophilic elements. It's one thing to just have kawaii little girl characters as decorations to make jokes, but it's another to have them all be in love with the MC, trying to seduce the MC, kiss  him and then sleeping naked with him in the same bed. Sorry, I'm out. \\n\r\nIt kinda even makes me embarrassed 'cause these type of things are what makes otakus seem like creeps.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to pick on the show too much because it's a low budget production, but I'm just being honest with my viewing experience.\\n\r\nAnd I've had A LOT of fun watching 'Trapped in video games' or shonens with stories modeled those type of narratives. Despite their MANY flaws, I'm a casual fan of stories like 'Gate', 'Log Horizon', 'No Game No Life', 'Re:Zero', 'Overlord', 'DanMachi', 'Hai to Gensou Grimgar', and can even overlook SAO's flaws to just have fun with the action scenes. I couldn't have fun with this.",

            "content": "The measure of an individual is what one does when in possession of true power. The greater one's power, the more options one has at one's disposal; choosing the path that benefits the greatest possible number is the noblest path when many alternatives are available, especially paths focused purely on oneself. Satou is someone who takes the high road and never strays from it.\r\n(This review is being written in response to a flood of negative reviews that completely misrepresent Death March. I am so displeased by the rating that I set up a MAL account just to write this.)\r\nWhen we acknowledge that the isekai genrehas been saturated, to say the least, we need to look for differentiating factors. A key point of differentiation is the viewpoint from which the protagonist approaches the new world to which he has been spirited away. The majority of isekais take a youthful and user-centric lens: a gamer teen or a teen / young adult hikikomori. The viewpoints inherent in such a background are limited by the age and by the mindset that said protagonists bring to their worlds. Satou comes to his new world as a builder (one of the lead programmers) and as a working adult - Death March is an isekai where the Game Master is the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nMany isekais are focused on the leveling up aspect (I have fond memories of playing games like Legend of Mir 3 and grinding away). However, what if you accidentally started out at level 310? Death March shows Satou being the coach to his party, so to speak. It's one thing to be an edgy teen trying to perfect your levels, fighting to achieve top dog status; it's a completely different story to already be on the top of the dominance hierarchy and to instead nurture the growth of others. I was a swimming instructor in high school and predominantly had a lot of female students aged 4 to 12 - watching Satou nurture his crew is the embodiment of what it means to be a teacher. Giving them room to experiment, being ever-present to back them up, and always being ready to teach through example - Satou is a man, not a boy. If you cannot relate to the MC, reflect on that.\\n\\n\r\nI picked up this anime last week when 3 episodes were available and the moment I was hooked was when it finally entered RPG mode and Satou started being a team leader. Thereafter I binged the entirety of the available manga and am now the proud owner of the 4 available light novels with the 5th pre-ordered.\\n\\n\r\nI want to close this review by mentioning the unique focus Death March places on imbuing RPG dynamics continually throughout the narrative. There are isekais that will skew towards the fantasy element, leaving the RPG elements as a backdrop; in Death March, the game elements play a central role in how Satou interfaces with the world. Death March is very precise on roles, skills, title acquisitions, the continual use of the menu etc - a detail to be appreciated by gamers and devs. As someone who has been working in tech, I can appreciate the mindset that Satou brings to acquiring new skills. This is truly a dev's mind on display - we are always reminded that this is a technologist with a Game Master interface, interacting with a fantasy-like environment.\\n\\n\r\nIn my mind, this is a solid 8/10 anime for the new perspective that it brings to the isekai genre. Don't come here for depth; don't come here for romance. Watch Death March if you want to see how level grinding, skill development, and team development look like from a coach's perspective. Watch Death March if you want to a explore the [builder] mindset, rather than the [user] mindset. Watch Death March if you're interested in exploring the isekai-context question: [How should I act if I am already the most powerful?] rather than [How can I become the most powerful?]. For, if we have not considered the endgame, we are not prepared to commence the journey. Death March is the endgame that all future isekais should consider.",

            "content": "MAL has words to match the numbers when putting up a score, but I haven't figured out if Dreadful (2) is worse than Pathetic (1) yet - This summarizes the rest of this review.\r\nTo put it short, DM (shortened for the show) is an Isekai, meaning that the story takes place in a \"new\" world rather than just having a different universal setting. There are a few Isekai animes already out, and even more mangas not yet adapted. Short story Shorter; The plot of most of the Isekai stories can be summarized to \"Guy somehow ends up in another world. The other world is afantasy world where anything from tolkien to new inventions will show up. The guy \"searches for a way to get back\" but never tries, and merely goes about \"exploring the world\" until the author runs out of ideas.\\n\r\nSimply put, if well done these stories could sometimes be entertaining, I don't have anything against them and I do enjoy a few of them; RE:monster for example.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of DM however is.. pathetic. \"A guy overworks himself, dies, ends up in a fantasy world where he instantly gets OP up until \"lvl 300\" or something by killing a bunch of lvl 50 lizards (Whoa). He sets off to explore the world and eventually get back home, but will only end up collecting a harem of underage girls.\" - If this is what you're after storywise, I won't call you stupid for being so; This kind of story appeals to quite a lot of people, and even though i'm personally not a fan and the \"plot\" can be completely described within those 4.5 lines, I shouldn't judge anyone for liking it. When I read this manga I got bored of it due to being passive, but considering that I'm laughing at the quality of the anime it proves enough to me that the story itself isn't the MOST pressing issue I had with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is horrible, low-quality blurry stillframe pictures for minutes per episode, many angles are wrong, faces look different from the same angles in different scenes, I can go on.\\n\r\nI'll also mention that the animating used for everything is as cheap as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nThe musc is just low quality, it doesn't match anything.\\n\r\nVoice acting isn't awful save for the MC and the elf guy, but the lines are.. bad. The script is simply awful.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in this show is monotone, but that's nothing you shouldn't expect from after having read my opinion of the story. Having monotone characters are sometimes a good thing, character progression is only needed for a few characters in most shows and when emphasized it often ruins the quality, but having no character diversity or progression tells me that the script is awful.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize all this yet again, this show has no highlights - it might appeal somewhat to some people for what it sets out to be, but the presentation is too bad to be praised. Personally I don't like the story very much, the script (The character lines) are edgy and unnatural, the art is low quality (low production cost), the intro, outro, SFX and \"OST\"s are low quality (low production cost) and the characters are way too bland and badly animated to make for even an acceptable harem (if you're into that).\\n\\n\r\nI will however give this show a 2 in overall ranking since I enjoyed some laughs in the animation used for the ants flying into the barrier in ep6.\\n\\n\r\nI decided a few weeks ago to watch this to the end just so that I could see how bad it would progress, and I will keep to that decision, but don't follow in my footsteps since this is a bad practise and may hurt your future unless you're hardened enough.\\n",

            "content": "Death March to a Parallel World Rapsody is very refreshing and relaxing anime, it's not great desconstructor like Konosuba or Rezero was, but it did well on what it tried to do and that is, nothing. Yes, you did not read wrong, this anime is a very simple Slice of Life on a parallel world, nothing more, nothing less. At the start of the anime, you see a little of Satou's past life, as a proggramer, to me that was actually very important and fresh, because I always found myself asking: \"what the hell Kazuma or Subaru did on their past lives\". It's just somethingthat won't matter anyway to the main plot of most isekai anime, but it's nice to see more of the character, even tough Satou may be seen as an self-insert character(to me he is, as I'm also game developer), not everyone can relate easily to him, expecially his logic. I mean, most of you would like to be some kind of overlord on another world, but to Satou and to myself as well, he did the right choice, of hiding his powers and make himself as a simple merchant. Even though he is most probably the stronger person on that world. But what he want is really enjoying a happy life with the girls he took to be their guardians. I mean, they may be his slaves as that world says, but he takes care of all of them, as if they were his child. Unfortunately the only female characters with some sort of relevance or at least a bit developed is Arisa, so I'll get to her in a bit. First of, Arisa in the inside is a grown-up woman from japan, as is Satou, so her action do make sense, even though she is in a child's body. She also is the character responsible for most perverted moments in this show. \\n\r\nAnother strong point of this anime, in my opinion, is the Art, the characters and scenery are beatifull, even though the animation lacks a lot, a few episodes had action enough to take the score down, so for the part of illustratring the scenery and characters, silver link did a well done job. The sound is also gorgeous, both OP, ED and the music at the end of episode 10 are magnific, as well as the BGS at overall.\\n\r\nYou can't say I didn't enjoy this anime because I really enjoyed it up, it was a very refreshing anime with the \"another world\" theme.\\n\\n\r\nIn overall, this anime is better appreciated if you like isekais and can get through the first episode, as it makes the anime look like another battle isekai.\\n\r\nIn summary:\\n\r\nStory 5\\n\r\nArt 9\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nCharacter 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nOverall grade: 8",

            "content": "\"Acquired Title: Buffoon\"\r\nThe anime industry is no stranger to Isekai anime. Hugely popularised by Tenchi Muyou in the previous century it has come a long way for better and for worse. Death March is another of those fantasy cliche harem Isekai with an OP MC not unlike last year's infamous Isekai Smartphone. Where was Death March different? Was it better? Is it watchable? Let us see.\r\nStarting off strong, Death March started off with a guy named Satou who is a 29 y/o programmer and is transported to a fantasy game where he becomes OP almost immediately. What I liked about the starting was that itdidn't jump off straight into the harem action and instead gave a small backstory about the MC. Sadly it was completely washed out by (guess what?) all the harem action that followed and till the end we followed one formula: Problem occurs, Satou learns of it, Satou solves it, Girl gets picked up and attracted to Jesus-kun, next episode. This formula to be honest completely exhausted my interest and dropped the score down to a 6 to which it still stands. The story I've got to say tries to be unique but since it throws all these cliche situations and doesn't stop using the same formula repeatedly it falls short of a good score. Frankly I couldn't be disappointed more than this. I had expected the story to be way better than Isekai Smartphone but even though it DID improve it didn't improve to the point I'd hoped it would. Does that make it good? No. Simply because it was too lacking in the story dept to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nDeath March mixed two things I strongly started to dislike as I watched more anime, Lolis and harems. I was a fan of the latter before but quickly lost interest due to the lack of innovation in the genre. Death March is a perfect example of that, wasted potential. It had bright looking caracters but that's all they were. Flat. No personality apart from a few unique features and a hard on attraction towards Jesus-kun for some reason. Now the show does have it's good points even though they are few in number. The soundtrack is good and nice to hear and fit the theme perfectly, quite shocking because Death March failed in almost every other aspect. It's art was vibrant and all but it's few fight scenes let me down and the fight scenes themselves felt short and half-assed. They could have done a much better job with that. \\n\\n\r\nFlat Characters, weak story, OP MC. What else is there to note about Death March? Nothing more since that's all that this and other modern Isekai anime are about. It's hard to come by good Isekai these days simply because the SAO effect is still on going and I can't wait for the next decade when hopefully this trend dies out and we get some actual innovation in the anime industry for once. Needless to say I didn't find Death March enjoyable and apart from a few minutes was boring to watch. Characters like Arisa had a lot of potential because of their \"could-be-amazing\" story especially since Arisa's backstory was quite unique and if explored could do much better but no. They had to focus in Satou's oh so powerful skills and the way he picks chicks just HAD to get extra screentime. I won't be surprised if we get an OVA and the same goddamn formula is used there as well. Mark my words, this WILL happen. You see if it doesn't. That is, if this shovelware even GETS an OVA, which unfortunately looking at Japan's taste in OP Characters is all but unapproved of.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could Death March have done better? It could have made the characters more believable and given some personality to them instead of using then as Waifu material which I'm sure the otaku masses will still gladly feed on without noticing that the characters are a textbook example of how characters SHOULDN'T be made and that Death March is such a huge tribute to last year's Isekai Smartphone. I already got started on that before so I'll try not to spew more on Isekai Smartphone. Now since I do my new format reviews, I do not do the scores until after I'm done writing but I won't be surprised if it gets a 5 or way less. Frankly if you force me to be the most conservative person out there I will say this then \"Death March could be considered mediocre since it does most of the things bad but since that's how almost all Isekai anime are like this it's considered mediocre\" since that's unfortunately the case with the anime industry today. Since when were such anime considered mediocre I'll never know, but eh, I'll have to mark it that way then else it'd be unfair to other Isekai anime like Isekai Smartphone.\\n\\n\r\nLooking for a good Isekai to watch? First off, good and Isekai have never been further apart. Now that statement was an exaggeration if I do say so myself since as with everything in this world there's always exceptions. Isekai anime weren't always as shit as they look like in this decade and you don't need me to tell you that if you are a long time anime watcher. If you ask me a recent Isekai that WAS good I'd gladly recommend KonoSuba to you not because it's just so funny and it ranks third in my favorite comedies but the fact it's a refreshing take on the Isekai genre simply because it is a middle finger to the Isekai genre itself. It parodies and takes those Isekai cliches and makes fun of them. Meanwhile another good Isekai you could watch is Isekai Seikishi Monogatari which is a Tenchi Muyou spin-off (the title I mentioned earlier) and is frankly my personal favorite Isekai since it not only has a proper centered plot but it divides the episodes into two parts the first being all the fanservice and the second being all the plot so it helps as everyone gets what they want. \\n\\n\r\nWhatever the matter. If you do choose to watch the anime I recommended or instead decide to watch Death March or Isekai Smartphone, keep in mind that this is a genre heavily influenced by the SAO effect and that it doesn't look like that effect will hold down soon. Yet there's still light at the end of the tunnel. Will we see a good Isekai sometime soon? I sure do hope so. As for now, time to wait for the second season of Isekai Smartphone (groans inside)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 4.2\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I rarely do my best girl columns since I made my new format but I'll bring it back next time since I didn't find anyone in Death March interesting. Maybe Liza was a bit fun to watch in the earlier episodes and Nana was cute but no one interested me much to call them the \"best girl\". So apologies hardcore Otakus.",

            "content": "Ok, im mad. Almost all reviews for this anime are unironical 8 out of 10's or higher. Whatever, lets get into this review. \r\nFirst of. The story, or lack thereof. There is no overall direction with it. It\u2019s not going anywhere. It\u2019s like the writers just wanted to show off cute girls and halfway through writing realized that they had to give the show some sort of substance. Any drama that is supposed to happen never carries any weight because it\u2019s never built up and whatever villain that appears doesn't have any substantial motive. It is obvious that they're there because the writers have achecklist that they must complete. The latest villain, some random mage literally tells the main characters exactly where to go. Kidnaps the newest girl that is too be added to the mc\u2019s harem. And then the mc has too work his way up a bunch of floors too finally reach the evil guys\u2019 chamber. That is such a stereotypical damsel in distress type story that i don\u2019t even know what's going on. All they need now is a tower and a dragon. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters...\\n\r\nIt\u2019s ok to just have a slice of life story that doesn't go anywhere but if you\u2019re going to do that, focus on the characters. Develop them. In slice of life the characters and how they behave in their daily life is supposed to be what carries the show. Konosuba shined in this very way. This show does not. Zena for example is so boring, bland and she actually has no defining character traits. She's just a polite girl who fell in love with our main because the plot told her too. At least the demihumans bring a little shred of comedy (even if i have seen all these types of jokes before). But that is all they are there for and since the comedy isn\u2019t anything new it gets old after a while. So the show doesn't go a more Konosuba character driven route or a more serious story driven route and as such completely falls apart. Don\u2019t halfass two things, tryhard one. \\n\\n\r\nLastly\u2026 the mc. Wow, what a disappointment. I can\u2019t even begin to express how much seeing his character turn into nothing hurt me. He started off strong, you see most anime mc\u2019s are teens. Usually around 15. So when i heard that this guy was going to be in his 30\u2019s i got hyped. I hoped this was going to bring some mature thinking too the show. I thought he, being 30 would have developed some type of character. A personality. Him being loved by a bunch of kids around the age of 15 was certainly going to be interesting. How were they gonna handle that. They didn\u2019t. The mc in this show is painfully bland with no defining personality traits whatsoever and the fact that he's an adult isn\u2019t adressed or ever even touched on. Not explored. In fact as icing on the cake they put him back into his 15 year old body when he gets teleported into the fantasy world. It is as if they wanted too really let the viewers know that this anime wasn\u2019t going to do anything different. Of course he\u2019s your stereotypical, nice guy, emotionless, always smiling, plain, bland, harem mc that you\u2019ve seen before thousands of times if you actually watch anime. \\n\\n\r\nOh and btw, the animation sucks. Don\u2019t even make me touch on the lack luster fight-scenes that more resemble still panning shots (i'm referring too later fight-scenes as the first one in episode 1 actually had actual animation and carried a little weight). Oh and btw, the show started strongly. The mc starts off with nothing in a world that he knows nothing about. He\u2019s low leveled and we actually get to see him struggle and hurt. Legitimate emotions are being brought out here and thats why im so mad that the show then turned into what it turned into. Because it started off really down to earth with the mc pulling all-nighters at his office and then actually struggling in the fantasy world if even only for like 10 minutes of episode 1. But then the mc of course reaches the max level in one fight by literally wiping out an entire army with meteors. Yeah, f\u2019ck this show. \\n",

            "content": "\u00ab I\u2019m not into loli but \u00bb Satoo, just before beginning his loli journey.\r\nDisclaimer: This review contain a lot of spoilers, if you have not seen the show, please don\u2019t, if you already have feel free to read. \r\nStory\r\nThis anime is about two things : food porn, particularly \u201cmeat porn\u201d (you didn\u2019t planned to become a vegan ? Now you will) and pedo moments. 45% of the time, characters are eating / searching for food or buying some useless things because there\u2019s a need to fill this empty anime, 45% is full of that creepy thing about those 10 years old slaves kids showing theirlove to the main character and the 10% left is about random things that happen that our hero resolve by upgrading his skills. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like the author had one thing in mind doing this anime : \u201c Ok, those prepubescent kids are in love with fan-service ? Let\u2019s make an anime where everything is about that ! We\u2019ll put some furry, with animals ears and tails, they will be able to fantasize and masturbate on it ! Make them slaves, that\u2019s more sexual. Let\u2019s give them 10 years old, no personality. Now let\u2019s make them cry every 5 minutes about how they are hungry or how much they love the main character ! That\u2019s perfect.\\n\r\n\u2026 Damn, but those characters have to do things in this world now, we need a plot\u2026 Mhhh... let\u2019s add random events that have nothing in common, btw nobody will care because they will all love that shitty sexual thing around my characters !\\n\\n\r\nThis anime have two important life lessons for you, the first is, if a woman is mad at you, just buy her stuff (like earrings and shit) . And if you face a problem, just cheat your way out of it (by upgrading your skill at the last second). The philosophical ethics is on point. And don\u2019t forget, if a 11 year girl want to fuck you, it\u2019s ok as long as she\u2019s mentally older!\\n\\n\r\nThere is no scenario: the plot for the season 1 is non existent, MC is catapulted in this new world and..  do nothing except eating, buying stuff and sheltering every loli he met. The anime try to give us some interest by suggesting the MC is the new hero who will kill the demon king (how original), but because Satoo is OP, nobody can kill him, there is no sense of danger, and therefore no progression possible, and unlike one punch man, the situation is not nearly as funny.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nI must admit the cast of characters is really diverse, you have a loli cat girl, a loli dog girl, a loli princess, a loli innkeeper's daughter. In fact Death march must really have a population problem, because 90% of the people are prepubescent girl there. There is only one and i really mean ONE other dude on this anime who have more than 2 line of dialogue (but is a clich\u00e9 btw), and he literally do nothing significant. It\u2019s like the guy behind the story had some ideas for the plot but after 5 minutes of reflexion, got bored.\\n\\n\r\nSato: your generic kirito dude, he\u2019s overpowered, he\u2019s boring as hell, he have 0 charisma ( special mention to his submissive voice who try to sound calm) and the ladies love him because he is rich and nice.\\n\\n\r\nGirl\u2019s harem: In Death March, every girl of the harem are both walking clich\u00e9(the shy one, the energetic/happy etc..) and so similar that they don\u2019t even deserve a specific description. They all are half retarded (compared to them the hero seems like a genius), in love with the MC for no reason and zero personalities (well with nearly no backstories behind it must be logical)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSatoo\u2019s seiyuu died halfway of the first episode (18:10 you can check by yourself) and was replaced at that point by someone with an oyster charisma (RIP).\\n\r\nWe will not talk about the flying enemy monster who sounds so comically bad it would be fun if this anime was a parody, unfortunately, it isn\u2019t.\\n\r\nThe accelerated voice sounds when they throw a spell is fucking weird and hurt my earring. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is ok, nothing memorable except two at the end of the Tree arc and the ending of ep 10, too bad you will only hear them once.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nYour generic fantasy universe mixed with cat girl, dog girl and even lizard girl because why the fuck not? As long as it look like a loli you\u2019re free to go. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like dragon ball super and powerpoint had a child, and that child got hit by a truck. Two frame fight, an abuse of fixed plane, blurry effect everywhere. Very weird color choice (the food look so bad, with no texture and wrong colors that it look like someone puked them). The animation is cheap and easy but unlike Mcdonalds, it doesn't feel satisfying to watch. Graphism are comparable to what was produced 10 years ago\\n\r\nLight effects are ok tho.\\n\\n\r\nCan we talk about Arisa hair color changing every scene for no reason? Or recycling of background whenever it\u2019s possible  (one of the most blatant example is when Satoo is travelling and you see the same house every 2 second)\\n\r\nThe 3d part feel out of place and is just plain ugly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAfter 5 episode of disturbing child sexualinnuendo, food and nonsense, i fell asleep several times during episode 6. So I rewound to see what I had missed and there was only loli, food, and an ants army that was useless as fuck. \\n\r\nThe first episodes, it was funny to make fun of the anime, but you know, the shortest jokes are the best. After some episodes, it became painful to watch. It was just a set of non-funny jokes used again and again until the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n\r\n Chryn and Naryun.\\n",

Another man sucked into game anime, they're probably going to mess it up, it's not going to be original...\"\r\nI'm happy to be proven wrong. The protagonist is a computer game programmer who gets sucked into some sort of game world that he seems to have help code or take part of coding. The game was a hardcore MMORPG before, but was recently patched so that it'd be more casual player friendly. He went to sleep, and woke up inthe game.\\n\\n\r\nI do enjoy this anime a lot, because it's like playing a game getting tons of hacks, and granted free-roam, free-creation, free-interactions. Makes you ponder what would you do in the situation the protagonist has found himself in? Will he desire to return to the real world? Would he want to stay in this one? Sure he's OP now, but will he continue to be OP? What happened that caused him to be here? Etc.\\n\\n\r\nIt reminds me a lot of Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, a touch of Druaga and Overlord, it's getting a little harem-like, but women flocking to powerful and rich men isn't really something that hard to believe. Often times the stories are the same, just the setting is different. I haven't enjoyed an anime like this for a long time. Not since Log Horizon, and SAO. I do spend my weeks looking forward to the next episode.",

But hey, it seems this world is a game that he made.\r\nThe story is just 'like that'. Not a serious one, with some comedy spices, make it so light. But plot still nothing special, just a nice guy named Satoo who very overpower helping many people. Oh WOW... what a nice guy. Satoo didn't want everyone know about his super power, but look at this! I can jump so god damn high! Look at this look at this! I can do everything that I doesn'tgood at so completely perfect after one try!\\n\\n\r\nArt is mediocre,  with some CGI in it (in unimportant scene; like traveling in horse). Nothing special with combat effect. Character design not that epic. So nothing special but still 'edible'.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I hate most in this anime is character development. Yes. It seems like AI (maybe cuz it was a game). But the protagonist, it seem to usual and nothing special in him. \\n\\n\r\nBut yes, it can waste of my time quickly, I think I enjoy it! It so light and cheerful, perfect for some lonely people who love to play RPG games, will make you imagine your self living in your fav RPG games!\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'll not give a bad rating, it still 'edible'. Seriously, if you have a great spare time, just watch it!",

Actually, there's barely the scrapings of a plot, and there's almost zero character development. \r\nThat being said, this anime ranks with not just Overlord, but No Game, No Life in the list of anime that I will happily buy and rewatch when I'm bored. It's afun, light romp through a generic MMORPG fantasy world. \\n\\n",

Add the overpowered main character, some cute girls from random races , some demons every now and then and oh the good old seven gods plot and you get Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku. It kinda feels like you're watching a long OVA of sorts after a while in.\r\nSo getting through the story part the show isn't all that bad , thegraphics are done pretty good the sounding is better than most anime out there and it has likable characters (MC included) but then again it has a real generic and overused plot that makes everything else just bland.\\n\r\nIt is a pretty average show and still enjoyable to some extent esp. if you binge watch it (makes the story less creepy) and the comedy is done pretty good you can have some good laughs through the episodes but then again if I were given the chance to watch this again for the first time or skip it I'd definitly not spend my time on sth so generic while there are better anime out there.\\n",

Well, nothing, sooooo? Well that's just it cu'z the original creator play it too safe, that the lack of any hard trail or struggle or tragedy makes it too predictable and dampens any excitement that one would not expect from the character. Also, it was very obvious that the anime itself and the manga was just him and his harem, were he plays this goody two shoes guy where he doesn't even bang any of them. I mean he has every harem member one can imagine , from a loli to a milf. Also the main character itself is very much a wishy washy were at one point he is this super hero who has to hide his identity to a trader who can make miracles to a diplomat who has to deal with the lords. So basically his character lacks direction other than a guy who came from the real world and got stuck into the game he's creating.\\n\\n\r\nDreadful 2, Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nLike I've said this is one anime you can afford to skim some episodes, since it was too boring and to random to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nPathetic 1, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nPretty obvious that this another Isekai wa Smartphone only different,  and don't be expecting a season 2 since it's pretty obvious that some studio would come up with another one like this that's just to pathetically BORING!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSHIT! \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The starting of an fantasy-esque SAO-like Episode 1 into the parallel RPG world, that essentially plays you the ending of the 1st cour that gives you Kirito-like powers after killing an insane amount of enemies that hasyou COMPLETELY OP at the very start. As a programmer, you are the creator and have to fix bugs within the game, so what to do? Call in numerous girls, both loli and old to join your party as you progress the game! Ah...that settles the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, 1 guy to many girls.\\n\r\nThe one guy Ichirou Suzuki...(ahem, sorry) Satou wanders around the fantasy RPG that he's supposed to check for bugs, get sucked into the RPG world and activities galore.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls (IMO generic at best):\\n\r\nArisa, self-proclaimed \"wife\" of Satou, who ACTUALLY knows his origins,\\n\r\nZena, the girl knight he rescued from Day 1 and attached to him since,\\n\r\nsaved slaves Tama, Lulu, Liza, Pochi, they're erm...good in spots? Can anyone help me identify???\\n\\n\r\nOther than this, there's no incentive on the characters whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are subpar to say the least. Knowing the show's director from Imouto sae Ireba li, I'd suspected he knows the dark magic secrets to making a show stand out, but it didn't. At times it can be good and exceptional while others are plain bad. What gives???\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, yeah I can forgive its shortcomings with the less-than-stellar OST. Not that the show needs some extravagant marketing for the OP and ED, they are OK at best, and overall, no redeeming value whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I'm growing to be tired of Isekai shows that just don't bring the shows that have the tag some justice, and Death March falls right where it should be. Please skip this show if you wanna save yourself.",

            "content": "Okay, before I go any farther: THIS IS NOT AN ACTION-ORIENTATED SHOW. There. I just solved half the problems people seem to encounter when going into this show. Note there will be some minor spoilers in this review. Death March is a pretty standard Isekai; we have our MC show up as a 15 year old boy, he's suddenly transported to a fantasy world, he's pretty OP, and yay, he has a harem. However, despite the fact that I tend to LOATHE harem situations, I'm actually really enjoying this show. I'll give you a run down. \r\nStory: 7\r\nHonestly? There really isn't one. Why? Because, despitethe Isekai genre, its a SLICE OF LIFE anime at its core. There are some pretty cool action scenes, but a great deal of the show is world building, and exploring the culture and magic. We get a short arc here and there to break it up, but sometimes they feel a little rushed. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the MC learn about the world and take care of his companions, and I like him learning his new skills and showing off occasionally. Its relaxing. It does get a little stale at some points, with the action arcs being so short, but its still pleasant, if you're not there for the action.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to point out, there is slavery in this anime. Is it sexualised? No. Is is glorified? No. Does it gloss over how morally wrong it is own to slaves? Sometimes. The world is meant to parallel the more traditional medieval setting, where slaves were a thing; especially being biased against people who were 'different'. In this world, its demi-humans. The characters are not abused by the MC, and still show a significant amount of mental scarring that came with being treated, as well, slaves. They insist on remaining slaves, though, because, well, gratitude? Or just because its something they associate with themselves? It's not clear, and I'm not super comfortable with it, but the MC gave up arguing and now they're assigned companions I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nEverything is quite high quality, in the typical modern anime way. The whole anime seems to have a bit of a blue 'film' over it, which becomes more intense through the MC's point of view, which gives the whole 'hey, this is a video game like place, yeah?' feel. It can get a little annoying sometimes in areas that supposed to have lots of yellow.  All the characters are unique in their looks, and the backgrounds are very good. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing memorable, but overall decent. Opening and ending aren't amazing, but I don't skip it every time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nHonestly? A little bland. They're all likeable, and have very distinct personalities, I don't want to kick even the villains in the face, but they feel very NPC. I suppose that's kind of the point, but he is supposed to be in a fantasy world that works like a game, not the other way around. For example, the children do not actually act like children. No child doesn't at least get grabby sometimes, or a little whiny. The characters don't seem to have proper flaws beyond 'this one is naive' and 'this one is prideful' and even then it's 'not too prideful' and 'not too naive though'. The MC is a little bland. His two settings seem to be 'this is okay' and 'this is slightly worrying'. He very rarely gets surprised, or angrier beyond annoyance, and maybe it's the disassociation that comes with have an interface over everything you do, but he doesn't ever say anything 'wrong' or mean'. He also makes very few mistakes. The fact that's in actuality a 28-year old stuck in a 15 year old's body makes for a refreshingly mature character at least, and really tones down the romance, where he's more playing along than invested. Overall he think the teen crushes are all kinda cute and temporary, which is kinda refreshing, if somewhat assholish. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very relaxing anime to watch, with a lot of world building and fantasy concepts. I liked watching the MC adapt, and I especially enjoyed the video game like aspects of levels, skills and titles. So watch if you want slice of life, aren't that interested in intense harem situations and like a dose of fantasy.",

I dropped it and started the anime thinking I had missed something crucial which gave the title its flair. \r\nNope, just boring.\r\nThe main character is mature and calculating, so thats one good point, but all the subplots he gets involved in and decisions he makes are straight up uninteresting. Watching him do stuff literally feels like grinding in a MMO. The show essentially establishes him as strong in episode 1, but nothing in the show banks on that point to make itremotely interesting. This isn't a complaint about overpowered protagonists, Overlord has done an amazing job at it. More that this show has no substance to it. Its like watching a slice of life without the comedy or watching an action genre without the plot. No interaction feels meaningful and nobody has no idea whats going on.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, pretty bad show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is generic but not too generic \"Transported in Another World\" or (Isekai) anime.\r\nIt's not surprising that people give it a low score when they see Fantasy tags. They expect this series packing a lot of action and stories with main character progression in it.\r\nBut not for this anime. This anime is a laid back SOL and cooking/eating dishes.\r\nWe follow Suzuki Ichirou in his \"laid back\" adventure/tourism in another world with his fellow party/bunch-of-kids-he-is-in-charge-with.\r\nWhen I said \"laid back\" I mean it, he got to level 300 in an instant. There's literally no human that can beat him.\r\nThe story focus more on the tourism inanother world, rather than your average action fantasy anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself as far as I read it on the LN is quite interesting and not that boring, if you prefer slow to mid story pace of course.\\n\\n\r\nWatching their fluffy yet heartwarming story makes me smile.\\n\\n\r\nIt's that kind of story that you should just see without analyzing the story, It's a SOL in another world. Just sit down and enjoy their tourism.\\n\\n\r\n---STORY---\\n\r\nAs I said before, the story is their laid back tourism and a little bit SOL in another world. It is a fresh story in Isekai anime genre. I give it 7/10\\n\\n\r\n---ART---\\n\r\nI have no complains in Art department. The animation is good but the action sequence is a little bit lacking. The colors and the environments is superb i must say. I give it 8/10\\n\\n\r\n---SOUND---\\n\r\nIt's good. 7/10\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTER---\\n\r\nWe got a 29 years old as a main character is rather refreshing for a shounen anime. He is also not that dense and will lay his hand on onee-sans if he could (but too bad tho, in the anime, they tune it down. It is not an ecchi anime/LN tho.). \\n\r\nHe is also caring towards children and his companions, and always thinking of the best decision for them.\\n\\n\r\nTama and Pochi are cute\\n\\n\r\nLiza is a girl that always wanted to protect his master, and meat.\\n\\n\r\nArisa is a mischievous brat but he always thinking about his master's well being.\\n\\n\r\nLulu is shy fragile flower, but looks can fool you. No one in his party is useless burden.\\n\\n\r\nNo Tsundere in their main party is a plus point for me. I give 9/10\\n\\n\r\n---ENJOYMENT---\\n\r\nI enjoyed every time I watched this, so I give 9/10\\n\\n\r\n---OVERALL---\\n\r\nGood anime, recommended for people who wanted a light heart warming story. 8/10",

            "content": "Man. I'm sad.\r\nI loved the books. They are some of my favorite light novels, because they have no pretenses of being anything but an isekai slice of life, and they manage to do it in such an absurdly over-the-top way that it's funny.\r\nThe anime... fails to live up to any of my expectations. The plot is conveyed badly, the art and sound design is just passable, the characters aren't done well, and as a result my enjoyment suffered.\r\n\"How can the plot be conveyed badly?\" I hear you ask. \"There was never much plot to begin with!\" You would be correct. The reason its conveyed badlyis because Satou's inner monologue is the key element in how the story is conveyed.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't give you the funny lines where Satou thinks things like \"The demon looked like it might cause issues if I left it around, so I killed it on my way to get lunch.\" The books are full of stuff like that, where you have a \"wait, what?\" moment because of how casually and offhand satou mentions absurd things. When you take out the inner monologue, it just becomes a classic Mary Sue, and you miss out on the humor intended by the conflict of his casual attitude with his over the top actions.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but a large portion of the plot revolves around Satou using his system to learn and max out skills at absurd speed. But in the anime they didn't even bother to translate the on screen text which tells you when he acquires skills, which was another thing that was humorous, having situations where satou does really minor things to get absurd skills.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it takes a pure absurd comedy and turns it into a generic isekai plot, losing 90% of its charm.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I am very disappointed. I have to give it a 5, and that's generous. I want to give it more but I can't. Pass on the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut read the books. They're good.",

            "content": "This was the worst isekai anime I have ever seen. The show is about an overworked video game programmer who falls asleep after an exhausting day at work and suddenly wakes up in a video game-like fantasy world where he has been summoned by an unknown person (to be a hero against the forces of the Demon Lord who threatens the kingdom - that part's not important to the plot at all). The show\u2019s (clich\u00e9) premise and edgy title imply that the series will be dark and full of action, but instead the show is extremely slow paced, features almost no action of any kind,and instead focuses on our hero Satou\u2019s travels around the world with his ever growing harem of slave girls with no distinct personalities\u2026 Yeah\u2026 \\n\r\nThe problems with the show start in the second episode, in which Satou starts as a powerless Level 1 player threatened by an army of Lizard Men, only to be saved by a nonsense Deus Ex Machina meteor shower that somewhow jumps his level and wealth up immensely and make him overpowered to the point of nothing that happens in the show really mattering. Every time he encounters a problem, all he does is increase his skill levels and suddenly he can do anything and beat any problem, i.e. there is no tension at any point in the series since he doesn\u2019t need to strategise or plan anything and is never in real danger. Satou also has a consistent love interest throughout the show named Zena (his pseudo-harem being made up of slaves he bought to rescue from abusive masters), who despite being the only interesting character in the show (since all of the slave girls have the same hyper-devoted personality and Satou has no personality) is constantly shafted for screen time so that the other slave girls can be sexualised to disturbing levels (which are even more disturbing when you realise that Satou is 29 and some of these girls are as young as 11).\\n\r\nFortunately, Satou himself never once actually engages in paedophilic behaviour, but unfortunately despite the fact that the show goe out of its way to show the blossoming romance between him and Zena, it\u2019s impossible to ship that romance since despite specifically talking about places he wants to take her he visits and is serviced by two brothels during the course of the series (and don\u2019t you dare say that he didn\u2019t actually sleep with those prostitutes, since we see that his skill box has several \u201csexual skills\u201d added to it after one of his visits. So, Satou is unfaithful to his not-quite-girlfriend, overpowered, and has no personality\u2026 oh, and he looks suspiciously like Kitiro from Sword Art Online because the character designers were lazy.\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, what few action scenes the show has are extremely underwhelming visually, as is the rest of the animation. The battles with the Undead King\u2019s minions during the arc where the elf princess was kidnapped could have been visually stunning, but instead the animation looked cheap and lacked anything in terms of visual effects or dynamic camera movements. This is a real shame because the studio that made this, Silver Link, actually have made some superbly animated action sequences in Fate/Kaleid, and the studio that assisted in the animation, Studio Connect, are known for having almost exclusively made action-based anime\u2026 so, everything in this series seems to come down to laziness, both in the writing and in the animation.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, during the Undead King arc, Satou cheats his way through the challenges with the help of a teleporting-powered plant loli, so any and all excitement you might feel about him having to find a way through to the top of the monster and challenge infested tower is dashed immediately by a lazy get-out-of-trouble-free-card deus ex machina.\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the Demon Lord who is set up from the start never even features, and the entire series builds towards an unbearable anti-climax that I won\u2019t spoil for anyone insane enough to want to watch the show (but involves saving a forest from a noble that wants to shop it down), we never find out anything about why the events of the series are taking place, and there are so many cringy moments of underage fanservice that it made me almost want to gouge my eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what starts as a clich\u00e9 but promising fantasy series gradually waters down into a boring tensionless \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d series with no character development or plot of any kind. It. Is. Terrible. 0/10, not recommended.",

            "content": "Generic isekai high fantasy harem self-insert anime that gets a lot right and a fair bit wrong.  \r\nA few things that I'll warn you about, and if you don't like the idea of them then just move on now: the sound is awful.  From bland voice acting to a forgettable, almost satirically boring soundtrack, the sound here just sucks the excitement right out of you. \r\nNext, the animation is nothing special.  Not offensive, just nothing special.  A couple of nice backgrounds, with plenty of characters in cities, even in the background, can't save this from overusing rather obvious CGI and forgettable,babyfaced characters.  A couple of exceptions exist but unfortunately the MC isn't one of them.  \\n\r\nFinally, yes, the MC is completely and laughably overpowered.  That's established in the first episode.  There's no power creep in the season, thankfully. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the good.  Pacing here is actually really good.  The story moves along appropriately, the intra-episode pacing is nice, and you feel a sense of progression without a sense of being rushed.  Nothing really changes beyond the first episode, which doesn't really matter that much because that's not the point of the show.\\n\r\nEyes are done either totally inappropriately to the character or totally fittingly.  One or the other, there's no in-between, but more often than not the eyes are expressive and pleasant to look at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of those series where if it does get a season 2, I can almost guarantee it'll ditch its good aspects (especially pacing), but these twelve episodes are a low-stakes, gentle way to unwind that I can recommend.",

It throws all fantasies about the different world onto your face like throwing\u00a0meat at the dog's face and says \"Just eat it quietly and be satisfied\", and that is what I like about it.\r\nDeath March doesn't\u00a0hide its true form.\u00a0Death March doesn't\u00a0give a fu*k about emotions, ethics, drama, world building, story, characters, or any other thing that you expect to find in agood anime. From episode one it screams that it is going to be a loli and fanservice anime, it is going to have a\u00a0Gary Stu as the main character and he is going to have a harem with every girl in love with him, it spits in your face that hero is perfect and he is never going lose, hero is going to be a black slate so you can draw yourself in that situation and you know what I love it, I love when a work of art is honest with itself and its views, I love when an anime scream that it is not perfect and it is not trying to be perfect. I love it when an anime say's to your face that It is fan service for the sake of fan service, it is fantasy service for sake of fantasy service.

It quenches's the thirst for fantasy, for going into another world, for being strongest person.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSo is\u00a0Death March worth watching? Yes but for entertainment alone, Is it good?

            "content": "Everything comes in cycles. Just a while ago it seemed like the \u201ctraditional\u201d isekai was on the way out, with the most notable entries in the genre being subversive takes on the premise of being transported to another world such as Konosuba or Re:Zero. In hindsight, they were mere blips, as it appears we are living in a new golden age of isekai anime, given the upcoming adaptations of Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu and Hyakuren no Haou to Seiyaku no Valkyria. If Death March is any indication of the quality of these upcoming shows, we\u2019re in for a rough ride. \r\nAtfirst glance, Death March\u2019s premise is somewhat interesting. An overworked game developer gets transported into the world of one of the games he\u2019s working on, complete with a standard MMO UI. Those ten minutes in the first episode, in which the viewer learns about how shitty the MC\u2019s job is, ends up becoming the most interesting part of Death March. As well as being a much realistic take on game development than New Game, it firmly establishes a reason for the MC to want to stay within the new world. \\n\\n\r\nHowever Death March quickly squanders whatever goodwill it built up when the OP begins. \\n\\n\r\nThe Opening\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no sugarcoating this. Slide Ride is one of, if not the worst, anime openings I have ever experienced in my life. The song itself is terrible; A cobbled together mess of various elements that fails to come together into any sort of coherent melody or rhythm. Instead of complimenting each other, the instrumentals and vocals actively clash, exposing each other\u2019s flaws more so. The whole song comes off as cheap, as if the whole thing was put together after one take. \\n\r\nThe animation and structure of the opening don\u2019t fair much better. The quick flashes of the girls of Satou\u2019s harem fail to establish them as distinct characters, whilst the show\u2019s titlecard is interspersed with annoying shots of the MMO\u2019s UI and menus. And yet the worst is to come.\\n\r\nWhile Slide Ride\u2019s chorus does its best to make your ears bleed, the action sequence chosen to show off how badass the main character is merely consists of him walking up a cliff and shooting a giant rolling boulder, saving two of his underaged slaves in the process. By contrast, Smartphone\u2019s OP, even with its poor animation, at least showed the MC and his harem fighting together against various monsters, doing a much better job at building audience expectations. \\n\r\nDeath March\u2019s OP does none of that. By pure accident, it ends up becoming a perfect symbol of the show itself. \\n\\n\r\nPlot and Characters\\n\\n\r\nDeath March can best be described as slice-of-life isekai, with the series largely consisting of short vignettes of Satou and his harem, broken up by occasional attempts at a story arc. The problem is that the show makes these little vignettes boring as hell, failing to take advantage of the fantasy world setting in any meaningful way. \\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s largely down to the characters. A good cast can turn even the most mundane situations into something worth watching. However, this is Death March. \\n\r\n Once again, we have a bland, nonchalant, over-powered male protagonist. The fact that he was an adult prior to being transported to a fantasy hardly plays into how Satou reacts to situations around him, and generally he feels like any other teenaged male isekai protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nHim being overpowered also robs the story of any sort of tension. We know, from a hilarious sequence early on the first episode in which Satou levels to over 300 by dropping meteors on CGI lizardmen, that nothing in this world offers much of a challenge. When anything appears that might present a challenge, Satou simply dumps points into a relevant skill and resolves it without much issue. \\n\r\nThe rest of Satou\u2019s harem, fails to make much of an impression either, with personalities ranging from non-existent to one-dimensional. They also contribute to the increasingly irritating isekai trend of being slaves of the protagonist, in order to give them an easy justification to follow the MC. To Satou\u2019s credit, he does refuse any form of sexual contact, but the ultimate effect is to make him even more bland. \\n\r\nBecause of all this, the show\u2019s various scenarios simply flow past without any meaningful impact. I frequently struggled to recall the events of the episode just minutes after I finished watching each episode.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nDeath March\u2019s one unique gimmick, that of Satou being able to see a MMO UI, ends up being a distraction from the other things that are happening on screen. Aside from a few bits of visual comedy, the menus mostly exist to introduce characters and settings in a lazy manner, and reinforce the increasingly ridiculously long list of MMO titles Satou has acquired, reminding the audience of how much an overpowered badass Satou is. \\n\r\nUnintentionally, having Satou resolve things so easily is a blessing in disguise, as it saves the audience from having to withstand Death March\u2019s action scenes for any longer. The show\u2019s already limited animation really suffers during bits of action, with stiff movement, poor direction and CGI that would have been laughed at ten years ago. \\n\r\nEven in normal times, the show fails to rise above mediocre in the art department. Death March has a strange pastel-like quality to the colours, and the overall design of the world could be from any medieval-themed game or anime. Most irritating is the filter that is slapped across the viewer whenever we see Satou\u2019s perspective. Meant to emulate depth of field, it ends up distorting the image and making everything seem like a blurry mess. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nDeath March fails as an adaptation of the light novel, and neither does it stand as a standalone product. \\n\\n\r\nIt, along with Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, serve as examples of the worse traits of isekai stories, with blatant wish fulfillment, non-existent plot and flat characterization. Normally, such a show would be merely forgettable, but in a season stacked as Winter 2018, it's flaws stand out even more so. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you want mundane but comfy slice of life, just watch Yurucamp. Don't waste your time on Death March. \\n",

In the outset it appears that the concept might be, at least a little, diverting...I was completely incorrect. \r\nIn terms of characters, our MC is the quintessential Mary Sue, there is no problem he cannot immediately overcome because he is already maxed on XP due to VERY convenient Deus ex machina in the first episode. He also has the personality of a damp, slightly warm, flannel.\r\nAs forthe rest of the characters, they are the usually collection of tropes, with one minor twist; the anime is positively festooned with Lolis. I'm not kidding, they're EVERYWHERE!\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is generally OK, with a few exceptions. Because of the preponderance of Lolis, several of the voices for the younger characters are grating on the nerves...it's a bit like trying to read a book in a room full of shouting preschoolers.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short; Don't waste your time. There are far better anime you could be watching. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Death March is the most pro-slavery tract of fiction produced since the end of the American Civil War. Death March's main character, Satou, is the most insidiously passive protagonist I think I have ever encountered. When thrown into a world with a legal and normalized institution of slavery, which includes the prostitution of children, Satou is apathetic at best \u2013 and eagerly complicit at worst. Satou is a fucking sociopath.\r\nLet\u2019s explore this.\r\nSatou is thrust into a fantasy world (with inconsistent video game elements because there is no spark of originality to be found here) and, of course, he\u2019s totally overpowered from the get-go. He soonenters a city where slavery is accepted, slaves are peddled alongside food items and clothing, and slaves are publicly beaten. The people of this city have no problems showcasing their vehement racism towards \u201cinferior\u201d races. This place is fantasy as imagined by Adolf Hitler, a setting even grimmer than Berserk. None of this phases our hero. \\n\\n\r\nHe may not care to watch abuse, and he may think the abusive slave owner is a jerk, but that\u2019s where it ends. He questions nothing about this society or its morals. The problem with the abusive slave owner isn\u2019t that he\u2019s a slave owner \u2013 it\u2019s that he\u2019s not a nice slave owner.\\n\\n\r\nEvents conspire to give Satou his own cadre of slave girls (Pochi and Tama, who are 10 years old, and Liza). He adapts quickly to giving orders and having them at his mercy. When they reach the surface, he immediately purchases two more slave girls for his harem: Lulu, 14, and Arisa, 11. In for a penny, in for a pound, right?\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be generous and concede that he needed to order Liza, Pochi, and Tama around because of extraordinary circumstances. Once the danger has passed, however, at no point does he ever consider setting them free. In fact, he seems to think that keeping them as slaves is the NICE thing to do.\\n\\n\r\nSatou, delivering the very last line in Episode 5: \"They don't deserve to be treated like slaves, but they feel more at ease that way.\"\\n\\n\r\nOh, well, that makes it so much better. It\u2019s so comforting to know he\u2019s considering the feelings of his human chattel. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Liza, Pochi, and Toma are denied room and board because of their race/species, they are graciously given a spot in the stable \u2013 like animals. Satou callously leaves them to sleep in a sty while keeping the bed for himself and his two human slaves.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Lulu and Arisa (again, 14 and 11 respectively) present themselves naked, he is utterly unfazed by the prospect of child prostitution. His only response: \u201cOh, they have that kind of slavery here, too.\u201d There is no hint of disgust, or even discomfort. The only problem is that it\u2019s just not his bag.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you know, for as many times as Satou insists \u201cI\u2019m not a lolicon,\u201d it\u2019s a little suspicious how he keeps finding himself surrounded by naked and sexually available children. Maybe he just gets off on exerting his dominance over them \u2013 choosing what they do, what they eat, and dressing them up like dolls. Then again, he kisses a prepubescent dryad girl not once, but twice in Episode 8. The show tries to excuse this by having the little girl proclaim her need for MP \u2013 but our hero doesn\u2019t even think of just handing over an MP potion, which was shown to be effective just one episode earlier. Perhaps Satou only feels emboldened to act on his pedophilic urges when he\u2019s alone.\\n\\n\r\nMoving from his moral transgressions, Satou is stupid in ways too stupid for stupid people. He is granted a basically unlimited pool of skill points, but instead of leveling every useful skill immediately, he only applies skill points the moment he needs them. For a computer programmer, he seems to lack any sense of long-term thinking.\\n\\n\r\nSatou is solely out for his own self-gratification, unconcerned about the heinous state of the world or the evil that plagues it. All of his so-called \u201cheroic\u201d and \u201cselfless\u201d acts revolve around little girls or little girls that resemble house pets. To quote The Criminal Personality, by Samuel Yochelson and Stanton Samenow, \u201cThe criminal's sentimentality reveals itself in compassion for babies and pets.\u201d Notice how little of a shit he seems to give about anyone not a girl or past puberty. His niceness is all a hollow, shallow front, a mask for the uncaring monster underneath.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, go look up the DSM-V guidelines for Antisocial Personality Disorder. These are the criteria professionals use to determine if someone is a sociopath \u2013 and Satou hits all the necessary marks. Satou is a less outwardly criminal, yet more unfeeling and callous take on Tony Soprano. Hell, I'd rather spend an evening with Hannibal Lecter - at least he has a personality and a voice that doesn't sound like nails on a chalkboard.\\n\\n\r\nSo why is Satou our protagonist? Does the show realize how monstrous he is? You can center a story on an antihero or even a villainous sociopath, but Death March seems totally unaware of how Satou comes across. Instead, it\u2019s littered with scenes of Satou feeding, clothing, and bathing his slaves, as if that will make us like and admire him.  I would hope that any morally sound person living in our time is going to see \"doesn't treat slaves  like shit\" as the bare fucking minimum for goodness \u2013 but for the creators Death March, that\u2019s all it takes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a moral trash fire, and it\u2019s kind of fascinating in that regard. Otherwise, all you have is a sparsely animated, thinly written, and shamelessly lazy addition to the overstuffed isekai genre. I would hope people are only watching this kind of stuff ironically \u2013 but I\u2019m not so optimistic. Thinking that this is marketed to children makes me want to throw up.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t deserve any more analysis. It deserves to be buried and forgotten \u2013 the sooner, the better.\\n\\n\r\nEnd of Series Update: Satou acquires two more harem slaves, a prepubescent elf child and Violet Evergarden. He heroically saves a horde of submissive, busty blondes and helps another prepubescent child. One of the last scenes of the entire show is two ten year old girls literally licking a clear, goopy liquid out of his palm.\\n\\n\r\nIt's pure garbage from start to finish.",

            "content": "Is Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku the zenith of trash \r\nisekai shows? Now dear reader I know that is a bold question, Overlord \r\nexists afterall, however, while Overlord is truly trash, it is not as \r\ndedicated to being insidous as Death March is.\r\nDeath March wants you to know that MC is a Nice Guy, not only is he a Nice \r\nGuy he's superhumanly nice, he is the Stakhanovite drone in his shovelware \r\ncapitalist enterprise selflessly sacrificing his own physical and mental \r\nhealth so one more ingame currency pack can get sold. MC is not a real \r\nperson, he's not a character you can emphasisewith, he's a surreal \\n\r\nmasochistic cut out with godlike powers with some cult leader tenancies \\n\r\nwho we are supposed to know is a Nice Guy because he doesn't exploit those \\n\r\naround him to the maximum extent that he can. It's also important to \\n\r\nremember that MC is consciously deceiving and manipulating everyone around \\n\r\nhim at all times in fact one of the few moments where it tries to pretend \\n\r\nthat everything is not going MC's way is when he is being manipulated by \\n\r\nan ability this loss of control is deeply unsettling to MC but there's no \\n\r\nexploration of it! \\n\\n\r\nAlso, he is a grown ass man deposited in the body of age undefined anime \\n\r\nteenager, although for some reason the show mentions that and then forgets \\n\r\nthat it did it and doesn't bring it up again... In a similar vain at the very start we get a slight Grimgar-esq insight into life of a baddy mob, it doesn't bother revisiting this...\\n\\n\r\nThe show features no reflection on its own setting, MC is deposited in an \\n\r\nextremely dark place, chattel slavery is the norm and the church dispenses \\n\r\nhorrific punishments without MC considering his environment for a moment. \\n\r\nThere is the faintest of hint that MC at least thinks about the mechanics \\n\r\nof the church's persecutions, but it is on an entirely individual level \\n\r\nand confined (so far as I have seen into the show) to one scene in one \\n\r\nepsiode. If the show had any more  of a hint of self-awareness I'd think \\n\r\nit was trying to make a point about desensitisation to traumatic \\n\r\nconditions but I think that's an overly generous reading.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a grand tour of tired tropes and stock characters, there is no \\n\r\nchemistry between characters (indeed the central cast of characters are \\n\r\nquite literally MC's chattels). The show is so bad on these fronts that if \\n\r\nwe ever got any of MC's internal monologue I could believe this was meant \\n\r\nas a critical deconstruction of a genre that's become a stale ouroboros. I \\n\r\ndon't even want to dismiss that possibility, I want to hold on to the hope \\n\r\nthat in the last episode we discover that MC had a complete mental \\n\r\nbreakdown as a result of his horrid working conditions, but I can't really \\n\r\nimagine there's enough self-awareness in the show for that to be the case \\n\r\n(also you know a show is probably bad if you want the whole thing to be a \\n\r\npsychotic episode to forgive it its faults...).\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside all of the trash, even taking the show on its own merits as \\n\r\na adventure game romp it falls on its face, I can't quite grasp how we're \\n\r\nmeant to suspend disbelief where there's no risk or danger in a game \\n\r\nenvironment where MC has access to the console, in fact in the moments that \\n\r\nit does do that I find myself perplexed as to why he doesn't just h4x his \\n\r\nway through whatever obstacle is in front of him. And as I said before \\n\r\neven if you pretend he doesn't own the googly eyed girls following him \\n\r\naround it's creepy and the shows constant reminders of how much of a Nice \\n\r\nGuy MC is makes it all the more creepy.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Zero it ain't.\\n\\n\r\nPerversely though, because of just how insidious it is I do recommend \\n\r\nwatching it because it is a master-class in how not to do this.\\n\\n\r\nNow I guess it's not impossible that come episode 12 we're going to see a Damascene moment where suddenly the show hurls itself open and examines the tiny little flags it dropped along the way and explores what it's been doing all this time but I find that extremely unlikely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI think the above covers it but below are some spoilers on specific \\n\r\ninstances of why this show is so unpleasant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe desire to portray MC as a Nice Guy is truly maddening and so lacking \\n\r\nin self-awareness that... well... it's maddening. There's also the \\n\r\ngenerally bad writing and MC's completely unquestioning acceptance of the \\n\r\nworld around him.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the early examples of this is when he first enters the town and \\n\r\ngoes to an inn, he considers the woman who runs the inn \"If she was 10... \\n\r\n20kg lighter I'd be all over that... but since she's fat I'm gonna creep \\n\r\non her 14 year old daughter\", not even kidding, that's our Nice Guy MC.\\n\\n\r\nShortly thereafter MC becomes a slave owner... shortly there after he buys \\n\r\nan 11 year old sex slave, not even kidding, the show tries to make this \\n\r\nokay by pretending that she's a grown woman who died in the real world and \\n\r\nwas resurrected in this world as a child of a noble family who fell and so \\n\r\nshe was enslaved and trained as a sex slave... MC is shown to be a Nice \\n\r\nGuy because he does not then have sex with her... instead he goes to a \\n\r\nbrothel in a slave holding city. Like, we expect some pretty absurd male \\n\r\npower fantasy elements in harem anime but the dissonance here between the \\n\r\nconstant presentation of how much of a Nice Guy MC is with *everything* \\n\r\nelse in the show is jarring.\\n\\n\r\nI really am struggling with this one to fathom the show's intent, why is it so keen to tell us that MC is a good guy with his head in a bubble?",

            "content": "Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku Anime Review\r\nBy: Ainana Hiro\r\nApril 25 2019\r\nOverall: 9.2\r\nPlot: 8\r\nWhat if one day you wake up and you're already in a game? What if your normal disastrous and stressful life turns into a more enjoyable one? This kind of theme is not new in an anime series. It is rather famous and currently one of the most picked plot. The story starts with the protagonist Satou and his busy life as a game creator at the age of 29. Sounds amazing, right? Though it isn't. He spent days and days fixing bugs in different games without having the time to restat all. One night when sleep comes to him, he woke up seeing himself in a life or death situation, with features of a game only he can see, with a familiar place he already saw, with the age of 15. His journey began upon the realization that he isn't dreaming. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike other MMORPG themed anime series, this one slightly touch the core of being in a game such as doing raids, having guilds, PVP. It contains of more simple things in a game such as obtaining different skills and titles, mastering different professions like crafting and alchemy, living a peaceful like with the slaves he helped getting their freedom back. It focuses more on the little things of the game that is mostly taken forgranted. The anime pace is slow but satisfying. It is great to see a common concept of a story but with different shades of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the story is overpowered, but not in a way most character is. His level is very high, yes. But the familiarity of every skills and the game itself needs time. His character is calm and smart. That even if he was brought to a different world, his 29 years old self won't change. It is cute how he is always smiling and have a pleasant look on his face. It is also amazing how he made choices depending on what will be the outcome and not just pure instinct to show his strength. This story is a harem and there are different girls on his circle. Their too cute and funny. And it is cool how the author made a limit on them in between of master and just fan service. I just really don't like that one character who keeps on flaunting on the protagonist assuming their relationship. I hate her, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nI freaking love the voice of tama. It's so cute and funny. It feels like watching a very irresistible pet in front of you. Her voice is the best! The shift of the animation from the viewers perspective to the protagonists itself is also cool. It is shown how the surrounding should be in his eyes since there is menu only he can see. Though the protagonist looks like the typical character with a black hair and a black clothes long enough to hide his body, he is much different. Every characters of the story is cool on their own and it is a plus that neither of them all, nothing acts like an NPC, remembered Emilia. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is so satisfying. I felt like playing some MMORPG my whole life. Their daily adventures and moments felt like their just living normally. And I think that is what the author wanted the viewers to see. Its great to watch anime like this once in a while. \\n\\n\r\nEnding: 9\\n\\n\r\nI don't want this to end. I want to see more of their clever doings, their cuteness and innocence. The ending show how the protagonist make use of his skills, hiw he can helo others by using his mind than using his sword. I really love his character. Mature, calm, always smiling, reliable. Being near him will make you feel safe. Their struggles on the end and how they solve it is a great way to end the series. Though I think, this story is still ongoing and there's a still a lot of adventure they must take. Must check the manga of it.",

Death March isn't an Isekai anime, it's a Travel Documentary with lolis. More than likely, you're not going to watch Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown or the YouTube channel Abroad in Japan and start criticizing about why they aren't starting with $0dollars and having no experience in navigating the area, or questioning why they are given access to certain places that might be more restricted. \\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't want any difficulties or conflicts, because at its core it is about sightseeing and relaxation. There is a reason why some say Death March is a cooking anime. Back at the start of my review is the EXACT fantasy of our overworked main character's and a lot of overworked office workers'; to completely relax and not give a care about anything. \\n\\n\r\nYou SHOULD feel that the first 10 minutes of Episode 1 to be relatable in some way. If it is not, or if you dislike Travel Documentaries, and find the idea of not having to worry about anything appalling, this show isn't for you. \\n\\n\r\nMy number scores don't really mean anything.

            "content": "Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody has the single most overqualified score I\u2019ve ever experienced in anime. Every single track is excellently suited to its task, and the way they all work together results in the perfect musical accompaniment for a whimsical, laid-back fantasy adventure more interested in the simple mundanities of life in a magical, quasi-Medieval world than any sort of grand, epic journey. The ED song in particular is so memorable and homey that I would rank it up with Konosuba\u2019s fantastic relaxing fantasy/country fusions. There were so many moments across these twelve episodes where I found myself thinking, \u201cMan, I\u2019m reallygoing to enjoy listening to this music on Youtube once I finish watching this show. I might even imagine a better anime it hypothetically might have been used for so I can wash the stench of this fucking garbage out of my mouth.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, the quality gap between Death March\u2019s score and every single other part of it is so freakishly large that I\u2019m half convinced some inspired, rebellious composer snuck into Silver Link\u2019s studios some time during post-production and proceeded to record over whatever generic, lifeless musical mush was intended to be the soundtrack, just to fuck with the studio execs. Or maybe he just did it on principle, as part of some heroic quest to ensure that no anime production will ever be allowed to slop onto screens and streaming services without at least one commendable quality. Someday, I would like to meet this revolutionary man of music, to learn his craft and understand his ways, so that he may inspire me in the same way he is so clearly inspired by anime as a medium. Perhaps that day will never come. But I will hope on regardless, because the mystery he left me with is by far the only interesting thing to come out of Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody, and were it not for his contributions, I would have spent six hours on this show and gotten nothing in return. So thank you, mystery man of music. Thank you for ensuring I at least had something, anything, of value to hold onto in this utter waste of a show with otherwise no redeeming qualities whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe truly sad thing is, none of what I said in those opening paragraphs is hyperbole. Death March to the Absurdly Overextended LN Title is, without a doubt, the single most useless anime I\u2019ve ever experienced, to the point where wondering how such a brainless fart of a show somehow obtained its one aspect of quality was the only thing keeping me from going insane due to excessive boredom. It is truly remarkable how completely unremarkable this show is, how not a single moment lands with any emotional impact, how not a single aspect feels like it was crafted with anything more than base-level commercial cynicism, how utterly disinterested it appears to be in its own existence. It\u2019s the animated embodiment of a vegetative state; the only thing separating it from complete nonexistence is the fact that it technically does exist, and you can\u2019t help but feel that pulling the plug and putting it out of its misery would be a mercy to everyone. There is no reason for this show to exist. There is no reason for me to have watched it beyond the first episode. But I\u2019m an anal-retentive moron who never likes leaving a job unfinished, so here we are. And hey, at least now I can pass the warning along to you, so now you won\u2019t be tricked into thinking the SIXTH MOST POPULAR SHOW IN ITS SEASON might be worth your time in any way. Seriously, this shit has more members on MAL than Place Further Than the Universe, how the fuck is that in any way justifiable?\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d summarize the plot, such as it is, but that would be given this show far too much credit. It\u2019s an isekai, so you already know the drill: teenage guy gets transported to a RPG-based fantasy world, instantly becomes the most powerful motherfucker in existence who gets all the girls and never has to be meaningfully challenged in any way, whether physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, or any other way that might actually make for a halfway-compelling story. Okay, technically, this guy\u2019s in his thirties and working at a video game company (he gets sucked into the world of the RPG he and his team have been struggling to finish), but he reverts back to his teenage self the moment he sets foot in Candyland, so it doesn\u2019t make a difference. And technically he\u2019s not a virginal weirdo who can\u2019t process sex through anything other than nosebleeds; he actually does get laid a couple times... but only offscreen and by random one-off prostitute NPCs we barely get to see, not by any of his steadily accumulating harem. Then again, considering how many members of his harem are Literal Children, perhaps that\u2019s for the best. But on the other hand, at least if this show evoked moral outrage in me, that would, in fact, be a reaction of SOME kind. And that would have had some value, any value.\\n\\n\r\nBut no, the fact of the matter is, this show has no idea of where it wants to go, and it spends the entirety of its run time going nowhere, advancing no character arcs, plotting no greater narratives, introducing no interesting tidbits of worldbuilding, setting up no fun group dynamics for the central team to have any sort of chemistry, pulling off no feats of even notable animation, and never even attempting to rescue itself from its own lack of inertia. Again, no hyperbole here; we spend twelve goddamn episodes with Satou and his ever-growing harem and the only thing that changes in any of them between the start and end is that more girls just keep getting added. The few stabs at genuine emotion skip the apparently unnecessary process of making you actually, like, care about these characters and just assume you\u2019ll already be invested in their well-being from the second they\u2019re on screen. Meanwhile, the vast majority of the show\u2019s run time is spent on watching this personality-defunct team going camping, eating dinner, learning to leaf-whistle, and a million other boring little distractions that do nothing to endear us to the characters in any way. But at least the complete lack of narrative moment is only boring, whereas the fight scenes are both boring and ugly as sin. Clearly I need to apologize to Overlord, because I was not aware of how abysmal CG monsters could look.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s something almost infuriating about how little effort was put into this show, how clearly no one working on it (besides the aforementioned symphonic daredevil) gave any sort of shit at all. It isn\u2019t even trying to hide the naked cynicism of its existence, the fact that it only exists for the sake of selling the cheapest possible power fantasy and profiting off the rock-bottom standards it imagines its audience to have. But then it can\u2019t even do the power fantasy well enough to justify the callous disregard for quality on display. None of the girls are interesting or hot, even by the very generous standards of cheap waifu bait; they might as well not even have personalities at all, for how token and half-assed their supposed fetish gimmicks are. The deadpan isn\u2019t much of a deadpan, the hardass isn\u2019t much of a hardass, the snarker isn\u2019t much of a snarker, the flustered virgin isn\u2019t much of a, well, you get the point. The only one who leaves any sort of impression is the bratty, squeaky-voiced, and that\u2019s solely due to the rising desire to gag her with a dirty sock before she throws one more obnoxious tantrum about wanting to jump Satou\u2019s completely uninteresting wizard staff, may it remain forever flaccid.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of Satou himself, good fucking god, he is legitimately the most insufferably bland motherfucker to ever grace the protagonist role. I don\u2019t know whose decision it was that he should deliver all of his lines in the exact same quasi-paternal nice-guy drawl with an aw-shucks half-smile, but whoever it was should be fired, because the end result makes you want to reach through the screen and scream \u201cEMOTE!!!\u201d in his face, just so he gets pissed off and shows that he has the capacity for at least a single other emotional state. Especially when his nice-guy fantasy presentation clashes with his tendency to objectify every woman and girl he comes across, making internal comments about their boobs and attractiveness in the same dreamily genial way he patronizes them in reality. Because that\u2019s what real nice guys do, right? Oh, and he\u2019s not a lolicon. He\u2019s definitely not a lolicon. It\u2019s one of he first things his internal monologue tells us, so he definitely wants you to know that he\u2019s not a lolicon. Never mind how much he clearly enjoys the felling of a thirteen-year-old\u2019s boobs pressing against him, he is in no way a lolicon. And maybe if he tips his fedora harder, he can make you forget that most of the girls in his harem are his actual slaves, all of whom he took from other owners and could free at a moment\u2019s notice with no averse affects or risk of them abandoning him, making them his equal traveling companions, but chooses not to because... I guess he gets off on being called \u201cMaster\u201d by a ten-year-old cat girl. But he\u2019s not a lolicon, guys. Swear.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve put far more thought into this waste of space than its creators ever did. Honestly, I feel dirty even affording it the benefit of my full thoughts here, because it doesn\u2019t deserve any thought at all. It deserves to be wiped of the sole of our collective shoe and tossed in the garbage bin where it belongs. Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody is the single most mindless show I\u2019ve ever watched, bereft of even the slightest speck of value to justify its existence. It never should have been made. I never should have watched it. But I did, and shame on every decision that brought us to this point.",

            "content": "I have seen several isekai (and isekai adjacent) shows, as they generally provide me a sort of guilty pleasure. So I have to say, I'm almost impressed at how bad this show was, considering the general lackluster quality of this variety of anime. It would be overpraising Death March to say that it is generic - as it fails to reach even the lowest bar of quality that your average isekai does. \r\nThe lead character is the most personality-less fictional character I think I have ever encountered. He somehow manages not only to avoid at all costs having his own characterization, he also actively drivesaway the development of the characters around him. It's kind of amazing.\\n\\n\r\n And on the subject of characters, I think I won't be the first to point out how intensely creepy it is that the majority of female characters hovering around the lead character are literal children. And slaves. I've seen some push-back on this, as certain commenters claim that Satou is only acting as a father figure to the girls. However, slight SPOILERS, there are several episodes where the children are involved in fanservice-y moments with Satou. In the last episode alone, three little girls lick (or attempt to lick) a gooey substance from the lead's fingers while the background is sparkling. It's not exactly subtle. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of storytelling, Death March is much more a slice of life style isekai than anything else. This in an of itself is not a problem, but it becomes one when the characters that are being relied upon to carry the narrative are so lifeless. \\n\\n\r\nI wish I could say the show makes up for its faults in another way, but I found the soundtrack, character designs, animation, etc to be completely average. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say whether you would enjoy watching this series or not, that always varies from person to person - however, I think I can at least say that if you are looking for some fun fantasy escapism, there are so many better options out there.",

It is the type of anime that you watch without real interest, the type that you would watch when youhave nothing better to do or when you're waiting for an episode of another anime to come out. I'm not saying this anime is necessarily bad it's just not great. If you're looking for an anime that will give you the \"feels\" with a really good story and character development this is not the anime to watch but if you're looking to waste time until you find something better to watch I would give this a shot. Who knows you might end up enjoying it!",

            "content": "Story (7/10) - Death March starts as any Isekai anime would; main character is living life, but then gets transported to another world, voluntarily or otherwise. At first he thinks it's a dream (as most would), but then realizes it's not and tries to adjust to the new world. I think the problem most people have with this anime is the situation surrounding Lulu and Arisa when they're first introduced. While it is terrible, it's considered normal in the world of Death March. And thankfully, the main character is not like everyone else.\r\nArt (8/10) - The art style makes it easily recognizable as a fantasyanime. The simple, base design is nice and endearing, not too hard on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) - The opening theme gives a nice lively beat as it mixes Satou's previous life with his new one as he explores with his companions. The ending song echoes an air of a calm, relaxing tone by the female cast. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10) - Although he didn't start that way, Satou quickly becomes your average over-powered Isekai protagonist. He's also surrounded by an all-girl cast that likes him (more or less) that you'd generally find in a Harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10) -  Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody did have some competition during the Winter 2018 season as it aired alongside Overlord II. Regardless, it did have a nice, heartwarming journey for a programmer turned hero who's literally living the dream. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6.8/10) - While I can understand people giving this show a low score for the issue surrounding Lulu and Arisa, I feel like that's all they have to hate. Despite Death March having average characters, a seemingly generic storyline, and 'terrible' art; I think a small part of the show is being too deeply dug for a light-hearted anime.",

So man people love to throw out SAO and one punch man to compare this to but that is just outright unfair, Sao didn't give a crap about the world it had created and quite frankly after the first 12 episodes turned to absolute garbage, OPM focuses on a completely overpowered charter and the show doesn't take itself seriously at all. Death march is neither of those things it's taking the time to explain it's universe and show the Main charters progression in his own understandingof how this new world works, which is a nice refreshment. The characters are all interesting enough and anyone who wants to bitch about it being un-original needs to wake up and recognize that we haven't had an \"Original\" show since at least 2004 everything is drawing off something else.\\n\\n\r\nWell now that that rant is out of the way I'll just say this, 1. I didn't hate the main character, he's a reasonable guy with the ability to evaluate situations. 2. It's visually appealing, sure we're not talking the best animation ever or anything but it looks good enough to not detract from the anything. 3. It's got me curious, i want to see more of this world and what's going on in it, which is something that is being teased and that many other shows have teased yet failed to follow up on. Death march has a helluva lot of potential and as a standalone does just fine. Those of you who think this show is complete trash, please come talk to me I'll show you real trash you uneducated swine.",

I really like the fact that the MC is actually a mature level-headed guy who is 29 yrs old (kinda reminds me of Itami from GATE) and not some immature brat or some shitty pervert that we see in many other cliche harem shows.\r\nThis anime is basically an Isekai Slice of Life story, that is, it just showcases the daily life of our cool MC and the cute girls doing the normal Isekai stuff inanother fantasy world. It doesn't try to do anything beyond that, so many people might not like it due to this reason. I mean, it doesn't try to be an epic thriller like Re;Zero, it doesn't give much details or explanations about the working of the another world like Log Horizon, it doesn't get you excited like No Game No Life nor does it make you laugh your ass off like KonoSuba BUT it is indeed a tension free relaxing anime you can spend your time on and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who like the 'Isekai' genre, I give it an 8/10...recommended to those who like the Isekai-harem genre :)",

However ever since I watched the first episode I realized this is not why it was made. It was made to make people laugh. So if you're in for an anime like Konosuba, this is your jam :).\r\nThe story setting is incredible. The main character is a game creator and gets trapped in a game with the boosts he just had implemented in another game. Having those boosts he gets about to about lv 300 and now can prettymuch do everything he wants. However the way he is so humble with what he's got really amazed me and made the story even better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art kinda reminds me of No Game No Life. Loved it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good. No complaints.\\n\\n\r\nNow the only outstanding character is the main one, but it's really enough in my opinion. The other thing that impressed me was how he was able to help the others and even change their character to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the anime it was so fun! If I had to compare it to another anime it would be Konosuba. I loved that one and this one was just as good :)",

            "content": "A decent but mediocre anime unfairly maligned by factually wrong hipsters.\r\nThis is a Slice of Life/Sightseeing anime that doesn't communicate what it's trying to be clearly upfront. The main thing that makes it interesting is that it subverts common tropes in the industry. The art style isn't all that great, and I feel it's a bit lacking in scene direction, but if you've been wanting a slice of life sightseeing anime in another world this could be exactly what you've been waiting for.\r\nThere's my review, I'll now spend the rest of this review explaining why what Hipster Critics are saying about the Anime is factuallyincorrect.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--The Harem Trope - #1 Point of Criticism where the Critics are Wrong--\\n\r\nThe Anime is widely criticized for having a Harem and I feel that many critics could not see past their preconceived ideas about what that meant. For example this Anime touches on issues like PTSD from rape, Statutory Rape being Rape regardless of circumstances, how Consent that isn't given freely can't be considered true Consent, and so on. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is deliberately subversive of the Harem Trope, the circumstances of the Parallel World are misogynistic but the Main Character isn't and all of his traveling companions develop an entirely platonic relationship with him based on mutual respect, only two characters even have romantic designs on him and he only returns the interests of one.\\n\\n\r\nStarting at episode 3 it becomes clear that it's going in a different direction with it, and I feel that a lot of critics must have either not watched the Anime at all and are going entirely by youtube hipster reviews, or made up their minds about it so strongly before they watched it that they could not see past their preconceptions. The much talked about scene at the end wasn't in any way sexual, and wouldn't even be interpreted that way without the preconceived expectation for it to be.\\n\\n\r\n--Responding to other common factually wrong Criticisms--\\n\r\nThe Anime doesn't take place inside of a videogame. Critic after critic says it does, but the world the character finds himself in is a Parallel World and that becomes apparent to the MC as he explores it. The only thing from videogames is his interface, inventory, and mechanics that were carried over when he was pulled into the parallel world.\\n\\n\r\nThe Meteor Spell was based on expendable items that were only meant to help new players through a beginner dungeon, not to be used on a whole army of Lizardmen in another world, anyone saying \"fix your game\" must have missed this point even though it was very clearly spelled out in the very first episode.\\n\\n\r\nHow the Protagonist arrived in the Parallel World is explained. He was pulled in by a powerful being, likened to a goddess. This is explained during the Undead King arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe Main Character is a lawful pacifist, he tries to resolve situations without violence if at all possible. That's why he doesn't go around playing judge jury and executioner like some critics feel he should.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a Shonen anime, it deliberately skips the grind to focus on what it's trying to do. If we had to watch him level up from level one we may as well just watch any Shonen or SAO or something. The main sense of MC progression comes from the MC picking up new abilities and figuring out his inventory, but the main focus is on how the MC interprets the world and how characters in it interact.\\n\\n\r\nNo OP is not automatically boring, there are plenty of Anime with OP MCs that are really interesting. But this IS NOT an Action Anime, and those saying an OP MC is making it boring for the standard reasons are both factually wrong about OP characters and are missing the point of the anime. Death March is best understood as a Slice of Life and Sightseeing Anime.\\n",

            "content": "Why should you watch Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku.\r\nStory is Good (7). Let me acknowledge the elephant in the room: Death March is not something new. If I were to criticize it further, it is almost a SAO (Sword Art Online) + Overlord rip off. However, what it has that made me watch it is not the deep plot nor character development, but the entertainment value that it offers. The story is light and filled with the usual troupes of Harem, Online Game and Action genre it would be so familiar to viewers that you wouldn't even care to notice it. You would definitelywatch this not for the story but for the journey and experiences that the characters are faced with.\\n\\n\r\nArt is Good (7). One of the things that I like about this anime is how it handles the gaming elements of the story. You will truly feel the vibe of its gaming elements through the menus, notifications and achievements that the OP Main Character toggles or gains through his journey. The environment and characters are not lush enough to be worthy of watching on the highest quality as possible. so 480p to 720p is enough for you to appreciate the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound is Good (8). What I especially love about the sound is the gaming sounds it uses to denote achievements and titles as well as using items, skills and crafting. It really produces that gaming sound that makes you feel that you are watching a game. \"Slide Ride (\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9)\" by Run Girls, Run!, the opening theme is great and pumps you up on a grand adventure even though you are not going to get a grand one. \"Suki no Skill (\u30b9\u30ad\u30ce\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb)\" by Wake Up, Girls! is a nice ending song to end a light hearted anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Mediocre (5). The weakest part of this anime are the characters. They are all the usual character personalities with the usual quirks that you can find on every anime you have watched. The main character is no different. All throughout the series I was looking for a stronger motivation for the character or at least something that would take away his \"generic\" title away, but nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThe strange thing about this anime is even though I heavily criticize it on a lot of factors, I still greatly enjoy the series. I think that there are just some things that you enjoy even if the quality is sub par. May that's why I like watching American B-Movies. Oh well...\\n\\n\r\n7 lizardmen tails out of 10.",

            "content": "\"Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody\" really should be called \"Snooze Time to a Copycat Show Nothing New\". The show is an adaption of a light novel series. Part of the purpose of such animes is to leave the viewer wanting to go and read the series. When I'm left thinking, well, good thing I didn't buy the first novel that's not a good sign.\r\nStory: 3\r\nProbably being generous with a 3 here. The story is unoriginal and does nothing to try to spice it up. Main character gets trapped in a fantasy world, is overpowered from early on, and develops a harem. Oh, andhelps a few people during the series. That's pretty much the anime. While a small snippet of one episodes eludes to something bigger going on, as is usually the case when characters get trapped/sent to other worlds, I didn't care enough for the bigger picture to want to pursue the series further (plus even what was hinted at seemed like an overused plot idea). I'm not saying that any anime that comes out now with the whole trapped/reincarnated/etc. in another world story is worth under a 5 rating; that premise is so flexible in ways to spice it up, to make it stand-out and fun, which is probably why it still is being used so frequently in anime and manga. This series was just not a good representative for such series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\r\nNothing extraordinary, experimental, cutting-edge, etc. While it didn't hurt the eyes, it was just boring.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nJust look at the above, though change eyes for ears.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\r\nAt first I was thinking the main character could actually be interesting due to him being on the more mature side; in the end, though, his maturity simply meant he always knew how to approach things calmly. He was boring, no other way to put it. The other characters composing his harem are also boring, often stereotypical, and even forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI can't say I really enjoyed the series much at all. It was blah the whole way. The series should have had a sign that said \"Nothing to see here, move along\". \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nNow, perhaps for anyone simply wanting to see a mostly loli harem with little action actually occurring within the harem, this series is decent. For everyone else though, the series will likely come off boring, a rehash of ideas already being used for years now. I actually forgot the series ended last week, the final episode was so anti-climatic, that I didn't realize till this morning that the series didn't have a thirteenth final episode. I suggest to most people debating about whether to watch this series, as many others already have, to save the time and pick another series.",

While Konosuba aims for Comedy, Death March focus is in the lighthearted and kind environment. The world itself may be unoriginal but the take the series takes to the genre is novel. Don't mistake it as an another harem, sure some people may like this however this is not what the series is about.\r\nThe best way to describe the series is as follows: \"A slice of life One Punch Man with a very tender and positive outlook.\"I believe that I could have given this a 10 (Occasionally the Japanese style for harems went overboard . . . I don't like harems at all and I'm still giving this a 9. I wish I could go for 10 because of how warm the series was.) Fortunately that was not an obstacle as the MC is reluctant in the first place due to story reasons and he is the definition of truly a nice guy. Watching this makes you smile and it's the perfect way to welcome Spring after a long Winter.\\n",

If you are looking for an anime with a fixed, clear story/plot, this anime does not really have one unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nI am not really picky about art/sound, but I will mention that sometimes the character's voice sounds off, or doesn't really sound like how they look/act.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is decent, they portray their character's personality both directly and indirectly through their actions and verbal speech, and did not quite overemphasize on one's personality. But unfortunately most of the characters did not have enough characteristics, or you could say there was not enough scenes of character development.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, this anime is enjoyable to me.

To aim to find fun moments with the girls is not the problem, but the lack of necessary preambles to connect better with the cast.\\n\r\nThe characters are archetypes, but at least everyone participates. The argument focuses more on the exploration of the world, that has been a change of perspective from the previous one \"to fight and be the strongest\".

Here, though... the pacing is mind-bogglingly slow, and it feels like it takes two episodes to present one episode worth of material.\r\nIt also doesn't really have the \"peaceful silly fun\" atmosphere \"Smartphone\" had. \r\nSo, all things considered, there is little reason to watch it.\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\r\nRatings:\r\n3/10story, 5/10 art, 5/10 soudn, 4/10 character, 4/10 enjoyment, 4/10 overall.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nIt is usual (for nowadays, that is) \"game isekai\" where protagonist gets thrown into a game-like world, except he is overpowered. Similar titles are \"Overlord\", \"Smartphone\", \"Log Horizon\", and few others. \"Game isekai\" anime can only be fun when there's non -game conflict/story (like those in the good episodes of overlord), or when protagonist is overpowered in either a clever or fun way.\\n\\n\r\nNone like that is in this anime. The whole thing feels like overly long exposition with next to non-existent conflict. The \"cute girls doing silly things\" aspect also isn't strong enough to make it fun.... so all things considered, it is bland and dull with exception of a few moments.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10:\\n\r\nActually, it is decent with a slight touch of originality. One side character (golem) is quite cute and a bit unusual in design, protagonist is generic looking, and few small sidekicks could work as \"cute characters\" as well. THe whole thing feels a bit low-budget, though, and there are few noticeable instances of CG use, or \"animation saving\" tricks like panned shots, etc. \\n\\n\r\nI believe there was one or two decent ifght scenes with fluid movement, but fight scenes are so uncommon in this anime, that it doesn't really help.\\n\\n\r\nSoudn: 5/10:\\n\r\nThe \"watashi tachi no party\" ending sounded nice, and opening wasn't bad either, but overall the music simply doesn't stand out much. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10:\\n\r\nWalking stereotypical carton cutouts. Everybody is a stereotype, acts  their story role, and is not very believable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 4/10:\\n\r\nI found it to be dull. The events within episodes feel stretched, and it would be more intersting to watch the anime if it was \"compressed\" or had better writing. Overall it feels like this is 6 episode worth of events in it.\\n\\n\r\nOVerall: 4/10:\\n\r\nIt is boring to the point where it can put you to sleep. There is one nice moment in the beginning (fight), and nice moment in the middle (another fight), plus one somewhat cute/interesting character, but it is it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you REALLY want to watch \"game isekai\" you could try \"smartphone\" instead, or first 5 episodes of overlord 2 (lizardmen arc). Those will be better.\\n\\n\r\nOVerall it is not, horrible, but it is so dull that I can't really recommend it.",

There is really now way for me to explain how bad this story plot is because there is no plot, there is no end goal there is nothing. It might be good anime to watch if you are still a child.\r\nArt/Sound-7: the saving grace of this anime, the visuals and sound were not bad\r\nCharacter-1: The MC is possiblythe lamest most cliche character you can imagine. The upstanding mc with no humor but is badass and does the coolest calmest thing in every situation. retarded. other than that there are some lolis, animal girls and a slave harem. as well as a love intrest. All of them have no character development or just a generic female character personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-1: this show basically just made me cringe a wild amount and I was so close to dropping it countless times. I honesty hated it.\\n\\n",

I have no idea what kind of anime it's trying to be, and I don't think the studio did either. Is it a fantasy adventure? A slice of life? A harem comedy? It attempts to be all of these things at once, and ends up failing at all of them for that very reason.\r\nThe massive cast doesn't help. The girls are introduced so quickly that you barely get a chance to learn their names before the next one is tossed into the party. What couldhave been an interesting group of characters ends up being a boring haremesque mob of nobodies that follow the main character around because he's the main character.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does have plenty of fun ideas, but with only twelve episodes it never gets a chance to flesh any of them out. The series length is the single biggest thing holding it back from being a good show, but without a second season it will never be anything more than \"acceptable.\"",

            "content": "So this appears to be a divisive show somewhat, with some convinced that it's their favorite isekai 10/10 and others saying it's a loli-harem bait show that deserves a 1/10. In all honesty, Death March is neither of those shows, rather it's others representing extremes of what is present in the show.\r\nSpecifically in Death March, the protagonist doesn't play the usual clueless 17 year old male with an insatiable sex drive. Rather, he plays a 30 year old man in a 17 year old's body. Thus, he seems to handle situations closer to what a parent or adult would. He has a clean head, andthus takes on the responsibility of all these slaves so they can live a better life. That doesn't mean the trash tones that others are noting about it being a harem show aren't there, however, the point is to contrast the usual reaction to a harem with someone who is interested in older women and being a loving father.\\n\\n\r\nDeath March isn't a groundbreaking show, but the protagonist broke out of the mold enough I can see why people like it so much. However past this, there isn't much beyond Satou. Unfortunately, I don't believe (although I hope I'm wrong) that this show will get another season. It seems like this was a quick adaptation of a manga to fill the slots to air. There were hints to some interesting backstories to characters, however this wasn't really capitalized on in the short time we knew characters. It took a couple episodes to get the whole group together, so really going into backstory wasn't possible. The show itself would have benefited from a 20 episode season, because 12 just cut it a little too short. Arisa is fairly compelling, but as stated before they couldn't go in depth too much with the time they had.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the episodes were somewhat compelling, with Satou having to figure out inventory management as well as his level up system to complete events. Even though he can steamroll enemies, it's harder for him to save others or complete timed events without thinking ahead. That's more the meat of of the show, Satou thinking out his problems and coming to a solution that benefits everyone.\\n\\n\r\nI hope for another season, as honestly this was a pretty fun simulcast for me week to week. I'm not sure how a binge watch treats anyone, yet I found myself engaged in finding out more about the world and the characters. At the end of the day, that's all a moderately-good and average isekai needs.",

            "content": "Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku has ended after 12 episodes this Winter 2018 season. I believe it was bad, but better then it should have been for what the show is. Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku is about a late 29 year old Game Programmer who gets transported to a game world where he is 15. In this game world, a bug occurs and the protagonist, known as Satoo, becomes a level over 300. \r\nThat sounds familiar doesn't it. Through and through this is your typical Isekai show. Overpowered protagonist, harem, blank main character, everything. There are different kinds of quirks to thisshow to at least attempt to set it apart. Like how every time Satoo does something you can see the U.I of the game come up to confirm that. It displays a stats screen, inventory, points that you get to spend on skills, when he uses an ability, and when he acquires/uses an item. This happens quite often. Its sort of distracting really. Another part of the show that I've noticed is about the fetishization of being a savoir. Most of not all of the harem girls are slaves who are indebted to our protagonist. These girls that were abused and extorted before being saved. And after being saved, is then treated kindly, then joining as part of the harem. This archetype of the slave character is common in these type of shows, but they are normally limited to one or 2 girls. But Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku has it for most of its main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not very good, but by no means I hate this show. Its an isekai show for god's sake, the market is oversaturated, and it does nothing different. I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen much of this type of this show. Other then that, no recommendation. I give this show a 4 out of 10. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku.",

            "content": "IT IS IN NO WAY as bad as everyone makes out. It has flaws, sure, but find me an anime that doesn\u2019t! It was part entertaining, part relaxing, and part awkward, but overall mostly enjoyable.\r\nIt\u2019s a lot less plot-heavy than your normal Isekai anime. Most of the season is just Satou wandering around the new world he finds himself in, getting to grips with how things work and making friends along the way. He doesn\u2019t automatically stumble upon the main villain\u2019s giant plot to destroy the world as we know it. He gets into a few fights helping people, but mostly he just takes thingsas they come, day by day. That\u2019s why this is probably known as a slice-of-life Isekai. Which is nice for a change.\\n\\n\r\nYou might ask, if Satou is so overpowered why doesn\u2019t he act differently in like\u2026the majority of the situations? Why does he even bother trying to help people or getting into fights when he could easily kill any bad guy with a single strike, and make enough money to get absolutely anything he wants? \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fair question, and I think the answer is: he\u2019s simply enjoying himself as he is now. He\u2019s still figuring out this new world, and basically just taking a break from his exhausting previous life. As he is now, he\u2019s free, and revealing his strength would automatically diminish his freedom. He also doesn\u2019t realise just quite how OP he is, but it\u2019s unlikely much would change even if he did realise that he\u2019s miles above the strongest bosses.\\n\\n\r\nThe world building, while not exactly original, is well-presented. There\u2019s a lot of exposition, and great details of time can be spent on single meals or learning a new type of magic. There\u2019re plenty of inner monologues too, but they tend to be on interesting topics or areas that prove necessary for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the art was amazing, but then again I\u2019m just partial to that type of style. The animation was great, and the music was light-hearted and fit the series well.\\n\\n\r\nThe harem. This is where the problem starts. So here\u2019s the thing, Satou is actually a 30 year old guy in a 15 year old body. He has the mind and tastes of a 30-year-old, and he\u2019s not interested in little kids or lolis. He picks up a lot (A LOT) of girls during his wanderings \u2013 saves their lives, rescues them from slaver or kidnappers, defeats them after being challenged to a fight, you name it \u2013 but he views himself as their guardian and is not interested in any of them sexually. That isn\u2019t to say he\u2019s celibate; he just goes elsewhere when he wants to party. A few of the girls (not the younger ones) seem to be in love with him, but it\u2019s unlikely that will ever get anywhere. There is an awkward scene shortly after he rescues two of the girls from a slaver (which is understandable considering how they must have been previously treated), and another one near the end, but he sorts it out both times and moves on.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s different to your normal harem. It\u2019s not that Satou\u2019s merely incredibly dense and doesn\u2019t figure out their feelings, simply that he doesn\u2019t return them. (I\u2019m not sure if this applies in relation to the oldest of them \u2013 who at least is an adult - but it still seems unlikely.) He\u2019s kind and gentle to everyone, teaches them how to read and fight, and basically just views them as his new family.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a caveat; it feels like this takes a turn for the worse in the final episode. It\u2019s almost like the creators realised that they had no weird moments in most of the anime, so tried to cram them all in at the end. I\u2019d actually advise against watching the final half of the last ep, it\u2019s a lot more cringey than the others and adds nothing to the story anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem (and this is the result of having so many characters) is that none of the cast really gets much development. The only character who even gets a proper backstory is Arisa, and even that doesn\u2019t have much time spent on it. As for Satou, I had no idea he actually died in his sleep until someone pointed it out to me \u2013 even though it happens in the first episode and is in the actual name of the blasted anime. I\u2019d just thought until then that it was like Log Horizon where everyone just disappeared in front of their computers one day. That being said though, making him a game dev was a good idea. It makes his natural understanding of the game mechanics much more realistic, because it\u2019s the sort of thing he himself created in his job. His OPness also made better sense that way too. So well done on that part.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it\u2019s just an anime to watch when you want to kill some time. It\u2019s not deep, and not generally fast-paced, but it is quite light-hearted and relaxing. It has none of the heaviness of Grimgar or the horror/mystery of Re:Zero. It\u2019s more like watching Konosuba but without all the crude and over-the-top humour. If that sort of light-hearted atmosphere is the type of thing you like, then this might be worth a watch.

            "content": "So here we go to another anime review... This time is Isekai Smartphone to Tomo ni season 2.... sorry nah... it's Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku or Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody and it was awful!\r\nI love Isekai guys. I really do. Overlord was one of the first animes I watched and loved. Dan Machi aas well. But both Death March and Smartphone guy are crap. Comparing it Sword Art Online is almost an affront to it. Those two shows suffer  from the same problem I truly despise. Over Powerful characters. In Death March we follow Ichirou Suzuki who works ata software company and it's transported to another world. Right from the start he finish off some lizards with a fireball that make him level 300 or so and from this moment on every people he meets are between level 1 to 15 or so. There aren't anyone more powerful than him. And everything he do he do it easily.  So, of course he sets to do what High School DxD main guy couldn't... Be a Harem King. And this guy is the man. He has by the last episode 8 girls range 10 or so 17/18 and all want to jump him down HARD. (okay not all but half!).\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the cast of females is that they are so many and so poorly written and most of them are alike or bland. After all they are characters from a game (minus one). From Liza, Ponchi or Tama who were slaves and were bought by Satou. But he doesn't end there Arisa & Lulu. Also Nana who is a Homonculus and become part of his harem - she has great boobs but unfortunately (or not) don't have a personality... Mia an elf princess and I am forgetting someone... But I tell you it doesn't matter. There is also soldier who he doesn't buy but saves in the first episode and that's Zena. It seems he has some legit interest in her but unfortunately the other gals don't let him pursue the feelings...\\n\\n\r\nSo each three or four episodes follows a arc (maybe a light novel) and Ichirou deals with plain and easily putting one more girl in his harem...\\n\\n\r\nBoring little anime, with no real ending (after all the light novels keep coming out and suprises me how people enjoy it). As a novel it might be good to read before some more compliated novels and thus I compreehend the hype after all we all do that. I do that with Dan Machi per example or some warhammer novels. But comparing the anime to Overlord, Grimgar or even Dan Machi or god's sake (well not him) Youjo Senki is really saying that Mong\u00f3lia has a international football team as Portugal or Germany. They are both football teams but they play in very different leagues. \\n\\n\r\nSorry forgot to mention about the rest of the things... Art is okay - nothing to spectacular but fortunately not all girls have super boobs but they pretty generic comparing with other works from Silver Link. They really look the same with other characters from some of their shows.. good look ;) The sound it's there and serves its purpose but it's nothing too good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's one of those animes to watch between other animes but if you skipped it you would miss a thing. This show is not going to be recommend by anyone. Please don't watch it in one go... Unless you do it rapidly. \\n\\n\r\n4/10 (which is the same rating as Smartphone guy)",

Stories like those are enjoyable and sell well, so I can't really say that it's a downside, but market oversaturation and people getting fed up with cliches can hurt it.\r\nStill, you can't make a story only from used parts, and Death March has some things that make it stand out fromcrowd. \\n\r\nOne such quality would be adult protagonist. While Satou isn\u2019t some daredevil badass, his not being dense (!) and keeping cool head in situations where MCs usually panic is really refreshing. I blame animation (facial emotions) and voice acting for making him seem much less interesting than he is.\\n\r\nOther thing that makes Death March special is some focus on exploration of the world and its systems. It\u2019s one of few isekai titles that actually show us protagonist trying to understand and test how his abilities work. It goes well in pair with Satou\u2019s desire to enjoy this new world at his own pace, without becoming some great hero and gathering attention.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you could ask where things went wrong and what\u2019s the reason behind this anime\u2019s low score. I believe biggest flaw in this adaptation is too small focus on things I mentioned in previous paragraph. The adult and experienced protagonist, as I mentioned earlier, has been undermined by voice acting and animation. The exploration part, that could win over SoL crowd, was used more like a filler between \u201cstory\u201d and action, instead of being the main driving force.\\n\r\nThe bad animation that I keep mentioning over and over again also hurt action scenes a lot. And I mean A LOT. They are truly pathetic and I don\u2019t know why they even bothered with those.\\n\r\nAnother weak point of Death March are characters. While Satou is pretty good himself, vast majority of main and side characters are just bad. Personalities that can be summed up in one word and no development or backstories make even main cast feel like mob characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what about enjoyment? As I said in the beginning, it\u2019s very enjoyable anime. Even when Satou\u2019s voice tried to put me to sleep and my eyes bleed from animation, I still had a lot of fun watching it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if not all the downsides I mentioned earlier, this anime would be even more enjoyable. It\u2019s just one of those titles that don\u2019t rely that much on more artistic values and rather make watcher enjoy it by playing on more basic desires and wish fulfillment.\\n\\n",

Warning I am enebriated as that's the only way of watching this show without dying of boredom.\r\nStory: It's about a game developer working on the development of a game, that happens to randomly enter the world of a game that incorporates elements of the games he's working on. Instead of getting involved he prefers a passive position, observing the world and how it functions. Which is cool and all until you realize nothing happens and it's 12 episodes of him realizing *wow a new feature that is totallystandard of RPGs I just happened to learn about!* Then you mix in some fetishistic scenes and pro-slavery sentiments and a lack of a cohesive plot, and bam you get Death March.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is alright.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Same as art, the sound is alright.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There is no character worth discussing, there's Kirito 2.0 and a bunch of side characters that are mostly irrelevant until they are shoehorned in for either fanservice or to remind you that these people that aren't interesting are important too!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Watching this show was a test of patience and resolve and I think I failed.

The anime in its self was not built to be an action packed show like DB or Naruto. Its more of an anime that brings a sense of calm to the person. \r\nAside from the main character, Satou, the rest are pretty interesting. They have their cliches and all but are made fun and interesting. The relationship between the main character is also fun because to the little girls he is ateacher while he is a friend to the others. Never treating them like slaves. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character in itself is the OP super powerful character but at difference of other anime the story is supposed to be like that. The story wouldn't be as interesting if we watched the main character have to become stronger and fight against the weaker characters when there are other anime that do that better. \\n\\n\r\nThe story in itself is pretty charming because we don't know why he was brougt into this world as it just happened. There was no God or magical summoning as there was for the other Japanese people brought to this world. Combined with that  Satou is the game creator and knows his stuff, it results in a charming and calm story.",

            "content": "I think to start this review off I should say that I have been reading this online for about 1~2 years now. It completely threw me for a loop when I learned that Death March was getting an anime, and hopefully you will understand why I feel that way after this review. So I know where this story eventually develops to, but I can still understand all of the reviews complaining about the plot and story. And honestly, they should complain, because I don't think this story is anime worthy for the amount of episodes that they have given it.\r\nNow, I'm not complaining about thepacing, about them packing too much info into too little episodes- in fact, the pacing is almost the same as it is in the novel. But that hasn't done a good thing for this show. This show is about slice of life over-powered protagonist going into a world where he can travel and discover new places, eat new foods, and find all the cliche' isekai (did i spell that right?) would-be protagonists that he eventually encounters. It is a story of comedy and satire on all the feudal magical worlds ever made. But the problem is, with the slow pacing and small number of episodes, Death March will never get to the core of what the show is about. At least we got to see the cute Tama and Pochi though!\\n\\n\r\n*Update*\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the series, all I can tell you is, if you haven't read the book, don't bother watching this. You won't feel anything for it and will probably be disappointed. The novel is meant to be enjoyed slowly over a long period of time, and is great light reading. But the only thing that this anime could have brought to the table was great animation, picture, and sound, and it never brought any of those things. It really is not worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend the novel which sousetsuka is translating currently, because things do get more interesting, but there was too little in this adaptation of it.",

            "content": "So all I'm seeing in the reviews right now are the logical extremes of ratings - literally 9's, 10's and 1's.  Thus i felt it was my duty to give a more nuanced and rational review of this anime.  \r\nFirst off, I think there's clearly something here.  I read the manga adaptation way before this came out, and between that and the anime, there's magic in the simplicity of the story.  The protagonist is pretty tame and most of our supporting cast are 1 dimensionally characterized by single words like: \"child,\" \"dutiful,\" \"meek,\" or (sigh) \"horny,\" yet the characters come togetherin something that really blends together as a family.   Hands down this is the best part of the show - the semi-subversion of what could have so easily been another mindless harem into a cute, loving adopted family.  Hell ya I'm sold on watching a simple but consistent main character travel around a fantasy world adopting cute girls in need into his care and teaching them how to survive in a world filled with racism and greed.  And we get... a little bit of that.\\n\\n\r\nSo lets get on to the issues.  I did not like the 7 anime episodes I have seen, and from what I know from alternate sources, the story gets worse.  So as I said there's quite a few cute characters that our MC basically adopts, however he adopts them so fast we have little to no time to actually get to know them.  As soon as we get a new set of faces, our old characters' screen time is practically 0 - and hence we only have time for only the most basic of character development.  The main character is equally stale but doesn't even have this poor excuse.  Multiple times he encounters things that give him the opportunity for deep existential conflict as to: why he's here, who else is here, and the vicious nature of classism an racism, but our protagonist merely comments on it and drops the topic permanently within seconds.  Too bad we don't get to see internal conflict or question the setting - that would be too exciting.  \\n\r\nSpeaking of which is our next issue - pacing and drama.  The story has little excitement and plays down what little it has.  The first episode has actual tension because the protagonist is concerned for his survival, but past that episode we will never be concerned again that any issue can trouble our hero.  At some point he faces off with a deific being, and never once will you hear him sound anything but calm and in control.  He's not even worried about his girls, because he's so completely sure he can protect them too.  There's so much room for drama and badassery here, but the execution is just as poor as the quality of the lackluster animation.\\n\r\nConstantly, throughout this story you'll find the author falling into that age old trap of wish fulfillment - gutting the drama in lieu of a Main Character who feels calm, collected and in control at all times.  And that really could have worked, if instead of all this action nonsense they just focused on the strengths of the story - a cute family riding around discovering the world - but of course each arc is premised entirely around which damsel will be rescued and our would building and character building is stifled. \\n\r\n Clearly the author wanted drama - constantly rescuing damsels demands drama, however the wish fulfillment formula demands no drama. Either can work, but the author amateurishly tried to merge these two concepts in the worst possible way.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Author found some magic but instead of exploring it, we get a pretty generic wish fulfillment series with particularly bad action sequences.  \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing i gotta say before this review ends is: Thank you satou for not being a pedophile.  \\n",

I like how lighthearted it is, just like what you feel when you are walking to a park while eating ice cream together with your pet or your friends. \r\nLiking the MC's companions is easier than liking the MC cause he is too OPand too plain at the same time and the way he handle things is somehow questionable but I think the author really want it that way cause it compliment how the story flows. The author made the MC's character plainly white so you can easily love the colorful personalities of his companion/family.He made the MC too OP so he can easily deal with serious matters(killing dragons,gods and demon lords) and set it aside while focusing on trivial matters like gathering material,drinking tea, playing and eating with her companion and how they compete for his affection cause that trivial matters is what this anime is all about. The interaction of the characters itself and their simple daily life full of cuteness and warm feeling.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are expecting something like SAO, Grimgar, NGNL,Log Horizon then you will really get disappointed.

The show's art and story was good but the characters and the humors were quite off... The character just lacks the kick to be a good show. It's mild and it's kinda out of place. The character was OP but lacks the ability to give me goosebumps unlike that good other similar anime that's airing this season.\r\nBut this is something that I can tolerate for the sake of finishing the show... I am in between of Liking andDisliking the show, but  I hope it works out.",
