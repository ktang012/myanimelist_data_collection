            "content": "Vampires are overrated these days. The idea of them being in anime series isn't a new concept either. In fact, there's plenty of them already like Vampire Knight, Shiki, Rosario + Vampire, etc. Most of them involves some sort of strange faithful day event when the vampire gets caught up with a human in their world and then certain twists come that ties them to some sort of relationship. Only this time, it's a little a bit different. In Blood Lad, the vampire actually wants to help the human. Rather than treating them as a slave or food, this series takes a twist as ourvampiric friend Vlad Charlie Staz embarks on a journey to restore a human back to their mortal selves after a tragic event. (by tragic, I mean as in getting eaten alive)\\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad is an anime adapted series based off the manga of the same name written by Yuuki Kodama. The series takes the vampire theme idea and twists it into a humorous tale. That's because our otaku friend Staz has never met a human girl before. So, what happens when a young, pretty, and shy Japanese girl accidentally wonders into his territory? All hell breaks loose. Or rather for Staz, it's like the dream of a life time. After all, he's never met a human before. More so, Fuyumi Yanagi happens to be a girl with a Japanese background. It's a fun journey and one hell of a ride, for both our main characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, we know that Staz is a vampire but also a boss of sorts at his own territory. He has his own underlings for dirty work. Judging by his appearance, Staz also seems to be unemployed and is literally an otaku with the stuff he has hanging around his room. More interesting factors about his character reveals that despite being a vampire, he doesn't seem to have an appetite for human blood. Oddly enough though, he does have a bit of bloodlust towards Fuyumi. This spells out a sort of trouble for Fuyumi because Staz's lack of common sense. In fact, we can see that Staz only seems to lust after Fuyumi in the beginning because of her fresh scent of blood and body. Strangely though, his lust disappears after Fuyumi's death. But the fact that he still cares enough to help Fuyumi return to her normal life shows his sincerity. It almost seems to be human like for Staz because the lengths he goes to help Fyumi throughout the series despite numerous dangers that puts his own life at risk. Fuyumi on the other hand plays the role more of the eye-candy but also at times encourages Staz to be himself. It's an odd relationship between the duo but they sure stand out as entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters plays their part to fulfill the entertainment part as well. We got mad scientists, a witch, and werewolf that adds to the package of this series. Their diversity and abilities adds more flavor to the series that is not only tasty but also spices up some troubles for both Staz and Fuyumi. For instance, there's a rivalry between Staz and Wolf beyond just going at each other with fists. Then, there's also some sibling trouble for Staz later on that adds even more dangers to himself. It's a fun take to this series because Staz has to learn how to adjust without depending on others. It's the fact that Fuyumi depends on him this time as Staz learns more about humanity as well as himself. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the series having a relevant plot, it usually maintains more of a lighthearted and humorous atmosphere. This is evidenced by the various parodies in the beginning such as the stuff  in Staz's room or the way that Fuyumi is killed. Even though she is dead, Fuyumi returns as a cute ghost and her method of death can also be surprisingly amusing. The show also plays on Staz's character by portraying him as a character with little knowledge of what's really there. For example, there are numerous times when Staz uses ideas he gets from Japanese manga which he reads from rather than common sense. On a more serious note, there's some revelations revealed later on that might surprise some viewers.\\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad also presents the supernatural relevantly well. Although not as grim as some series such as Shiki, this anime portrays Staz as a vampire with supernatural abilities. This is evidenced in the beginning as he is able to do various things that a normal human cannot. Then, there's the other characters too who displays their own sides of supernatural traits such as Wolf and his expertise in the boxing field or Hydrabell with her magic. Needless to say, the series' characters and setting combines elements of both the real world and the supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nFan service is also an overused word but Blood Lad doesn't avoid it. In fact, there's plenty of those for both girls and the guys. Fuyumi fulfills the role of fanservice with her body structure as well as being stark naked from the very first episode after her fate. In fact, the way she looks must also been a trigger for Staz's bloodlust for her. It doesn't stop there either though as she has to depend on Staz in order to remain existent. To do, there's the finger sucking along with the baby bottles. Furthermore, she is often dressed in skimpy ways or in lascivious outfits. Even for the female audience, there's some service to offer when Staz and Wolf gets into a fight in their outfits. It's service for the fans and at times, they do get out of hand.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the series defies any realism, expect some strange twists as well. It also doesn't fit within some vampire themes since Staz is shown to be stronger than the typical vampire with his resistance to certain weaknesses. Fuyumi also seems to play along with her new adjusted life even though she wants to return to her human life. The fact that the duo has gotten used to each other shows how much they value their relationship even if it's completely on bizarreness. It's what Blood Lad is anyways, a bizarre yet entertaining anime with more than just a love triangle or thirst for vengeance.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals wise, Brain Base does an alright job with its elements although some of the characters' designs looks rather generic. Fuyumi in particular is designed to look busty with girlish traits while Staz is more of the bad boy role. The characters all have some taste of their supernatural traits though whether it's a werewolf, vampire, etc. The supernatural world doesn't look as grim or too unusual compare to our own. On the other side, some of the monsters are portrayed as looking dangerous. The production values are decent though with style. Staz's sunglasses, Liz's headgear, and Wolf's silver hair are reflection of this in a humorous way.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Blood Lad is above par. The OP song \"ViViD\" by May'n has a rocky style with its presentation. Then, there's the action and comedy scenes where music matches its style. True to its premise, Blood Lad also has its occasionally eerie-like soundtrack playing during some of the more scenes fitting within this vampiric theme series. Staz's VA Ryota Osaka (Valvrave the Liberator: Haruto, Rozen Maiden: Jun, Hataraku Maou-sama: Sadao) recently began to play parts relating to young teenagers whose life is changed dramatically. Thus expect his talent to come in this series as well in the shoes of our vampire. On the other hand, Fuyumi's shy voice reflects her character in the new situation she is in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Blood Lad is a very fun series to watch and enjoy. To me, it shouldn't be taken serious despite its premise. In fact, there are many moments in this series where the fights and moments are portrayed as parody rather than anything too serious. However, Staz is serious about his mission to help Fuyumi return to being mortal once again. If I was entirely serious though, most of the series should be absorbed as fun and a different take on the vampire genre. It's not just about falling in love or achieving vengeance. Rather, Blood Lad plays on the values of a relationship between a human and a vampire to see how far they come. It's a journey that will quench your thirst if you're looking for some fun.",

            "content": "Ok, time to make my review of this 10 episode anime thing....then again, I think I should just quit beating around the bush and state by ratings for each of this anime's category.\r\nStory: mediocre 5.\r\nOk, so vampires plots are overrated, and this anime follow the same path as that of the main character which has some similarities from \"Hataraku Maou-sama\" which is about a underworld big boss who doesn't wanna be a big boss anymore and desires a simple life in another place, in fact the plot is almost the same as the mentioned anime. Only the execution is different and it is almost (and I do mean \"ALMOST\") like a remake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I'm gonna give the credit to Fuyumi and Hydra bell, co'z I like the way how they're illustrated.\\n\\n\r\nSound: fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ, Oh sorry I doze off, ok on this part I'm gonna refer to the main character's diction, intonation, enunciation, and tone as some what, ZZZZZZZZZ, eh! Ok so their voice seemly has that lack of sleep thing in it that one would make you want to doze off or it has the sleepy effect as if the character's themselves and I'm referring to Staz and Braz's who have been deprived of sleep for a very long time. However, I give this anime's category a 6 co'z I like the way Fuyumi's VA who delivers a sweet tone on to her character. As for the op and ed....I hate them both.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Enjoyment and Overall: poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- It's all on Staz, everything about the character is too cliche especially when everything was place on him, other character's here are just antagonist waiting to be tamed by him, Fuyumi on the other hand is more of  a sexy mascot than a damsel in distress as for Hydra Bell... I kind hate her dichotomy character which she's this liberated  evil bitch in one hand which you wouldn't wanna bring home to mom and on the other hand she want's to be loved.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- The enjoyment part of this anime is pretty stupid, in fact I can compared it to opening a safe where one wasted a lot of time and effort only to find out that the combination is just 12345. Just like this anime Staz when into a lot of effort to make Fuyumi a human again only to be flustered us audience that Fuyumi simply has to go back to her world to be human again, then again it also conflicts earlier episodes were Fuyumi and Staz did went into the human world and Fuyumi is still a ghost. It would have had a smart ending if Staz forces that Frankenstein doctor in his world to clone Fuyumi's body and have her soul posses it just like what Braz did to his father in the final part of the last episode.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Brain Base, didn't do a good job of presenting this anime, then again, it was a good thing that they limit it to just 10 episodes.  Overall, this series should be better off as a manga than an anime. Season 2? I wouldn't suggest it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Blood Lad is a classic example of taking a typical genre type and applying a currently popular twist on it; in this case you end up with yet another supernatural comedy Most titles that fall under this category are barely passable, but Blood Lad seemed to stand out from the rest of the crowd so I gave it a chance. I mean a vampire boss that is more interested in the otaku culture of Japan over fresh human blood\u2026 that doesn\u2019t sound too unoriginal and downright unbearable, right? Well I\u2019m going to tell you why I was neither right nor wrong in Blood Lad\u2019s case.\\n\r\nThe story follows Staz, a vampire boss of the demon world. He is feared across the demon world for being one of the most powerful bosses around and is also known for always accomplishing any goal he sets out for. So when Fuyumi, a young and big-breasted Japanese girl, accidentally makes it into the demon world and is killed, Staz decides he\u2019ll help bring her back to life. Already two typical character types have been established: an overpowered hero and a big-breasted, clumsy heroine. So, if it sounds to you like a pretty typical hero saves damsel-in-distress story then you\u2019re absolutely right\u2014because that\u2019s what it is. But that is not all it is. Let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this series was the comedy. It wasn\u2019t forced, it wasn\u2019t complicated, the references to Japanese culture were easy to understand for any anime fan, it was not overused and it was just downright hilarious. But the credibility of the series cannot be justified by just one aspect of the plot even if the show is prominently defined by this aspect\u2014and that is where Blood Lad quickly let itself down. At first, the comedy held up the dialogue in a good way but it soon became hard to overlook the lacking parts of the rest of the dialogue. The comedy became repetitive and started to let down the dialogue and eventually the plot also. Where Blood Lad\u2019s story went wrong is when they failed at mixing bad drama and action with good comedy\u2014and then tried to patch up their faults with more good comedy. After this much repetition, the good comedy became bad comedy and the plot became even less comprehensible because of the overuse of unneeded gags.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the story, Blood Lad\u2019s art started out great but was relatively let down by a certain aspect. Prominently the most annoying part of Blood Lad\u2019s art was the obscure and abstract changing of colours, backgrounds and art within certain scenes at an attempt to pair with the comedic side of the plot. At first it worked well but this soon enough, just like the use of comedy, became forced and overused. Apart from this annoyance, Blood Lad\u2019s art was actually one of the series\u2019 strong points. The animation was always fluid, the art was consistent, the character designs and the design of the Japan influenced \u2018demon world\u2019 worked very well together and over all the animation, when not overused, matched the mood of the series and the genre by having simple and somewhat goofy character designs like typical comedy series do but also mixing it with typical shounen character designs, this caused a nice blend of the comedy and action. Apart from the certain abstract scenes mentioned before, the art was far from an eyesore and actually helped maintain the series when it began to fail.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack goes with the series in a pleasurable but non-memorable way. The opening song did a great job of giving me a positive view when I started the anime and when I started the new episode every week. Even when I knew the anime that was starting after the minute and a half song was far from perfect. The soundtrack worked well in matching the moods of different scenes and didn\u2019t separate the viewer from the voice acting but instead accompanied the seiyuu\u2019s dialogue well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Blood Lad all play a relatively necessary role in the show but the way some of these roles were developed is probably the weakest point of the series. In some cases there is no development at all, they are simply placed in the series for the short time they are needed then used later on for gags. But, with it being a 10 episode series and of the comedy genre, which doesn\u2019t typically have or need much character development,  I do take into account that it would be very hard to develop all the characters they introduced. So I\u2019ll only be judging the development of the main characters. Staz, obviously, has the most development as a character throughout the series and for a comedy series this should have been absolutely fine, here\u2019s the problem though-- it didn\u2019t feel like enough. The flashbacks and dialogue he\u2019s involved in don\u2019t provide enough substance to give me a reason to care about him. Little character development in a comedy series is acceptable but if it is not handled well, which in this case it wasn\u2019t, it makes you care about the character less. If you don\u2019t care about the main character then it is hard to care about anything he or she is involved in, which in a main character\u2019s case is usually everything to do with the series. The biggest let down of the series was the underdevelopment of Staz, if you can\u2019t get your viewer to care about the main character then the anime falls apart.\\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad was a show that let itself down more than it let the viewers down, because it could have been much more than it ended up as.\\n\\n\r\nBut after all this negativity in this piece of writing I can honestly say that I still really enjoyed Blood Lad. No it didn\u2019t impress me as much as I was expecting, yes it had a lot of flaws, but the overall charm of the series kept me watching. If you\u2019re a fan of this anime I can understand why and I can also say I am a fan. If I can\u2019t point out the flaws in a series then how can I properly call myself a fan? Blood Lad was a fun experience and I still hold to my previous comment that it was neither unbearable and unoriginal nor bearable and original, because honestly from a critical standpoint Blood Lad didn\u2019t impress me or frustrate me\u2014it just gave me enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nAfter reading this review I hope you have a good idea on all the flaws of Blood Lad. But if you were interested in this series like I was I encourage you to look past the flaws and have fun with this anime, it might not be the most empowering, impressive, revolutionary anime in existence but it is great for some enjoyable watching and sometimes that\u2019s all that matters. If you can look past that fact then who knows you might really enjoy this anime. Give it a shot.\\n",

            "content": "\"Every vampire fiction reinvents vampires to its own needs. You take what you want.\"\r\nWhen and why did vampires become so popular in the past few years? The only conclusion that I could really come to was the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer. It's the series that sucked the blood (and money for that matter) out of adolescent girls everywhere. Why? Somewhere along the line I think our society forgot what vampires are supposed to be. The premise of \u2018Vampires\u2019 were originally made to be terrifying beings that were both intimidating and powerful.  If you don't know what I'm talking about regarding what a vampireideally should be, I would promptly direct you to Hellsing Ultimate where you may bask in the bloody goodness that is Alucard.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Blood Lad is pretty unoriginal. Vampire meets a human girl, the human girl gets into trouble, and the vampire becomes the hero to save her. Pretty clich\u00e9. The plot of Blood Lad, however, is pretty good. The demon world is interesting in itself based on the premise of the 'bosses' that control territories, the hierarchy of demons, and the Demon Acropolis (where top tier demons reside). Material is presented at a good pace that keeps the audience interested rather than confused; at a ten episode run, that's quite a feat. One last thing that I want to mention is that Blood Lad is lined with constant references to other anime and anime characters. If you're like me and enjoy knowing what is being referenced, you'll think or say something to the equivalent of, \"Fuck yeah! I got that reference. Sweet!\" as you give yourself a high five. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation of Blood Lad is good. It's an anime of 2013 and thus there it's essentially a basic standard to have good animation and art. The action scenes look nice, the characters look good, and everything flows well overall. Nothing to complain about here, but also nothing to brag about. The sound portion is decent enough. The OP and ED are both pretty good; I enjoyed them both, but they aren't something that warrants watching and listening to every episode. There are a wide array of voices for the characters and I liked how fitting they were for their respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the characters of Blood Lad interact. Each of them is interesting in their own sense of the word. Staz, the main protagonist, is a vampire of prestigious class/breed and 'boss' of a territory in the demon world. He\u2019s also and an otaku that aims to quench his thirst for something that isn\u2019t blood; he's infatuated with all things from the human world, but mainly things from Japan. He collects anime, manga, video games, Japanese attire, and becomes entranced by anything new from the human world. This is also part of the reason he is attracted to Fuyumi, the female lead. Fuyumi is a human girl from Japan who ends up wandering into the demon world accidently and subsequently turned into a ghost after dying. She entrusts her future to Staz in hopes that he can return her back to being human. She's really shy, quiet, and humble for the most part. Bell, a spatial magic sorceress, acts like a second female lead. She's provides quite a few comedic moments and often teases Staz. She's clever and deceptive, but also is also quite the softie. While those three are the really prevalent characters, many other characters take up their fair share of screen time such as Wolf, Braz, and Liz. I don't think there was a character I legitimately didn't like in the whole series, however there also wasn't much meaningful development for the series\u2019 characters either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Blood Lad is entertaining to say the least. I enjoyed what it had to offer for a story about vampires and the supernatural. Fan service is really prevalent in this series and did become slightly a nuisance for me; it seems they took every opportunity to showcase cleavage and added it in. The series runs for only ten episodes, which is a shame because it leaves a lot of questions unanswered and feels rather incomplete. If you're looking for a fun, simple show to watch, Blood Lad might be what you're looking for; just don't expect any deep themes or depth that makes a series great.\\n",

            "content": "I couldn't stand this show. It was so boring, cliched, generic, uninteresting, annoying, unfunny, and just stupid. I didn't want to know what any of the episodes contained after what is established to be after the 2nd episode. I couldn't careless.\r\nThese characters were the worst thing about this show, I couldn't stand to think why they are even in the show, it all felt like excuses for entertainment. All of them were easy to look in the eye and know what they are, and that's great, I love a show that can establish something, but when you are obnoxious about it, then you are boundto make it tiresome and annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe show carefully explains what this whole story is about, saving a human's life. Now it sounds serious, but they executed it like it was child's play. Wow, I am so interested how they are going to save a human's life. They went through boxing, they fought a boring ass side villain, the main character has family problems, and, and... wait, why do they all sound so simple, but not even a single bit of original idea's in it? DING DING DING, you hear that folks? They made a show not only to slowly advance what the main story is about, but to shove in every cookie cutter activities just to make a show cool. WOW, THIS SHOW IS A NEW HIT. A BIRTH TO A NEW GENERATION OF STEALING IDEAS FOR TEENAGE ENTERTAINMENT. I GUESS WE GOTTA HAVE A NEW TITANIC WHERE THEY HAVE TO PLAY GOLF TO WIN THE GIRL OF THEIR DREAMS! DOESN'T\"T THAT SOUND EXCITING??\\n\\n\r\nEven the whole story is dreadful, I can explain one sub-plot without making it sound entertaining, but that's how the actual show is. Here is one sub-plot I have summarized while watching this show, and yes, it is spoilers. Here we GO!\\n\\n\r\nThe main character and the human ran to see the main characters buddy. They found him coincidentally and asked how to resurrect a human. He wants to know why the main character cares, and the main character just does. His friend asks for a competition and he agrees. If the main character wins, he gets to know how to resurrect, however, if he loses, he needs to give away the human. He was unaware what the competition, generally we all thought they were just going to fight it out using their powers, well they are fighting, but by boxing. The human is wearing a costume for fan service. The main character and his friend were fighting, and the main character drained his strength by using his fangs. His friend transformed into a werewolf, but it was pointless. The main character was about to conclude the fight, but the girl starts crying and said to stop fighting. The other girl, who was unbriefly introduced in the 2nd episode, stopped the fight by teleporting the characters to a different area. The werewolf gives in and explains about the resurrection.\\n\\n\r\nYou starting to see how boring and plain this was? Well if you watch the anime, you aren't going to be thrilled about watching the actual event, because it is, so, damn, BORING AND ANNOYING. \\n\\n\r\nI can't understand how this can happen. I don't understand why people think it is funny and original, I don't know why people think this is a masterpiece, and I don't know PEOPLE ENJOY IT. It's the fact there are vampires that are way overrated in this show, how there is a werewolf, there are monsters in the show, the main character is all powerful and is chill about it, a girl looks attractive that they dress her up and make her do things that no standard girl would ever do in their entire lives because she is played like a plain girl, so WHY MAKE HER LIKE THIS AT ALL, and... you know what, this is why it is enjoyable because IT IS SO GENERICALLY BULLSHIT. \\n\\n\r\nWell there are more shows out there that are like this, and people seem to enjoy them and don't care, so I guess trying to prove why it's bad is pointless.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 3/10, twilight but with boobs.\\n",

            "content": "Blood Lad is a supernatural anime, revolving around a mystical realm involving the main character, Staz, a vampire boss in charge of a territory who is surprisingly also an otaku and a huge fan of everything Japan-related. It is weird yet unique.\r\nThe story starts of when a human girl (the main female character, sadly I forgot her name) appears from nowhere in town and thus Staz's people find her, knowing Staz will be fascinated by the human girl. Then he realizes that she is fading from the world of living and he decided to help her initially for his own goals. He gets help fromhis friends and yea.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the story of this anime is really inconsistent, it is like sht happens, then it becomes good again in a matter of time, fluctuating the repetitive pattern. Some episodes are really interesting with it's action scenes and humour and it is so hilarious most of the time while it also contains many references to real anime in our world, however, some episodes are just SO boring I actually fell asleep for half an episode and could not wake up until my room was drooling from liquid......inconsistency is majorly a lack down for this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art quality was decent to say the least. The character designs were well made and they were recognizable, sadly though, it isn't amazing either. The background colours were quite random, they were all over the place and although it is a demon world, every single street in this world shouldn't look like its graffiti done by a 5 year old brat.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was fine, the opening was catchy and a bit addicting, but then the ending song was quite wrong, it doesn't fit well with mood of the ending of any episode, doesn't collaborate well or match nicely to present a neat and long lasting effect to the audience, every time the ending song played, i felt like i was in a funeral with a group of friends singing a sad song. Also, noneo f the soundtracks were memorable, but o well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all-rounded, there were the girls who only tried to get laid with Staz, and then the male characters who were nicely brought in. Wolf, the masochist was basically a power-house, he could tank an entire army including Staz and he was strong as well, being that said, one of my favorite scenes was him fighting Staz in a boxing match. He also showed feelings towards liking Fuyumi the main girl (oh i remembered), helping her out. Staz was quite likable, a badass overpowered damning kamikaze here and there fanboy who gets all the chicks day and night. However, none of the characters were well developed, reducing the potential of these characters. Building a development, story or background of a characters especially the main characters will definitely provide and deliver more feels towards the show, and we will care more about them, because when Fuyumi was fading i didnt even cry, when staz was beaten up, i didnt cry or flood a river in my room becaue I already knew that he would wake up and trash the enemy in a matter of 3 seconds. \\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad, was not terrible or extremely bad, but the potential wasted was disappointing as I really did expect more from these characters and even the plot as well. Pacing was poo, inconsistent episode delivery too. The humor and action were the notable qualities that were well done in this anime. It is a good comedy and fantasy genre anime\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Blood lad will give you quite a lot of laughs, but you can be sure to feel safe because there isn't anything sad or tragic here, don't worry your room will not flood with tears. You wont give any damns, when someone dies. Inconsistency kills Blood Lad, leaving it stoned, becoming little bacon-bits. \\n\\n",

The excellent portrayal of said Comedy really sets the light tone of the anime which favours the otherwise feeble story. The timing of the jokes was never rushed nor forced nor complicated. They were easy to follow and hilarious to watch so you are in store for some serious chuckles! Regrettably this seems to be the only strong point of \u2018Blood Lad\u2019, for the comedy bits startto partake a repetitive nature which brings down the overall nature of the show since it\u2019s other aspects like Action and Romance are mediocre at best! Although the Comedy is solid throughout with many Easter eggs that are plastered all over the place. And I loved how Self-Referential this anime was, shrewdly incorporating it into its Comedy which resulted to a unique and funny experience!\\n\\n\r\nStaz (MC) is a very powerful vampire who also happens to be the Boss of his district in the Demon world. Time and time again, he battles powerful opponents but somehow wins despite his lackadaisical nature.  Due to his obsession with Otaku culture, his constant number of manga references and use of anime knowledge were the best part of his trait, often displayed in clever and unexpected ways. And his flashbacks provided enough details about him for you to care, though this arc could have been handled better. Staz life changes when he meets a Big breasted Japanese teenager (Fuyumi) and this is where the show starts. All he wants to do is suck her blood but something happens to her after which Staz can only promise to resurrect her somehow. Fuyumi was a disappointment because for all the unique and supernatural characters with their comical personality types in this show, she was the most plain and boring of all! I really can\u2019t say much about her except that she\u2019s the damsel in distress character, making her forgettable due to her dull and clueless nature. The Supporting characters are interesting on their own, from the manipulative Bell who comes with a dual personality of a Bitch and a girl who wants to fall in love to the Badass Wolf with his scary strength and regeneration powers. You have tons of other characters that are barely shown which hurts them since they don\u2019t get a lot of growth, yet somehow Braz shines by coming off all clever and scary while Liz makes an entrance with her depiction of affection for Braz and her overall cute yet mindless nature. In spite of introducing such exceptional characters, they fail to make a splash due to the short run time given to them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation happened to look very neat even when depicting dark places like the demon world but the overall colour scheme and contrast takes time getting used to cause for some reason it gave off a cartoon show vibe that\u2019s made for children! Still the change in the colour art style was well done for it totally worked during the comical scenes despite its cheap looking nature to me. The OP/ED were ok while the Voice Acting was nothing memorable but once again the Comedy and Action bit were elevated with the perfect use of abnormal sound effects throughout the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis Comedic Action packed vampire show turn these genres over its head by refusing to align itself to being a clich\u00e9 anime, rather focuses on keeping a light and fun atmosphere. Regardless of this attempt, it manages to start well but the sudden end to an incomplete story leaves a bad taste in your mouth! What\u2019s worst is that it needed just a few more episodes to wrap up its current story arc and they fail to do so in the hopes of greenlighting another season. Add in the completely boring romance attempt between Staz and Fuyumi which leaves you frustrated because you totally want Bell and Staz to hook up since they share more screen time and exhibit actual chemistry! In fact, I would go as far as putting Bell\u2019s mom with Staz rather than that bore fest of a teenager! \u2018Blood Lad\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously for you to enjoy since it\u2019s flawed in many places, from the straightforward plot to the animation and some characters. But it\u2019s still worth watching just for those parody moments alone. The short run of 10 episodes definitely plays into the anime\u2019s favour since it\u2019s able to maintain its charm for the most of it. All in all, despite all the fan service provided, I still wasn\u2019t impressed but I was entertained enough to recommend this to another viewer for a one-time watch only. Just don\u2019t expect anything deeper or meaningful and be prepared for an unfinished story which leaves many things unanswered.",

            "content": "Oh, damn, those vampires again, it seems they are everywhere, and why am I complaining when I am reviewing a vampire anime? First lets make it clear I picked up this only for the fact that it seems like it would be a comedy and for the Seinen tag. Turns out it is mostly a comedy anime but I don't understand why its Seinen? This is typical Shounen manga with damsel in distress formula with a supernatural comedy twist, but definitely not Seinen ( some uncalled for ecchi doesn't make Seinen,sorry), so stop advertising false information.\r\nStory\r\nThe story of Blood Lad follows our \"hero\" Staz whois a vampire in the makai (demon world) who doesn't drink human blood & is also an otaku, he is a leader of a small portion of demon world but mostly spends his time watching anime, reading manga and playing Japanese video games. One day our \"heroine\" Fuyumi accidentally wanders into the demon world and ends up in Staz's territory, Staz is so excited to finally meet a human girl but when he was a bit busy protecting his territory Fuyumi gets killed and turns into a ghost. And thus the story begins as our hero decides to revive Fuyumi into a human again. But wait there is a catch, Staz is not as heroic as it seems, actually he has a strong desire to drink Fuyumi's blood so he secretly wants to resurrect her for that. And thus our heroes trial begins as he tries to find ways to reach his goal. The story was a bit boring at the start but after a few episodes it starts to get a bit interesting, mostly due to some nice side characters most of whom actually are cliche Shounen characters but none the less likeable. The main likeable thing about the story is not its premise or the character backgrounds (which are too generic if you ask me) but the comedic side of it, the continuous pun at typical Shonen's like Staz trying to use Kamehameha was really funny stuff and it keeps the show enjoyable but when the writer tries to make things a bit serous with romance and family chemistry stuff then it starts to fall apart cause the main storyline for this anime is not original at all, we really have seen all those cliche stuff way many times before.\\n\r\nFrom me story gets 6.5 out of 10.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThe characters are not the strongest aspect of this anime, Staz is actually alright when he acts his funny self but his back story and all other aspects of his character are to bland for me but at least he is better than our heroine Miss-I-am-so-innocent-and-dumb-and-typical-with-unnaturally-big-breasts Fuyumi, come on we had these kinds of heroines for so long its just unbearable now.  And those unnecessary ecchi stuff, provocative dresses and shameless fan service is just too awful to waste my breath on.\\n\r\nBut not all is lost in the character department either because of some strong side characters, I mean Braz, Bell & Liz are almost impossible not to like and although a typical rival character I did like Wolf, and other side characters like Staz's gang members (Deku,Saty,Yoshida) were written with quite a lot of care it seems. So all I can say about the whole character business is that if Kodama would have given his main characters the same level of care as he did most of his side characters it would have been a way more better anime in my opinion.\\n\r\nThe characters get 7.5 out of 10 (and that's mostly for all the characters minus the main two). \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nUnarguably the animation is top notch and the best thing about this anime, the action sequences are colorful and a delight to watch, the character designs are lovely and the whole animation is fluid and crisp, it is one of the things to be amazed of in this show. But sadly that is not enough, you need good story and solid main characters to tell the story with your nice animation.\\n\r\nThe animation gets 8.5 out of 10.  \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound effect is appropriate for the show but nothing that really pulls your attention into it. The Opening theme is \"ViViD\" by May'n which is a nice opening for the show but doesn't really makes you want to get the listen to it as a separate form of entertainment. The ending theme is \"BLOODY HOLIC\" by Yuuka Nanri which is rather bland is my opinion and really doesn't go with the show, it tries somehow force the romance into the front of the situation which unfortunately I say is not the strongest aspect of the show, its the comedy that is, the opening song at least acknowledges that.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets a 6.5 out of 10 from me (its okay but really nothing to write home about).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of the day the writer did try to make a show which tries a different take on the vampire theme and the otaku twist is nice with the pun at other animes & manga bit is nice but unfortunately it seems that he himself sometimes forget what his initial intentions were and tries to inject serious stuff into the fold and force some unnecessary ecchi and romance into the mix which turns a otherwise quite innovative and fun idea into a cliched mental anguish for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE\\n\r\n                                     6.5 out of 10. \\n",

Then, eaten by a plant Fuyumi dies and the rest of the show is about trying to resurrect Fuyumi and Staz's actual feelings for her. The fast paced story goes great with the just as fast Character Development with in just about every episode a new character is introduced, not all ones you like, but none the less new. Ithas references to other anime and anime creators so it makes hilarious. This is a good anime if you want something to raise your spirits and make you think.",

            "content": "Alright yall Ima keep this short and simple for a short and simple anime. Blood lad, to put it simply, was funny. For one, it made a great job of making the whole mood feel light-hearted, even when people were \"dying\" and the mood was supposed to be set serious it had never felt that way to me.\r\n  For a while now I had tried to search for an anime taht even from the very start I could tell was going to be an anime that didn't have such intense and heavy moody characters.... COUGH all those characters who think smiling isa sin COUGH. Even then though, it was hard to find something both interesting and light hearted, I wanted something like hunter x hunter. Blood lad had successfully accomplished that for me.\\n\\n\r\n  So that's it for my short and simple review, this anime is comedic, light-hearted, has plenty of action, enjoyable, has a very nice story and plot, and it's only problem is that it wasn't longer. 10/10 would bang the end PEACE OUT.\\n\\n\r\nPS I gave this anime a 9/10 for the sheer reason that it did what it set the mood for. It didn't have a peaceful nonchalant mood but has everyone dying and crying for days. It struck for a light - hearted fun enjoyable short anime to watch. It's plot was quite good for an anime so.\\n\\n\r\nSo when you watch this don't expect the deepest plot ever, with twists and turns and amazing woahs after every episode, if you're tired of being serious watch this anime. If I had had a serious mood and been searching for that, this anime would have gotten a solid 6. But it didn't, it hit exactly what it wanted to hit, and that's why I felt that this anime was more than enjoyable. It set the mood, it carried out the mood, and it kept it at that pace for the entire time without missing a single beat. PEACE OUT NO I AM REALLY DONE 14/10 WOULD BANG PEACE OUT!",

            "content": "Before I start this review, I would first like to say that I did not enjoy this anime.  I decided to try out the English Dub, and though I didn't mind it the voice-acting, there were points where listening to some of the dialogue spoken frustrated me. I had started this anime a while back and stopped watching for a bit as it did not peak my interest, but figured I should just finish it off because it is a short season. Let's get into this.\r\nStory - 5\r\nThe story was meh to me. It didn't really interest me nor kept me engaged, especially withthe main plotline. But I felt the side stories, the relationships between some of the characters were interesting just a bit more, but that is really all. I do like the idea that it is set in the demon world, giving the viewer a bit of new atmosphere... despite it looking like a normal city. Some of the sub stories in the anime were a bit stupid, like the romance between Fuyumi and Stax or Bell liking Stax because of some reason. It just sort of happens, and really, I just found it more irritating them heart-warming. There is no sense of development for these romances, and it didn't feel realistic to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nSurprisingly, I liked the art. It was simple and clean. Nothing grand at all, but passable. There were some demons designed to look ugly as hell, but luckily those would only be minor characters. Our main Character's designs were also pretty cool too. There are some problems I had with the how Bell and Fuyumi are over-sexualized, usually revealing their breasts or asses. They are usually dressed \"appropriately\" for each situation, and it annoyed me. Though it was not my main focus, it was still a bother.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 3\\n\r\nNothing really stood out for me in anime music wise. I don't remember any of the music and the opening was meh. Probably one of the few weak points of the anime, actually. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are unique in their own ways, especially with their special abilities. I do love how Stax is a full-on perverted Otaku, and I found him an amusing character to watch. I also did enjoy Wolf, and wish I could have seen more of him in the story. There were some weak characters like Fuyumi. She is useless. Like hell, she is useless. Wolf, Stax and Bell always seem to be saving her ass and trying to keep her safe. She does nothing to benefit the characters, and is just sort of there for the plot and give these characters some purpose. Bell was also a weak character. Despite having such an unique ability, I just found her annoying, not at all cute. Whenever she was around, she just frustrated me. I wish she had become a cheeky girl, yes, but also not be tied down by her feelings for Stax. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this anime. Watching each episode felt like more of a chore, and I would find myself swearing at the characters due to their stupidity. Though, I did get some few laughs, I still found myself mostly frustrated. I would just think that this kind of anime is not what I enjoy to watch. Sure, I love watching something to laugh at, which I think this anime was aiming at, but this was just plain ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nComing to a close, I give this anime a four. I was close to give it a three, but it just didn't seem right. It wasn't that awful. Blood Lad could be enjoyed by others, but with me, I just don't enjoy it. Maybe someone who enjoys complete ridiculousness and don't mind the constant fanservice would like to give this a try. Upon this review, my final score is a 4 out of ten.",

            "content": "I just want to mention first that I have read the manga for Blood Lad (up to where it\u2019s translated) and that this was actually my first manga ever (so it\u2019s a bit special to me). However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s one of my favorites and really I think it\u2019s just average overall. I\u2019ll be making many comparisons between the manga and anime (without spoilers of course).\r\nStory \u2013 6/10\r\nI do really like the unique the initial plot. It follows Staz who is a vampire that is the leader of a section of the underworld. Staz also happens to be an otaku for all things fromthe human world, especially things from Japan, from anime to figures to Final Fantasy. And yes, they make a lot of references to different things (Dragonball might have the most). One day, Staz hears from his henchmen that a human girl suddenly appeared in the streets. Being who he is, Staz can\u2019t resist meeting her. However, due to an unfortunate series of events involving giant plants, the girl (whose name is Fuyumi) ends up dying only to turn into a ghost. Staz (for reasons that are somewhat selfish) vows to help Fuyumi get her human body back. They travel everywhere in search of clues and even go back to the human world for a short time. They slowly piece things together about how to return Fuyumi to her human form but what they uncover is a much bigger story that pulls them in even though Staz really wishes he could just get this all over with at times.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it was announced that Blood Lad would only have 10 episodes, I was kind of skeptical how they would fit everything in, and, whether or not they would go past where the manga is translated into English as there are about 15 chapters that are not translated (about 1/3rd of the manga at this time). While not too many problems came from having a shorter series, the anime was very fast paced. Blood Lad is a series that tends to jump around a lot and lose focus of the overall plot amidst a sea of side plots. With the fast pacing, there were times during some episodes where the plot switched between places so fast that it became hard to follow. Most of the episodes also end at awkward points in the story and kind of cut up the story in ways that I think mess up the story (at least if you are watching one episode a week like I did).\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was done by studio \u201cBrains Base\u201d who is known for works like Baccano, Durarara!!, Amnesia, Natsume Yuujinchou, etc. While they\u2019re previous works (as far as I\u2019ve seen) usually have very impressive art, I felt they went a little overboard with Blood Lad. The animation looks great and the fight scenes are well animated, but the anime was just way too colorful in my opinion. The Blood Lad manga had a much darker edge (despite being a comedy manga), and the wide array of colors in almost in almost every moment of the anime kind of dampens that effect at times. But there are some places, like Staz\u2019s otaku room, which do benefit from the colorful animation, but they are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nA problem with the art that the manga also suffers from is in its character designs. While I really like some of the characters\u2019 designs (like Staz, Braz, and Akimu), there were many that I thought were just strange. Fuyumi and Bell especially look awkward and Wolf\u2019s face in his werewolf form just looks kind of strange and unnatural the way it\u2019s elongated. The characters are also very vividly colorful especially when it comes to hair color, which goes back to the last part. Still, Staz and several other characters do have very good designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also very average. I really only noticed one track that stood out to me while the rest was mostly average, but I also never noticed any really disliked. The one good track sounds kind of mysterious and is used in the few darker scenes or just before the comedic scenes (the latter of which kind of ruins its effect).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job of portraying their roles with Staz\u2019s being the standout performance. His voice actor, Ohsaka Ryota, does an amazing job portraying the otaku vampire and all of his craziness. With Fuyumi (who\u2019s just kind of bland to start with) her voice actress did fit the role well, but was still boring. I also found Wolf\u2019s voice in his werewolf form to be very annoying and kind of cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime drops in my opinion. While Staz is great and sometimes unpredictable, some of the other characters (especially Fuyumi) are very one dimensional and boring. It was the same way in the manga, too. Fuyumi is just one of the most boring female protagonists I\u2019ve ever seen. She\u2019s your typical damsel in distress who gets thrown around by everyone (with occasional fanservice) and doesn\u2019t ever do anything herself. Since the entire plot and most of the side plots are centered on her, it really ruins the story at times because of her being unable to do anything while everyone else fights to help her regain her humanity.\\n\\n\r\nNow for some of the better characters. Hydra Bell is a demon who uses magic that opens portals to wherever she wants to go and can even view things in other places just by making a rectangular shape out of her fingers. She enjoys messing with Staz and testing his powers to see how strong he really is. Wolf is a territory boss just like Staz. He and Staz have known each other since they were kids and have an interesting relationship as rivals. Braz is Staz\u2019s older brother who Staz hates. He often experiments on Staz and is kind of one of the antagonists of the series. Liz is Staz\u2019s younger sister and the jail keeper of what appears to be the largest prison in the underworld. She hates Staz because he gets most of Braz\u2019s attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the background characters are either forgettable or were just introduced around the end of the anime and barely get any screen time. It\u2019s a pretty large cast of characters for an anime with only 10 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the series was rushed too much and would have done much better with 12 or 13 episodes. The manga was already fast paced and the anime only sped that up as it sometimes put about 3 chapters into a single episode. The art is just too colorful in my opinion, and the soundtrack really doesn\u2019t stand out at all. While Staz is a good protagonist, Fuyumi is just a horrible heroine. The rest of the cast is both good and bad as well. It\u2019s definitely not the best show this season, though it\u2019s not really the worst either. If you\u2019re looking for vampire anime (despite being extremely different) I would recommend Shiki instead. If you\u2019re looking for comedy and action then try Blue Exorcist which has a very similar feeling and similar protagonists.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nUsually in anime monsters, demons, vampires etc are considered the villains of the show and end up being defeated by the hero, however Blood Lad decides to concentrate on the whole monster aspect and their world making for one somewhat interesting setup.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story focuses on Staz, a vampire who rules a section of the demon world. One day a random human girl called Fuyumi finds herself in the demon world and whilst under Staz's protection she gets eaten and becomes a ghost. Staz vows to bring her back to life.\r\nNow as simple as the premise is, a lot more stuff goes onin this show than you think especially considering it's only 10 episodes, so a lot of content was squished into this.\\n\r\nIt starts out fairly normal as Staz tries his best finding ways of bringing Fuyumi back to life while also getting caught up in ridiculous situations.\\n\r\nBut as the show goes on it starts to get more plot heavy as more characters are introduced and we get to know more about Staz's history and other family members, I thought this was an interesting addition to the story and kept me hooked, then as we enter the final episodes the story focused more on Fuyumi and her family issues which seemed like it had cropped up out of nowhere, but if have good attention to detail then you probably knew there was something odd about Fuyumi in the first place.\\n\r\nAnother story line develops along the way too, which is the state of power in the demon world and this was mainly to do with Staz's brother Braz. This tied in once again with their family history and showed how open and expansive this world was.\\n\r\nThe whole however really has it's up and down moments, the 10 episode length doesn't help with this as I feel like the plot advanced very quickly and never settled in one spot for too long, now this wasn't entirely a bad thing as it kinda suited an anime like this. The problem is that one moment you're concentrating on this thing, then something else gets thrown at you and then something else comes outta nowhere, it got a little tiresome trying to keep track of the amount of things going on and it hurt the story in some way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite having quite a large cast of characters, most of them were particularly interesting whereas some were interesting, but got a little worse over time.\\n\r\nStaz is the MC and a vampire, now even though he's a vampire he tends to have a lazy kind of attitude making people underestimate him, but that is always a bad thing as he is incredibly powerful. He is also very stubborn, doesn't really have much sense of things and is very impetuous, but despite these shortcomings whenever he sets a goal for himself he always makes sure it is done, plus unlike most monsters you see he has an extreme interest in the human world and the products they have.\\n\r\nFuyumi is the female MC, she randomly ends up in the demon world and becomes a ghost after being eaten by a plant. Now you may think she is there for just bland fanservice and in some cases you might be right, but she had a mysterious nature and always had some kind of importance even though she was the butt end of Staz's jokes and actions yet out of all the characters in the show she seemed like the most reasonable and always pointed out how stupid some situations were. Plus she's cute as hell, you can't ignore a cute girl like her.\\n\r\nBell is a sorceress, who tends to get in Staz's way of his goal. At first I really liked her personality as it reminded me of Haruko from FLCL, but despite her funny, playful yet short tempered attitude she slowly became a somewhat forced love interest for Staz and this just didn't fit right for her character, which in the end hurt her reputation a little.\\n\r\nWolf is like Staz, a demon boss, but he is a werewolf. Wolf is a badass and definitely goes great with Staz's character since the two are friendly rivals, he is strong willed and ambitious making him a force to be reckoned with which is why you wouldn't want to fight the fella. He also has a short temper, though much worse than Bells and tends to take his frustration out on his goons, but he means well and does have a caring nature especially towards Staz and his friends. Sadly his presence in the show is kinda cut short as he leaves the group shortly before the final episodes, which sucked since he was a great character alongside Staz.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI will give credit where credit is due, because this was a surprisingly colourful show, each scene looked like a goddamn rainbow, well unless the setting was dark and evil then that's a different story, but it always captured the scenes very nicely. I also liked the punk aspect of Staz's area and the lettering too making it seem like he was a proper gang boss. The other areas were alright too and made the demon world look big and expansive showing it could be as large or even bigger than our own world.\\n\r\nEven the characters had a very colourful essence, the amount of outfits and costumes they wore was a lot and surprisingly they fitted the characters well, I especially liked the black jacket getup that Staz had at some point making him look pretty badass, plus it was also funny how the show kinda knew when it was putting Fuyumi in revealing clothing like it was a joke towards other anime's that had busty looking female characters wearing revealing outfits.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't too bad either, I enjoyed the op which was nicely tuned to the way the show was, which was all over the damn place. Although I feel like the opening kinda spoiled the events that were going to happen and this is something I slowly noticed over time and I suddenly knew where the next locations were going to be. However the op was still fun to listen to.\\n\r\nThe ed was actually ok, it had the mysterious element that represented a part of Fuyumi's character, but just like the opening it kinda spoiled a story line that would connect her and Bell's characters although not in the way I was expecting.\\n\r\nIt's soundtrack was pretty surprising, it had great intense pieces for when the action scenes happened and gave them a feeling like there was a lot at stake if the hero's didn't win.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe action was pretty damn sweet, they were quick, thrilling and pretty suspenseful considering what was on the line. The best was definitely the boxing match between Staz and Wolf which just seemed funnily out of place compared to every other battle. However there were some battles that relied more on wit than brawn like when Bell was trying to trap Staz in one of her dimension cages and he ended up outwitting her in a pretty hilarious way.\\n\r\nNow when it comes to comedy, this show was a bit of a mixed bag. It didn't start off too well with the comedy and the only funny moments were mainly between Staz and Fuyumi along with the instances that involved Bell, but slowly over time the comedy did get better and better as the characters got into more ridiculous situations.\\n\r\nI liked how the supernatural was the entire focus point of the show, usually if would be something supernatural set in the human world, but for once it's actually set in the world of the supernatural which isn't something where many anime's (from what I've seen) are set. So it was nice to see a different kind of setting compared to other anime's I've seen in the past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a pretty short and sweet show, colourful and mostly fun characters and a heavily focused supernatural setting makes this a pretty memorable show that hopefully one day will get the second season it deserves.",

The biggest point downer in my opinion is the randomness of it all. Okay, a human pops out of nowhere, something convenient appears at some weirdly convenient time, and somebody just happens to be related to someone else. People might like that kind of thing, but for me, it just shortens the attention span. At least it was funny...\r\n- I can't stand cliffhangers. Blood Lad has got to have the best cliffhangers of the century. I was so annoyed andclose to flipping my desk whenever an episode ended, but the cliffhangers were so cleverly placed and scripted that I HAD to keep watching. That's the best, and the worst, part of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n- What can I say? Art is subjective.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\n- The music appeals greatly to my taste. -1 point for the OP that I didn't really like. Subjectivity again... I'm still learning how to listen objectively, bear with me >",

            "content": "I love vampires. And I loved the Blood Lad manga...from the point I read up to. I await for the next volume to be out in the US. \r\nThe moment I heard of the anime, I put it on my instant \"plan to watch list\" in my head. (As this was before I joined MAL). (Side note): Okay. So, when I heard it was going to be 10 episodes, I kind of freaked out a bit and since Wikipedia was being edited constantly between 10 and 12 episodes, I didn't know what to believe. \r\nAnyway, for this review, I'll start to say:\r\nWhen I watched thefirst few episodes, I loved how closely it followed the manga. I loved how it was almost exactly like the manga, except for maybe a few event rearrangements, but I didn't really care about that. After around episode seven though, I was wondering... \"how are they going to wrap up this anime\"? \\n\\n\r\nThen it dawned upon me: \"It's going to end with Staz and Fuyumi are going to go through the doorway, and the vampire hunt will begin\". I got the door part right. I got the vampire part wrong. So, I was right about how it would end to a 50% tangent. I was disappointed it ended the way it ended, so -2 on enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, it covers the first six volumes of the manga, that's it. So, 8/10 on story, 8/10 on enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine. There's nothing wrong with the art, and I really enjoy how it looks in the anime. In fact, it's better in the anime because I get to see what the mangaka's art looks like...animated! It's great--like any other manga that became an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nI have Asperger's. So the loud noises really bothered me when I was watching Blood Lad. I had to pause for a few minutes because the sound effects really got to me, and I tried hard to ignore the sound effects, I couldn't--they were too loud for me. The music was okay, though, I did enjoy the music to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not a lot of character development. That's not bad or anything, but Staz develops nicely, imo. Fuyumi, Bell, Wolf and Staz, don't though, that didn't bug me, but I wanted to see Fuyumi develop a tiny bit. Liz was a great character, btw. I loved all the characters. Especially Staz, Fuyumi, Bell and Beros...despite her not being in it a lot. All of tears.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was great, BUT THEN IT WAS OVER. And I was upset by that. The anime had so much potential, but then it ended the exact way I knew it would, I didn't want it to be that way. But it was a really good and fun summer anime, probably the best Black Comedy I ever watched. I want, no, I need a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you like ten episode anime and black comedy.  \\n",

I was tempted to rate it down just for ticking me off.  \r\nI enjoyed Blood Lad.  I began it with skepticism because all things vampiric have been letting me down recently.  The concept of a pwoerful vampire infatuated with humans and the human world to the point of being an otaku is intriguing and amusing.  I like the quick pace of the writing.  The animation style is artsy.It's purposefully flat and '70s comic looking to give the watcher the sense that indeed this is not the human world. \\n\\n\r\nStaz, our otaku vampire prince, is an anti-hero.  He is not a good guy.  In fact he tells you he's not.  He's a demon afterall.  Most of the demons he runs across are in human form, but there are some in other forms.  I was never sure if our leading lady was dense or just overwhelmed. She was likeable, but I didn't love her. \\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad is good, but it is too short and the story doesn't end.  I hope there is a 2nd season.",

No other reason. Yes it does look good and yes its funny, but maybe dragonball references aren't funny to you.\r\nThe characters aren't unique at all, its the same stereotypes you see in literally any anime. The story is the interesting part IMO. It ties magic and technology with vampires, werewolves with a ton of fighting. Not bad at all.\r\nThere is subtle romance and ecchi but other than huge oppai (which are a staple of ANY anime these daysto get more sales) on the main girl character along with her clueless klutz like attitude. So instead of just the MC, now you have two idiots as main characters. I wish more anime were like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a light hearted anime. It has very cool and some serious moments, but its slap-happy type of fun. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend it! Especially if you like dragonball. Lol",

            "content": "Vampires are overrated these days. The idea of them being in anime series isn't a new concept either. In fact, there's plenty of them already like Vampire Knight, Shiki, Rosario + Vampire, etc. Most of them involves some sort of strange faithful day event when the vampire gets caught up with a human in their world and then certain twists come that ties them to some sort of relationship. Only this time, it's a little a bit different. In Blood Lad, the vampire actually wants to help the human. Rather than treating them as a slave or food, this series takes a twist as ourvampiric friend Vlad Charlie Staz embarks on a journey to restore a human back to their mortal selves after a tragic event. (by tragic, I mean as in getting eaten alive)\\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad is an anime adapted series based off the manga of the same name written by Yuuki Kodama. The series takes the vampire theme idea and twists it into a humorous tale. That's because our otaku friend Staz has never met a human girl before. So, what happens when a young, pretty, and shy Japanese girl accidentally wonders into his territory? All hell breaks loose. Or rather for Staz, it's like the dream of a life time. After all, he's never met a human before. More so, Fuyumi Yanagi happens to be a girl with a Japanese background. It's a fun journey and one hell of a ride, for both our main characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, we know that Staz is a vampire but also a boss of sorts at his own territory. He has his own underlings for dirty work. Judging by his appearance, Staz also seems to be unemployed and is literally an otaku with the stuff he has hanging around his room. More interesting factors about his character reveals that despite being a vampire, he doesn't seem to have an appetite for human blood. Oddly enough though, he does have a bit of bloodlust towards Fuyumi. This spells out a sort of trouble for Fuyumi because Staz's lack of common sense. In fact, we can see that Staz only seems to lust after Fuyumi in the beginning because of her fresh scent of blood and body. Strangely though, his lust disappears after Fuyumi's death. But the fact that he still cares enough to help Fuyumi return to her normal life shows his sincerity. It almost seems to be human like for Staz because the lengths he goes to help Fyumi throughout the series despite numerous dangers that puts his own life at risk. Fuyumi on the other hand plays the role more of the eye-candy but also at times encourages Staz to be himself. It's an odd relationship between the duo but they sure stand out as entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters plays their part to fulfill the entertainment part as well. We got mad scientists, a witch, and werewolf that adds to the package of this series. Their diversity and abilities adds more flavor to the series that is not only tasty but also spices up some troubles for both Staz and Fuyumi. For instance, there's a rivalry between Staz and Wolf beyond just going at each other with fists. Then, there's also some sibling trouble for Staz later on that adds even more dangers to himself. It's a fun take to this series because Staz has to learn how to adjust without depending on others. It's the fact that Fuyumi depends on him this time as Staz learns more about humanity as well as himself. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the series having a relevant plot, it usually maintains more of a lighthearted and humorous atmosphere. This is evidenced by the various parodies in the beginning such as the stuff  in Staz's room or the way that Fuyumi is killed. Even though she is dead, Fuyumi returns as a cute ghost and her method of death can also be surprisingly amusing. The show also plays on Staz's character by portraying him as a character with little knowledge of what's really there. For example, there are numerous times when Staz uses ideas he gets from Japanese manga which he reads from rather than common sense. On a more serious note, there's some revelations revealed later on that might surprise some viewers.\\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad also presents the supernatural relevantly well. Although not as grim as some series such as Shiki, this anime portrays Staz as a vampire with supernatural abilities. This is evidenced in the beginning as he is able to do various things that a normal human cannot. Then, there's the other characters too who displays their own sides of supernatural traits such as Wolf and his expertise in the boxing field or Hydrabell with her magic. Needless to say, the series' characters and setting combines elements of both the real world and the supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nFan service is also an overused word but Blood Lad doesn't avoid it. In fact, there's plenty of those for both girls and the guys. Fuyumi fulfills the role of fanservice with her body structure as well as being stark naked from the very first episode after her fate. In fact, the way she looks must also been a trigger for Staz's bloodlust for her. It doesn't stop there either though as she has to depend on Staz in order to remain existent. To do, there's the finger sucking along with the baby bottles. Furthermore, she is often dressed in skimpy ways or in lascivious outfits. Even for the female audience, there's some service to offer when Staz and Wolf gets into a fight in their outfits. It's service for the fans and at times, they do get out of hand.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the series defies any realism, expect some strange twists as well. It also doesn't fit within some vampire themes since Staz is shown to be stronger than the typical vampire with his resistance to certain weaknesses. Fuyumi also seems to play along with her new adjusted life even though she wants to return to her human life. The fact that the duo has gotten used to each other shows how much they value their relationship even if it's completely on bizarreness. It's what Blood Lad is anyways, a bizarre yet entertaining anime with more than just a love triangle or thirst for vengeance.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals wise, Brain Base does an alright job with its elements although some of the characters' designs looks rather generic. Fuyumi in particular is designed to look busty with girlish traits while Staz is more of the bad boy role. The characters all have some taste of their supernatural traits though whether it's a werewolf, vampire, etc. The supernatural world doesn't look as grim or too unusual compare to our own. On the other side, some of the monsters are portrayed as looking dangerous. The production values are decent though with style. Staz's sunglasses, Liz's headgear, and Wolf's silver hair are reflection of this in a humorous way.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Blood Lad is above par. The OP song \"ViViD\" by May'n has a rocky style with its presentation. Then, there's the action and comedy scenes where music matches its style. True to its premise, Blood Lad also has its occasionally eerie-like soundtrack playing during some of the more scenes fitting within this vampiric theme series. Staz's VA Ryota Osaka (Valvrave the Liberator: Haruto, Rozen Maiden: Jun, Hataraku Maou-sama: Sadao) recently began to play parts relating to young teenagers whose life is changed dramatically. Thus expect his talent to come in this series as well in the shoes of our vampire. On the other hand, Fuyumi's shy voice reflects her character in the new situation she is in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Blood Lad is a very fun series to watch and enjoy. To me, it shouldn't be taken serious despite its premise. In fact, there are many moments in this series where the fights and moments are portrayed as parody rather than anything too serious. However, Staz is serious about his mission to help Fuyumi return to being mortal once again. If I was entirely serious though, most of the series should be absorbed as fun and a different take on the vampire genre. It's not just about falling in love or achieving vengeance. Rather, Blood Lad plays on the values of a relationship between a human and a vampire to see how far they come. It's a journey that will quench your thirst if you're looking for some fun.",

            "content": "Ok, time to make my review of this 10 episode anime thing....then again, I think I should just quit beating around the bush and state by ratings for each of this anime's category.\r\nStory: mediocre 5.\r\nOk, so vampires plots are overrated, and this anime follow the same path as that of the main character which has some similarities from \"Hataraku Maou-sama\" which is about a underworld big boss who doesn't wanna be a big boss anymore and desires a simple life in another place, in fact the plot is almost the same as the mentioned anime. Only the execution is different and it is almost (and I do mean \"ALMOST\") like a remake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I'm gonna give the credit to Fuyumi and Hydra bell, co'z I like the way how they're illustrated.\\n\\n\r\nSound: fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ, Oh sorry I doze off, ok on this part I'm gonna refer to the main character's diction, intonation, enunciation, and tone as some what, ZZZZZZZZZ, eh! Ok so their voice seemly has that lack of sleep thing in it that one would make you want to doze off or it has the sleepy effect as if the character's themselves and I'm referring to Staz and Braz's who have been deprived of sleep for a very long time. However, I give this anime's category a 6 co'z I like the way Fuyumi's VA who delivers a sweet tone on to her character. As for the op and ed....I hate them both.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Enjoyment and Overall: poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- It's all on Staz, everything about the character is too cliche especially when everything was place on him, other character's here are just antagonist waiting to be tamed by him, Fuyumi on the other hand is more of  a sexy mascot than a damsel in distress as for Hydra Bell... I kind hate her dichotomy character which she's this liberated  evil bitch in one hand which you wouldn't wanna bring home to mom and on the other hand she want's to be loved.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- The enjoyment part of this anime is pretty stupid, in fact I can compared it to opening a safe where one wasted a lot of time and effort only to find out that the combination is just 12345. Just like this anime Staz when into a lot of effort to make Fuyumi a human again only to be flustered us audience that Fuyumi simply has to go back to her world to be human again, then again it also conflicts earlier episodes were Fuyumi and Staz did went into the human world and Fuyumi is still a ghost. It would have had a smart ending if Staz forces that Frankenstein doctor in his world to clone Fuyumi's body and have her soul posses it just like what Braz did to his father in the final part of the last episode.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Brain Base, didn't do a good job of presenting this anime, then again, it was a good thing that they limit it to just 10 episodes.  Overall, this series should be better off as a manga than an anime. Season 2? I wouldn't suggest it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Blood Lad is a classic example of taking a typical genre type and applying a currently popular twist on it; in this case you end up with yet another supernatural comedy Most titles that fall under this category are barely passable, but Blood Lad seemed to stand out from the rest of the crowd so I gave it a chance. I mean a vampire boss that is more interested in the otaku culture of Japan over fresh human blood\u2026 that doesn\u2019t sound too unoriginal and downright unbearable, right? Well I\u2019m going to tell you why I was neither right nor wrong in Blood Lad\u2019s case.\\n\r\nThe story follows Staz, a vampire boss of the demon world. He is feared across the demon world for being one of the most powerful bosses around and is also known for always accomplishing any goal he sets out for. So when Fuyumi, a young and big-breasted Japanese girl, accidentally makes it into the demon world and is killed, Staz decides he\u2019ll help bring her back to life. Already two typical character types have been established: an overpowered hero and a big-breasted, clumsy heroine. So, if it sounds to you like a pretty typical hero saves damsel-in-distress story then you\u2019re absolutely right\u2014because that\u2019s what it is. But that is not all it is. Let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this series was the comedy. It wasn\u2019t forced, it wasn\u2019t complicated, the references to Japanese culture were easy to understand for any anime fan, it was not overused and it was just downright hilarious. But the credibility of the series cannot be justified by just one aspect of the plot even if the show is prominently defined by this aspect\u2014and that is where Blood Lad quickly let itself down. At first, the comedy held up the dialogue in a good way but it soon became hard to overlook the lacking parts of the rest of the dialogue. The comedy became repetitive and started to let down the dialogue and eventually the plot also. Where Blood Lad\u2019s story went wrong is when they failed at mixing bad drama and action with good comedy\u2014and then tried to patch up their faults with more good comedy. After this much repetition, the good comedy became bad comedy and the plot became even less comprehensible because of the overuse of unneeded gags.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the story, Blood Lad\u2019s art started out great but was relatively let down by a certain aspect. Prominently the most annoying part of Blood Lad\u2019s art was the obscure and abstract changing of colours, backgrounds and art within certain scenes at an attempt to pair with the comedic side of the plot. At first it worked well but this soon enough, just like the use of comedy, became forced and overused. Apart from this annoyance, Blood Lad\u2019s art was actually one of the series\u2019 strong points. The animation was always fluid, the art was consistent, the character designs and the design of the Japan influenced \u2018demon world\u2019 worked very well together and over all the animation, when not overused, matched the mood of the series and the genre by having simple and somewhat goofy character designs like typical comedy series do but also mixing it with typical shounen character designs, this caused a nice blend of the comedy and action. Apart from the certain abstract scenes mentioned before, the art was far from an eyesore and actually helped maintain the series when it began to fail.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack goes with the series in a pleasurable but non-memorable way. The opening song did a great job of giving me a positive view when I started the anime and when I started the new episode every week. Even when I knew the anime that was starting after the minute and a half song was far from perfect. The soundtrack worked well in matching the moods of different scenes and didn\u2019t separate the viewer from the voice acting but instead accompanied the seiyuu\u2019s dialogue well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Blood Lad all play a relatively necessary role in the show but the way some of these roles were developed is probably the weakest point of the series. In some cases there is no development at all, they are simply placed in the series for the short time they are needed then used later on for gags. But, with it being a 10 episode series and of the comedy genre, which doesn\u2019t typically have or need much character development,  I do take into account that it would be very hard to develop all the characters they introduced. So I\u2019ll only be judging the development of the main characters. Staz, obviously, has the most development as a character throughout the series and for a comedy series this should have been absolutely fine, here\u2019s the problem though-- it didn\u2019t feel like enough. The flashbacks and dialogue he\u2019s involved in don\u2019t provide enough substance to give me a reason to care about him. Little character development in a comedy series is acceptable but if it is not handled well, which in this case it wasn\u2019t, it makes you care about the character less. If you don\u2019t care about the main character then it is hard to care about anything he or she is involved in, which in a main character\u2019s case is usually everything to do with the series. The biggest let down of the series was the underdevelopment of Staz, if you can\u2019t get your viewer to care about the main character then the anime falls apart.\\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad was a show that let itself down more than it let the viewers down, because it could have been much more than it ended up as.\\n\\n\r\nBut after all this negativity in this piece of writing I can honestly say that I still really enjoyed Blood Lad. No it didn\u2019t impress me as much as I was expecting, yes it had a lot of flaws, but the overall charm of the series kept me watching. If you\u2019re a fan of this anime I can understand why and I can also say I am a fan. If I can\u2019t point out the flaws in a series then how can I properly call myself a fan? Blood Lad was a fun experience and I still hold to my previous comment that it was neither unbearable and unoriginal nor bearable and original, because honestly from a critical standpoint Blood Lad didn\u2019t impress me or frustrate me\u2014it just gave me enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nAfter reading this review I hope you have a good idea on all the flaws of Blood Lad. But if you were interested in this series like I was I encourage you to look past the flaws and have fun with this anime, it might not be the most empowering, impressive, revolutionary anime in existence but it is great for some enjoyable watching and sometimes that\u2019s all that matters. If you can look past that fact then who knows you might really enjoy this anime. Give it a shot.\\n",

            "content": "\"Every vampire fiction reinvents vampires to its own needs. You take what you want.\"\r\nWhen and why did vampires become so popular in the past few years? The only conclusion that I could really come to was the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer. It's the series that sucked the blood (and money for that matter) out of adolescent girls everywhere. Why? Somewhere along the line I think our society forgot what vampires are supposed to be. The premise of \u2018Vampires\u2019 were originally made to be terrifying beings that were both intimidating and powerful.  If you don't know what I'm talking about regarding what a vampireideally should be, I would promptly direct you to Hellsing Ultimate where you may bask in the bloody goodness that is Alucard.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Blood Lad is pretty unoriginal. Vampire meets a human girl, the human girl gets into trouble, and the vampire becomes the hero to save her. Pretty clich\u00e9. The plot of Blood Lad, however, is pretty good. The demon world is interesting in itself based on the premise of the 'bosses' that control territories, the hierarchy of demons, and the Demon Acropolis (where top tier demons reside). Material is presented at a good pace that keeps the audience interested rather than confused; at a ten episode run, that's quite a feat. One last thing that I want to mention is that Blood Lad is lined with constant references to other anime and anime characters. If you're like me and enjoy knowing what is being referenced, you'll think or say something to the equivalent of, \"Fuck yeah! I got that reference. Sweet!\" as you give yourself a high five. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation of Blood Lad is good. It's an anime of 2013 and thus there it's essentially a basic standard to have good animation and art. The action scenes look nice, the characters look good, and everything flows well overall. Nothing to complain about here, but also nothing to brag about. The sound portion is decent enough. The OP and ED are both pretty good; I enjoyed them both, but they aren't something that warrants watching and listening to every episode. There are a wide array of voices for the characters and I liked how fitting they were for their respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the characters of Blood Lad interact. Each of them is interesting in their own sense of the word. Staz, the main protagonist, is a vampire of prestigious class/breed and 'boss' of a territory in the demon world. He\u2019s also and an otaku that aims to quench his thirst for something that isn\u2019t blood; he's infatuated with all things from the human world, but mainly things from Japan. He collects anime, manga, video games, Japanese attire, and becomes entranced by anything new from the human world. This is also part of the reason he is attracted to Fuyumi, the female lead. Fuyumi is a human girl from Japan who ends up wandering into the demon world accidently and subsequently turned into a ghost after dying. She entrusts her future to Staz in hopes that he can return her back to being human. She's really shy, quiet, and humble for the most part. Bell, a spatial magic sorceress, acts like a second female lead. She's provides quite a few comedic moments and often teases Staz. She's clever and deceptive, but also is also quite the softie. While those three are the really prevalent characters, many other characters take up their fair share of screen time such as Wolf, Braz, and Liz. I don't think there was a character I legitimately didn't like in the whole series, however there also wasn't much meaningful development for the series\u2019 characters either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Blood Lad is entertaining to say the least. I enjoyed what it had to offer for a story about vampires and the supernatural. Fan service is really prevalent in this series and did become slightly a nuisance for me; it seems they took every opportunity to showcase cleavage and added it in. The series runs for only ten episodes, which is a shame because it leaves a lot of questions unanswered and feels rather incomplete. If you're looking for a fun, simple show to watch, Blood Lad might be what you're looking for; just don't expect any deep themes or depth that makes a series great.\\n",

            "content": "I couldn't stand this show. It was so boring, cliched, generic, uninteresting, annoying, unfunny, and just stupid. I didn't want to know what any of the episodes contained after what is established to be after the 2nd episode. I couldn't careless.\r\nThese characters were the worst thing about this show, I couldn't stand to think why they are even in the show, it all felt like excuses for entertainment. All of them were easy to look in the eye and know what they are, and that's great, I love a show that can establish something, but when you are obnoxious about it, then you are boundto make it tiresome and annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe show carefully explains what this whole story is about, saving a human's life. Now it sounds serious, but they executed it like it was child's play. Wow, I am so interested how they are going to save a human's life. They went through boxing, they fought a boring ass side villain, the main character has family problems, and, and... wait, why do they all sound so simple, but not even a single bit of original idea's in it? DING DING DING, you hear that folks? They made a show not only to slowly advance what the main story is about, but to shove in every cookie cutter activities just to make a show cool. WOW, THIS SHOW IS A NEW HIT. A BIRTH TO A NEW GENERATION OF STEALING IDEAS FOR TEENAGE ENTERTAINMENT. I GUESS WE GOTTA HAVE A NEW TITANIC WHERE THEY HAVE TO PLAY GOLF TO WIN THE GIRL OF THEIR DREAMS! DOESN'T\"T THAT SOUND EXCITING??\\n\\n\r\nEven the whole story is dreadful, I can explain one sub-plot without making it sound entertaining, but that's how the actual show is. Here is one sub-plot I have summarized while watching this show, and yes, it is spoilers. Here we GO!\\n\\n\r\nThe main character and the human ran to see the main characters buddy. They found him coincidentally and asked how to resurrect a human. He wants to know why the main character cares, and the main character just does. His friend asks for a competition and he agrees. If the main character wins, he gets to know how to resurrect, however, if he loses, he needs to give away the human. He was unaware what the competition, generally we all thought they were just going to fight it out using their powers, well they are fighting, but by boxing. The human is wearing a costume for fan service. The main character and his friend were fighting, and the main character drained his strength by using his fangs. His friend transformed into a werewolf, but it was pointless. The main character was about to conclude the fight, but the girl starts crying and said to stop fighting. The other girl, who was unbriefly introduced in the 2nd episode, stopped the fight by teleporting the characters to a different area. The werewolf gives in and explains about the resurrection.\\n\\n\r\nYou starting to see how boring and plain this was? Well if you watch the anime, you aren't going to be thrilled about watching the actual event, because it is, so, damn, BORING AND ANNOYING. \\n\\n\r\nI can't understand how this can happen. I don't understand why people think it is funny and original, I don't know why people think this is a masterpiece, and I don't know PEOPLE ENJOY IT. It's the fact there are vampires that are way overrated in this show, how there is a werewolf, there are monsters in the show, the main character is all powerful and is chill about it, a girl looks attractive that they dress her up and make her do things that no standard girl would ever do in their entire lives because she is played like a plain girl, so WHY MAKE HER LIKE THIS AT ALL, and... you know what, this is why it is enjoyable because IT IS SO GENERICALLY BULLSHIT. \\n\\n\r\nWell there are more shows out there that are like this, and people seem to enjoy them and don't care, so I guess trying to prove why it's bad is pointless.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 3/10, twilight but with boobs.\\n",

            "content": "Blood Lad is a supernatural anime, revolving around a mystical realm involving the main character, Staz, a vampire boss in charge of a territory who is surprisingly also an otaku and a huge fan of everything Japan-related. It is weird yet unique.\r\nThe story starts of when a human girl (the main female character, sadly I forgot her name) appears from nowhere in town and thus Staz's people find her, knowing Staz will be fascinated by the human girl. Then he realizes that she is fading from the world of living and he decided to help her initially for his own goals. He gets help fromhis friends and yea.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the story of this anime is really inconsistent, it is like sht happens, then it becomes good again in a matter of time, fluctuating the repetitive pattern. Some episodes are really interesting with it's action scenes and humour and it is so hilarious most of the time while it also contains many references to real anime in our world, however, some episodes are just SO boring I actually fell asleep for half an episode and could not wake up until my room was drooling from liquid......inconsistency is majorly a lack down for this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art quality was decent to say the least. The character designs were well made and they were recognizable, sadly though, it isn't amazing either. The background colours were quite random, they were all over the place and although it is a demon world, every single street in this world shouldn't look like its graffiti done by a 5 year old brat.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was fine, the opening was catchy and a bit addicting, but then the ending song was quite wrong, it doesn't fit well with mood of the ending of any episode, doesn't collaborate well or match nicely to present a neat and long lasting effect to the audience, every time the ending song played, i felt like i was in a funeral with a group of friends singing a sad song. Also, noneo f the soundtracks were memorable, but o well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all-rounded, there were the girls who only tried to get laid with Staz, and then the male characters who were nicely brought in. Wolf, the masochist was basically a power-house, he could tank an entire army including Staz and he was strong as well, being that said, one of my favorite scenes was him fighting Staz in a boxing match. He also showed feelings towards liking Fuyumi the main girl (oh i remembered), helping her out. Staz was quite likable, a badass overpowered damning kamikaze here and there fanboy who gets all the chicks day and night. However, none of the characters were well developed, reducing the potential of these characters. Building a development, story or background of a characters especially the main characters will definitely provide and deliver more feels towards the show, and we will care more about them, because when Fuyumi was fading i didnt even cry, when staz was beaten up, i didnt cry or flood a river in my room becaue I already knew that he would wake up and trash the enemy in a matter of 3 seconds. \\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad, was not terrible or extremely bad, but the potential wasted was disappointing as I really did expect more from these characters and even the plot as well. Pacing was poo, inconsistent episode delivery too. The humor and action were the notable qualities that were well done in this anime. It is a good comedy and fantasy genre anime\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Blood lad will give you quite a lot of laughs, but you can be sure to feel safe because there isn't anything sad or tragic here, don't worry your room will not flood with tears. You wont give any damns, when someone dies. Inconsistency kills Blood Lad, leaving it stoned, becoming little bacon-bits. \\n\\n",

The excellent portrayal of said Comedy really sets the light tone of the anime which favours the otherwise feeble story. The timing of the jokes was never rushed nor forced nor complicated. They were easy to follow and hilarious to watch so you are in store for some serious chuckles! Regrettably this seems to be the only strong point of \u2018Blood Lad\u2019, for the comedy bits startto partake a repetitive nature which brings down the overall nature of the show since it\u2019s other aspects like Action and Romance are mediocre at best! Although the Comedy is solid throughout with many Easter eggs that are plastered all over the place. And I loved how Self-Referential this anime was, shrewdly incorporating it into its Comedy which resulted to a unique and funny experience!\\n\\n\r\nStaz (MC) is a very powerful vampire who also happens to be the Boss of his district in the Demon world. Time and time again, he battles powerful opponents but somehow wins despite his lackadaisical nature.  Due to his obsession with Otaku culture, his constant number of manga references and use of anime knowledge were the best part of his trait, often displayed in clever and unexpected ways. And his flashbacks provided enough details about him for you to care, though this arc could have been handled better. Staz life changes when he meets a Big breasted Japanese teenager (Fuyumi) and this is where the show starts. All he wants to do is suck her blood but something happens to her after which Staz can only promise to resurrect her somehow. Fuyumi was a disappointment because for all the unique and supernatural characters with their comical personality types in this show, she was the most plain and boring of all! I really can\u2019t say much about her except that she\u2019s the damsel in distress character, making her forgettable due to her dull and clueless nature. The Supporting characters are interesting on their own, from the manipulative Bell who comes with a dual personality of a Bitch and a girl who wants to fall in love to the Badass Wolf with his scary strength and regeneration powers. You have tons of other characters that are barely shown which hurts them since they don\u2019t get a lot of growth, yet somehow Braz shines by coming off all clever and scary while Liz makes an entrance with her depiction of affection for Braz and her overall cute yet mindless nature. In spite of introducing such exceptional characters, they fail to make a splash due to the short run time given to them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation happened to look very neat even when depicting dark places like the demon world but the overall colour scheme and contrast takes time getting used to cause for some reason it gave off a cartoon show vibe that\u2019s made for children! Still the change in the colour art style was well done for it totally worked during the comical scenes despite its cheap looking nature to me. The OP/ED were ok while the Voice Acting was nothing memorable but once again the Comedy and Action bit were elevated with the perfect use of abnormal sound effects throughout the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis Comedic Action packed vampire show turn these genres over its head by refusing to align itself to being a clich\u00e9 anime, rather focuses on keeping a light and fun atmosphere. Regardless of this attempt, it manages to start well but the sudden end to an incomplete story leaves a bad taste in your mouth! What\u2019s worst is that it needed just a few more episodes to wrap up its current story arc and they fail to do so in the hopes of greenlighting another season. Add in the completely boring romance attempt between Staz and Fuyumi which leaves you frustrated because you totally want Bell and Staz to hook up since they share more screen time and exhibit actual chemistry! In fact, I would go as far as putting Bell\u2019s mom with Staz rather than that bore fest of a teenager! \u2018Blood Lad\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously for you to enjoy since it\u2019s flawed in many places, from the straightforward plot to the animation and some characters. But it\u2019s still worth watching just for those parody moments alone. The short run of 10 episodes definitely plays into the anime\u2019s favour since it\u2019s able to maintain its charm for the most of it. All in all, despite all the fan service provided, I still wasn\u2019t impressed but I was entertained enough to recommend this to another viewer for a one-time watch only. Just don\u2019t expect anything deeper or meaningful and be prepared for an unfinished story which leaves many things unanswered.",

            "content": "Oh, damn, those vampires again, it seems they are everywhere, and why am I complaining when I am reviewing a vampire anime? First lets make it clear I picked up this only for the fact that it seems like it would be a comedy and for the Seinen tag. Turns out it is mostly a comedy anime but I don't understand why its Seinen? This is typical Shounen manga with damsel in distress formula with a supernatural comedy twist, but definitely not Seinen ( some uncalled for ecchi doesn't make Seinen,sorry), so stop advertising false information.\r\nStory\r\nThe story of Blood Lad follows our \"hero\" Staz whois a vampire in the makai (demon world) who doesn't drink human blood & is also an otaku, he is a leader of a small portion of demon world but mostly spends his time watching anime, reading manga and playing Japanese video games. One day our \"heroine\" Fuyumi accidentally wanders into the demon world and ends up in Staz's territory, Staz is so excited to finally meet a human girl but when he was a bit busy protecting his territory Fuyumi gets killed and turns into a ghost. And thus the story begins as our hero decides to revive Fuyumi into a human again. But wait there is a catch, Staz is not as heroic as it seems, actually he has a strong desire to drink Fuyumi's blood so he secretly wants to resurrect her for that. And thus our heroes trial begins as he tries to find ways to reach his goal. The story was a bit boring at the start but after a few episodes it starts to get a bit interesting, mostly due to some nice side characters most of whom actually are cliche Shounen characters but none the less likeable. The main likeable thing about the story is not its premise or the character backgrounds (which are too generic if you ask me) but the comedic side of it, the continuous pun at typical Shonen's like Staz trying to use Kamehameha was really funny stuff and it keeps the show enjoyable but when the writer tries to make things a bit serous with romance and family chemistry stuff then it starts to fall apart cause the main storyline for this anime is not original at all, we really have seen all those cliche stuff way many times before.\\n\r\nFrom me story gets 6.5 out of 10.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThe characters are not the strongest aspect of this anime, Staz is actually alright when he acts his funny self but his back story and all other aspects of his character are to bland for me but at least he is better than our heroine Miss-I-am-so-innocent-and-dumb-and-typical-with-unnaturally-big-breasts Fuyumi, come on we had these kinds of heroines for so long its just unbearable now.  And those unnecessary ecchi stuff, provocative dresses and shameless fan service is just too awful to waste my breath on.\\n\r\nBut not all is lost in the character department either because of some strong side characters, I mean Braz, Bell & Liz are almost impossible not to like and although a typical rival character I did like Wolf, and other side characters like Staz's gang members (Deku,Saty,Yoshida) were written with quite a lot of care it seems. So all I can say about the whole character business is that if Kodama would have given his main characters the same level of care as he did most of his side characters it would have been a way more better anime in my opinion.\\n\r\nThe characters get 7.5 out of 10 (and that's mostly for all the characters minus the main two). \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nUnarguably the animation is top notch and the best thing about this anime, the action sequences are colorful and a delight to watch, the character designs are lovely and the whole animation is fluid and crisp, it is one of the things to be amazed of in this show. But sadly that is not enough, you need good story and solid main characters to tell the story with your nice animation.\\n\r\nThe animation gets 8.5 out of 10.  \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound effect is appropriate for the show but nothing that really pulls your attention into it. The Opening theme is \"ViViD\" by May'n which is a nice opening for the show but doesn't really makes you want to get the listen to it as a separate form of entertainment. The ending theme is \"BLOODY HOLIC\" by Yuuka Nanri which is rather bland is my opinion and really doesn't go with the show, it tries somehow force the romance into the front of the situation which unfortunately I say is not the strongest aspect of the show, its the comedy that is, the opening song at least acknowledges that.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets a 6.5 out of 10 from me (its okay but really nothing to write home about).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of the day the writer did try to make a show which tries a different take on the vampire theme and the otaku twist is nice with the pun at other animes & manga bit is nice but unfortunately it seems that he himself sometimes forget what his initial intentions were and tries to inject serious stuff into the fold and force some unnecessary ecchi and romance into the mix which turns a otherwise quite innovative and fun idea into a cliched mental anguish for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE\\n\r\n                                     6.5 out of 10. \\n",

So i had somewhat high expectations who were crushed by the stupidity of this anime . I never got the 'plot' of this anime. I never found any character interesting enough to care. Staz was okay but he was the only somewhat interesting one. The girls were there doing nothing and just being 'eye candy' for the viewer. Cheap joke after cheap joke i struggled to finish a 10 episode series and im ashamed about that(i usually dont drop any series otherwise i might have done it) . Its the first time i give a series a score under 5 (my average is like 8.3 or something) but i found nothing good to grab onto as a saving quality of this anime. Not even worth the small effort of watching just 10 episodes in my opinion.\\n\r\nStory - 3 - incomplete\\n\r\nArt - 5 - wanky\\n\r\nSound - 6 - honestly i gave a generic grade cause i dont remember the op/ed\\n\r\nCharacters- 2 - Staz and noone else\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2 \\n\r\nOverall - 3",

The fast paced story goes great with the just as fast Character Development with in just about every episode a new character is introduced, not all ones you like, but none the less new. Ithas references to other anime and anime creators so it makes hilarious. This is a good anime if you want something to raise your spirits and make you think.",

For one, it made a great job of making the whole mood feel light-hearted, even when people were \"dying\" and the mood was supposed to be set serious it had never felt that way to me.\r\n  For a while now I had tried to search for an anime taht even from the very start I could tell was going to be an anime that didn't have such intense and heavy moody characters.... COUGH all those characters who think smiling isa sin COUGH. Even then though, it was hard to find something both interesting and light hearted, I wanted something like hunter x hunter. Blood lad had successfully accomplished that for me.\\n\\n\r\n  So that's it for my short and simple review, this anime is comedic, light-hearted, has plenty of action, enjoyable, has a very nice story and plot, and it's only problem is that it wasn't longer. 10/10 would bang the end PEACE OUT.\\n\\n\r\nPS I gave this anime a 9/10 for the sheer reason that it did what it set the mood for. It didn't have a peaceful nonchalant mood but has everyone dying and crying for days. It struck for a light - hearted fun enjoyable short anime to watch. It's plot was quite good for an anime so.\\n\\n\r\nSo when you watch this don't expect the deepest plot ever, with twists and turns and amazing woahs after every episode, if you're tired of being serious watch this anime. If I had had a serious mood and been searching for that, this anime would have gotten a solid 6. But it didn't, it hit exactly what it wanted to hit, and that's why I felt that this anime was more than enjoyable. It set the mood, it carried out the mood, and it kept it at that pace for the entire time without missing a single beat. PEACE OUT NO I AM REALLY DONE 14/10 WOULD BANG PEACE OUT!",

            "content": "Before I start this review, I would first like to say that I did not enjoy this anime.  I decided to try out the English Dub, and though I didn't mind it the voice-acting, there were points where listening to some of the dialogue spoken frustrated me. I had started this anime a while back and stopped watching for a bit as it did not peak my interest, but figured I should just finish it off because it is a short season. Let's get into this.\r\nStory - 5\r\nThe story was meh to me. It didn't really interest me nor kept me engaged, especially withthe main plotline. But I felt the side stories, the relationships between some of the characters were interesting just a bit more, but that is really all. I do like the idea that it is set in the demon world, giving the viewer a bit of new atmosphere... despite it looking like a normal city. Some of the sub stories in the anime were a bit stupid, like the romance between Fuyumi and Stax or Bell liking Stax because of some reason. It just sort of happens, and really, I just found it more irritating them heart-warming. There is no sense of development for these romances, and it didn't feel realistic to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nSurprisingly, I liked the art. It was simple and clean. Nothing grand at all, but passable. There were some demons designed to look ugly as hell, but luckily those would only be minor characters. Our main Character's designs were also pretty cool too. There are some problems I had with the how Bell and Fuyumi are over-sexualized, usually revealing their breasts or asses. They are usually dressed \"appropriately\" for each situation, and it annoyed me. Though it was not my main focus, it was still a bother.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 3\\n\r\nNothing really stood out for me in anime music wise. I don't remember any of the music and the opening was meh. Probably one of the few weak points of the anime, actually. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are unique in their own ways, especially with their special abilities. I do love how Stax is a full-on perverted Otaku, and I found him an amusing character to watch. I also did enjoy Wolf, and wish I could have seen more of him in the story. There were some weak characters like Fuyumi. She is useless. Like hell, she is useless. Wolf, Stax and Bell always seem to be saving her ass and trying to keep her safe. She does nothing to benefit the characters, and is just sort of there for the plot and give these characters some purpose. Bell was also a weak character. Despite having such an unique ability, I just found her annoying, not at all cute. Whenever she was around, she just frustrated me. I wish she had become a cheeky girl, yes, but also not be tied down by her feelings for Stax. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this anime. Watching each episode felt like more of a chore, and I would find myself swearing at the characters due to their stupidity. Though, I did get some few laughs, I still found myself mostly frustrated. I would just think that this kind of anime is not what I enjoy to watch. Sure, I love watching something to laugh at, which I think this anime was aiming at, but this was just plain ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nComing to a close, I give this anime a four. I was close to give it a three, but it just didn't seem right. It wasn't that awful. Blood Lad could be enjoyed by others, but with me, I just don't enjoy it. Maybe someone who enjoys complete ridiculousness and don't mind the constant fanservice would like to give this a try. Upon this review, my final score is a 4 out of ten.",

            "content": "I just want to mention first that I have read the manga for Blood Lad (up to where it\u2019s translated) and that this was actually my first manga ever (so it\u2019s a bit special to me). However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s one of my favorites and really I think it\u2019s just average overall. I\u2019ll be making many comparisons between the manga and anime (without spoilers of course).\r\nStory \u2013 6/10\r\nI do really like the unique the initial plot. It follows Staz who is a vampire that is the leader of a section of the underworld. Staz also happens to be an otaku for all things fromthe human world, especially things from Japan, from anime to figures to Final Fantasy. And yes, they make a lot of references to different things (Dragonball might have the most). One day, Staz hears from his henchmen that a human girl suddenly appeared in the streets. Being who he is, Staz can\u2019t resist meeting her. However, due to an unfortunate series of events involving giant plants, the girl (whose name is Fuyumi) ends up dying only to turn into a ghost. Staz (for reasons that are somewhat selfish) vows to help Fuyumi get her human body back. They travel everywhere in search of clues and even go back to the human world for a short time. They slowly piece things together about how to return Fuyumi to her human form but what they uncover is a much bigger story that pulls them in even though Staz really wishes he could just get this all over with at times.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it was announced that Blood Lad would only have 10 episodes, I was kind of skeptical how they would fit everything in, and, whether or not they would go past where the manga is translated into English as there are about 15 chapters that are not translated (about 1/3rd of the manga at this time). While not too many problems came from having a shorter series, the anime was very fast paced. Blood Lad is a series that tends to jump around a lot and lose focus of the overall plot amidst a sea of side plots. With the fast pacing, there were times during some episodes where the plot switched between places so fast that it became hard to follow. Most of the episodes also end at awkward points in the story and kind of cut up the story in ways that I think mess up the story (at least if you are watching one episode a week like I did).\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was done by studio \u201cBrains Base\u201d who is known for works like Baccano, Durarara!!, Amnesia, Natsume Yuujinchou, etc. While they\u2019re previous works (as far as I\u2019ve seen) usually have very impressive art, I felt they went a little overboard with Blood Lad. The animation looks great and the fight scenes are well animated, but the anime was just way too colorful in my opinion. The Blood Lad manga had a much darker edge (despite being a comedy manga), and the wide array of colors in almost in almost every moment of the anime kind of dampens that effect at times. But there are some places, like Staz\u2019s otaku room, which do benefit from the colorful animation, but they are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nA problem with the art that the manga also suffers from is in its character designs. While I really like some of the characters\u2019 designs (like Staz, Braz, and Akimu), there were many that I thought were just strange. Fuyumi and Bell especially look awkward and Wolf\u2019s face in his werewolf form just looks kind of strange and unnatural the way it\u2019s elongated. The characters are also very vividly colorful especially when it comes to hair color, which goes back to the last part. Still, Staz and several other characters do have very good designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also very average. I really only noticed one track that stood out to me while the rest was mostly average, but I also never noticed any really disliked. The one good track sounds kind of mysterious and is used in the few darker scenes or just before the comedic scenes (the latter of which kind of ruins its effect).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job of portraying their roles with Staz\u2019s being the standout performance. His voice actor, Ohsaka Ryota, does an amazing job portraying the otaku vampire and all of his craziness. With Fuyumi (who\u2019s just kind of bland to start with) her voice actress did fit the role well, but was still boring. I also found Wolf\u2019s voice in his werewolf form to be very annoying and kind of cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime drops in my opinion. While Staz is great and sometimes unpredictable, some of the other characters (especially Fuyumi) are very one dimensional and boring. It was the same way in the manga, too. Fuyumi is just one of the most boring female protagonists I\u2019ve ever seen. She\u2019s your typical damsel in distress who gets thrown around by everyone (with occasional fanservice) and doesn\u2019t ever do anything herself. Since the entire plot and most of the side plots are centered on her, it really ruins the story at times because of her being unable to do anything while everyone else fights to help her regain her humanity.\\n\\n\r\nNow for some of the better characters. Hydra Bell is a demon who uses magic that opens portals to wherever she wants to go and can even view things in other places just by making a rectangular shape out of her fingers. She enjoys messing with Staz and testing his powers to see how strong he really is. Wolf is a territory boss just like Staz. He and Staz have known each other since they were kids and have an interesting relationship as rivals. Braz is Staz\u2019s older brother who Staz hates. He often experiments on Staz and is kind of one of the antagonists of the series. Liz is Staz\u2019s younger sister and the jail keeper of what appears to be the largest prison in the underworld. She hates Staz because he gets most of Braz\u2019s attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the background characters are either forgettable or were just introduced around the end of the anime and barely get any screen time. It\u2019s a pretty large cast of characters for an anime with only 10 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the series was rushed too much and would have done much better with 12 or 13 episodes. The manga was already fast paced and the anime only sped that up as it sometimes put about 3 chapters into a single episode. The art is just too colorful in my opinion, and the soundtrack really doesn\u2019t stand out at all. While Staz is a good protagonist, Fuyumi is just a horrible heroine. The rest of the cast is both good and bad as well. It\u2019s definitely not the best show this season, though it\u2019s not really the worst either. If you\u2019re looking for vampire anime (despite being extremely different) I would recommend Shiki instead. If you\u2019re looking for comedy and action then try Blue Exorcist which has a very similar feeling and similar protagonists.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nUsually in anime monsters, demons, vampires etc are considered the villains of the show and end up being defeated by the hero, however Blood Lad decides to concentrate on the whole monster aspect and their world making for one somewhat interesting setup.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story focuses on Staz, a vampire who rules a section of the demon world. One day a random human girl called Fuyumi finds herself in the demon world and whilst under Staz's protection she gets eaten and becomes a ghost. Staz vows to bring her back to life.\r\nNow as simple as the premise is, a lot more stuff goes onin this show than you think especially considering it's only 10 episodes, so a lot of content was squished into this.\\n\r\nIt starts out fairly normal as Staz tries his best finding ways of bringing Fuyumi back to life while also getting caught up in ridiculous situations.\\n\r\nBut as the show goes on it starts to get more plot heavy as more characters are introduced and we get to know more about Staz's history and other family members, I thought this was an interesting addition to the story and kept me hooked, then as we enter the final episodes the story focused more on Fuyumi and her family issues which seemed like it had cropped up out of nowhere, but if have good attention to detail then you probably knew there was something odd about Fuyumi in the first place.\\n\r\nAnother story line develops along the way too, which is the state of power in the demon world and this was mainly to do with Staz's brother Braz. This tied in once again with their family history and showed how open and expansive this world was.\\n\r\nThe whole however really has it's up and down moments, the 10 episode length doesn't help with this as I feel like the plot advanced very quickly and never settled in one spot for too long, now this wasn't entirely a bad thing as it kinda suited an anime like this. The problem is that one moment you're concentrating on this thing, then something else gets thrown at you and then something else comes outta nowhere, it got a little tiresome trying to keep track of the amount of things going on and it hurt the story in some way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite having quite a large cast of characters, most of them were particularly interesting whereas some were interesting, but got a little worse over time.\\n\r\nStaz is the MC and a vampire, now even though he's a vampire he tends to have a lazy kind of attitude making people underestimate him, but that is always a bad thing as he is incredibly powerful. He is also very stubborn, doesn't really have much sense of things and is very impetuous, but despite these shortcomings whenever he sets a goal for himself he always makes sure it is done, plus unlike most monsters you see he has an extreme interest in the human world and the products they have.\\n\r\nFuyumi is the female MC, she randomly ends up in the demon world and becomes a ghost after being eaten by a plant. Now you may think she is there for just bland fanservice and in some cases you might be right, but she had a mysterious nature and always had some kind of importance even though she was the butt end of Staz's jokes and actions yet out of all the characters in the show she seemed like the most reasonable and always pointed out how stupid some situations were. Plus she's cute as hell, you can't ignore a cute girl like her.\\n\r\nBell is a sorceress, who tends to get in Staz's way of his goal. At first I really liked her personality as it reminded me of Haruko from FLCL, but despite her funny, playful yet short tempered attitude she slowly became a somewhat forced love interest for Staz and this just didn't fit right for her character, which in the end hurt her reputation a little.\\n\r\nWolf is like Staz, a demon boss, but he is a werewolf. Wolf is a badass and definitely goes great with Staz's character since the two are friendly rivals, he is strong willed and ambitious making him a force to be reckoned with which is why you wouldn't want to fight the fella. He also has a short temper, though much worse than Bells and tends to take his frustration out on his goons, but he means well and does have a caring nature especially towards Staz and his friends. Sadly his presence in the show is kinda cut short as he leaves the group shortly before the final episodes, which sucked since he was a great character alongside Staz.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI will give credit where credit is due, because this was a surprisingly colourful show, each scene looked like a goddamn rainbow, well unless the setting was dark and evil then that's a different story, but it always captured the scenes very nicely. I also liked the punk aspect of Staz's area and the lettering too making it seem like he was a proper gang boss. The other areas were alright too and made the demon world look big and expansive showing it could be as large or even bigger than our own world.\\n\r\nEven the characters had a very colourful essence, the amount of outfits and costumes they wore was a lot and surprisingly they fitted the characters well, I especially liked the black jacket getup that Staz had at some point making him look pretty badass, plus it was also funny how the show kinda knew when it was putting Fuyumi in revealing clothing like it was a joke towards other anime's that had busty looking female characters wearing revealing outfits.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't too bad either, I enjoyed the op which was nicely tuned to the way the show was, which was all over the damn place. Although I feel like the opening kinda spoiled the events that were going to happen and this is something I slowly noticed over time and I suddenly knew where the next locations were going to be. However the op was still fun to listen to.\\n\r\nThe ed was actually ok, it had the mysterious element that represented a part of Fuyumi's character, but just like the opening it kinda spoiled a story line that would connect her and Bell's characters although not in the way I was expecting.\\n\r\nIt's soundtrack was pretty surprising, it had great intense pieces for when the action scenes happened and gave them a feeling like there was a lot at stake if the hero's didn't win.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe action was pretty damn sweet, they were quick, thrilling and pretty suspenseful considering what was on the line. The best was definitely the boxing match between Staz and Wolf which just seemed funnily out of place compared to every other battle. However there were some battles that relied more on wit than brawn like when Bell was trying to trap Staz in one of her dimension cages and he ended up outwitting her in a pretty hilarious way.\\n\r\nNow when it comes to comedy, this show was a bit of a mixed bag. It didn't start off too well with the comedy and the only funny moments were mainly between Staz and Fuyumi along with the instances that involved Bell, but slowly over time the comedy did get better and better as the characters got into more ridiculous situations.\\n\r\nI liked how the supernatural was the entire focus point of the show, usually if would be something supernatural set in the human world, but for once it's actually set in the world of the supernatural which isn't something where many anime's (from what I've seen) are set. So it was nice to see a different kind of setting compared to other anime's I've seen in the past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a pretty short and sweet show, colourful and mostly fun characters and a heavily focused supernatural setting makes this a pretty memorable show that hopefully one day will get the second season it deserves.",

The biggest point downer in my opinion is the randomness of it all. Okay, a human pops out of nowhere, something convenient appears at some weirdly convenient time, and somebody just happens to be related to someone else. People might like that kind of thing, but for me, it just shortens the attention span. At least it was funny...\r\n- I can't stand cliffhangers. Blood Lad has got to have the best cliffhangers of the century. I was so annoyed andclose to flipping my desk whenever an episode ended, but the cliffhangers were so cleverly placed and scripted that I HAD to keep watching. That's the best, and the worst, part of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n- What can I say? Art is subjective.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\n- The music appeals greatly to my taste. -1 point for the OP that I didn't really like. Subjectivity again... I'm still learning how to listen objectively, bear with me >",

            "content": "I love vampires. And I loved the Blood Lad manga...from the point I read up to. I await for the next volume to be out in the US. \r\nThe moment I heard of the anime, I put it on my instant \"plan to watch list\" in my head. (As this was before I joined MAL). (Side note): Okay. So, when I heard it was going to be 10 episodes, I kind of freaked out a bit and since Wikipedia was being edited constantly between 10 and 12 episodes, I didn't know what to believe. \r\nAnyway, for this review, I'll start to say:\r\nWhen I watched thefirst few episodes, I loved how closely it followed the manga. I loved how it was almost exactly like the manga, except for maybe a few event rearrangements, but I didn't really care about that. After around episode seven though, I was wondering... \"how are they going to wrap up this anime\"? \\n\\n\r\nThen it dawned upon me: \"It's going to end with Staz and Fuyumi are going to go through the doorway, and the vampire hunt will begin\". I got the door part right. I got the vampire part wrong. So, I was right about how it would end to a 50% tangent. I was disappointed it ended the way it ended, so -2 on enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, it covers the first six volumes of the manga, that's it. So, 8/10 on story, 8/10 on enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine. There's nothing wrong with the art, and I really enjoy how it looks in the anime. In fact, it's better in the anime because I get to see what the mangaka's art looks like...animated! It's great--like any other manga that became an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nI have Asperger's. So the loud noises really bothered me when I was watching Blood Lad. I had to pause for a few minutes because the sound effects really got to me, and I tried hard to ignore the sound effects, I couldn't--they were too loud for me. The music was okay, though, I did enjoy the music to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not a lot of character development. That's not bad or anything, but Staz develops nicely, imo. Fuyumi, Bell, Wolf and Staz, don't though, that didn't bug me, but I wanted to see Fuyumi develop a tiny bit. Liz was a great character, btw. I loved all the characters. Especially Staz, Fuyumi, Bell and Beros...despite her not being in it a lot. All of tears.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was great, BUT THEN IT WAS OVER. And I was upset by that. The anime had so much potential, but then it ended the exact way I knew it would, I didn't want it to be that way. But it was a really good and fun summer anime, probably the best Black Comedy I ever watched. I want, no, I need a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you like ten episode anime and black comedy.  \\n",

I was tempted to rate it down just for ticking me off.  \r\nI enjoyed Blood Lad.  I began it with skepticism because all things vampiric have been letting me down recently.  The concept of a pwoerful vampire infatuated with humans and the human world to the point of being an otaku is intriguing and amusing.  I like the quick pace of the writing.  The animation style is artsy.It's purposefully flat and '70s comic looking to give the watcher the sense that indeed this is not the human world. \\n\\n\r\nStaz, our otaku vampire prince, is an anti-hero.  He is not a good guy.  In fact he tells you he's not.  He's a demon afterall.  Most of the demons he runs across are in human form, but there are some in other forms.  I was never sure if our leading lady was dense or just overwhelmed. She was likeable, but I didn't love her. \\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad is good, but it is too short and the story doesn't end.  I hope there is a 2nd season.",

No other reason.

The story is the interesting part IMO. It ties magic and technology with vampires, werewolves with a ton of fighting. Not bad at all.\r\nThere is subtle romance and ecchi but other than huge oppai (which are a staple of ANY anime these daysto get more sales) on the main girl character along with her clueless klutz like attitude. So instead of just the MC, now you have two idiots as main characters. I wish more anime were like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a light hearted anime. It has very cool and some serious moments, but its slap-happy type of fun. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend it! Especially if you like dragonball. Lol",

            "content": "Blood Lad was an anime that seemed like it was very popular when it came out, then quickly fizzled out and went under the radar. Not a lot of people seem to remember it anymore...and that is what made me interested in it. Years after the craze had died down, I decided to check it out. Here is what I thought about this series.\r\nThe bold presentation style was one of this anime's strong points. One of the main perks of this anime was it's vibrant colour palette. Even though it takes place in the demon world for the most part, the atmosphere and colours blenddark and light perfectly. The one thing I disliked about the anime was it's insertion of fanservice where it didn't need to be. It felt like someone was adding it on to sell the anime and not for much else, when the scenes in the source material did not feature fanservice or were drawn as gags. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a mixed bag. They range from lovable and amazing, to bland, to just frustrating and annoying. I absolutely *hated* Bel, and felt that she is the worst example of a tsundere, letting people get into danger all because of her obsession with a man who does not want her, but hey, people will like her anyways because FANSERVICE. -.- Fuyuki was sort of bland, and at times felt like she was just there, but was pretty non-offensive. She got a bit more interesting as the series went on, but during the first half of it she is just bland. Staz and Liz were the best characters in the show, and their interactions in the series were actually pretty cute. I loved how Staz learns to become responsible for his little sister when he is shown from the beginning to be such a self-centered character. Wolf was also a decent character, and I like how the whole \"vampires and werewolves hate each other\" trope was averted. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was decent, but was cut off right when it was getting interesting. I guess this is due to the anime not getting renewed. I think if this show had more than 10 episodes, it could have gotten more room to stretch it's legs and be a more complete story, but what we got was just decent. Watch it if you're interested in monster boys I guess.",

            "content": "I found Blood Lad on accident and saw it was only ten episodes, so I said, Why not?  Overall, it was alright, something to watch if you're bored but not something I would recommend.\r\nThe story was decent with some sprinkling of action, character conflicts, some humor.  Most refreshing was the fact it wasn't your typical vampire story.  Stay, our vampire protagonist, isn't fighting of his bloodlust for some human he meets randomly and falls in love with.  This story is at least more complex than that and with the help of many different species of monsters this is not your averagevampire story.  That being said, the characters do nothing to help the story for me.  With only ten episodes you can't go deep into character building, but these characters at their core do nothing for me.  Most fall flat or have contradicting character traits that don't really work for me.  The art I found to be refreshing, however.  It's filled with color and the character designs really follow the monster anatomy.\\n\\n\r\nSo again, overall, I guess this anime is alright for one of those days you're super bored and have nothing else to watch.",

            "content": "***THIS REVIEW IS ONLY BASED ON THE ANIME***\r\nThis is my very first review about any anime and although I didn't watch a ton of anime, but I have definitely seen enough to judge this one topic by topic. \r\nIf you're looking for some action and with a potion of comedy then you will be just wasting your time in this anime. \r\nStory - 6\r\nAnything good about this anime is only its story and rest of its aspects are nothing because without art, animation, sound and character, you can't make a anime out of it. The plot isn't some unique stuff or a intriguing one, Ihave come across many anime with the very same plot. After all, we all have heard and watched stories about the demon world and how the main characters of that story travel aboard. The story development is one real good plus point for this anime, the pacing of the story is not the smoothest though. Regardless of good story development, this anime lacks the power to keep the viewers wanting to watch it whole.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nNothing very special about its art too, why I gave its art 6 out of 10 is because it won't do justice to anime like soul eater etc. I found the 2's art pretty similar and we all know that Soul Eater is one of the best out there. What I am trying to say is that the art of this anime is neither very good too comparing it to the anime of its time (eg. Shingeki no Kyojin).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\\n\r\nNeither the opening nor the ending caught my attention, also the insert music are quite bad. Not a single song or music or soundtrack in this anime was memorable, I don't even remember that it actually had soundtracks (the ones I remember are nothing new and are quite common). About the voice acting, I prefer you to watch the dubbed one as it suited the characters better in my opinion. I have watched subbed 4 episodes and the voice acting didn't impress me much whereas the dubbed one was way better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the character sheet is nothing innovative as well, regardless Staz was easily the best character in the anime, then I will place that redhead lolli Liz and then Wolf will attain the 3rd spot. Nothing much to talk about but yeah that Fuyumi girl was pretty dumb, but full score to Hydra. Few characters were tried to be depicted as a source of witticism which they failed to horribly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\\n\r\nThere's almost nothing to enjoy in this anime as far as I have seen, you will enjoy this anime only if you love reading story books that implements no thrill and unrest to you but progresses like a old boring book. Many scenes were attempted as a gag bomb but they lacked humour and hence, turned out to be a goddamn flop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\\n\r\nVery close to horrible but what saves this anime is its story, this anime has comedy in its genre which I highly doubt. Not single very moment I felt like \"woah this scene is hilarious, I should start laughing\", story and its development is the only reason I completed it.This anime is nothing but just a old dumbass boring book that kids hate to read. The plot of the anime is nothing of a unique or astonishing one, neither the characters are.",

            "content": "There exists an alternate world full of demons which one can reach through magical portals. A somewhat air-headed human girl named Fuyumi accidentally travels though such a portal and is soon captured by demons. Luckily Staz, the head of the demons, is a carefree vampire who wants to break away from his clan's past and has no intentions of harming Fuyumi. Unfortunately, he's not terribly attentive and Fuyumi is soon gobbled up by a giant flower-monster. Greatly attracted to something unknown about Fuyumi, Staz vows to restore Fuyumi's ghost to her former body, which is now a frowning pile of bones.\r\nBlood Lad is a light-heartedaction/comedy with a fair dosage of ecchi. An extremely short and ultimately incomplete work, this is a good watch as a shonen piece. There is not enough depth or complexity to warrant the seinen tag nor is there enough character progress to warrant a romance tag. If you're looking for some bloody quick action (of the fighting/magic sort) by all means give this a try. If not, I'd wait to see if there is a sequel before jumping in. As it is, there are too many unanswered questions for this to be a fulfilling watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nBlood Lad seems to be going for a cool shonen look. The coloring is quite saturated (except for the vampires' pale skin) and lots of characters have rather funky clothing. Backgrounds are rather simplistic and detailing is only average at best. Character styling is definitely unique with a lot of interesting designs and twists on established monster stereotypes, my favorite being Yukiotoko, a snowman who is cold from his own existence. In certain short sequences characters are drawn with different hair colors, a stylistic choice I guess. What kind of irritated me was the fact that the protagonist Staz was drawn with such a lack of emotional range. He is either calm and collected or grinning and collected. While a laid back protagonist is fine, having some emotional range would do a lot to engage the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThere's plenty of action in this show with a range of physical and magical battles. There are quite a few non-traditional attacks that differentiate this from your typical show but nothing that will knock you off your feet either. Expect a fair amount of blood and carnage though, with this being a pretty light-hearted show, nothing is really gruesome in an Elfen Lied sense. There is a fair amount of ecchi in this show ranging from finger licking to bouncing body parts and skimpy clothing.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nBlood Lad opens with a rock based OP fit for the amount of action in the show. I don't really like the melody and don't particularly care for the singer's voice. The ED is a slightly slower rock piece with a much better singer and melody. The \"cool\" theme is further reflected in the BGM, which has a percussion-heavy tune with electronic, guitar, and brass-based instruments that gives the series a unique feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is relatively young and new but does a fair job at bringing some life to the characters. I think Emi Bridcut did a great job as Hydra Bell, who has by far the most depth out of all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis is a fairly light-hearted show though there are some pretty late plot twists/revelations. The show has quite a few subplots running alongside the main plotline of trying to revive Fuyumi. Annoyingly, these subplots are developed a lot more than the core goal. In fact, once Staz decides to revive Fuyumi, he seems to be doing everything but that (i.e. getting endlessly sidetracked). Thus, while we learn a lot about Staz's family and the demon realm, we still don't have a good grasp of how Fuyumi can be a human again.\\n\\n\r\nAs explained above, expect meandering arcs about various subplots, many of which have their own rising action and climax. While the story progression is fair, there are still way too many unanswered questions at the end of the show. The final conclusion is more of a teaser than a conclusion, which obviously begs for a second season. The caveat is that the events of this show are the type that a viewer soon forgets (think the gap between White Album and White Album Second Season). Thus, I recommend waiting for a second offering for a more complete viewing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhile the show has a lot of interesting and unique personalities, I felt there was a lack of actual development. Hydra Bell is probably the only character that shows any growth and development through the piece. Staz starts as a lazy but powerful vampire and ends the same. Fuyumi starts as a clueless living girl and ends up as a clueless ghost. Wolfboy starts as an underdog fighter and remains such at the end. While you get fair exposition on important characters, we'll have to wait till the second season for any real development.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nIf you walked into this series based on a potentially intriguing relationship between Staz and Fuyumi forget it. Drop this and move on or this show will leave you with an agonizing, unfulfilled feeling. Otherwise, add this to your list and wait for a second season. Blood Lad is a unique but incomplete work; a concept that, due to such a partial execution, really doesn't hold its own.",

Now the closing...I don't know why but it wasn't satisfying! There was waaay too much! A cliffhanger, a surprise and a mystery is a little too much too process in that one \r\nlast episode...well anyway another season be great.

            "content": "The Video review is up on my youtube, but here is the written Review.\r\nStory - 4/10\r\nVampires used to be seen as fearsome creatures back in the day, but these days they are usually seen as heroes or anti-heroes. The story begins as a normal day of a vampire named, Staz Charlie Blood, his own territory boss, until, Fuyumi Yanagi, an ordinary human girl wanders herself into the human world and is taken to Staz. Now  naturally when you think of vampire, they\u2019ll of course suck her blood, but unlike his ancestors he avoids attacking humans. However Staz does find an interest in her, untilshe is killed and turned into a ghost. So the main premise of the show is that Staz is trying to find a way to resurrect Fuyumi back to a normal human. So he can find that satisfaction he had for her when she was alive, because when  she turned into a ghost he lost that attraction. It\u2019s a basic plot, but following the story is kind of hard. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is only 10 episodes long and usually one episode has like around 3 different plots. The story jumps around a lot, and that can be confusing. It felt really rushed and even in the end it wasn\u2019t satisfying, as if it was setting up for something bigger. This in turn is kind of disappointing because I was really interested and hooked into the world of Blood Lad. The Demon world, is such a unique and exciting place. I like how the writers were able to put all these supernatural creatures, from vampires to werewolves to frankenstein and many more creatures into one show, and it actually makes some sort of sense. Because there is so much different powers and abilities in this world, if you were to look away for just a bit you could miss out on something. Because there is so much things going on, it\u2019s quite easy to miss something along the way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nStaz Charlie Blood is the main protagonist of the show. He is the boss of a territory in the Demon World. He is rather powerful often usually able to defeat any opponent, and that is proven further down the track as he becomes stronger. What you probably didn\u2019t expect is that Staz is also an otaku. He is obsess with Japanese culture whether its video games or manga. But it\u2019s more like he\u2019s obsess with the human world, as hinted when he saw Fuyumi. Despite looking unreliable, he is dependable, once he\u2019s made up his mind he tries very hard to achieve his goal, even though he may not look like it, he has enough motivation to. What I like about this character is the mystery surrounding his past and his motives. Because he has interesting past, but also his motives are mystery as well, which really adds to his character, if he didn\u2019t have those mystery surrounding him, he would be a generic never say die character, with a bit of cockiness added. The fact that he\u2019s an otaku, many common anime lovers can relate to a protagonist. Because to be honest, not a lot of people are a fan of vampires, because you know\u2026twilight.\\n\\n\r\nFuyumi Yanagi is the main female heroin in the series. Actually I wouldn\u2019t really say heroin more of a constant damsel in distress. She is a normal Japanese School Girl who accidentally wanders into the Demon world and gets herself killed and therefor she becomes a ghost. Although she is very kind and supportive person, she is completely useless. Yes it does make sense since she comes from the human world, it would make sense for her not to have any powers. She\u2019s pretty much just around for plot device. She relies a lot of the other characters around her to get things done. She is Staz\u2019s driving force, but also everyone else\u2019s object, because she literally gets tossed around by everyone. Seriously she\u2019s rather generic and kind of annoying. She\u2019s also kind of there for fan service. The only the conflict I did enjoy from her was as the series went on, she grows accustom to the demon world which brings the question, does she want to be a human or stay as a demon. But that storyline is short lived and left unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nBell Hydra and Wolf are the other main characters of the show. Bell is a mischievous treasure hunter and her defining appearance is her oversize big ass backpack. Who knows what she carriers in there, maybe just a lot of different frames she uses as portals, because that\u2019s her power. She's around to pretty much ruin people\u2019s day, she\u2019s not evil, but she\u2019s very tricky which can annoy some, and I like her interactions with Staz, because she rivals him. Wolf is Staz\u2019s friend and rival, not much can be said about him other than he is wild. He\u2019s motivation for helping Staz is because he simply has a crush on Fuyumi. But even he was barely given enough screen time to be interesting, there was really any development in him and he is supposed to be Staz\u2019s rival, and Staz did develop.\\n\\n\r\nMost the characters have an interesting backstory and past, but because of the run time and how short the anime was, it wasn\u2019t fully explored. Most of the characters only had a few episodes to shine, but there wasn\u2019t enough development in them. Even some of the later characters in the series were hinted of motivations for doing what they were doing, but that is left unanswered, so you\u2019re wondering why was this character introduced in the first place. Also because the ending is  left open ended, the character development just felt like one piece of a great puzzle that was going to be something bigger. So it really feels incomplete and it\u2019s disappointing because I felt there could\u2019ve been potential for these characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 7/10, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was probably Blood Lad\u2019s strongest point lies, which is the art style. It\u2019s a unique art style, all the characters besides Fuyumi have the evil anime eyes, so you can\u2019t really tell who\u2019s good and who is bad, which I like. Also the Demon world is surprisingly full of colours, everything really looks unique and because they jump around the demon world a lot, you get to see a lot of different settings. Also all characters look unique as well and they look good. Albeit the colour scheme is still very basic and you can see as if some of the backgrounds weren\u2019t completed, but that just goes to the art style. Some people are going to have a problem with the art, because it\u2019s not typical and does look sometime simplistic. The animation does shine around some of the fight scenes though, the effects look good and every character has their own power and animation which is a really shining point in the anime, but it\u2019s too short lived most of the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is ok, it\u2019s nothing special. The soundtrack suits the mood and different settings and locations of the show. The show has a good mixture of gothic music to suit the theme of the show, I particular like it the most when they play some punk rock in it. Of course being a vampire theme anime you\u2019re going to get some organs in here and there, but that\u2019s not to say they have some comedic music in there from time to time. The opening and ending themes are ok, the ending does it job, however I do enjoy the opening as it really sets up the show very well, not to mention it basically shows what\u2019s going to be happening in the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOne thing Blood Lad does very well is having a character with an otaku background. So despite being a vampire he is somewhat relatable. But because when you have a character based on an otaku population, most of the jokes in the show are based on different anime and manga etc. And if you don\u2019t get the reference you\u2019re probably not going to be laughing as hard, but if you do get the reference they make you can enjoy the show. Some of the other jokes tend to involve slapstick comedy, so other than parodying and slapstick they don\u2019t have a huge range of jokes. Because during my time of watching Blood Lad, I don\u2019t think I laughed really hard. But only some jokes where I did get the references, I got a good satisfaction out of it. The genre really surprised me, because I was able to see so many different supernatural things in one place and see how the world unfolds around them, which is what I like about the show. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story of Blood Lad I give it a 4. For the reason it\u2019s incomplete and hard to follow, yet it has a simple premise. Plus the story felt really rushed and yet, it didn\u2019t conclude properly. The only thing I really enjoyed was the whole concept of the Demon world, as I felt I really needed to see more because it was an interesting world.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, they get a 7 from me. Reason being I think most of them were interesting to a point, but they just weren\u2019t fully developed and left out, so I was disappointed. But I did enjoy the character interactions with each other and I think Staz\u2019s mystery really adds to him. I did find the characters likable by the way.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound I give it a 7 and 6 respectively. The art style is unique and that\u2019s positive, but because it\u2019s unique it may not appeal to too many people and plus some of it looks basic. But I like how everything is unique and actions scenes were great, but short lived. The sound does it\u2019s job and opening theme setups the anime really well.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 7. I\u2019m not a huge fan on vampires, but the anime was able to create a character I normally don\u2019t enjoy as much to a character I like because he\u2019s relatable. And I understood some of the references the anime was making, and it made me laugh which it should be doing for a comedy series. But I found myself confused sometime because the story constantly jumps and expects me to be paying attention to everything, expects it to be funny even when I don\u2019t get the references.\\n\\n\r\nSo after rounding all the scores up I give Blood Lad a 6/10. It\u2019s not a bad anime, it\u2019s above average because it\u2019s uniqueness and likeable cast of characters. The main character is relatable, however if you don\u2019t understand some of the references, you\u2019re probably not going to enjoy it as much. I recommend this anime to Vampire fans, as I think that\u2019s the only type of people who may enjoy it, because it\u2019s hard to follow.\\n",

            "content": "So Blood lad. It is definitely a satire of sorts. Definitely playing off most of the standard vampire stories. Now I would not recommend the anime, but I would recommend the manga. There is a lot of time in the manga for the story to mature, and you get to personally know the characters. As well as their motivations. While with this one they planned on making a second season that has not even had a release date. So this results in a super rushed and kind of non sense story. You kind of feel lost on why the characters want to do what theydo. I also felt like this anime could of had so much more. It is a great satire, and a decent little comedy. However knowing how great the manga was. It kind of hurts knowing what this anime could have been. Despite those downfalls. I thought that the art and sound were pretty fantastic. The animation really compliments the manga, and it is great eye candy. The voice acting was pretty good to. Although the main girl does sound a little to high pitched for my taste, but if yah like that. Have at it haus. So overall. I would recommend this anime, but do not expect huge and great things from it. Hopefully the second season comes in, and helps pick up where this anime left off.",

I felt this show had  a lot of potential , but it turned out to be a random packed bagage of genres . From action to nonsense , from there to drama and back to nonsense in a split of a second i was shocked that it was possible . Don't get me wrong i enjoyed that and had this little feeling that something like that might just happen in this show after the first 30 seconds . In a way it soundslike i am contradicting myself here . Ok , in other words this show turned out to be something else that i thought it would be , but even so it wasn't bad . \\n\r\nThe story was nicely told , not rushed , a lot of things that i didn't expect to happen , happened , plus that if this anime will continue an even better story will arise , that's only my speculation , i didn't read the manga , or any other spoilers , lets call it ' instinct ' . \\n\r\nWhat i didn't see here was any character development , maybe a little on Staz's part and Liz's side as well ,  but otherwise the main heroine was the same from the start to the end , useless , with an acute Orihime Syndrome , the bad guys were nice , but totaly inexistent , let's not forget about the ones who would normaly aid the MC , the support characters , they were the best  ( sarcasm here ) . Anyway we can't expect any major difference in the characters in a 10 eps long anime , that is almost impossible , i think . \\n\r\nArt and Animation were above averange that is for sure , the effects were really nice done , plus the design of the world was done perfectly for this kind of show , well the mangaka who wrote this has done that , but lets give credit to the animators as well . \\n\r\nFor the Sound part i didn't really notice anything special , maybe i am tone deaf , but that is my humble opinion . \\n\r\nAll in all this show is made to make you laugh at how a vampire is trying to revive a human girl , even if that means leaving his safe zone . Maybe in the future the story will get a lot more serious , but until then those who haven't watched it do so you won't regret a thing . \\n\r\nPS : Here the vampires don't sparkle in the sunlight , so don't worry and enjoy .",

If you love vampires, harem, and a girl who dies within the first episode by a plant than watch this! There is a scene were this main female character is naked (so don't watch it with parents.) I found this anime REALLY funny and I just loved Staz. \r\nThe story is about this girl who somehow got into the monster world and everyone there were surprised and sorrounding her so yeah she was pretty freaked out. Now they called Staz which is their leader sortaand he I think he likes manga and Japan (i'm not 100% sure) So when they brought the girl to him he was really interesting in her because she was a human... and he hasn't met humans I think. Then he leaves her in his room because there were some people outside and they were doing bad things and he had to get rid of them. Now he left this plant there which eats people... So as you can guess the plant ATE the girl and she was there as a ghost (not really scary) naked. (but they brought her clothes.) That's the story.\\n\\n\r\n I loved the art,sound, and characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall in MY opinion the anime was an 8 out of 10 because of the comedy",

The mom because she didn't consider any of the characters. As for Staz he's a great character, but he never showed any emotion-for anything! Fuzumi was also annoying because she had that nice, innocent girl act and I'm not into that. It was good though as for the plot and creativity, but it was kinda a cliff hanger for romance. You think something romantic would happen, but it would just stop. If your going toadd romance go through with it, don't half-ass it. However if you like supernatural animes with comedy and action this is for you. If your looking for romance, strong female leads and good endings than this isn't for you. If you already watched this and wanna find out what happened read the manga because its exactly like the anime except it keeps continuing. Overall it was an OK anime, but I wouldn't recommend it.",

            "content": "Vampires. Vampire-themed series are not new nowadays. Blood Lad is one of them. I first encountered Blood Lad on a manga site, the art on it really pulled me in. Its comedic feel didn't left me hanging in the air too. So I kinda expected a lot in the anime.\r\nThe story revolves around Staz, an otaku-vampire who's obsessed about Japan. He also happens to be a territory boss in the world of demons. One day a girl named Yanagi Fuyumi, a female Japanese high-school girl ended up in Staz's territory. Staz being the one who's obsessed about Japan quickly took the advantage of talking toher. But during their conversation, someone is trying to capture Staz's territory. Staz succesfully defends his territory, but left Fuyumi unguarded. She died then turned into a ghost. Staz then made a promise to Fuyumi that he'll turn Fuyumi back to human. So that's basically what the plot is.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is undoubtly great, like I've been saying on most of my reviews; we rarely see ugly nowadays. And Blood Lad is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music. Opening theme was made by May'n which brought us a lot of good OST's. The ending wasn't half bad too. The series contains only 10 episodes, so they didn't bother changing the opening or ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters turned out pretty good too! Seiyuus who voiced some of the characters really suited them. They were perfect for them.\\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad is quite short if you ask me, 10 episodes weren't enough to fill me up. Well the good thing is that its quite longer than the translated manga on the net. They added a couple of scenes to the story in the anime though. It progressed a little bit different. I enjoyed Blood Lad, it was definitely a good watch for me. A little action and a comedic series once in a while is what I needed these days. I loved how they kept the fan service at minimal. Too much fanservice almost always destroy a lot of good series. But it the end, Blood Lad shows a lot of potential in terms of being a great action-packed series. There were quite a few scenes which shows Blood Lad has a chance of having romance in it. I just hope they make the second season better, and a little bit longer than 10 episodes. For me, Blood Lad was finally reaching its peak then it was ended on the tenth episode. I was truthfully disappointed how short the series came out. I gave Blood Lad an 8, maybe a 9 if it was longer. So have fun watching Staz's comedic acts!\\n\\n\r\n(Overall Score : 8/10)\\n",

            "content": "I was reluctant to watch Blood Lad at first. The story didn't sound very appealing, nor did the concept of vampires. Most of all the art seemed terrible. But, after finally giving it a chance I have to say I'm highly disappointed there were only 10 episodes; it was amazing.\r\nThe art seemed bad to me before starting, I was wrong about this. While it isn't as good as some higher budget anime, it's dealable. The only character who sometimes seemed to look odd in a few frames would be Staz(the main protagonist), though this was only the case for a few scenes and honestly wasn'tthat bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't amazing or anything, but it's not bad either. It has a few twists that are incredibly predictable, still there's a few things I didn't see coming. Often times a predictable twist will turn a different way last minute to reveal a surprise, something which was intriguing. However, the plot isn't entirely what I was watching it for. This series was one of the few to literally make me laugh out loud in certain situations. It's jokes are usually more adult, I wouldn't recommend this series for younger audiences. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, it's constantly entertaining. The characters are actually pretty well developed for only 10 episodes, all except(in my opinion) Wolf, so be prepared to not hear a lot of his back story unlike some of the other more main characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a really good, enjoyable little demon themed anime. Be warned though, the ending is a cliffhanger and rather abrupt.",

            "content": "WARNING: THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. I'LL TRY TO BE SUBTLE WITH THE SPOILERS BUT JUST FOR A WARNING IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE SHOW, DON'T READ THIS.\r\nWhen it comes to vampire anime's, it's dark, gloomy, depressing, and the characters are just blood sucking hotties. So when I watched Blood Lad, I expected myself to watch something similar to what I watched before in vampire anime's... but it surprised me when it didn't.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story is about a vampire named Staz who is an otaku when it comes to anime and manga. He rules the East Demon World but is somewhat lazy when it comes tothe part of \"ruling\". One day, a human girl appears in the Demon World and Staz instantly takes a liking to her, wanting to know the culture of the human world. One thing leads to another and the girl dies and becomes a ghost. Now it's up to Staz to try to resurrect her back to life.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to say the story is very refreshing for a vampire anime. However, the more episodes you watch, the more you kind of forget what the main goal of the story was. Each episode ends with them trying to get something which just keeps piling with more stuff along the way. With those things coming in, it might take forever in order for the main character to get back to his main goal.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was really good. It was bright, colorful, and just something nice to look at. The character art was good, but the background art made it have more lower points. For me, the background was just blurry blocks that could have shaped a building or some sort, and they just colored it with whatever neon color they wanted.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe opening had this upbeat rock music that I really liked. The OST was pretty good too but it didn't have that much significance for me to listen to it again. The voice acting was good but sometimes it just sounded a bit too forced for me. I guess it's just my way of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nOne of the lowest I have for this, the reason why I chose this is because the only noticeable character development I found was the main character himself. Otherwise than that, the other characters just kind of stayed the same as they were when we first saw them. I don't want to be that mean because the show was just 10 episodes so they couldn't bring out character development for all the other characters but still... just try and show a little of development some.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nDespite all my protests, I liked the show. It was very refreshing to find a different story line than all those other vampire anime's. But it was around the last episode that left a lot of questions unanswered. I don't want to say any other spoilers otherwise than that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Blood Lad is an anime that was fair enough and I could recommend to you guys if you want to watch a different vampire story!     \\n",

            "content": "Blood lad starts off by introducing us to a Staz, a vampire in the demon world that is entranced by the human world. He wears plain clothes and is basically an otaku. He\u2019s also a boss of a territory so he\u2019s something of a gang leader, though he isn\u2019t particularly interested in being one. He gets a call from his henchman Deku that a human girl was found in the territory. He is excited and the girl is brought to him. He is immediately entranced by her, wanting to suck her blood and ends up talking to her, asking her questions about the human world.Unfortunately, right after that Yanagi gets caught up in a fight between Staz and someone who\u2019s attacking his territory. Staz defeats his opponent but one of the monsters he sent out, ate Yanagi, who was left unprotected in Staz\u2019s room. Staz no longer has the same interest in her now that she is a ghost and he vows to resurrect her to get back the feeling he had before.\\n\\n\r\nA thing to know about Blood Lad before starting it, is that the story for the anime is incomplete. There are 10 episodes, and by the end of the last episode, we get what seems to be a precursor to a second season, though there isn\u2019t one. \\n\\n\r\nThe story that is there isn\u2019t too bad. The story slowly reveals new details of the characters instead of giving them all away at their introduction. For example, Staz is supposed to meet someone called Wolf at a point in the series and we are left wondering what type of person this is, how he relates to Staz, and whether or not he is the key to resurrecting Yanagi. We learn quickly the first two things and the latter as well, but to get to that point of actually resurrecting her, Staz has to go into more of these quests. The quests lead into each other and occasionally lead to battles. \\n\\n\r\nThe battles however are not that interesting and sometimes you can sense that the series is trying to make you feel some type of way but it feels like someone doing a judo throw without unbalancing you first, you just stand straight while the other person is trying to tug to no avail. An example of this is in a fight with Wolf that ends on a weird beat with some words between each other that seems strangely placed. It was supposed to show a darker, more serious side of Staz but it was too out of nowhere for me to really get into it. To explain further, it was like a much less believable version of what the anime Ruroni Kenshin does when contrasting Kenshin\u2019s normal carefree ways to his battousai moments. \tAdding to this fault in the action to create a certain mood, the fight scenes themselves were not aesthetically pleasing, the special moves and the choreographed fighting lacked that \u201ccool\u201d factor that you find in series where two swords clash or a person is losing but gets the upper hand.They tried to add some humor within the fights by sometimes adding parodies of other shows but they didn\u2019t always fit the mood and more critically, lacked originality or cleverness. I\u2019ve seen gags of Ashita no Joe and Dragon Ball Z before and this series did not add anything to what has been already done before. There is also not much use of character power ups during the series or if there is, it is brief and the characters go back to being somewhat the same after a fight or so.The fights just feel like filler to get to the next part of the story when it should really be one the things to look forward to.  The story progression is in itself not too bad, as details are revealed piece by piece and at a good pace, but how the story does this progression is not always very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in Blood Lad though not groundbreaking can have their moments where you can care for them or root for them but their developments can sometimes be abrupt. An example of this is when Yanagi starts to realize that she is no longer a human and gets into a little fight with Staz, the first she\u2019s done, because of her frustration. Staz responds, going back into his pseudo-shonen battousai persona. They could\u2019ve explored Yanagi just a little bit more instead of making it about Staz and ending it there. The show, does, to it\u2019s credit develop this part of Yanagi later on but in a bit more of a convoluted way that story wise makes for something more interesting but sacrifices some sentimental potential for Yanagi\u2019s character that was present in the moment Yanagi started questioning herself. As for Staz, his character though amusing at first, gets old very fast and by the end of the show I was under the impression that there wasn\u2019t too much there. He felt like one part of a trio villain crew, one that\u2019s super energetic and combative, one that\u2019s the leader and very quiet and powerful, and Staz, the one that fights the main hero\u2019s friends with his hands in his pockets and a bored expression. In trying to keep up Staz\u2019s personality that we were introduced in the first episode, Staz as a character becomes very shallow. The side characters like Wolf or Hydra, are also very meh. You can understand their motives but you don\u2019t really care too much to really get invested. Hydra has two clear motives that she spells out but both you are unclear as to why she cares so much and you won't have much incentive nor really be rewarded to try to find out. In spite of all the faults of these characters as characters, however, they are at times good for providing comic relief which other than the story progression is really what keeps the show moving. At the very least even when a gag failed or didn\u2019t hit that hard, I\u2019d still enjoy that the show was trying to have some fun.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a quick 10 episode series with a few laughs and an otaku themed MC, and some okay action, this show would probably fill that gap. But if you\u2019re looking for the next anime show that will hook you in to the point you binge it one night, I wouldn\u2019t go for this one. Mediocrity isn\u2019t necessarily bad and Blood Lad has an aesthetic that can make it mindless and easy to watch, after you\u2019ve watched something more \u201csophisticated\u201d  and serious like Aku no Hana, or Vampire Knight or Acca-13 (I\u2019m only mentioning these cause I was watching them in between or before watching Blood Lad).\\n\\n\r\n\t(Oh yeah, and the music and art were alright. Characters looked same-y and the music was forgettable.)",

I typically watch anime without reading the synopses beforehand, so I went into this one blind, just like all the rest.\r\nIt was a little jarring since I didn't know the story was about a vampire who lived in the demon world, but I came to love it. I am a little sad that the entire manga wasn't adapted into anime, but I suppose that gives me more of an incentive to read the rest, right?\r\nI found Staz to bea great, dynamic character with a lot of potential for growth and development, which is what I like to see in a main character. Wolf is absolutely precious, and I wish he'd gotten more screen time. Fuyumi is adorable, and I want to protect her with my life. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it's hard to say anything bad about Blood Lad. The only reason I've ranked it as an 8 is because it wasn't mind-blowing, but I would 100% read the manga and watch the anime again in the future.",

The rating should be higher in my opinion. It should be 8.00. Seriously this anime is a HIDDEN GEM today!!! I love the story, parody, characters, everything. The story is top notch. I have never seen a story like this. The comedic vibe is funny. The character development is great for me. The parody is awesome. I felt like watching 2 anime series in 1 anime. The action is also great complete with a comedy element. Every episodeis worth the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is one of my favorite anime character. He has funny personality. The side characters have enough screentime and they are also entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has only 10 episodes but it was a fun ride. Too bad it ended with a cliffhanger. Please make Season 2 of this anime ASAP!!! I believe everyone will love it! To those who haven't seen yet the anime, pls watch it. You won't regret.\\n\\n",

It was nice being able to watch through a series for once, rather than start a few episodes and get intimidated by the length. on the other hand, to get to 10 episodes, Blood Ladjust threw the concept of narrative into the air and shot it with a shotgun. Is it worth extoling a short length when the story so obviously needed extra time to flex its muscles?\\n\\n\r\nAside from the weird jumps forward in time that it does in between episodes, Blood Lad simply doesn't have an ending. It just stops. I'm not sure if it's because they ran out of money, or just because they didn't care, but either way it fails to conclude.",

            "content": "Blood Lad was a good show overall, there's only a few minor problems that I had with it. The fist of which is that, many times, the places they were in were completely void of people other than the main characters. It would've been nice if there were more extras in the background. The lack of people made it seem like the places they were in were desolate, even when they were in cities. Luckily, this problem was remedied towards the end. The other issue is that there's no way to tell how the different places they go to are connected. There was never anoverhead view or a map that pointed out all of the different locations. There are also a lot of isolated views. They never really show too much of the location that they are in, so it's hard to get a grasp of the locations.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a good story which really started to pick up towards the end of the show. It seems like there will be a second season. There's also some funny parts in each episode. I look forward to reading the manga and hopefully watching a second season if there is one.",

            "content": "I enjoyed Blood Lad, but that's mostly because the humor really suited my tastes. It seems to me that the anime is mostly to garner interest in the manga, which is fine I guess, but if you're looking for a stand alone story, look elsewhere. It doesn't really end conclusively. At all. I found that irritating, but overall I'm glad I watched Blood Lad. Other than that, my only criticisms are that it is too short (didn't really develop the story enough to do it justice) and that this is too much fan service (that is not the way breasts work, sorry). It's enjoyable ifyou're looking for something you don't need to invest a lot of time, thought, or emotional venture into.",

            "content": "It's a shame how vampires in our generation look awfully gayish. The overrated \"Twilight Saga\" has been crashing on earth with undoubtedly stupid characters that appears to be handsome and beautiful for some. In my case, I hate horribly attention-seeking vampires. I mean, where's the action? The great ride to fame and success? The creepy-looking and blood-sucking vampires? \r\nOn the other hand, an anime arrived with a rather awesome entrance... Here is Blood Lad. It is an anime which I started watching just now and finished it in only one day. SO how did a ten-episode anime caught the attention of a girl like me?Basically, I saw it airing in one of the channels of the television and I caught a glimpse of the first episode and naturally made me curious. This anime has no sparkling vampire bullshit and having boyfriends and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad has its extremes and ordinary spots but in the end, it had quite a long journey for me to get captivated to its story. Staz, an otaku vampire who loves the stuff in the human world occasionally met a human girl namely Fuyumi Yanagi who ended up being a ghost. With lots of mayhem and outrageous outcomes, Staz completely swore to Fuyumi that he will bring her back to life. The itinerary to get there is capricious to take because it changes from one character to another and another conflict arises in each episode. It leads to an absolute long way in order finally get the ending that we want. There are no fillers added and every scene seems adequate to the story line. Some romance can also be depicted from the story but it isn't the main idea of the plot so it isn't shojo-ish. Some famous japanese celebrities and anime characters (some are uncredited take Dragonball Z as an example) are being mentioned once in awhile. It isn't all that original considering its gloomy atmosphere and overly-mentioned type of characters but secrets will be revealed, a whole bunch of action scenes will appear, comedic acts and gags will also be expected and most of all, the never-ending \"deals\"of each characters that led to one place to the other which will make you watch every episode with your eyes open.\\n\\n\r\nBrain's Base is an animation studio which produced Durarara!, Baccano, Isshukan Friends, etc. Blood Lad had its outmost style of high quality and definition that I've seen before. It aired last 2013 so what do you expect? It's new, hip and attractive to the eyes. What made it different is that, gigantic letters keep floating or rather attacking on the screen which is very manga-like. It has the Durarara! essence that I've witnessed before. The yellow bright lines caught up to me and it quickly reminded me of Durarara! Anyway, the animation on the barbaric fighting scenes were amazing and phenominal. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was a bit undermined. I believe that it needs more improvement and it was one of my biggest concerns about the series. It didn't stand out and my option is that they should hire the musical scorer of Durarara!, Soul Eater or Death Note because all of those dark animes have ridiculously awesome soundtracks and background music. I can't even remember the tune of the OP and ED of Blood Lad. The voice actors did well somehow and not a single issue was made.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from demons and Halloween Characters, i can help but remember SE. However, Blood Lad has characters that were just fine. Some are annoying and nonchalant. Some are heroic, cool and likable and some are just plain stupid and trashy altogether. The characters have their strengths and weaknesses but it didn't bother me that much and they did not catch my whole attention. I like them when they are in the same scene but individually, they are just simple and not really that special. The antagonists look really good and powerful but the main character was just not compelling to me. I also hated that all women were big-busted but it never grabbed my attention so it was just a tame damage.\\n\\n\r\nIn Karneval, I liked watching the first episode because it had a mysterious way of telling a story and everything seems so vague but exciting until in the latter episodes, it became flat and boring but Blood Lad is different. It is one of those shows that may be pitchy and unfulfilling to watch at first but as soon as you get to the middle episodes, you will get hooked and attentive. It was the kind of anime that I'd almost given up at first but then as soon as I watch it, It had superior potential after all. The antics were mild at first but soon you will die of laughter after a few episodes. The battle scenes were just great and not too shabby. I just have to criticize the fan service which irritates me a lot but at least it isn't forced and it's nothing but a bland distraction. \\n\\n\r\nInclusively, I do believe that this 10-episode anime deserves a nine because other 12 episode shoujo animes were not my interests. This is a must watch series that will keep you waiting for the next episode to come up. I do want this anime to have a second season and I will wait for the manga to end awesome-ly.",

It has a spin on comedy a different approach that you don't see a lot of in anime, characters that have there own sense of humor that blend together to make it a surprisingly very funny show.\r\nI called it refreshing because although short it gives a lot of information not to much but enough and it doesn't drag out the episodes with useless fillers that makes it feel like it going on forever.\r\nIt also has character development actuallymakes you care about the characters. Action that is not overboard but still has plenty of epic moves in it. Magic that you want to learn more about. A good romance plot that isn't to obvious but you know kinda whats gonna happen.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in all if i had to sum up what i thought of this anime in one sentence it would be: \\n\\n\r\nBlood Lad is a very good anime, it doesn't leave you feeling like they could've done better or you just wasted my time with boring fillers and the spoiled the end with a crappy finish, no it has the right amount of everything action, romance, powers, comedy and characters.

The other episodes seem to have bits of comedy thrown in there at random places to make it seem more exciting.\r\nI did enjoy that Staz seems like a different vampire to what you normally wouldget in anime with some instances when you can relate back to him.

The friendship between two bros, vampire and wolf. Foreshadowedtotal spanking of the chicks by the guys. It was great. But just stop there.
