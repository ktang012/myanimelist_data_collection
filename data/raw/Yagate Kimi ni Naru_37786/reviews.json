            "content": "Bloom Into You is not a romance. Rather, it is a love story about self-realization. \r\nThe series follows the titular late bloomer, Yuu Koito, a girl who has never felt love before. Since she was young she has dreamed of falling in love, romanticizing the day when it would happen. Expecting to be swept off her feet, eventually. But that day has never come, even when someone confesses to her she feels nothing. This has kept her from fully connecting to her friends and peers, they are far more understanding of what they want romantically. She was alone until she met Tokou Nanami. A girlwho has also never experienced love, until she met Yuu. \\n\\n\r\nTo Yuu's surprise, Touko suddenly confesses to her, and while she does not reciprocate due to her inability to love, she allows Touko to be in love with her. The one condition Touko sets for Yuu is to never love her back. From here on, the tale of self-discovery begins, as each character learns from the other about who they are. At the start of the show Yuu seems like your typical blank slate protagonist devoid of the ability to love, but look further and you\u2019ll see her personality is surprisingly realistic. Yuu is the type of person who cares for others deeply but masks it beneath a veneer of logic and normalcy. She possesses many of the telltale signs of sexual repression, her loneliness and lack of romantic feelings are just a few examples. Throughout the show, we see her pushing through boundaries she would have previously avoided, gaining more control of her life, she reflects on who she is and gains a better understanding of her own identity. This is why labeling Bloom Into You as a romance would be only half true; while it features people in love, it is more complicated than that. Before Yuu can love she has to face the realization what she wants, who she is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth stating that Bloom Into You depicts homosexual youth more realistically than I have seen in any anime before. Highlighting even the most minuscule of details that only someone who has experienced firsthand can convey believably. For example, in the first episode, Yuu\u2019s father lets slide a casually homophobic comment about worrying that she isn\u2019t in a relationship with someone of the same sex. After this line comes, the director smash cuts to Yuu in dismay at what he said. The tone sharply changes from moment to moment like this on many occasions to great success because of the subtly to which it is executed. \\n\\n\r\nIn comparison to Yuu, Touko is rather different in that she knows exactly what she wants and would die before she relinquished her purpose. Touko wants to love Yuu because she can be vulnerable with her, she wants desperately for Yuu to always be there to comfort her. However, she can\u2019t stand the thought of being loved in return by Yuu because of her own insecurities. Throughout the series we see her personality pulled apart and analyzed thoroughly, she is rather basic upon first impression, but look further and there is far more to her than meets the eye. If Yuu were to love her, she would be conflicted, because in her mind she can\u2019t possibly be loved. It's an upsetting conflict that she endures, but incredibly effective in engaging anyone who has experienced similar insecurities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, these story beats are delivered with an impressive amount of grace and panache. The dialogue feels very natural, Yuu\u2019s interactions with her friends are realistic and believable. Most of all, the supporting characters are consistent. They don\u2019t have random lapses in their personalities, and if anything changes there\u2019s an explanation for it in their lives. For example, if a character is acting awkward towards the suggestion of seeing a romance movie, it\u2019s because they had their heart broken recently and needed a push to mention it to their friends. There's a layer of depth to everyone that is far greater than what is expected of not only yuri, but anime in general. \\n\\n\r\nThis is also the rare explicitly lesbian show that does not fetishize its characters at all. Touko is very clear about her romantic and physical attraction to Yuu; likewise, Yuu is very clear about her lack of ability to love. Both are treated like fully realized people instead of objects. In figuring out themselves and what they mean to eachother, they do run into a few issues. Nevertheless their relationship is still built on communication, consent, and respecting boundaries. They\u2019re a likable duo and it\u2019s easy to get invested in their development. When the first kiss happens non-consensually, it is apologized for immediately, then it never occurs again. The author very deftly avoids, as well as subverts, the Class-S tropes negatively associated with the yuri genre. \\n\\n\r\nClass-S usually refers to yuri that do not allow their characters to get into serious relationships, they are in high school and have time to play around before they get married to men when they graduate. The author of Bloom Into You has said on a few occasions that this is not a yuri, rather it is a story about girls and love. Understandably she wants to distance her story from negative connotations associated with the genre. Notably, this anime features a healthy adult lesbian relationship, showcasing that there is more to being homosexual and female outside of the scandalous high school melodrama. We also see a supporting character who faced the issue of her lesbian relationship being nullified under the pretense that 'it's just a phase', and from this, she develops into a wonderfully nuanced character. \\n\\n\r\nOn the production side, Bloom Into You is magnificent. Beautiful visual storytelling, the storyboards convey characters inner emotions in engaging ways, it is very visually interesting. There are occasional breathtaking moments of sakuga, but what impresses more is the director's keen eye for editing to clue us in onto how a character is feeling at any given moment. If emotions are obscured it is deliberately so, if they are shown then you have to take into account every little detail given to the audience. One of the best moments of visual storytelling in the first episode is when a rush of water divides Yuu from her friends; this shot perfectly conveys how her lack of understanding of herself divides her from the average teenager. Aside from just visual metaphors, how the story plays out is representative of the internal struggles Yuu and Touko face. The play that Touko desperately wants to enact is a tale of a woman without memories who needs to pick a desirable personality for herself, reflecting her insecurity and desire to better herself. \\n\\n\r\nPunctuating each emotional beat are melancholic piano keys loudly implying the turmoils each character is enduring, and each of them is developed consistently enough for the musical accompaniment to feel very deserved. This is contrasted with melodic orchestral pieces to match the upbeat tone of scenes when characters come together and express heartwarming joy. With a talented and experienced composer like Michiru Oshima producing the soundtrack, the show\u2019s audiovisual splendor blends together with its script wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Bloom Into You took me by surprise would be an understatement. At first, its unusually realistic characters blindsided me; Yuu and Touko are superbly nuanced people. They're lost in the dark trying to find their way through a first relationship just as real people in their situation would. The many relevant themes this series tackles are what give the cast such believability and relatability unlike any other anime in this genre; self-loathing, societal expectations, homophobia, and sexual repression to name a few. Each theme is delivered respectfully and with subtly. In the first few episodes, the pacing is quite slow, but always purposefully so, and once it gains speed it becomes enrapturing. \\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Bloom Into You is the best anime I watched from this season, perhaps even the year. It is a masterfully crafted, unforgettable experience that will leave an impact on me for years to come.",

            "content": "Love takes shape that the universe may never have a precise answer on. Can we all agree that human emotions can never be truly understood? What does it mean to be in love? Why do people fall for each other? In our world of imperfection, we will never know the truth to this question. Humans are imperfect and we were built that way in the eyes of our creator.\r\nThe art of anime adaptations is a fascinating subject that takes many forms. I\u2019m very open minded with just about any genre although when it comes to yuri and shoujo-ai, I\u2019m rather indifferent about it. Recent adaptationsof the shoujo-ai genre hardly made an impression on me such as Citrus or Netsuzou Trap. Both of those shows let me down big time with their aggressive stance on relationships. I wanted to see a softer side of the shoujo-ai genre without subscribing to sexual same gender relationships that relies on shock service. Thankfully, Yagate Kimi no Naru is the answer.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not too familiar with the community related to shoujo-ai works but it\u2019s clear that the manga has popularity. The series was launched in April 2015 from the Monthly Comic Dengeki Daioh and in the present, it has over 500k printing copies and ongoing. However, I was also curious about the anime adaptation after seeing the staff involved. Director Makoto Katou made a rather interesting impression back in 2015 when they directed a mystery light novel adaptation called \u201cBeautiful Bones: Sakurako\u2019s Investigation\u201d. While this series doesn\u2019t contain much mystery, it definitely made me wonder if it has a similar mystique. Indeed, watching Yagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom Into You) finally gave me a shoujo-ai that I desired.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, we meet Yuu Koito, a first-year high school student who has a love for shoujo manga. From her perspective, it\u2019s easy to see what love is on a fictional level. It isn\u2019t until a second-year student named Touko Nanami comes into her life that she really begin to experience what life and love is. Similar to Yuu, Touko also has trouble experiencing love although it\u2019s clear that her mind is set to understand it. As a student, she is very admirable for her dependable personality and someone the freshmen look up to. However, all this seems to be masking her insecurity. The truth is, Touko has many weaknesses underneath her cool persona. It\u2019s shown throughout the series that she feels loneliness due to her past and Yuu becomes the only person that she trusts in. On the other hand, Yuu seems to be more wary about love and wants to experience it. However, her view towards love is not as dedicated as Touko. She wants to experience love but often denies feelings of it. Yuu\u2019s personality is more the opposite of Touko\u2019s as she is indecisive at times, including her own future. So to say the least, how can these two develop a genuine relationship?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think the main draw of the show isn\u2019t to see if the main characters can get together as a couple. Rather, it\u2019s about how characters experience love and what love really means to them. Realistically, both characters views love in different ways although it\u2019s clear that they lack experience in it. Touko is the more obvious with her insecure personality where she often isn\u2019t sure what to do to make happy moments with Yuu. On the other hand, Yuu often believes what she experiences to be more of a fantasy than actual love. I guess part of that comes from reading all those shoujo manga although as the series progresses, she begins to grow out of her shell. The storytelling continues to test the two\u2019s relationship on many levels. It\u2019s a show that capitalizes on bringing in drama and thankfully, I can say that it accomplishes that very well. The drama sells with the character personalities, behaviors, dialogues, and realistic feelings. I\u2019m also more pleased to say that everything in the show felt very real. Characters behave like humans do especially for high school students of their age. It\u2019s a time period when young people want to get the best out of their lives and love is often a prominent part of growing up. To me, this show manages to capture the essence of character growing up while discovering what love is about.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Yuu and Touko are the most prominent characters, it\u2019s hard to take eyes off of some of the others. Sayaka Saeki is a good example as someone who used to attend an all-girls school and became a close friend with Touko. The two work together as part of the student council but it\u2019s very clear that Sayaka sees her more than a friend. Love is the easiest way to describe it. It\u2019s also easy to see why she falls for her too considering their similar personalities. Both Sayaka and Touko are hardworking individuals who are willing to help others. However, Sayaka is perhaps less outgoing compared to Touko and thus, not as easily as approachable. The series doesn\u2019t dedicate to their relationship but it\u2019s interesting to see Sayaka\u2019s vision of love. In essence, she hides her feelings and is not someone that\u2019s easy to read on the surface. This is a contrast to both Yuu and Touko as those two tends to say what\u2019s on their mind. On a lesser extent, we also get to see the relationship between Miyako and Riko which is shown to be very healthy in nature. Their relationship is relaxing and almost like a contrast to the drama that we see so often in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the shoujo-ai genre, I think it\u2019s pretty easy to recognize that pretty much all the main characters are lesbians in one way or another. Some are to a lesser but it\u2019s pretty clear from the start. What were you expecting though? The anime advertised itself as such with the same gender relationships so be prepared to subscribe to that from start to finish. But as a show with a lot of drama, I should say to watch this with a careful focus on the characters. Watch for what they say, how they behave, and their intentions. For me, I find the most complex character to be Yuu since her personality is often sarcastic and believes too much into fictional love. This is true especially in the beginning where it became hard to know what she really wants. The more I watched though, the more I came to accept Yuu for who she is and her quest to discover love. And that\u2019s what I find so entrancing about this show.\\n\\n\r\nIn perhaps a coincidental timeline, we also get Troyca as the studio. It's the same one that worked on Sakurako\u2019s Investigation with the exact same director. As my first impression, this anime managed look colorful and vibrant with its character designs. There\u2019s a feminine charm for the majority of the cast that really brings the elegance out of the characters. The emotional context are captured with the vivid details of body language and human expressions. The background visual quality is also stellar with a certain degree feeling of photorealism. Some of the scenes during the mid-season episodes like the ones with the bridge stands out the most. Last but not least, I would like to mention that character voice mannerism for the main cast is portrayed with supreme talent. Not only did I feel attached to their personalities, these characters also sounded like they belong in this anime from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAh, it\u2019s about damn time. I\u2019ve been indifferent about shoujo-ai shows for a good while but after seeing Yagate Kimi ni Naru, I may change my mind. This show managed to capture the expression of love in ways that exceed my expectations. It seized opportunities to recreate a sensational drama without stepping over the line. Keep your pants on because you\u2019re not going to get sexual shock content all over your face. What you get is a drama done right in the most entrancing way possible. It's almost perfect.",

            "content": "Yagate Kimi ni Naru is an anime that reminds us of the complexity of love. Several philosophers, artists, even you have tried to express that feeling to someone when you fall in love. A close person, a forgotten friend, call it what you want. Maybe someone declared us, and we did not know how to respond. Maybe we have failed, or we have managed to understand the meaning of love. No matter what happened in our life, those feelings are still present. This series uses that feeling, something that we cannot describe and creates a refreshing and pure plot that will fascinate you.\r\nOn the otherhand, some viewers may consider this series boring, absurd and ridiculous. If you do not like romance combined with slice of life, you will agree with them and this anime won't be for you.\\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\\n\r\nThe story is straightforward, and the relationship between the different characters is exquisitely well developed. We have two girls, Yuu and Touku. The first cannot experience the feeling of love. She may know the literal meaning, but she has never \"loved\" anyone and perhaps never will. The second is a perfect student, president of the school council who cannot accept being loved. All this leads her to reject any proposal of love or avoid any relationship with someone who shows this feeling towards her. The plot develops gradually when Yuu feels the need to reject a declaration of love. Since she cannot ask for help from her friends, she decides to ask Touku, who supports her and helps her reject the declaration. For some viewers, it could be unrealistic, a clich\u00e9, I call it destiny or love at first sight, Touku begins to love Yuu. At first, we can think that it will take advantage of Yuu's condition. However, this is the beginning of an innocent relationship in which both girls will try to understand the meaning of love and about themselves. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the plot is a combination of heart and self-definition,  slice of life and romance. The series uses school life to improve the relationship and create perfect moments where these characters can be together. In addition, it maintains simplicity and is pleasant. It does not need any strange exaggeration to ignite love like other series like Citrus with forced scenes to name one.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting factor is the setting. In general, yuri romance fails because it is set in an unrealistic place where almost the entire cast is lesbian. However, in the beginning, we can appreciate a diverse group of characters that keep the plot alive and realistic. Unfortunately, the plot tends to this unrealistic configuration in some parts, and that can be seen as negative. The author avoids any social consequences, and this could be interpreted as ridiculous by some spectators. Also, that's one of my reasons for not giving the series a perfect score because it's weird and gives you the impression that something is missing. Another reason, the series has an open ending and the most relevant part of the story is in the manga, and it may not be animated (I hope I'm wrong).\\n\\n\r\n--Characters\u2014\\n\\n\r\nI like the way how the characters evolve with the relationship. The story has two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nYuu Koito. She is an avid reader, cute, friendly and caring. For some reason, she cannot experience love, and she expects to learn about it with Touku. One interesting factor is the way how she can read Touku because this helps to brace the outcome. For me, she is in constant change because her doubts appear more often. Sadly, we cannot explore more of her development for that reason I invite you to read the manga.   \\n\\n\r\nTouku Nanami. She is a perfect girl for all the persons around her. However, she is a character full of fears and doubts. She hides that face from anyone, but Yuu can look inside her. She dislikes being loved because she hates herself, so she will reject anyone that show any affection towards her. For me, she is a very complex character but in the deep, she is the weakest one.  When she is with Yuu, she gets anxious and irradiates a beautiful feeling to the audience. \\n\\n\r\n--Art and Sound\u2014\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good. However, there are some angles where the character lost some proportion, and they will look a bit pointed. It is weird but does not occur too often. The camera dynamic and movement are excellent, they are smooth and fit the romantic moments. It makes your eyes focus in the details of the scene. Additionally, the animation uses a bright and vivid palette that is pleasant to the eye and makes the characters glow.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contributes with the atmosphere of the scenes and helps in the crucial moments.  The sound is elegant, soft and perfect. The OP is fantastic, and I love the rhythm and the connection with the lyrics. The ED is average, but it has a pleasant score combination.  \\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment\u2014\\n\\n\r\nI do not have too many negative complaints about the series. The plot is entertaining, and it arouses curiosity. The relationship between the characters is realistic, cute and pure. I love how Yuu tease her Senpai and how she reacts to that. The relationship is amusing and captivating. Sadly, the manga stills ongoing, so the series is not going to be completed. \\n\\n\r\nI certainly will recommend the series because it has a real emotional level with minor plot issues and acceptable pacing. However, if we compare the series with others from the same genre like Citrus or Aoi Hana, it will give you the impression that something is missing. The series is missing the charisma of a complete couple (two characters are needed in a relationship). In this show, Touku has that charisma, but Yuu lacks it because she cannot express the feeling of love and that gives the impression that the show is average or unfinished, but it is part of the plot concept. For that reason. I invite you to read the manga because you will see Yuu\u2019s progression and changes in the source.  \\n",

            "content": "Yagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom into You) started off showing all the markings of a beautiful love tale. It\u2019s very distinctive in how the romantic tones are handled between its characters. It\u2019s a quiet slow burn that follows the story of two girls who have yet to feel the excitement that should come with love. Mostly spent focusing on one of the main protagonists in Yuu Koito, who is a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d She feels lonely from all her romance-obsessed peers. While at first, she doesn\u2019t seem to understand them or her own feelings, she\u2019s already showing signs of being drawn to Touko Nanami\u2014a girl thatshe would enter an unexpected and unique relationship with.\\n\\n\r\nBloom into You is very much a character-driven story, with a steady pace that dedicates time to building up Yuu and Touko as characters first and having the romantic elements come after\u2014which may come to you as a breath of fresh air to many in this oversaturated genre of romance. Yuu doesn\u2019t know how it feels to love someone, more so, she has an unrealistic and romanticized view of love, inspired by music and shoujo manga\u2014It\u2019s supposed to be an overwhelming and perfect experience like you\u2019re walking on air that sends your heart aflutter. After being confessed to by a boy, she doesn\u2019t feel anything. It just isn't the way she's been led to believe it's \u201csupposed\u201d to be. This makes her come to the conclusion that she is incapable of falling in love with anyone. This all changes when she meets a member of the student council in Touko. The irony here is that Yuu wants to be close to her, that perhaps she can learn to love and reciprocate her feelings\u2014in contrast with Touko who finally has someone who is unable to love in which she finds comfort in. That someone where she can be herself around, free her from her lonely struggles. \\n\\n\r\nThe source of the underlying conflict is what makes it so unique. The characters\u2019 struggles are very complex but understandable and relatable in some cases. The plot is not driven by pure misunderstandings. Touko is the way she is because of a traumatic experience from her past and also, having to live up to the high expectations as a role model student, who is seemingly perfect in every way to the likes of her older sister Mio. This affects her on multiple fronts, she doesn\u2019t want Yuu to end up falling for her when she can\u2019t even love and accept herself. The characters feel very real and layered, everyone is fairly likeable and the story manages to tell the events from each one's point of view without compromising the development of the main duo. Bloom into You has very appreciable pacing, really exploring its themes; which are intriguing and fresh for a romance and taking its time without indulging in unnecessary melodrama. Everything feels like it's moving the plot forward, and this makes for a compelling story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the issues of the main ship and the main characters themselves remain interesting and reasonable, the supporting cast feels like real people as well as opposed to the character tropes we often see in all romance media. Meet Sayaka Saeki, she is very close friends with Touka and has secretly loved her for a long time now. Sayaka has been very loyal and supportive to the star pupil, she really wants to confess her love but she fears that it could ruin their current relationship. She too understands Touko\u2019s dilemma\u2019s and is rather jealous of the attention Yuu is getting from Touko. She feels as if Yuu has come in to take this connection away from her. This dynamic is very interesting as it feels like Sayaka would become sort of an antagonist but she is given a backstory, a moment of introspection and goals where she grows into one of the most likeable characters. Seiji Maki is a good contrast to Yuu as he is sort of similar in terms of being incapable of falling in love with the difference is that he comes across as an aromantic person, telling Yuu that he is not the same as her, as he can tell that Yuu actually loves Touko. Seiji tries to direct her on a path where she can realize that love comes in many shapes and forms, that it can also be unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I have seen, the art has remained faithful to Nio Nakatani\u2019s manga thanks to TROYCA. The studio did a remarkable job of the designs, animation, layouts, colours, score, script and layout. They all come together, perfectly in sync that it gently draws the audience into its sensory and emotional world. The appeal comes from the gorgeous background art and amazing use of camera angles and special effects, it\u2019s telling that director Makoto Katou has a great understanding of balancing the artistic and technical aspects of cinematography. You can see this is full effect in the series premiere as well as its OP. The visuals are breathtaking, filled to the brim of symbolic imagery, telling a story by the art and animation alone, complemented by a goosebumps-invoking song called \"Kimi ni Furete\u201d which is performed by Riko Azuna. \\n\\n\r\nThe very fore-fronted orchestral soundtrack comes from the genius mind of Michiru Oshima who composed for series such as Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, Fullmetal Alchemist, Little Witch Academia (TV), So Ra No Wo To and Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei. It becomes one with all of the themes and the aesthetics of Bloom into You and shows a great understanding of the use of the piano by balancing the harmonics with both bright and mellow tones which gives the show added emotional weight behind its impact moments and colour with a wide variety of harmonics to compliment the many emotions throughout. The visuals and music go just as well together as the pairing of Yuu and Touko, which is why the atmosphere of the show is so alluring.\\n\\n\r\nBloom into You perfectly balances all of the different moods, focusing on the heart of its drama which is Yuu's developing feelings, Touko\u2019s self-loathing and Sayaka\u2019s selflessness. And it does this without making things feel forced or implementing unnecessary fanservice. I appreciate that it\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows and that it takes time to show the good times along with the bad when in love, both joy and heartache. Every flower blooms at a different pace, sometimes we need time to realize and understand our own feelings, by carefully listening to our heart as well as learning to love and accept ourselves before we are able to love others. All of us blossom when we feel loved, and wither when we do not feel loved. This is the core message that Bloom into You presents that makes it one of the better romances in recent time.\\n",

I thinkthe best thing to consider of what exists currently is that it tones down a lot of melodrama that would generalize or dumb-down the significance of the relationship very well. The plot seems uneventful but it's time dedicated to emotionally build these characters, and that's where you really get the feel for Koito and Nanami. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a well-written, well-directed story in general, I would not hesitate to suggest this at all.

It handles the relationship development in quite a mature way, which is pretty good.\r\nStory:\r\nI find it hard to tell, if it is a Yuri-Anime or not, since the girls do not fall into a explicit category of lesbian or anything. They harbour a complex identity, with one afraid of falling in love and other cannot love anyone.\r\nThe other one (Yuu) feels like she identifies herself as asexual, though can't say uptill Ep 7.\r\nThe way their relation is handled is quite well, but requires a certain maturity tounderstand whats going on.

Never knew flowers could have an eerie feel associated with them.

            "content": "This show is average. Not bad, not good. Just average. That being said, I wasn\u2019t entertained watching this, not even from laughing at how bad it was, because it wasn\u2019t bad. It was just average. Despite what most people think, being average isn\u2019t a terrible thing, so as a little disclaimer, I am not saying everything about this show sucks for everyone who might take this review badly. This is just my opinion, that being said, these are my reasons:\r\nThe show is very clearly, a romance genre. The key to any good romance media is the relationship: nothing else matters that much. My problem withthe show is that it doesn\u2019t try to make the relationships between our main characters all that interesting. An issue with many yuri or yaoi animes are that they use the idea that they are in a homosexual relationship to hide the fact that there is no real substance or development; they are too lazy to create anything interesting about the relationship besides the fact that they\u2019re lesbians. The setting isn\u2019t the issue either as there are a ton of romance anime that do well in mundane settings (and even if a romance media is set in a more unconventional and/or radical setting- the relationships itself isn\u2019t taken over by the setting) because romance genres aren\u2019t really supposed to be about exterior factors that govern the story's universe per say, rather a device to tell a love story. My point being, the environment or exterior factors shouldn\u2019t be the most important part overshadowing the characters, but should be used as an effective agent in portraying a relationship. However, Bloom Into You makes this mistake repeatedly throughout its course as boring subplots distract us from the main focus of the anime, the relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSo why was the relationship so uninteresting? Or, at least why did I subjectively find it bland? Well, it has to do with the romance development/buildup and characterization. A great romance anime that does this very well is Kimi Ni Todoke. There are certainly a lot of cute romance scenes in Bloom Into You, but it isn\u2019t memorable or as effective as they could be. This is because there is no real buildup to the romance scenes or context, (for God\u2019s sake one of the main characters doesn\u2019t even reciprocate the same feelings) which makes the scenes unsatisfying and coming out of nowhere. There is no longing, no real angst that make the romance scenes worth while in this anime. Kimi Ni Todoke, my aforementioned example, takes the time to show longing, reciprocation of feelings as well as showing who each of the characters are: this is what makes trivial scenes of even the characters smiling at each other enjoyable and satisfying- overall making it an effective romance medium. Bloom Into You doesn\u2019t do this very well either. Even in supposed-to-be emotional scenes, I fail to sympathize with any of the characters, and I\u2019m a really emotional person, so it says a lot! There is no real character in dialogue, visuals or voice acting. It feels completely bland and lifeless, a very frustrating issue because the anime is centered around our characters and their relationship with each-other. There is just genuinely no substance in dialogue either which makes it very hard to emotionally relate with the last-minute backstory. Just overall making the characters less likable and therefore the romance/ their relationships less interesting and engaging.\\n\\n\r\nA very important note I\u2019d like to mention is the trend in a lot of animes that I\u2019d like to call The Aesthetic Effect. The Aesthetic Effect is used in animes with \u201cpretty\u201d visuals, stories, music and concepts to be used as a facade to it\u2019s mediocre nature. How vague the show is and the inoffensive factors of this anime make it desirable and appealing to a lot of the general audience. I think not only is this anime extremely bland, but also quite offensive at times by using lesbians as a token to justify dislikable behaviour to say the least of the main character Nanami forcefully putting herself upon the clearly uninterested Yuu. Not to be THAT person, but if a male character did things Nanami did to Yuu, it would be seen as extremely creepy. I found these scenes very unsightly and uncomfortable, which is the least thing you want for a romantic scene in a cute anime. To wrap things up, it is very clear this anime was made by people who see lesbians as an easy token key to attract audiences without adding real substance. Bloom Into You is just vague, pretty, attractive concepts jumbled into an unprofessional mess with the name of aesthetically pleasing romance. I will never understand why this anime is so overrated and put on a pedestal for being some sort of groundbreaking anime as it is just plain out boring with not really anything new to offer. Do yourself a favor and don\u2019t watch this anime, it\u2019s just a waste of time and it will leave you with nothing. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - boring and mediocre, uses gay tokenism to hide behind it\u2019s flaws. \\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR at the bottom.\r\nI'm not quite sure how to say exactly what YagaKimi is to me. There's so much to say about its portrayal of a unique relationship, how it explores the concept of love and what it makes me feel to watch it as it progresses. If I had to sum it into one word YagaKimi is 'interesting'.\r\nStory - 10\r\nThe story of YagaKimi is about someone who has never fallen in love before, Yuu, having a 'more than friends, less than lovers' kind of relationship with her senpai, Nanami and how misconceptions about love shape that relationship. It is a rather slow burn andyou could complain about nothing really happening but, that is one of the strengths of YagaKimi, after the first episode there is a gradual build-up of emotions that slowly but surely endear you to the characters, thoroughly immerse you into their mindsets until you feel you know them better than they know themselves and never wastes a moment of time, constantly adding or expanding on details. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strength of YagaKimi is the maturity in which it handles its themes and its refusal to have cheap drama or adhere to cliches. You never get the impression the impression that anything in this isn't genuine. Any drama that exists comes from the natural progression of events and the reasonable response given the personalities. No drama overstays its welcome and is often resolved in the episode it appears in when the characters talk about the problems. There are plenty of ways Nakatani Nio could have extended the drama infinitely or gone over the top like many of her contemporaries but, she refuses. A non-spoiler example is an indirect kiss that is only noticed by Nanami and that she only has a mild reaction to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nRomances, particularly shoujo romance, has always held a disconnect for me; an often insurmountable hurdle in the way they present love. They often present it, as Yuu perceives it should be, an overwhelming feeling of happiness just being around a person, that I never understood. This results in the anime having to convince me that this feeling is genuine.\\n\\n\r\nYagaKimi overcomes this hurdle by having its main character being in that same situation of longing for that feeling but not being able to grasp it that makes for an instantly relatable character that you get invested in growing as a person as the story goes on.\\n\\n\r\nNanami, on the other hand, becomes one of the most emotionally complex characters in romance anime and seeing her various layers peeled back and explored is truly where my 'interest' in YagaKimi stems from. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal stance on side characters is too ignore them until they're relevant and let them not waste space or make them interesting. YagaKimi follows the former, the side characters are interesting enough that I'm not bored during the short time that they're the focus while adding little bits of detail to the overall message of the story. Though none of them really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nYagaKimi was a decently drawn manga with a penchant for symbolism, visual storytelling and interesting composition. The anime has managed to bring some of the less expressive parts of the manga to life and has so far translated the panels beautifully into animation. Troyca has done an outstanding job with the visuals, making the best looking anime this season. Although other anime is technically better looking, YagaKimi uses its visuals in the best way.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nEvery piece of music used compliments the scene that it plays under as music should, though nothing about the OST stands out. The OP and ED aren't to my taste, but neither is most Japanese music I've listened to so I can't judge them fairly.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is on point, perfectly representing the characters and really selling their emotions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I really enjoyed YagaKimi. It is definitely the best shoujo-ai I've seen and among the best romances I've read (all my other favourite romances haven't been adopted yet). The way all the points mentioned above work together to create an anime that I can only call a masterpiece. Watching the anime has made me notice lots of subtle details I missed in the manga, causing me to re-read and gain a better appreciation for it and rewatching the episodes has been rewarding in all the extra subtleties that animation can give.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10\\n\r\nYagaKimi is an interesting take on an interesting relationship dynamic with mature handling of its themes and a refusal to add cheap melodrama or cliches. It has relatable and emotionally complex characters that are voiced well and animated beautifully. The soundtrack adds to the experience without standing out and the visual storytelling is the best this season. It is definitely worth a watch.\\n",

            "content": "Like a delicate flower, Bloom Into You acts upon its namesake, as the seed of the slept-on dark horse blossoms into one of the most charming shows to blindside me this year. I\u2019m glad, for had I not stumbled upon the glowing reception for this treat, it may have never swept me off my feet. From its mostly charming depictions of lesbian love to its authentic showcasing of friendship, each interaction is filled to the brim with charm and care. Said charm and care also show in a majority of the revelations which make this surprisingly relatable and whimsical cast come to life even morethan one could imagine. The revelation for Maki and subplot for Koyomi might be my personal favorites of the show, each bolstering integral portions of the show\u2019s three overarching plotlines. Seeing them intertwine, how each colorful character bounces off them, and how Yuu evolves from them, is simply heartwarming. This show may be repetitive and melodramatic in places, but the monologues and forced wind blowing aren\u2019t enough to smear the beauty on display here.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of display, Makoto Katou\u2019s directing is a major selling point. While it occasionally feels forced like with the focus on scenery in emotional moments, we more often get the most luscious visualizations of each characters\u2019 headspace, along with some mesmerizing and communicative shots that can be hung on a wall. These are the scenes where Makoto and his team at TROYCA shine. \\n\\n\r\nAdding onto the visual splendor of this show, the lovely art style and facial expressions translated from the manga do well to accentuate the tender yet lively nature of the characters and their interactions. The fashionable school uniforms and other equally elegant wardrobes only compliment this even further, and the female uniforms look particularly wonderful. While there are certainly flat moments and sparse bits of unsightly CGI, the show rarely fails to remain as pretty as its females.\\n\\n\r\nTo add to this beauty one last time, there\u2019s the delicate OST Michiru Oshima composed. Several of the emotional tracks do well to complement each scene, adding to the heartfelt and loving nature of the show. My personal favorite example of this is the insert track from episode 9: \u201cRise\u201d by Riko Azuna, as it is one of my favorite insert tracks of the year. Nothing embodies the pleasant nature of the show more than this one track, not even the fun ending theme by the main leads\u2019 VAs, or the opening theme by the same artist. \"Hectopascal\u201d and \"Kimi ni Furete\u201d respectively make for good songs in their own right despite the questionable techno in the former and the questionable vocals in the latter, so there\u2019s nary an issue to be had, even here.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s a word that encapsulates this delicate beauty, it would be \u201cendearing\u201d. The banter and interactions feel so authentic and lifelike that amidst the lampooning and exhibition of shoujo tropes lies a surprisingly wholesome and equally elegant tale of lesbian romance. For every moment of repetitious interactions and monologue, there\u2019s an impactful revelation, beautiful interaction, or heartwarming moment to counterbalance. There may be lulls and missteps, but this beauty has enough elegance and charm for me to brush that all aside. She\u2019s wonderful, ain\u2019t she?\\n\\n\r\nWritten and Edited by: CodeBlazeFate\\n\r\nProofread by: Peregrine",

            "content": "I expected this one to be the best and cutest lesbian romance shojo ai series from this season, but the other 2 have been much more fun to watch.\r\nThe other main character here is some sort of ideal girl, student council president, getting confessed by boys (and girls) all around, super kind and polite. However, how she is presented in the series makes her just seem empty and distant. Her entire personality pretty much ends with her way of being so damn nice. \r\nThe story is advanced from the POV of Yuu, our real main character, and she really isn't much better. Kohai to mrs.president, looking up to her like she is the real senpai. Other traits include being kinda weak and awkward at times, pondering over every little thing that happens. That's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue has also been pretty dreadful. All they do is talk about love confessions and how to turn down boys in the most polite way possible. The way it is presented makes it seem like the girls and the story writer are so hard trying to not get anyone's feelings hurt or in any way offended that it is simply too much. It's almost disgusting. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I don't really even care about what is going on with the story anymore since the characters have been such a huge letdown and uninteresting that whatever happens, it won't mean anything to me. I guess they are a good match to each others at least, considering both of them are boring and uninteresting. I will, however, say that the story surely is not making this thing any better. The pacing is just ridiculous and the romance development doesn't make any sense. It's contradicting against what our characters say and so fake / unbelievable that this thing is starting to be like air to me. If the series had managed to be good even for a second, I would claim this was an insult towards the girl love genre, but unfortunately this thing is so bland that it doesn't manage to even be that. As much as I disliked Citrus, at least the series had its moments. I conclude this series is terrible because it is making me see other shows I strongly disliked in more positive light.",

            "content": "I'm absolutely perplexed and bewildered by the general consensus on this anime, so I would like to provide my two cents, because there's not a single review I can agree with.\r\nArt/Sound:\r\nLet's get the subjective criteria out of the way first. Art is good, character designs are pleasant to look at, and backgrounds are of high quality aswell. As for the soundtrack, the piano compositions that play at certain scenes are very nice, however I can't say the same about neither OP nor ED, I disliked them both, I'm not going to say that they are bad or anything such, it's just not the kind ofmusic I enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters/Plot:\\n\r\nThe juicy part. What unfolds in this show is a dysfunctional relationship between a person that's mentally disturbed (Touko) and a person that's flawed on the fundamental level, because she is incapable of feeling love and empathy (Yuu). People claim they see a very mellow and realistic relationship between two girls, but I personally fail to see that.\\n\\n\r\n There's a lot of opinions that Touko has a genuine affection towards Yuu, but I think that people are mistaking an indulgence for affection. How can you feel genuine affection and love for someone, if you are incapable of loving yourself? She even states outright that she doesn't want Yuu to love or hate her back, and only wants to indulge herself in Yuu's kindness, as that puts her distressed self at ease, a dubious concept at best, since how can a person to whom love and empathy are alien, unknown emotions, can be kind, is beyond me. \\n\r\nTouko also quite frequently acts in a mentally disturbed and creepy manner, looking at her family photo and reassuring herself that she'll be exactly as her sister was in her eyes. Because, apparently, if you're a shy and meek child, instead of self-betterment, a much superior choice would be to become a literal copy of your older sister, and then grapple with mental and stress repercussions of your decisions. Not to mention that she low-key contemplates suicide a couple times, once at the crosswalk at the train tracks, and another in the final episode, where she's standing at the train station paltform and takes a step forward, while the train is about to pass the afformentioned station.\\n\r\nAs I stated earlier, Yuu is flawed on a fundamental level, since she cannot feel love and empathy, yet somehow renowned for her kindness, sure, whatever. In the relationship with Touko, to me personally, she comes off as a Stockholm Syndrom victim, because I cannot sum up a person that puts up with someone who indulges themselves in her, forces her to kiss them, even though she's clearly not in a mood for it, explicitly tells her to not have an affection of any kind towards them, in any other way. The only solace, is that at the end of final episode she's finally had enough of it, as she says: \"It's time for us to change trains, senpai\".\\n\r\nThe rest of cast is inconsequential, as they usually have about 5 minutes of screen time, over 12 episodes, total, or are there to fulfill a single role. The only one I will mention, is Maki-kun, a creepy self-admitted voyer, who doesn't want to be in any relationship himself, but rather be a spectator to the relationships of others, that he finds interesting/intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nPersonally, I'm revolted by relationship of this kind, I won't elaborate on it here further, as if you're reading this, it's clear as to why I'm displeased. There's nothing else I can add to this. When autumn chart was just released, I dismissed this anime, as I assumed that it will be like just about anything with similiar tags, only to be asked by my friend to join him, cause he saw potential. Now that it ended, he's dissapointed in it, though not as much as I am.",

            "content": "Bloom Into You is an embodiment of pleasantness, constructing a wholesome narrative about finding oneself and what lies ahead. This series is best described as a slice-of-life with romance as a primary narrative. While the setting is somewhat like Citrus in terms of character archetypes, Bloom Into You approaches storytelling much differently than most romance stories. The show is far less about dramatic tension between the characters, and instead focuses on evaluating their relationships with one another, whether it\u2019s affection, ambivalence, admiration, or animosity. The story takes form as a series of conventional moments and activities in which characters interact with one another in apractical, level-headed manner. Bloom Into You has a notorious aptitude for presenting these characters in such a way in which they are acting upon their own accord, rather than bending to the will of the narrative. The daily life of Yuu Koito is followed by us as we witness the changes in her everyday routine as well as her own views, watching everything blossom and mature as nature takes its course.\\n\\n\r\nThe melancholic tone that pervades much of Bloom Into You comes from conflicts within the characters\u2019 own selves, but rarely between characters. Yuu struggles to feel love and ponders about her future, Touko is lonesome and fixated on her duties, and Sayaka is jealous and keeps her feelings bottled within her. These are character arcs that rarely end up in dramatic confrontations, and rather are pursued by their own accord. The cast maintains a positive rapport throughout much of the story, largely shielded from dramatic complications that would negatively affect their relationships. Hostility between characters either occurs very rarely or is short-lived. Viewers who want to steer clear of serious drama will feel right at home with Bloom Into You. But those looking for drama will be somewhat dissatisfied by this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nEven as someone who has a strong bias for dramatic, emotionally driven narratives such as Octave, Citrus, and Aoi Hana, all of which are about lesbian romance as well, I can certainly say Bloom Into You has plenty going for it either way. The characters have just enough personality to give life to these situations. They emote, interject, pout, and elicit various other responses true to their character. Even the most mundane of character interactions feel very alive, and due to how likeable everyone is, this really emulates the pleasure of genuine socialization between good friends. The plot itself is largely unaffected by anyone other than Touko, and the cast succumbs to this as they wind up in various moments of recreation, discourse, and determination. In way, the plot is the cast itself.\\n\\n\r\nYuu is a very endearing character to follow in how her internal feelings slowly mature and develop as she interacts more with Touko and ponders over her feelings about her. Her attitude ranges from curious, to longing, to content, to frustrated. Her development, as with everything else in Bloom Into You, is taken slowly, but is done with nuance and purpose.\\n\\n\r\nTouko is unfortunately a less engaging character, and dare I even say a missed opportunity. Her conflict is very sensical, but her background isn\u2019t expounded enough to really make her dilemma feel genuine. Conceptually, she is a sympathetic character. Making decisions that only affect how people see you with no benefit to the self is unhealthy, and Yuu is both wise and respectable in trying to draw somebody away from this line of thinking. So this works well on paper, but the problem is this: Touko doesn\u2019t appear to be suffering nearly as much as the story wants us to believe. Loneliness and self-deceit come with symptoms, and the only apparent aftermath of this is her attraction to Yuu, who holds nothing against the true self which Touko hides from everyone else. This along with being timid and somewhat pushy, are really the only traits of her that we see that aren\u2019t of the \u2018perfect\u2019 self she puts on around others. The difference between these two versions of Touko isn\u2019t evident enough for me to be convinced that she\u2019s so drastically different than what she appears to be. Additionally, we hardly ever see her truly distressed about her whole charade, or just how negatively it affects her. Any sort of behavior she displays around Yuu, apart from romantic attraction, isn\u2019t symptomatic of being under pressure or constant stress.\\n\\n\r\nThe most obvious comparison to Touko might as well be Mei Aihara from Citrus, who shows obvious signs of stress and emotional depravity as she operates in a harsh upbringing with little to no free will. She shuts herself off from people, shows signs of anguish, and even has her own health at risk due to severe stress. Mei feels like an actual person whose misguided efforts affect her physically and emotionally, and thus is more convincing as someone in need of consultation and support. Am I saying that Touko should be written the same way as Mei? Of course not. In Citrus, Mei\u2019s circumstances were much harsher than Touko\u2019s, and thus would have a more damaging effect. But what Touko is going through would surely be taxing in a similar way. As it stands, Touko isn\u2019t characterized to the extent to where I actually worry about her, or believe that the charade she puts on is as damaging to herself as Yuu suspects. And thus, my emotional connection with Touko is limited.\\n\\n\r\nEven if Touko isn\u2019t as emotionally captivating as I\u2019d like her to be, the nature of the relationship between her and Yuu is what sells the experience. The time they spent with each other is sublime, with Touko being pushy at times while timid at others, and Yuu being cheeky and somewhat playful, as well as being occasionally snide in response to Touko\u2019s mannerisms. The dynamic between them makes for what I consider the best character moments in the entire series. Their interactions can be comedic, heartfelt, or introspective, and succeeds in all these. Furthermore, that one exchange between them in episode 6 might as well be a series highlight, and those who have watched the show will know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThis pairing also has a depressing nature to it, thanks to Touko\u2019s pessimistic view of love. Touko has essentially shackled Yuu into remaining in a state where if she were to develop romantic feelings for Touko, then Touko would no longer want to be in this relationship. It\u2019s especially disheartening to see a character you really like be confined in such a way out of her own volition, with the feeling that she may never live the dream she wanted for so long.\\n\\n\r\nAs worthwhile as all these characters generally are to watch, Bloom Into You really doesn\u2019t have all that much going for it in the way of depth. The character exploration is there, and the themes about love are quite engaging, but with the exception of Yuu, the personalities aren\u2019t exactly complex, as they\u2019re quite limited in traits. What makes the experience so worthwhile is watching these personalities cross roads with one another. The characters of Bloom Into You are not what I would call complex or even deep, but their development and general traits are woven into the narrative with such nuance and at a steady pace to where it all feels very authentic and wholesome. Each personality is a piece of a larger whole, working like gears to give function to a wholly pleasant and mesmerizing experience.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the audio/visual side of the show, I feel the need to be blunt here: the anime adaptation of Bloom Into You is a sheer blessing to the eyes as well as the ears; so much so that I consider this show to be an example of how manga adaptations should be done. The backgrounds are tremendously well-crafted, with detail sprawling over each object. Nearly everything is given a texture, lighting is used appropriately, and the result is a jaw-dropping collection of scenery which rivals that of Studio WIT. In this department, TROYCA has put in an effort that I cannot sing enough praise for.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, detailed scenery is just one part of what makes great shot composition in an animated product. And luckily, TROYCA manages to construct these shots with excellent color choices. The artstyle of the original manga is already a visual treat, and here it\u2019s been translated into animated form flawlessly. The show possesses a palette mostly comprised of soft colors with varying hues, perfectly capturing the style of the original manga. The colors are also used with enough restriction to where shots aren\u2019t cluttered. With all the detail put into the backgrounds, rarely does it ever look as though it was overcompensating to the point where colors are drowned out.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, along with these smart decisions in presentation, there are times when subtlety is completely discarded to communicate a point to the viewers. One such example is in the first episode, where Yuu\u2019s feeling of indifference is evoked with water gushing into the room and submerging her, then displaying her to be located far away from her deskmates. There are also other scenes like this, which project some abstract images to portray the thoughts of the characters, in a manner that feels hamfisted and rather obnoxious. This sort of thing is common in quite a lot of anime, but it\u2019s especially disappointing for a show like Bloom Into You to follow this same trend, as it\u2019s a show that generally excels in doing the opposite. Bloom Into You has various moments of directing that are subtle and evoke a sense of authenticity, so it's particularly jarring when stuff like metaphorical water flooding an entire classroom leaves such a blemish on this aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo even without much narrative complexity, Bloom Into You displays illustrious writing skill accompanied with equally awe-inspiring presentation. Everything falls into place creating an experience unlikely to be forgotten by me or anyone else in search of a very solid and wholesome romance story between girls, as well as a tale of self-realization.",

            "content": "I dropped this show because I stopped believing maybe there's something interesting that I'm missing and is coming up. It was pretty hollow and empty.\r\nFrom what I can see, people who like this show are people who looked for lighthearted entertainment. I looked for an interesting story that would teach me to understand something I didn't understand before, or share insights to things I didn't feel/think of before, but I found none here. This doesn't mean it has to be incredibley psychological - I found that in Idolish7 or Anohana for example. This one doesn't match to them.\r\nThere are pretty irregular personalities and relationships hereI suppose, which is good, but I don't think we had a chance to understand them in any deep level - I feel like we're only shown these on a surface level, their actions don't make sense to me. We don't see why is the connection like it is and where does each character feel like they stand, we just get a couple of dry reasons so we're like (making up an example not from this story) \"uh huh so she's crying because she was abandoned as a child\", they don't feel like something I'd encounter so I would understand it on my own with no need for the anime to show me how it feels, and they also don't get explored a little and I don't see stuff that would help me get a grasp of what these reasons feel like. It's dry, you're getting information but you finish an episode and you don't feel an emotional impact because surface level drama that does't make that much sense to you is all you saw. I don't come to understand why a character acts this way, why a character feels this way, I just come to generally know the listed reason the author told me earlier and enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you might think maybe it was shown and I just didn't get it, and maybe it is so, but I know I don't tend to miss stuff like that, so just try watching it and keep an eye out for that. I'd drop it pretty quickly and look for other good shows. If you'd like an interesting, incredibley insightful and smart LGBT manga, I recommend Shimanami Tasogare.\\n\r\ni If you want a lighthearted anime to ease your mind, I'd pick one that is meant for that, like Squid Girl or Yuru Camp. I feel like watching this is kind of a waste of your time in comparison to other works that are out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is actually beautiful, the op and ed songs are interesting and I kept noticing the beautiful background music through the anime. Kind of like Violet Evergarden's maybe, soft melodies that feel rich to me as far as I can tell. The tracks also kick in very unnoticabely and they don't take shame in silence and no track when it fits - which means a lot to me and was apparent in Idolish7 too, which is from Troyca as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual art for the backgrounds is incredibly pretty, there is no slack in the visual metaphors and they were very good in my opinion, both visually and in their meaning and presentation. If only they had actual depth to resemble thoguh.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like that's about all I can say prety much. This left me feeling hollow, I don't see what's in here to like over other shows.",

            "content": "The Shoujo Ai genre has seen it's fair share of ups and downs, and has been a letdown in recent times (We're looking at you Citrus), so when this show dropped in this season, I was very flawed at how I understood the taboo that is the Shoujo Ai aspect, but yet this show managed to do an outstanding justice to the genre, and (at this time) is one of (if not the best) shows due to its maturity and how it defines and breaks the convention that has been done before (e.g. moe-fied Yuru Yuri series) and teaches a whole new lesson altogether.\r\nYagate Kimini Naru, or Bloom Into You, tells the story of Yuu Koito and Touko Nanami, two individuals clasping for love in the most unusual way. Yuu, having grown up and loves reading shoujo manga, she feels the slightest (if not none) feeling of confessions from the opposite sex. Enter the high school age, and the other party (Touko) also gets the same treatment as Yuu, and immediately rejects the exact same feelings without hesitation. Having never both fallen in (true) love before, the tale of how Yuu and Touko manages to control and share their desires for each other; clear up misunderstands and all that stuff; is an entirely new territory to them. Although the lovey-dovey moments are a slow-but-painful process, the ever-folding drama is what makes the process special not just for the main duo, but the supporting cast as well (which is the Student Council), helping both Yuu and Touko in accidental taboo moments (Maki discovering that Yuu is in love with Touko, while the Sayaka-Touko-Yuu love triangle is present (but thankfully not told) and isn't the crux and problem (unlike Citrus)), discovering what's best and how to support each other. Not to mention that Saeki Sayaka, having come off from the same girls' school as Touko, has the same rivaled feelings when Touko always gives special attention to Yuu, so much that she doesn't let go, but understands her troubles and whatnot, really giving the edge to understand and not to conquer, that's a very bold decision to further drive her character into holding Touko close to her heart but not wanting to impede on her path.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, everything about this series is so well done, the writing doesn't feel tacked on and it's mostly ingenious genuity that really pushes every character (be it main or supporting) into simple or complex conflict that raises doubts and questions about each other's true intentions and whatnot. Brilliant work to the writing staff.\\n\\n\r\nTROYCA's art and animation is simply unrivaled. Although it is a detracting from their usual work (the Re:Creators style), they don't stop there. The beautiful art and the gripping animation are both works of wonder to draw people into the world that is both sightseeing and emotional-driving, that once you try to take your sights away even for just a moment, you're missing out on something special. Another brilliance of a work here to capture the gaze of the audience, and I have to say, this is a special moment in the world where imagination works wonders.\\n\\n\r\nEven more brilliant, is the sweet dope-fresh music. Most particularly, Michiru Oshima's composure of music. The beautiful, fantastic OP by Riko Azuna is really the icing on the cake, one to listen to on repeat, as is with the beautiful and subtle emotional tellings of the trio (Yuu, Touko and Sayaka) as they attempt to mask their true feelings for one another through the lush artwork present and the timely animations that just intensify the emotions all of us have to go through, even in forbidden land. The sweet ED by the main duo Yuu and Touko is OK at best, but not one to slouch either, as they try to walk the fine line through the relationship that has already been established.\\n\\n\r\nIt's about time we get an absolute masterpiece of the Shoujo Ai genre, and we have reached the pinnacle (or is it?). This is a show not to be skipped, even if the Shoujo Ai tag brings displeasure or disdain to your romance list.",

            "content": "Eventually, I will become you, or Bloom Into You, has met all of my expectations and holds all of the fundamentals of a top tier romance anime. Who should watch Yagate Kimi ni Naru? Anyone looking for a deep investment in a beautiful well thought out Shojou-ai story. Covering this more below.\r\nStory: 8/10  \r\nThis is very well done here, the episodes seemlessly fit together and do not drag in the slightest. The narrative itself is a bit fast, and a bit complex, which is okay. You will be jumping from scene to scene wondering, wait - how did they get here? As well assome unexplained settings, such as Yuu's home being in a bookstore. Slight deduction for pacing too quick in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNo complaints here, the art is flawless and encaptures the cute, \"special\" feel of young love. The art is easy on the eyes, and the nice colors are consistent throughout each episode. Very realistic art style. A very unique one as well, from the scenery, all the way down to the character's noses. Yagate Kimi ni Naru is at art style you won't find elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 \\n\r\nNailed it here as well, the sound is outstanding and very innocent, but uplifing. The sound matches the tone and overall atmosphere throughout each scene and episode. Never is it out of place. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nArguably the selling point of the series, i'm glad to say the characters here really bring it. Yuu and Touko. Our supporting characters are strong as well, notably Yuu's parents and her older sister. The personalities of Yagate Kimi ni Naru, are unique and really sell the story. Yuu and Touko's intense situations give you an \"in the moment\" feeling. Also, why are there so many characters? A lot of them look alike and you may not catch their name. Point deduction for craming in too many characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom Into You) is a timeless series that i would recommend to any romance/drama fan, especially shoujo-ai (same sex) anime fans. While I may not be adding a new song to my playlist, this series has a place in my heart, just as I expected it too. The tension between Yuu and Touko is one that is hopefully relatable, and may make you emotional during some scenes. The story, art, sound, and characters flow together like a river. If you appreciate high production value, you will be very satisfied with Yagate Kimi ni Naru. Thanks TROYCA for a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What exactly is love? Is it a feeling of trying to protect someone you treasure, or is it a feeling of gratitude for someone you deeply care about? There\u2019s no exact answer for it, but everyone has their own ideal of how love is, and with this idea adding a sprinkle of yuri, may I introduce you, Yagate Kimi Ni Naru (Bloom Into You), a show focusing on our two female protagonist, Koito Yuu and Nanami Touko, and their journey onto finding what love, truly means. \r\nStory / Character -9.5- \r\nWithin the first few minutes you get greeted by our first protagonist, Koito Yuu, whomis heavily obsessed in shoujo manga, and looks forward to having a heart pumping relationship, in which feels seemingly distant and unreachable for Yuu. Now being a high school student, Yuu was chosen to help out with the Student Council election. While trying to find out where the club is, she stumbled upon our next protagonist, Nanami Touko whom was being confessed by another male student. Having seen Touko rejecting the student, with the \u2018excuse\u2019 of not wanting to go out with anyone just yet, Yuu decides to consult her as Yuu herself too, is being bothered by the fact that her best friend confessed to her, and she didn\u2019t feel the \u2018spark\u2019 she initially thought she might have. Thinking how Nanami senpai might\u2019ve help her settle her problems, with the turn of the tide, Nanami suddenly confesses to Yuu, leaving Yuu in absolute confusion. What comes next are lovely moments that will surely make you go \u2018awww\u2019. \\n\r\nCharacter wise, unlike what you see in most romance anime, the dominant one usually is the older ones, or the male lead (in this case it\u2019s irrelevant). However, Touko albeit being a third year, is constantly showing her weaknesses, lowering her guard when she is around with Yuu, whom is younger than her. Even though as affectionate as Touko is, Yuu has convinced herself that she wouldn\u2019t fall in love with Touko (or is it (\u0360\u2256 \u035c\u0296\u0360\u2256) and in return for Touko\u2019s feelings, Yuu tends to be more kind towards her, and allows her to cling onto her even though Yuu doesn\u2019t plan on returning her feelings. Other character such as Saeki senpai and the teacher adds the depth for the story, making the story not necessarily just about Yuri at its core, but also people finding the true meaning to their life. Quite a simple plot to understand, everything you\u2019d expect from a shoujo ai but with a touch of uniqueness to the dialogues and monologues.\\n\\n\r\nArt -9- \\n\r\nThis is a great adaptation from the original manga series, characters look on point, animations are very fluid. One unexpected part that totally blew me away was the use of camera angles, some scenes were literally breathed life into them, and some made the scene extraordinarily dream-like. All in all, Troyca has done an exceptional job on adapting this manga into anime, and I think it\u2019s very commendable for making this anime such an enjoyable one.\\n\\n\r\nSound -8.5-\\n\r\nMost of the voice acting are done pretty well with some rare occasions where I actually found them to be slightly underwhelming, but not average enough to take a point off from the overall voice acting, so nothing to complain about here. The opening and ending are also quite good, I personally prefer the ending more than the opening, as it has a catchier vibe to it, and is sang by the two main protagonists. Soundtrack wise is sort of a mixed feeling (mostly good), what you usually here are ambient sound, like literally life-like ambient sounds, not many fancy soundtracks are going on throughout this anime, but they convey the feelings very well and tend to fit in the scenes. I personally just wished there was more to it, other than mostly being ambient. \\n\\n\r\nOverall -9-\\n\r\nBloom into you is a must watch if you\u2019re a big fan of the romance genre, taking the slower, gradual progression for the plot makes you more invested into the characters, and I think that is a great way to catch the audience\u2019s heart. Even though the plot is rather simple, the way it was executed through good directing and writing really makes this anime all the better. The conclusion for the anime isn't necessary what I thought it would've been (in relation to the manga that is), but was still a very wholesome nonetheless. If you want something that can hit you home, look no further and hope onto the feel train, and let the anime Bloom Into You. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Love is completely overexposed and misrepresented in media. For an anime, being a piece of media itself, to make that a plot point, they need to address love as realistically as possible. Bloom into you, pulls that off with a beautiful honesty. \r\nYuu is struggling with the fact that she's never experienced love. Her only understanding of love is what she gleans from romance manga. She then meets the student counsel president, Touko, who immediately falls for Yuu. Because this was nothing like the romance manga, Yuu doesn't really know how to handle this, and eventually agrees to go along with it, more or lessbecause why not? Mind you, Yuu is very upfront on the status of her feelings for Touko throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the entire anime is very honest with the relationships they depict. The fact that this is a homosexual relationship is mentioned, but is not really considered a big deal to anyone. That is refreshing, and quite frankly honest for this day and age. \\n\\n\r\nThe hiccups our couple do hit in their relationship are more centered around their own faults, misunderstandings, and misconceptions. you know, like every relationship out there. The problems they have are very real ones, and one of the messages one should glean from this anime is to be with someone else, you have to learn to be okay with yourself. Look no further than the cafe owner for an example of that. \\n\\n\r\nAnother relationship issue our couple has is that their feeling evolve for one another at different rates, and for different reasons. Touko falls hard an fast for Yuu, almost in an instant, while Yuu is no where never that level of emotional involvement throughout most of the show. This to, is commonplace in real relationships. \\n\\n\r\nAs their relationship grows, so do the young ladies in it. How these two lead one another to better understandings of themselves and those around them is lovely to see. \\n\\n\r\nIf I could describe the show in one word, it would be honest. Unlike Yuu's romance manga, the relationships in this anime are not magical, or perfect. They are grounded in reality, and that makes it far more beautiful than the vast majority of other romance stories out there.  \\n",

            "content": "Beautiful. This was my first impression for this show.\r\nThe genre what depicting love of between women. So-called Shoujo Ai and Yuri. I've ever not watched those shows. It's fresh mood for me.\r\nWhen someone love the person, it is important to understand the person's feeling. But this show is a little different case.\r\nPeople have complicated state are conscious of each other. Not easy thing. In that respect, this show is succeed.\r\nRelationship began by the course of nature. It changes gradually, and fall in love with each other. The moment is irresistible. Just like true love.\r\nThat isn't to say their relationship develop Romance. The balance is verygood. They're so adorable. At the same time, they're so sad.\\n\r\nYou can know this point when you watched this show. Subject by love of men and women. Like that straight shows are many.\\n\r\nI praise to challenge lesbianism amongst all of them. In addition, perfection is different order of magnitude. Excellent quality.\\n\r\nShoujo Ai and Yuri also a sort of entertainment though, they tend to avoid from people. Because of these shows seldom exist.\\n\r\nI don't say it, but I read a certain homosexual love manga in the past. This manga is nothing short of brilliant. This manga is similar to this show.\\n\r\nThere is no miracle with love. Skill and spirit build up love. Acquire them, and move forward in the future. As a result, that is inquire against yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Let's talk about this show. Story and characters are depicting by affable touches from beginning to end. Awkward depiction don't exist at all.\\n\r\nProtagonist of this show. Yuu Koito. A certain event made her start to dating with Touko Nanami. They're main characters of this show.\\n\r\nAnyways, their characteristic is so good. Yuu is a robust girl. Nanami is a girl who pampered with Yuu, despite student council first\u2010class member.\\n\r\nBut Nanami has hidden circumstances. Thereby change has occurred with their relationship. She's basically the owner of sorrow heart.\\n\r\nIn some way, She is existence as opposed to Yuu. They exchange of words in school, club activities, private. Yes, various situation.\\n\r\nPeculiar Shoujo Ai scenes included among them. Doing with them made sprout special consciousness. And they understand each other's mentality.\\n\r\nIn this way, this show's plot is unique. IMO, it's draw a line between other Romance shows. The reason is that character development is very nice thoroughly.\\n\r\nScript also surprisingly well-written every episode. I've watched shows of Jukki Hanada. This show also polite.\\n\r\nWhole interval and tempo of dialogues. These are blameless thanks to manga author's supervision.\\n\r\nYuu and Nanami are sensitive with person feelings because they don't experience real love. It's dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are very gorgeous. Disturbance is less and stable. Background and color also well-made, and shape elegant vibes.\\n\r\nCharacter design is personally quite likable. TBH, it's cute! So cute! Yuu's design is awesome. Nanami also beauty.\\n\r\nOP and ED are stunning with animation and music. I cried OP for a period of time. What are those meaning of language of flowers?\\n\r\nThis show's OP is Riko Azuna's debut single. Strong and delicate voice is fitting this show. I can expect her future activities.\\n\r\nHer tie-up song plays a certain episode as insert song. The timing are fitting well. Include splendid depiction, you'll have urge to experienced Attraction.\\n\r\nED is character song by Yuu and Nanami. Although catchy and bright melody, profound lyrics are fitting this show so much. OP also same.\\n\r\nVoice acting also perfect. Voice is fitting each characters. Especially Sayaka's voice actor performed complex and real feeling against Nanami well.\\n\\n\r\nI sympathize with Maki's assertion. But I'm not pleased his thought. Of course, This is his way of showing kindness to Yuu though, I'm not interested in him.\\n\\n\r\nIf I express this show besides I love this show so much, this show is so wonderful. All in all, this show is truly high level. Definitely one of my favorites.\\n\r\nEveryone loves someone. Efforts will not always awarded. The same may be said of Anime and Drama etc. It never everything goes well.\\n\r\nThat's why everyone face each other while doing trial and error. This is make or break. Everything is up to you. It is important to define own purpose.\\n\r\nThis show is delightful work what generated by destiny. Your rating is variation whether or not you can relate to Yuu and Nanami. Worth watching.\\n\r\nI seldom meet show what loving by author, staff, voice actors, and fans. I appreciate them. YagaKimi FTW!",

At first, I thought its just going to be another day of girls kissing and flirting with each other. How am I so wrong. Our protagonist Yuu is asexual, which makes it hard for our lovely couple to become one fully. However, Nanami is okay with it, and Yuu plays along being a yuri lover with no romantic feelings whatsoever, yet. The complication then escalates to how Nanami wants Yuu to continue to hate her and not love her at all,be by her side and let her love you. See the complicated relationship, but this aspect is what makes this show stands out. \\n\\n\r\nBut what attracts me about this show is the fantastic animation and the beautifully written story. Demonstrating the hardship being in a yuri relationship. Not to mention the yuri moments which stands out for me the most. But Nanami experience is what makes this show spark as she dealt with many hardships to meet her ideals and Yuu played the critical role of being there for her. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening music is the icing on the cake, loved the lyrics and the fantastic melody being turned into beautiful music to listen too. Also captures the beauty of our lovely couple. \\n\\n\r\nFor the whole series review, check out the link from above.",

            "content": "Bloom Into You is not a romance. Rather, it is a love story about self-realization. \r\nThe series follows the titular late bloomer, Yuu Koito, a girl who has never felt love before. Since she was young she has dreamed of falling in love, romanticizing the day when it would happen. Expecting to be swept off her feet, eventually. But that day has never come, even when someone confesses to her she feels nothing. This has kept her from fully connecting to her friends and peers, they are far more understanding of what they want romantically. She was alone until she met Tokou Nanami. A girlwho has also never experienced love, until she met Yuu. \\n\\n\r\nTo Yuu's surprise, Touko suddenly confesses to her, and while she does not reciprocate due to her inability to love, she allows Touko to be in love with her. The one condition Touko sets for Yuu is to never love her back. From here on, the tale of self-discovery begins, as each character learns from the other about who they are. At the start of the show Yuu seems like your typical blank slate protagonist devoid of the ability to love, but look further and you\u2019ll see her personality is surprisingly realistic. Yuu is the type of person who cares for others deeply but masks it beneath a veneer of logic and normalcy. She possesses many of the telltale signs of sexual repression, her loneliness and lack of romantic feelings are just a few examples. Throughout the show, we see her pushing through boundaries she would have previously avoided, gaining more control of her life, she reflects on who she is and gains a better understanding of her own identity. This is why labeling Bloom Into You as a romance would be only half true; while it features people in love, it is more complicated than that. Before Yuu can love she has to face the realization what she wants, who she is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth stating that Bloom Into You depicts homosexual youth more realistically than I have seen in any anime before. Highlighting even the most minuscule of details that only someone who has experienced firsthand can convey believably. For example, in the first episode, Yuu\u2019s father lets slide a casually homophobic comment about worrying that she isn\u2019t in a relationship with someone of the same sex. After this line comes, the director smash cuts to Yuu in dismay at what he said. The tone sharply changes from moment to moment like this on many occasions to great success because of the subtly to which it is executed. \\n\\n\r\nIn comparison to Yuu, Touko is rather different in that she knows exactly what she wants and would die before she relinquished her purpose. Touko wants to love Yuu because she can be vulnerable with her, she wants desperately for Yuu to always be there to comfort her. However, she can\u2019t stand the thought of being loved in return by Yuu because of her own insecurities. Throughout the series we see her personality pulled apart and analyzed thoroughly, she is rather basic upon first impression, but look further and there is far more to her than meets the eye. If Yuu were to love her, she would be conflicted, because in her mind she can\u2019t possibly be loved. It's an upsetting conflict that she endures, but incredibly effective in engaging anyone who has experienced similar insecurities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, these story beats are delivered with an impressive amount of grace and panache. The dialogue feels very natural, Yuu\u2019s interactions with her friends are realistic and believable. Most of all, the supporting characters are consistent. They don\u2019t have random lapses in their personalities, and if anything changes there\u2019s an explanation for it in their lives. For example, if a character is acting awkward towards the suggestion of seeing a romance movie, it\u2019s because they had their heart broken recently and needed a push to mention it to their friends. There's a layer of depth to everyone that is far greater than what is expected of not only yuri, but anime in general. \\n\\n\r\nThis is also the rare explicitly lesbian show that does not fetishize its characters at all. Touko is very clear about her romantic and physical attraction to Yuu; likewise, Yuu is very clear about her lack of ability to love. Both are treated like fully realized people instead of objects. In figuring out themselves and what they mean to eachother, they do run into a few issues. Nevertheless their relationship is still built on communication, consent, and respecting boundaries. They\u2019re a likable duo and it\u2019s easy to get invested in their development. When the first kiss happens non-consensually, it is apologized for immediately, then it never occurs again. The author very deftly avoids, as well as subverts, the Class-S tropes negatively associated with the yuri genre. \\n\\n\r\nClass-S usually refers to yuri that do not allow their characters to get into serious relationships, they are in high school and have time to play around before they get married to men when they graduate. The author of Bloom Into You has said on a few occasions that this is not a yuri, rather it is a story about girls and love. Understandably she wants to distance her story from negative connotations associated with the genre. Notably, this anime features a healthy adult lesbian relationship, showcasing that there is more to being homosexual and female outside of the scandalous high school melodrama. We also see a supporting character who faced the issue of her lesbian relationship being nullified under the pretense that 'it's just a phase', and from this, she develops into a wonderfully nuanced character. \\n\\n\r\nOn the production side, Bloom Into You is magnificent. Beautiful visual storytelling, the storyboards convey characters inner emotions in engaging ways, it is very visually interesting. There are occasional breathtaking moments of sakuga, but what impresses more is the director's keen eye for editing to clue us in onto how a character is feeling at any given moment. If emotions are obscured it is deliberately so, if they are shown then you have to take into account every little detail given to the audience. One of the best moments of visual storytelling in the first episode is when a rush of water divides Yuu from her friends; this shot perfectly conveys how her lack of understanding of herself divides her from the average teenager. Aside from just visual metaphors, how the story plays out is representative of the internal struggles Yuu and Touko face. The play that Touko desperately wants to enact is a tale of a woman without memories who needs to pick a desirable personality for herself, reflecting her insecurity and desire to better herself. \\n\\n\r\nPunctuating each emotional beat are melancholic piano keys loudly implying the turmoils each character is enduring, and each of them is developed consistently enough for the musical accompaniment to feel very deserved. This is contrasted with melodic orchestral pieces to match the upbeat tone of scenes when characters come together and express heartwarming joy. With a talented and experienced composer like Michiru Oshima producing the soundtrack, the show\u2019s audiovisual splendor blends together with its script wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Bloom Into You took me by surprise would be an understatement. At first, its unusually realistic characters blindsided me; Yuu and Touko are superbly nuanced people. They're lost in the dark trying to find their way through a first relationship just as real people in their situation would. The many relevant themes this series tackles are what give the cast such believability and relatability unlike any other anime in this genre; self-loathing, societal expectations, homophobia, and sexual repression to name a few. Each theme is delivered respectfully and with subtly. In the first few episodes, the pacing is quite slow, but always purposefully so, and once it gains speed it becomes enrapturing. \\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Bloom Into You is the best anime I watched from this season, perhaps even the year. It is a masterfully crafted, unforgettable experience that will leave an impact on me for years to come.",

            "content": "Love takes shape that the universe may never have a precise answer on. Can we all agree that human emotions can never be truly understood? What does it mean to be in love? Why do people fall for each other? In our world of imperfection, we will never know the truth to this question. Humans are imperfect and we were built that way in the eyes of our creator.\r\nThe art of anime adaptations is a fascinating subject that takes many forms. I\u2019m very open minded with just about any genre although when it comes to yuri and shoujo-ai, I\u2019m rather indifferent about it. Recent adaptationsof the shoujo-ai genre hardly made an impression on me such as Citrus or Netsuzou Trap. Both of those shows let me down big time with their aggressive stance on relationships. I wanted to see a softer side of the shoujo-ai genre without subscribing to sexual same gender relationships that relies on shock service. Thankfully, Yagate Kimi no Naru is the answer.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not too familiar with the community related to shoujo-ai works but it\u2019s clear that the manga has popularity. The series was launched in April 2015 from the Monthly Comic Dengeki Daioh and in the present, it has over 500k printing copies and ongoing. However, I was also curious about the anime adaptation after seeing the staff involved. Director Makoto Katou made a rather interesting impression back in 2015 when they directed a mystery light novel adaptation called \u201cBeautiful Bones: Sakurako\u2019s Investigation\u201d. While this series doesn\u2019t contain much mystery, it definitely made me wonder if it has a similar mystique. Indeed, watching Yagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom Into You) finally gave me a shoujo-ai that I desired.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, we meet Yuu Koito, a first-year high school student who has a love for shoujo manga. From her perspective, it\u2019s easy to see what love is on a fictional level. It isn\u2019t until a second-year student named Touko Nanami comes into her life that she really begin to experience what life and love is. Similar to Yuu, Touko also has trouble experiencing love although it\u2019s clear that her mind is set to understand it. As a student, she is very admirable for her dependable personality and someone the freshmen look up to. However, all this seems to be masking her insecurity. The truth is, Touko has many weaknesses underneath her cool persona. It\u2019s shown throughout the series that she feels loneliness due to her past and Yuu becomes the only person that she trusts in. On the other hand, Yuu seems to be more wary about love and wants to experience it. However, her view towards love is not as dedicated as Touko. She wants to experience love but often denies feelings of it. Yuu\u2019s personality is more the opposite of Touko\u2019s as she is indecisive at times, including her own future. So to say the least, how can these two develop a genuine relationship?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think the main draw of the show isn\u2019t to see if the main characters can get together as a couple. Rather, it\u2019s about how characters experience love and what love really means to them. Realistically, both characters views love in different ways although it\u2019s clear that they lack experience in it. Touko is the more obvious with her insecure personality where she often isn\u2019t sure what to do to make happy moments with Yuu. On the other hand, Yuu often believes what she experiences to be more of a fantasy than actual love. I guess part of that comes from reading all those shoujo manga although as the series progresses, she begins to grow out of her shell. The storytelling continues to test the two\u2019s relationship on many levels. It\u2019s a show that capitalizes on bringing in drama and thankfully, I can say that it accomplishes that very well. The drama sells with the character personalities, behaviors, dialogues, and realistic feelings. I\u2019m also more pleased to say that everything in the show felt very real. Characters behave like humans do especially for high school students of their age. It\u2019s a time period when young people want to get the best out of their lives and love is often a prominent part of growing up. To me, this show manages to capture the essence of character growing up while discovering what love is about.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Yuu and Touko are the most prominent characters, it\u2019s hard to take eyes off of some of the others. Sayaka Saeki is a good example as someone who used to attend an all-girls school and became a close friend with Touko. The two work together as part of the student council but it\u2019s very clear that Sayaka sees her more than a friend. Love is the easiest way to describe it. It\u2019s also easy to see why she falls for her too considering their similar personalities. Both Sayaka and Touko are hardworking individuals who are willing to help others. However, Sayaka is perhaps less outgoing compared to Touko and thus, not as easily as approachable. The series doesn\u2019t dedicate to their relationship but it\u2019s interesting to see Sayaka\u2019s vision of love. In essence, she hides her feelings and is not someone that\u2019s easy to read on the surface. This is a contrast to both Yuu and Touko as those two tends to say what\u2019s on their mind. On a lesser extent, we also get to see the relationship between Miyako and Riko which is shown to be very healthy in nature. Their relationship is relaxing and almost like a contrast to the drama that we see so often in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the shoujo-ai genre, I think it\u2019s pretty easy to recognize that pretty much all the main characters are lesbians in one way or another. Some are to a lesser but it\u2019s pretty clear from the start. What were you expecting though? The anime advertised itself as such with the same gender relationships so be prepared to subscribe to that from start to finish. But as a show with a lot of drama, I should say to watch this with a careful focus on the characters. Watch for what they say, how they behave, and their intentions. For me, I find the most complex character to be Yuu since her personality is often sarcastic and believes too much into fictional love. This is true especially in the beginning where it became hard to know what she really wants. The more I watched though, the more I came to accept Yuu for who she is and her quest to discover love. And that\u2019s what I find so entrancing about this show.\\n\\n\r\nIn perhaps a coincidental timeline, we also get Troyca as the studio. It's the same one that worked on Sakurako\u2019s Investigation with the exact same director. As my first impression, this anime managed look colorful and vibrant with its character designs. There\u2019s a feminine charm for the majority of the cast that really brings the elegance out of the characters. The emotional context are captured with the vivid details of body language and human expressions. The background visual quality is also stellar with a certain degree feeling of photorealism. Some of the scenes during the mid-season episodes like the ones with the bridge stands out the most. Last but not least, I would like to mention that character voice mannerism for the main cast is portrayed with supreme talent. Not only did I feel attached to their personalities, these characters also sounded like they belong in this anime from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAh, it\u2019s about damn time. I\u2019ve been indifferent about shoujo-ai shows for a good while but after seeing Yagate Kimi ni Naru, I may change my mind. This show managed to capture the expression of love in ways that exceed my expectations. It seized opportunities to recreate a sensational drama without stepping over the line. Keep your pants on because you\u2019re not going to get sexual shock content all over your face. What you get is a drama done right in the most entrancing way possible. It's almost perfect.",

            "content": "Yagate Kimi ni Naru is an anime that reminds us of the complexity of love. Several philosophers, artists, even you have tried to express that feeling to someone when you fall in love. A close person, a forgotten friend, call it what you want. Maybe someone declared us, and we did not know how to respond. Maybe we have failed, or we have managed to understand the meaning of love. No matter what happened in our life, those feelings are still present. This series uses that feeling, something that we cannot describe and creates a refreshing and pure plot that will fascinate you.\r\nOn the otherhand, some viewers may consider this series boring, absurd and ridiculous. If you do not like romance combined with slice of life, you will agree with them and this anime won't be for you.\\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\\n\r\nThe story is straightforward, and the relationship between the different characters is exquisitely well developed. We have two girls, Yuu and Touku. The first cannot experience the feeling of love. She may know the literal meaning, but she has never \"loved\" anyone and perhaps never will. The second is a perfect student, president of the school council who cannot accept being loved. All this leads her to reject any proposal of love or avoid any relationship with someone who shows this feeling towards her. The plot develops gradually when Yuu feels the need to reject a declaration of love. Since she cannot ask for help from her friends, she decides to ask Touku, who supports her and helps her reject the declaration. For some viewers, it could be unrealistic, a clich\u00e9, I call it destiny or love at first sight, Touku begins to love Yuu. At first, we can think that it will take advantage of Yuu's condition. However, this is the beginning of an innocent relationship in which both girls will try to understand the meaning of love and about themselves. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the plot is a combination of heart and self-definition,  slice of life and romance. The series uses school life to improve the relationship and create perfect moments where these characters can be together. In addition, it maintains simplicity and is pleasant. It does not need any strange exaggeration to ignite love like other series like Citrus with forced scenes to name one.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting factor is the setting. In general, yuri romance fails because it is set in an unrealistic place where almost the entire cast is lesbian. However, in the beginning, we can appreciate a diverse group of characters that keep the plot alive and realistic. Unfortunately, the plot tends to this unrealistic configuration in some parts, and that can be seen as negative. The author avoids any social consequences, and this could be interpreted as ridiculous by some spectators. Also, that's one of my reasons for not giving the series a perfect score because it's weird and gives you the impression that something is missing. Another reason, the series has an open ending and the most relevant part of the story is in the manga, and it may not be animated (I hope I'm wrong).\\n\\n\r\n--Characters\u2014\\n\\n\r\nI like the way how the characters evolve with the relationship. The story has two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nYuu Koito. She is an avid reader, cute, friendly and caring. For some reason, she cannot experience love, and she expects to learn about it with Touku. One interesting factor is the way how she can read Touku because this helps to brace the outcome. For me, she is in constant change because her doubts appear more often. Sadly, we cannot explore more of her development for that reason I invite you to read the manga.   \\n\\n\r\nTouku Nanami. She is a perfect girl for all the persons around her. However, she is a character full of fears and doubts. She hides that face from anyone, but Yuu can look inside her. She dislikes being loved because she hates herself, so she will reject anyone that show any affection towards her. For me, she is a very complex character but in the deep, she is the weakest one.  When she is with Yuu, she gets anxious and irradiates a beautiful feeling to the audience. \\n\\n\r\n--Art and Sound\u2014\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good. However, there are some angles where the character lost some proportion, and they will look a bit pointed. It is weird but does not occur too often. The camera dynamic and movement are excellent, they are smooth and fit the romantic moments. It makes your eyes focus in the details of the scene. Additionally, the animation uses a bright and vivid palette that is pleasant to the eye and makes the characters glow.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contributes with the atmosphere of the scenes and helps in the crucial moments.  The sound is elegant, soft and perfect. The OP is fantastic, and I love the rhythm and the connection with the lyrics. The ED is average, but it has a pleasant score combination.  \\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment\u2014\\n\\n\r\nI do not have too many negative complaints about the series. The plot is entertaining, and it arouses curiosity. The relationship between the characters is realistic, cute and pure. I love how Yuu tease her Senpai and how she reacts to that. The relationship is amusing and captivating. Sadly, the manga stills ongoing, so the series is not going to be completed. \\n\\n\r\nI certainly will recommend the series because it has a real emotional level with minor plot issues and acceptable pacing. However, if we compare the series with others from the same genre like Citrus or Aoi Hana, it will give you the impression that something is missing. The series is missing the charisma of a complete couple (two characters are needed in a relationship). In this show, Touku has that charisma, but Yuu lacks it because she cannot express the feeling of love and that gives the impression that the show is average or unfinished, but it is part of the plot concept. For that reason. I invite you to read the manga because you will see Yuu\u2019s progression and changes in the source.  \\n",

            "content": "Yagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom into You) started off showing all the markings of a beautiful love tale. It\u2019s very distinctive in how the romantic tones are handled between its characters. It\u2019s a quiet slow burn that follows the story of two girls who have yet to feel the excitement that should come with love. Mostly spent focusing on one of the main protagonists in Yuu Koito, who is a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d She feels lonely from all her romance-obsessed peers. While at first, she doesn\u2019t seem to understand them or her own feelings, she\u2019s already showing signs of being drawn to Touko Nanami\u2014a girl thatshe would enter an unexpected and unique relationship with.\\n\\n\r\nBloom into You is very much a character-driven story, with a steady pace that dedicates time to building up Yuu and Touko as characters first and having the romantic elements come after\u2014which may come to you as a breath of fresh air to many in this oversaturated genre of romance. Yuu doesn\u2019t know how it feels to love someone, more so, she has an unrealistic and romanticized view of love, inspired by music and shoujo manga\u2014It\u2019s supposed to be an overwhelming and perfect experience like you\u2019re walking on air that sends your heart aflutter. After being confessed to by a boy, she doesn\u2019t feel anything. It just isn't the way she's been led to believe it's \u201csupposed\u201d to be. This makes her come to the conclusion that she is incapable of falling in love with anyone. This all changes when she meets a member of the student council in Touko. The irony here is that Yuu wants to be close to her, that perhaps she can learn to love and reciprocate her feelings\u2014in contrast with Touko who finally has someone who is unable to love in which she finds comfort in. That someone where she can be herself around, free her from her lonely struggles. \\n\\n\r\nThe source of the underlying conflict is what makes it so unique. The characters\u2019 struggles are very complex but understandable and relatable in some cases. The plot is not driven by pure misunderstandings. Touko is the way she is because of a traumatic experience from her past and also, having to live up to the high expectations as a role model student, who is seemingly perfect in every way to the likes of her older sister Mio. This affects her on multiple fronts, she doesn\u2019t want Yuu to end up falling for her when she can\u2019t even love and accept herself. The characters feel very real and layered, everyone is fairly likeable and the story manages to tell the events from each one's point of view without compromising the development of the main duo. Bloom into You has very appreciable pacing, really exploring its themes; which are intriguing and fresh for a romance and taking its time without indulging in unnecessary melodrama. Everything feels like it's moving the plot forward, and this makes for a compelling story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the issues of the main ship and the main characters themselves remain interesting and reasonable, the supporting cast feels like real people as well as opposed to the character tropes we often see in all romance media. Meet Sayaka Saeki, she is very close friends with Touka and has secretly loved her for a long time now. Sayaka has been very loyal and supportive to the star pupil, she really wants to confess her love but she fears that it could ruin their current relationship. She too understands Touko\u2019s dilemma\u2019s and is rather jealous of the attention Yuu is getting from Touko. She feels as if Yuu has come in to take this connection away from her. This dynamic is very interesting as it feels like Sayaka would become sort of an antagonist but she is given a backstory, a moment of introspection and goals where she grows into one of the most likeable characters. Seiji Maki is a good contrast to Yuu as he is sort of similar in terms of being incapable of falling in love with the difference is that he comes across as an aromantic person, telling Yuu that he is not the same as her, as he can tell that Yuu actually loves Touko. Seiji tries to direct her on a path where she can realize that love comes in many shapes and forms, that it can also be unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I have seen, the art has remained faithful to Nio Nakatani\u2019s manga thanks to TROYCA. The studio did a remarkable job of the designs, animation, layouts, colours, score, script and layout. They all come together, perfectly in sync that it gently draws the audience into its sensory and emotional world. The appeal comes from the gorgeous background art and amazing use of camera angles and special effects, it\u2019s telling that director Makoto Katou has a great understanding of balancing the artistic and technical aspects of cinematography. You can see this is full effect in the series premiere as well as its OP. The visuals are breathtaking, filled to the brim of symbolic imagery, telling a story by the art and animation alone, complemented by a goosebumps-invoking song called \"Kimi ni Furete\u201d which is performed by Riko Azuna. \\n\\n\r\nThe very fore-fronted orchestral soundtrack comes from the genius mind of Michiru Oshima who composed for series such as Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, Fullmetal Alchemist, Little Witch Academia (TV), So Ra No Wo To and Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei. It becomes one with all of the themes and the aesthetics of Bloom into You and shows a great understanding of the use of the piano by balancing the harmonics with both bright and mellow tones which gives the show added emotional weight behind its impact moments and colour with a wide variety of harmonics to compliment the many emotions throughout. The visuals and music go just as well together as the pairing of Yuu and Touko, which is why the atmosphere of the show is so alluring.\\n\\n\r\nBloom into You perfectly balances all of the different moods, focusing on the heart of its drama which is Yuu's developing feelings, Touko\u2019s self-loathing and Sayaka\u2019s selflessness. And it does this without making things feel forced or implementing unnecessary fanservice. I appreciate that it\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows and that it takes time to show the good times along with the bad when in love, both joy and heartache. Every flower blooms at a different pace, sometimes we need time to realize and understand our own feelings, by carefully listening to our heart as well as learning to love and accept ourselves before we are able to love others. All of us blossom when we feel loved, and wither when we do not feel loved. This is the core message that Bloom into You presents that makes it one of the better romances in recent time.\\n",

It's great so far, and looking to be greater going forwards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It handles the relationship development in quite a mature way, which is pretty good.\r\nStory:\r\nI find it hard to tell, if it is a Yuri-Anime or not, since the girls do not fall into a explicit category of lesbian or anything. They harbour a complex identity, with one afraid of falling in love and other cannot love anyone.\r\nThe other one (Yuu) feels like she identifies herself as asexual, though can't say uptill Ep 7.\r\nThe way their relation is handled is quite well, but requires a certain maturity tounderstand whats going on. Hence, I won't recommend it to any person who doesn't have that maturity to respect what's going on here.\\n\\n\r\nArt : Beautiful.\\n\r\nOP : It has an eerie vibe associated to it. Never knew flowers could have an eerie feel associated with them. It's just fantastic\\n\\n\r\nAlso the small references, like the Ice-Cream Tear, and the two droplets of coffee separating apart (Ep 7) throws a light into the small details crafted by the animators and director.\\n\\n\r\nSound : OP/ED is again pretty good. Song added to playlist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nIt is better than Citrus like anime, and handles a delicate relationship very well. (atleast up till Ep 7)\\n\r\nLooking forward for the rest of the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nCheer\\n\r\n~Super Recoder",

            "content": "This show is average. Not bad, not good. Just average. That being said, I wasn\u2019t entertained watching this, not even from laughing at how bad it was, because it wasn\u2019t bad. It was just average. Despite what most people think, being average isn\u2019t a terrible thing, so as a little disclaimer, I am not saying everything about this show sucks for everyone who might take this review badly. This is just my opinion, that being said, these are my reasons:\r\nThe show is very clearly, a romance genre. The key to any good romance media is the relationship: nothing else matters that much. My problem withthe show is that it doesn\u2019t try to make the relationships between our main characters all that interesting. An issue with many yuri or yaoi animes are that they use the idea that they are in a homosexual relationship to hide the fact that there is no real substance or development; they are too lazy to create anything interesting about the relationship besides the fact that they\u2019re lesbians. The setting isn\u2019t the issue either as there are a ton of romance anime that do well in mundane settings (and even if a romance media is set in a more unconventional and/or radical setting- the relationships itself isn\u2019t taken over by the setting) because romance genres aren\u2019t really supposed to be about exterior factors that govern the story's universe per say, rather a device to tell a love story. My point being, the environment or exterior factors shouldn\u2019t be the most important part overshadowing the characters, but should be used as an effective agent in portraying a relationship. However, Bloom Into You makes this mistake repeatedly throughout its course as boring subplots distract us from the main focus of the anime, the relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSo why was the relationship so uninteresting? Or, at least why did I subjectively find it bland? Well, it has to do with the romance development/buildup and characterization. A great romance anime that does this very well is Kimi Ni Todoke. There are certainly a lot of cute romance scenes in Bloom Into You, but it isn\u2019t memorable or as effective as they could be. This is because there is no real buildup to the romance scenes or context, (for God\u2019s sake one of the main characters doesn\u2019t even reciprocate the same feelings) which makes the scenes unsatisfying and coming out of nowhere. There is no longing, no real angst that make the romance scenes worth while in this anime. Kimi Ni Todoke, my aforementioned example, takes the time to show longing, reciprocation of feelings as well as showing who each of the characters are: this is what makes trivial scenes of even the characters smiling at each other enjoyable and satisfying- overall making it an effective romance medium. Bloom Into You doesn\u2019t do this very well either. Even in supposed-to-be emotional scenes, I fail to sympathize with any of the characters, and I\u2019m a really emotional person, so it says a lot! There is no real character in dialogue, visuals or voice acting. It feels completely bland and lifeless, a very frustrating issue because the anime is centered around our characters and their relationship with each-other. There is just genuinely no substance in dialogue either which makes it very hard to emotionally relate with the last-minute backstory. Just overall making the characters less likable and therefore the romance/ their relationships less interesting and engaging.\\n\\n\r\nA very important note I\u2019d like to mention is the trend in a lot of animes that I\u2019d like to call The Aesthetic Effect. The Aesthetic Effect is used in animes with \u201cpretty\u201d visuals, stories, music and concepts to be used as a facade to it\u2019s mediocre nature. How vague the show is and the inoffensive factors of this anime make it desirable and appealing to a lot of the general audience. I think not only is this anime extremely bland, but also quite offensive at times by using lesbians as a token to justify dislikable behaviour to say the least of the main character Nanami forcefully putting herself upon the clearly uninterested Yuu. Not to be THAT person, but if a male character did things Nanami did to Yuu, it would be seen as extremely creepy. I found these scenes very unsightly and uncomfortable, which is the least thing you want for a romantic scene in a cute anime. To wrap things up, it is very clear this anime was made by people who see lesbians as an easy token key to attract audiences without adding real substance. Bloom Into You is just vague, pretty, attractive concepts jumbled into an unprofessional mess with the name of aesthetically pleasing romance. I will never understand why this anime is so overrated and put on a pedestal for being some sort of groundbreaking anime as it is just plain out boring with not really anything new to offer. Do yourself a favor and don\u2019t watch this anime, it\u2019s just a waste of time and it will leave you with nothing. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - boring and mediocre, uses gay tokenism to hide behind it\u2019s flaws. \\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR at the bottom.\r\nI'm not quite sure how to say exactly what YagaKimi is to me. There's so much to say about its portrayal of a unique relationship, how it explores the concept of love and what it makes me feel to watch it as it progresses. If I had to sum it into one word YagaKimi is 'interesting'.\r\nStory - 10\r\nThe story of YagaKimi is about someone who has never fallen in love before, Yuu, having a 'more than friends, less than lovers' kind of relationship with her senpai, Nanami and how misconceptions about love shape that relationship. It is a rather slow burn andyou could complain about nothing really happening but, that is one of the strengths of YagaKimi, after the first episode there is a gradual build-up of emotions that slowly but surely endear you to the characters, thoroughly immerse you into their mindsets until you feel you know them better than they know themselves and never wastes a moment of time, constantly adding or expanding on details. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strength of YagaKimi is the maturity in which it handles its themes and its refusal to have cheap drama or adhere to cliches. You never get the impression the impression that anything in this isn't genuine. Any drama that exists comes from the natural progression of events and the reasonable response given the personalities. No drama overstays its welcome and is often resolved in the episode it appears in when the characters talk about the problems. There are plenty of ways Nakatani Nio could have extended the drama infinitely or gone over the top like many of her contemporaries but, she refuses. A non-spoiler example is an indirect kiss that is only noticed by Nanami and that she only has a mild reaction to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nRomances, particularly shoujo romance, has always held a disconnect for me; an often insurmountable hurdle in the way they present love. They often present it, as Yuu perceives it should be, an overwhelming feeling of happiness just being around a person, that I never understood. This results in the anime having to convince me that this feeling is genuine.\\n\\n\r\nYagaKimi overcomes this hurdle by having its main character being in that same situation of longing for that feeling but not being able to grasp it that makes for an instantly relatable character that you get invested in growing as a person as the story goes on.\\n\\n\r\nNanami, on the other hand, becomes one of the most emotionally complex characters in romance anime and seeing her various layers peeled back and explored is truly where my 'interest' in YagaKimi stems from. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal stance on side characters is too ignore them until they're relevant and let them not waste space or make them interesting. YagaKimi follows the former, the side characters are interesting enough that I'm not bored during the short time that they're the focus while adding little bits of detail to the overall message of the story. Though none of them really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nYagaKimi was a decently drawn manga with a penchant for symbolism, visual storytelling and interesting composition. The anime has managed to bring some of the less expressive parts of the manga to life and has so far translated the panels beautifully into animation. Troyca has done an outstanding job with the visuals, making the best looking anime this season. Although other anime is technically better looking, YagaKimi uses its visuals in the best way.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nEvery piece of music used compliments the scene that it plays under as music should, though nothing about the OST stands out. The OP and ED aren't to my taste, but neither is most Japanese music I've listened to so I can't judge them fairly.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is on point, perfectly representing the characters and really selling their emotions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I really enjoyed YagaKimi. It is definitely the best shoujo-ai I've seen and among the best romances I've read (all my other favourite romances haven't been adopted yet). The way all the points mentioned above work together to create an anime that I can only call a masterpiece. Watching the anime has made me notice lots of subtle details I missed in the manga, causing me to re-read and gain a better appreciation for it and rewatching the episodes has been rewarding in all the extra subtleties that animation can give.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10\\n\r\nYagaKimi is an interesting take on an interesting relationship dynamic with mature handling of its themes and a refusal to add cheap melodrama or cliches. It has relatable and emotionally complex characters that are voiced well and animated beautifully. The soundtrack adds to the experience without standing out and the visual storytelling is the best this season. It is definitely worth a watch.\\n",

            "content": "Like a delicate flower, Bloom Into You acts upon its namesake, as the seed of the slept-on dark horse blossoms into one of the most charming shows to blindside me this year. I\u2019m glad, for had I not stumbled upon the glowing reception for this treat, it may have never swept me off my feet. From its mostly charming depictions of lesbian love to its authentic showcasing of friendship, each interaction is filled to the brim with charm and care. Said charm and care also show in a majority of the revelations which make this surprisingly relatable and whimsical cast come to life even morethan one could imagine. The revelation for Maki and subplot for Koyomi might be my personal favorites of the show, each bolstering integral portions of the show\u2019s three overarching plotlines. Seeing them intertwine, how each colorful character bounces off them, and how Yuu evolves from them, is simply heartwarming. This show may be repetitive and melodramatic in places, but the monologues and forced wind blowing aren\u2019t enough to smear the beauty on display here.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of display, Makoto Katou\u2019s directing is a major selling point. While it occasionally feels forced like with the focus on scenery in emotional moments, we more often get the most luscious visualizations of each characters\u2019 headspace, along with some mesmerizing and communicative shots that can be hung on a wall. These are the scenes where Makoto and his team at TROYCA shine. \\n\\n\r\nAdding onto the visual splendor of this show, the lovely art style and facial expressions translated from the manga do well to accentuate the tender yet lively nature of the characters and their interactions. The fashionable school uniforms and other equally elegant wardrobes only compliment this even further, and the female uniforms look particularly wonderful. While there are certainly flat moments and sparse bits of unsightly CGI, the show rarely fails to remain as pretty as its females.\\n\\n\r\nTo add to this beauty one last time, there\u2019s the delicate OST Michiru Oshima composed. Several of the emotional tracks do well to complement each scene, adding to the heartfelt and loving nature of the show. My personal favorite example of this is the insert track from episode 9: \u201cRise\u201d by Riko Azuna, as it is one of my favorite insert tracks of the year. Nothing embodies the pleasant nature of the show more than this one track, not even the fun ending theme by the main leads\u2019 VAs, or the opening theme by the same artist. \"Hectopascal\u201d and \"Kimi ni Furete\u201d respectively make for good songs in their own right despite the questionable techno in the former and the questionable vocals in the latter, so there\u2019s nary an issue to be had, even here.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s a word that encapsulates this delicate beauty, it would be \u201cendearing\u201d. The banter and interactions feel so authentic and lifelike that amidst the lampooning and exhibition of shoujo tropes lies a surprisingly wholesome and equally elegant tale of lesbian romance. For every moment of repetitious interactions and monologue, there\u2019s an impactful revelation, beautiful interaction, or heartwarming moment to counterbalance. There may be lulls and missteps, but this beauty has enough elegance and charm for me to brush that all aside. She\u2019s wonderful, ain\u2019t she?\\n\\n\r\nWritten and Edited by: CodeBlazeFate\\n\r\nProofread by: Peregrine",

            "content": "I expected this one to be the best and cutest lesbian romance shojo ai series from this season, but the other 2 have been much more fun to watch.\r\nThe other main character here is some sort of ideal girl, student council president, getting confessed by boys (and girls) all around, super kind and polite. However, how she is presented in the series makes her just seem empty and distant. Her entire personality pretty much ends with her way of being so damn nice. \r\nThe story is advanced from the POV of Yuu, our real main character, and she really isn't much better. Kohai to mrs.president, looking up to her like she is the real senpai. Other traits include being kinda weak and awkward at times, pondering over every little thing that happens. That's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue has also been pretty dreadful. All they do is talk about love confessions and how to turn down boys in the most polite way possible. The way it is presented makes it seem like the girls and the story writer are so hard trying to not get anyone's feelings hurt or in any way offended that it is simply too much. It's almost disgusting. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I don't really even care about what is going on with the story anymore since the characters have been such a huge letdown and uninteresting that whatever happens, it won't mean anything to me. I guess they are a good match to each others at least, considering both of them are boring and uninteresting. I will, however, say that the story surely is not making this thing any better. The pacing is just ridiculous and the romance development doesn't make any sense. It's contradicting against what our characters say and so fake / unbelievable that this thing is starting to be like air to me. If the series had managed to be good even for a second, I would claim this was an insult towards the girl love genre, but unfortunately this thing is so bland that it doesn't manage to even be that. As much as I disliked Citrus, at least the series had its moments. I conclude this series is terrible because it is making me see other shows I strongly disliked in more positive light.",

            "content": "I'm absolutely perplexed and bewildered by the general consensus on this anime, so I would like to provide my two cents, because there's not a single review I can agree with.\r\nArt/Sound:\r\nLet's get the subjective criteria out of the way first. Art is good, character designs are pleasant to look at, and backgrounds are of high quality aswell. As for the soundtrack, the piano compositions that play at certain scenes are very nice, however I can't say the same about neither OP nor ED, I disliked them both, I'm not going to say that they are bad or anything such, it's just not the kind ofmusic I enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters/Plot:\\n\r\nThe juicy part. What unfolds in this show is a dysfunctional relationship between a person that's mentally disturbed (Touko) and a person that's flawed on the fundamental level, because she is incapable of feeling love and empathy (Yuu). People claim they see a very mellow and realistic relationship between two girls, but I personally fail to see that.\\n\\n\r\n There's a lot of opinions that Touko has a genuine affection towards Yuu, but I think that people are mistaking an indulgence for affection. How can you feel genuine affection and love for someone, if you are incapable of loving yourself? She even states outright that she doesn't want Yuu to love or hate her back, and only wants to indulge herself in Yuu's kindness, as that puts her distressed self at ease, a dubious concept at best, since how can a person to whom love and empathy are alien, unknown emotions, can be kind, is beyond me. \\n\r\nTouko also quite frequently acts in a mentally disturbed and creepy manner, looking at her family photo and reassuring herself that she'll be exactly as her sister was in her eyes. Because, apparently, if you're a shy and meek child, instead of self-betterment, a much superior choice would be to become a literal copy of your older sister, and then grapple with mental and stress repercussions of your decisions. Not to mention that she low-key contemplates suicide a couple times, once at the crosswalk at the train tracks, and another in the final episode, where she's standing at the train station paltform and takes a step forward, while the train is about to pass the afformentioned station.\\n\r\nAs I stated earlier, Yuu is flawed on a fundamental level, since she cannot feel love and empathy, yet somehow renowned for her kindness, sure, whatever. In the relationship with Touko, to me personally, she comes off as a Stockholm Syndrom victim, because I cannot sum up a person that puts up with someone who indulges themselves in her, forces her to kiss them, even though she's clearly not in a mood for it, explicitly tells her to not have an affection of any kind towards them, in any other way. The only solace, is that at the end of final episode she's finally had enough of it, as she says: \"It's time for us to change trains, senpai\".\\n\r\nThe rest of cast is inconsequential, as they usually have about 5 minutes of screen time, over 12 episodes, total, or are there to fulfill a single role. The only one I will mention, is Maki-kun, a creepy self-admitted voyer, who doesn't want to be in any relationship himself, but rather be a spectator to the relationships of others, that he finds interesting/intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nPersonally, I'm revolted by relationship of this kind, I won't elaborate on it here further, as if you're reading this, it's clear as to why I'm displeased. There's nothing else I can add to this. When autumn chart was just released, I dismissed this anime, as I assumed that it will be like just about anything with similiar tags, only to be asked by my friend to join him, cause he saw potential. Now that it ended, he's dissapointed in it, though not as much as I am.",

            "content": "Bloom Into You is an embodiment of pleasantness, constructing a wholesome narrative about finding oneself and what lies ahead. This series is best described as a slice-of-life with romance as a primary narrative. While the setting is somewhat like Citrus in terms of character archetypes, Bloom Into You approaches storytelling much differently than most romance stories. The show is far less about dramatic tension between the characters, and instead focuses on evaluating their relationships with one another, whether it\u2019s affection, ambivalence, admiration, or animosity. The story takes form as a series of conventional moments and activities in which characters interact with one another in apractical, level-headed manner. Bloom Into You has a notorious aptitude for presenting these characters in such a way in which they are acting upon their own accord, rather than bending to the will of the narrative. The daily life of Yuu Koito is followed by us as we witness the changes in her everyday routine as well as her own views, watching everything blossom and mature as nature takes its course.\\n\\n\r\nThe melancholic tone that pervades much of Bloom Into You comes from conflicts within the characters\u2019 own selves, but rarely between characters. Yuu struggles to feel love and ponders about her future, Touko is lonesome and fixated on her duties, and Sayaka is jealous and keeps her feelings bottled within her. These are character arcs that rarely end up in dramatic confrontations, and rather are pursued by their own accord. The cast maintains a positive rapport throughout much of the story, largely shielded from dramatic complications that would negatively affect their relationships. Hostility between characters either occurs very rarely or is short-lived. Viewers who want to steer clear of serious drama will feel right at home with Bloom Into You. But those looking for drama will be somewhat dissatisfied by this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nEven as someone who has a strong bias for dramatic, emotionally driven narratives such as Octave, Citrus, and Aoi Hana, all of which are about lesbian romance as well, I can certainly say Bloom Into You has plenty going for it either way. The characters have just enough personality to give life to these situations. They emote, interject, pout, and elicit various other responses true to their character. Even the most mundane of character interactions feel very alive, and due to how likeable everyone is, this really emulates the pleasure of genuine socialization between good friends. The plot itself is largely unaffected by anyone other than Touko, and the cast succumbs to this as they wind up in various moments of recreation, discourse, and determination. In way, the plot is the cast itself.\\n\\n\r\nYuu is a very endearing character to follow in how her internal feelings slowly mature and develop as she interacts more with Touko and ponders over her feelings about her. Her attitude ranges from curious, to longing, to content, to frustrated. Her development, as with everything else in Bloom Into You, is taken slowly, but is done with nuance and purpose.\\n\\n\r\nTouko is unfortunately a less engaging character, and dare I even say a missed opportunity. Her conflict is very sensical, but her background isn\u2019t expounded enough to really make her dilemma feel genuine. Conceptually, she is a sympathetic character. Making decisions that only affect how people see you with no benefit to the self is unhealthy, and Yuu is both wise and respectable in trying to draw somebody away from this line of thinking. So this works well on paper, but the problem is this: Touko doesn\u2019t appear to be suffering nearly as much as the story wants us to believe. Loneliness and self-deceit come with symptoms, and the only apparent aftermath of this is her attraction to Yuu, who holds nothing against the true self which Touko hides from everyone else. This along with being timid and somewhat pushy, are really the only traits of her that we see that aren\u2019t of the \u2018perfect\u2019 self she puts on around others. The difference between these two versions of Touko isn\u2019t evident enough for me to be convinced that she\u2019s so drastically different than what she appears to be. Additionally, we hardly ever see her truly distressed about her whole charade, or just how negatively it affects her. Any sort of behavior she displays around Yuu, apart from romantic attraction, isn\u2019t symptomatic of being under pressure or constant stress.\\n\\n\r\nThe most obvious comparison to Touko might as well be Mei Aihara from Citrus, who shows obvious signs of stress and emotional depravity as she operates in a harsh upbringing with little to no free will. She shuts herself off from people, shows signs of anguish, and even has her own health at risk due to severe stress. Mei feels like an actual person whose misguided efforts affect her physically and emotionally, and thus is more convincing as someone in need of consultation and support. Am I saying that Touko should be written the same way as Mei? Of course not. In Citrus, Mei\u2019s circumstances were much harsher than Touko\u2019s, and thus would have a more damaging effect. But what Touko is going through would surely be taxing in a similar way. As it stands, Touko isn\u2019t characterized to the extent to where I actually worry about her, or believe that the charade she puts on is as damaging to herself as Yuu suspects. And thus, my emotional connection with Touko is limited.\\n\\n\r\nEven if Touko isn\u2019t as emotionally captivating as I\u2019d like her to be, the nature of the relationship between her and Yuu is what sells the experience. The time they spent with each other is sublime, with Touko being pushy at times while timid at others, and Yuu being cheeky and somewhat playful, as well as being occasionally snide in response to Touko\u2019s mannerisms. The dynamic between them makes for what I consider the best character moments in the entire series. Their interactions can be comedic, heartfelt, or introspective, and succeeds in all these. Furthermore, that one exchange between them in episode 6 might as well be a series highlight, and those who have watched the show will know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThis pairing also has a depressing nature to it, thanks to Touko\u2019s pessimistic view of love. Touko has essentially shackled Yuu into remaining in a state where if she were to develop romantic feelings for Touko, then Touko would no longer want to be in this relationship. It\u2019s especially disheartening to see a character you really like be confined in such a way out of her own volition, with the feeling that she may never live the dream she wanted for so long.\\n\\n\r\nAs worthwhile as all these characters generally are to watch, Bloom Into You really doesn\u2019t have all that much going for it in the way of depth. The character exploration is there, and the themes about love are quite engaging, but with the exception of Yuu, the personalities aren\u2019t exactly complex, as they\u2019re quite limited in traits. What makes the experience so worthwhile is watching these personalities cross roads with one another. The characters of Bloom Into You are not what I would call complex or even deep, but their development and general traits are woven into the narrative with such nuance and at a steady pace to where it all feels very authentic and wholesome. Each personality is a piece of a larger whole, working like gears to give function to a wholly pleasant and mesmerizing experience.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the audio/visual side of the show, I feel the need to be blunt here: the anime adaptation of Bloom Into You is a sheer blessing to the eyes as well as the ears; so much so that I consider this show to be an example of how manga adaptations should be done. The backgrounds are tremendously well-crafted, with detail sprawling over each object. Nearly everything is given a texture, lighting is used appropriately, and the result is a jaw-dropping collection of scenery which rivals that of Studio WIT. In this department, TROYCA has put in an effort that I cannot sing enough praise for.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, detailed scenery is just one part of what makes great shot composition in an animated product. And luckily, TROYCA manages to construct these shots with excellent color choices. The artstyle of the original manga is already a visual treat, and here it\u2019s been translated into animated form flawlessly. The show possesses a palette mostly comprised of soft colors with varying hues, perfectly capturing the style of the original manga. The colors are also used with enough restriction to where shots aren\u2019t cluttered. With all the detail put into the backgrounds, rarely does it ever look as though it was overcompensating to the point where colors are drowned out.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, along with these smart decisions in presentation, there are times when subtlety is completely discarded to communicate a point to the viewers. One such example is in the first episode, where Yuu\u2019s feeling of indifference is evoked with water gushing into the room and submerging her, then displaying her to be located far away from her deskmates. There are also other scenes like this, which project some abstract images to portray the thoughts of the characters, in a manner that feels hamfisted and rather obnoxious. This sort of thing is common in quite a lot of anime, but it\u2019s especially disappointing for a show like Bloom Into You to follow this same trend, as it\u2019s a show that generally excels in doing the opposite. Bloom Into You has various moments of directing that are subtle and evoke a sense of authenticity, so it's particularly jarring when stuff like metaphorical water flooding an entire classroom leaves such a blemish on this aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo even without much narrative complexity, Bloom Into You displays illustrious writing skill accompanied with equally awe-inspiring presentation. Everything falls into place creating an experience unlikely to be forgotten by me or anyone else in search of a very solid and wholesome romance story between girls, as well as a tale of self-realization.",

            "content": "I dropped this show because I stopped believing maybe there's something interesting that I'm missing and is coming up. It was pretty hollow and empty.\r\nFrom what I can see, people who like this show are people who looked for lighthearted entertainment. I looked for an interesting story that would teach me to understand something I didn't understand before, or share insights to things I didn't feel/think of before, but I found none here. This doesn't mean it has to be incredibley psychological - I found that in Idolish7 or Anohana for example. This one doesn't match to them.\r\nThere are pretty irregular personalities and relationships hereI suppose, which is good, but I don't think we had a chance to understand them in any deep level - I feel like we're only shown these on a surface level, their actions don't make sense to me. We don't see why is the connection like it is and where does each character feel like they stand, we just get a couple of dry reasons so we're like (making up an example not from this story) \"uh huh so she's crying because she was abandoned as a child\", they don't feel like something I'd encounter so I would understand it on my own with no need for the anime to show me how it feels, and they also don't get explored a little and I don't see stuff that would help me get a grasp of what these reasons feel like. It's dry, you're getting information but you finish an episode and you don't feel an emotional impact because surface level drama that does't make that much sense to you is all you saw. I don't come to understand why a character acts this way, why a character feels this way, I just come to generally know the listed reason the author told me earlier and enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you might think maybe it was shown and I just didn't get it, and maybe it is so, but I know I don't tend to miss stuff like that, so just try watching it and keep an eye out for that. I'd drop it pretty quickly and look for other good shows. If you'd like an interesting, incredibley insightful and smart LGBT manga, I recommend Shimanami Tasogare.\\n\r\ni If you want a lighthearted anime to ease your mind, I'd pick one that is meant for that, like Squid Girl or Yuru Camp. I feel like watching this is kind of a waste of your time in comparison to other works that are out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is actually beautiful, the op and ed songs are interesting and I kept noticing the beautiful background music through the anime. Kind of like Violet Evergarden's maybe, soft melodies that feel rich to me as far as I can tell. The tracks also kick in very unnoticabely and they don't take shame in silence and no track when it fits - which means a lot to me and was apparent in Idolish7 too, which is from Troyca as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual art for the backgrounds is incredibly pretty, there is no slack in the visual metaphors and they were very good in my opinion, both visually and in their meaning and presentation. If only they had actual depth to resemble thoguh.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like that's about all I can say prety much. This left me feeling hollow, I don't see what's in here to like over other shows.",

            "content": "The Shoujo Ai genre has seen it's fair share of ups and downs, and has been a letdown in recent times (We're looking at you Citrus), so when this show dropped in this season, I was very flawed at how I understood the taboo that is the Shoujo Ai aspect, but yet this show managed to do an outstanding justice to the genre, and (at this time) is one of (if not the best) shows due to its maturity and how it defines and breaks the convention that has been done before (e.g. moe-fied Yuru Yuri series) and teaches a whole new lesson altogether.\r\nYagate Kimini Naru, or Bloom Into You, tells the story of Yuu Koito and Touko Nanami, two individuals clasping for love in the most unusual way. Yuu, having grown up and loves reading shoujo manga, she feels the slightest (if not none) feeling of confessions from the opposite sex. Enter the high school age, and the other party (Touko) also gets the same treatment as Yuu, and immediately rejects the exact same feelings without hesitation. Having never both fallen in (true) love before, the tale of how Yuu and Touko manages to control and share their desires for each other; clear up misunderstands and all that stuff; is an entirely new territory to them. Although the lovey-dovey moments are a slow-but-painful process, the ever-folding drama is what makes the process special not just for the main duo, but the supporting cast as well (which is the Student Council), helping both Yuu and Touko in accidental taboo moments (Maki discovering that Yuu is in love with Touko, while the Sayaka-Touko-Yuu love triangle is present (but thankfully not told) and isn't the crux and problem (unlike Citrus)), discovering what's best and how to support each other. Not to mention that Saeki Sayaka, having come off from the same girls' school as Touko, has the same rivaled feelings when Touko always gives special attention to Yuu, so much that she doesn't let go, but understands her troubles and whatnot, really giving the edge to understand and not to conquer, that's a very bold decision to further drive her character into holding Touko close to her heart but not wanting to impede on her path.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, everything about this series is so well done, the writing doesn't feel tacked on and it's mostly ingenious genuity that really pushes every character (be it main or supporting) into simple or complex conflict that raises doubts and questions about each other's true intentions and whatnot. Brilliant work to the writing staff.\\n\\n\r\nTROYCA's art and animation is simply unrivaled. Although it is a detracting from their usual work (the Re:Creators style), they don't stop there. The beautiful art and the gripping animation are both works of wonder to draw people into the world that is both sightseeing and emotional-driving, that once you try to take your sights away even for just a moment, you're missing out on something special. Another brilliance of a work here to capture the gaze of the audience, and I have to say, this is a special moment in the world where imagination works wonders.\\n\\n\r\nEven more brilliant, is the sweet dope-fresh music. Most particularly, Michiru Oshima's composure of music. The beautiful, fantastic OP by Riko Azuna is really the icing on the cake, one to listen to on repeat, as is with the beautiful and subtle emotional tellings of the trio (Yuu, Touko and Sayaka) as they attempt to mask their true feelings for one another through the lush artwork present and the timely animations that just intensify the emotions all of us have to go through, even in forbidden land. The sweet ED by the main duo Yuu and Touko is OK at best, but not one to slouch either, as they try to walk the fine line through the relationship that has already been established.\\n\\n\r\nIt's about time we get an absolute masterpiece of the Shoujo Ai genre, and we have reached the pinnacle (or is it?). This is a show not to be skipped, even if the Shoujo Ai tag brings displeasure or disdain to your romance list.",

            "content": "Eventually, I will become you, or Bloom Into You, has met all of my expectations and holds all of the fundamentals of a top tier romance anime. Who should watch Yagate Kimi ni Naru? Anyone looking for a deep investment in a beautiful well thought out Shojou-ai story. Covering this more below.\r\nStory: 8/10  \r\nThis is very well done here, the episodes seemlessly fit together and do not drag in the slightest. The narrative itself is a bit fast, and a bit complex, which is okay. You will be jumping from scene to scene wondering, wait - how did they get here? As well assome unexplained settings, such as Yuu's home being in a bookstore. Slight deduction for pacing too quick in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNo complaints here, the art is flawless and encaptures the cute, \"special\" feel of young love. The art is easy on the eyes, and the nice colors are consistent throughout each episode. Very realistic art style. A very unique one as well, from the scenery, all the way down to the character's noses. Yagate Kimi ni Naru is at art style you won't find elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 \\n\r\nNailed it here as well, the sound is outstanding and very innocent, but uplifing. The sound matches the tone and overall atmosphere throughout each scene and episode. Never is it out of place. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nArguably the selling point of the series, i'm glad to say the characters here really bring it. Yuu and Touko. Our supporting characters are strong as well, notably Yuu's parents and her older sister. The personalities of Yagate Kimi ni Naru, are unique and really sell the story. Yuu and Touko's intense situations give you an \"in the moment\" feeling. Also, why are there so many characters? A lot of them look alike and you may not catch their name. Point deduction for craming in too many characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom Into You) is a timeless series that i would recommend to any romance/drama fan, especially shoujo-ai (same sex) anime fans. While I may not be adding a new song to my playlist, this series has a place in my heart, just as I expected it too. The tension between Yuu and Touko is one that is hopefully relatable, and may make you emotional during some scenes. The story, art, sound, and characters flow together like a river. If you appreciate high production value, you will be very satisfied with Yagate Kimi ni Naru. Thanks TROYCA for a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What exactly is love? Is it a feeling of trying to protect someone you treasure, or is it a feeling of gratitude for someone you deeply care about? There\u2019s no exact answer for it, but everyone has their own ideal of how love is, and with this idea adding a sprinkle of yuri, may I introduce you, Yagate Kimi Ni Naru (Bloom Into You), a show focusing on our two female protagonist, Koito Yuu and Nanami Touko, and their journey onto finding what love, truly means. \r\nStory / Character -9.5- \r\nWithin the first few minutes you get greeted by our first protagonist, Koito Yuu, whomis heavily obsessed in shoujo manga, and looks forward to having a heart pumping relationship, in which feels seemingly distant and unreachable for Yuu. Now being a high school student, Yuu was chosen to help out with the Student Council election. While trying to find out where the club is, she stumbled upon our next protagonist, Nanami Touko whom was being confessed by another male student. Having seen Touko rejecting the student, with the \u2018excuse\u2019 of not wanting to go out with anyone just yet, Yuu decides to consult her as Yuu herself too, is being bothered by the fact that her best friend confessed to her, and she didn\u2019t feel the \u2018spark\u2019 she initially thought she might have. Thinking how Nanami senpai might\u2019ve help her settle her problems, with the turn of the tide, Nanami suddenly confesses to Yuu, leaving Yuu in absolute confusion. What comes next are lovely moments that will surely make you go \u2018awww\u2019. \\n\r\nCharacter wise, unlike what you see in most romance anime, the dominant one usually is the older ones, or the male lead (in this case it\u2019s irrelevant). However, Touko albeit being a third year, is constantly showing her weaknesses, lowering her guard when she is around with Yuu, whom is younger than her. Even though as affectionate as Touko is, Yuu has convinced herself that she wouldn\u2019t fall in love with Touko (or is it (\u0360\u2256 \u035c\u0296\u0360\u2256) and in return for Touko\u2019s feelings, Yuu tends to be more kind towards her, and allows her to cling onto her even though Yuu doesn\u2019t plan on returning her feelings. Other character such as Saeki senpai and the teacher adds the depth for the story, making the story not necessarily just about Yuri at its core, but also people finding the true meaning to their life. Quite a simple plot to understand, everything you\u2019d expect from a shoujo ai but with a touch of uniqueness to the dialogues and monologues.\\n\\n\r\nArt -9- \\n\r\nThis is a great adaptation from the original manga series, characters look on point, animations are very fluid. One unexpected part that totally blew me away was the use of camera angles, some scenes were literally breathed life into them, and some made the scene extraordinarily dream-like. All in all, Troyca has done an exceptional job on adapting this manga into anime, and I think it\u2019s very commendable for making this anime such an enjoyable one.\\n\\n\r\nSound -8.5-\\n\r\nMost of the voice acting are done pretty well with some rare occasions where I actually found them to be slightly underwhelming, but not average enough to take a point off from the overall voice acting, so nothing to complain about here. The opening and ending are also quite good, I personally prefer the ending more than the opening, as it has a catchier vibe to it, and is sang by the two main protagonists. Soundtrack wise is sort of a mixed feeling (mostly good), what you usually here are ambient sound, like literally life-like ambient sounds, not many fancy soundtracks are going on throughout this anime, but they convey the feelings very well and tend to fit in the scenes. I personally just wished there was more to it, other than mostly being ambient. \\n\\n\r\nOverall -9-\\n\r\nBloom into you is a must watch if you\u2019re a big fan of the romance genre, taking the slower, gradual progression for the plot makes you more invested into the characters, and I think that is a great way to catch the audience\u2019s heart. Even though the plot is rather simple, the way it was executed through good directing and writing really makes this anime all the better. The conclusion for the anime isn't necessary what I thought it would've been (in relation to the manga that is), but was still a very wholesome nonetheless. If you want something that can hit you home, look no further and hope onto the feel train, and let the anime Bloom Into You. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Love is completely overexposed and misrepresented in media. For an anime, being a piece of media itself, to make that a plot point, they need to address love as realistically as possible. Bloom into you, pulls that off with a beautiful honesty. \r\nYuu is struggling with the fact that she's never experienced love. Her only understanding of love is what she gleans from romance manga. She then meets the student counsel president, Touko, who immediately falls for Yuu. Because this was nothing like the romance manga, Yuu doesn't really know how to handle this, and eventually agrees to go along with it, more or lessbecause why not? Mind you, Yuu is very upfront on the status of her feelings for Touko throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the entire anime is very honest with the relationships they depict. The fact that this is a homosexual relationship is mentioned, but is not really considered a big deal to anyone. That is refreshing, and quite frankly honest for this day and age. \\n\\n\r\nThe hiccups our couple do hit in their relationship are more centered around their own faults, misunderstandings, and misconceptions. you know, like every relationship out there. The problems they have are very real ones, and one of the messages one should glean from this anime is to be with someone else, you have to learn to be okay with yourself. Look no further than the cafe owner for an example of that. \\n\\n\r\nAnother relationship issue our couple has is that their feeling evolve for one another at different rates, and for different reasons. Touko falls hard an fast for Yuu, almost in an instant, while Yuu is no where never that level of emotional involvement throughout most of the show. This to, is commonplace in real relationships. \\n\\n\r\nAs their relationship grows, so do the young ladies in it. How these two lead one another to better understandings of themselves and those around them is lovely to see. \\n\\n\r\nIf I could describe the show in one word, it would be honest. Unlike Yuu's romance manga, the relationships in this anime are not magical, or perfect. They are grounded in reality, and that makes it far more beautiful than the vast majority of other romance stories out there.  \\n",

            "content": "Beautiful. This was my first impression for this show.\r\nThe genre what depicting love of between women. So-called Shoujo Ai and Yuri. I've ever not watched those shows. It's fresh mood for me.\r\nWhen someone love the person, it is important to understand the person's feeling. But this show is a little different case.\r\nPeople have complicated state are conscious of each other. Not easy thing. In that respect, this show is succeed.\r\nRelationship began by the course of nature. It changes gradually, and fall in love with each other. The moment is irresistible. Just like true love.\r\nThat isn't to say their relationship develop Romance. The balance is verygood. They're so adorable. At the same time, they're so sad.\\n\r\nYou can know this point when you watched this show. Subject by love of men and women. Like that straight shows are many.\\n\r\nI praise to challenge lesbianism amongst all of them. In addition, perfection is different order of magnitude. Excellent quality.\\n\r\nShoujo Ai and Yuri also a sort of entertainment though, they tend to avoid from people. Because of these shows seldom exist.\\n\r\nI don't say it, but I read a certain homosexual love manga in the past. This manga is nothing short of brilliant. This manga is similar to this show.\\n\r\nThere is no miracle with love. Skill and spirit build up love. Acquire them, and move forward in the future. As a result, that is inquire against yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Let's talk about this show. Story and characters are depicting by affable touches from beginning to end. Awkward depiction don't exist at all.\\n\r\nProtagonist of this show. Yuu Koito. A certain event made her start to dating with Touko Nanami. They're main characters of this show.\\n\r\nAnyways, their characteristic is so good. Yuu is a robust girl. Nanami is a girl who pampered with Yuu, despite student council first\u2010class member.\\n\r\nBut Nanami has hidden circumstances. Thereby change has occurred with their relationship. She's basically the owner of sorrow heart.\\n\r\nIn some way, She is existence as opposed to Yuu. They exchange of words in school, club activities, private. Yes, various situation.\\n\r\nPeculiar Shoujo Ai scenes included among them. Doing with them made sprout special consciousness. And they understand each other's mentality.\\n\r\nIn this way, this show's plot is unique. IMO, it's draw a line between other Romance shows. The reason is that character development is very nice thoroughly.\\n\r\nScript also surprisingly well-written every episode. I've watched shows of Jukki Hanada. This show also polite.\\n\r\nWhole interval and tempo of dialogues. These are blameless thanks to manga author's supervision.\\n\r\nYuu and Nanami are sensitive with person feelings because they don't experience real love. It's dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are very gorgeous. Disturbance is less and stable. Background and color also well-made, and shape elegant vibes.\\n\r\nCharacter design is personally quite likable. TBH, it's cute! So cute! Yuu's design is awesome. Nanami also beauty.\\n\r\nOP and ED are stunning with animation and music. I cried OP for a period of time. What are those meaning of language of flowers?\\n\r\nThis show's OP is Riko Azuna's debut single. Strong and delicate voice is fitting this show. I can expect her future activities.\\n\r\nHer tie-up song plays a certain episode as insert song. The timing are fitting well. Include splendid depiction, you'll have urge to experienced Attraction.\\n\r\nED is character song by Yuu and Nanami. Although catchy and bright melody, profound lyrics are fitting this show so much. OP also same.\\n\r\nVoice acting also perfect. Voice is fitting each characters. Especially Sayaka's voice actor performed complex and real feeling against Nanami well.\\n\\n\r\nI sympathize with Maki's assertion. But I'm not pleased his thought. Of course, This is his way of showing kindness to Yuu though, I'm not interested in him.\\n\\n\r\nIf I express this show besides I love this show so much, this show is so wonderful. All in all, this show is truly high level. Definitely one of my favorites.\\n\r\nEveryone loves someone. Efforts will not always awarded. The same may be said of Anime and Drama etc. It never everything goes well.\\n\r\nThat's why everyone face each other while doing trial and error. This is make or break. Everything is up to you. It is important to define own purpose.\\n\r\nThis show is delightful work what generated by destiny. Your rating is variation whether or not you can relate to Yuu and Nanami. Worth watching.\\n\r\nI seldom meet show what loving by author, staff, voice actors, and fans. I appreciate them. YagaKimi FTW!",

At first, I thought its just going to be another day of girls kissing and flirting with each other. How am I so wrong. Our protagonist Yuu is asexual, which makes it hard for our lovely couple to become one fully. However, Nanami is okay with it, and Yuu plays along being a yuri lover with no romantic feelings whatsoever, yet. The complication then escalates to how Nanami wants Yuu to continue to hate her and not love her at all,be by her side and let her love you. See the complicated relationship, but this aspect is what makes this show stands out. \\n\\n\r\nBut what attracts me about this show is the fantastic animation and the beautifully written story. Demonstrating the hardship being in a yuri relationship. Not to mention the yuri moments which stands out for me the most. But Nanami experience is what makes this show spark as she dealt with many hardships to meet her ideals and Yuu played the critical role of being there for her. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening music is the icing on the cake, loved the lyrics and the fantastic melody being turned into beautiful music to listen too. Also captures the beauty of our lovely couple. \\n\\n\r\nFor the whole series review, check out the link from above.",

            "content": "A Review of Yagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom Into You):\r\n(Very minor spoilers)\r\nMany questions have been asked and left unanswered throughout the generations of human existence. Where did we come from, where are we going, and how do we get there, as just a general idea. Big, open-ended questions with seemingly no conclusive answer and only opinions between each person to define whatever \u201canswers\u201d we may have. One of these questions that has plagued humanity for ages is \u201cWhat is Love?\u201d Many have concocted their own answers, such as \u201cpain,\u201d \u201ctrue bliss,\u201d \u201ca fool\u2019s errand,\u201d or, the classic \u201cBaby Don\u2019t Hurt Me.\u201d And while we allhave our own varying opinions on what love is, what it truly means, I think it\u2019s safe to say many people out there have an idea of what it feels like. So take that idea, look at it in your hands...and then throw it on the ground and stomp it into the dust of the Earth. What do you do now? What do you do when your entire conception of love fails to live up to the expectations you set before it?\\n\\n\r\nYuu was just like any other young girl, growing up hearing the fairytale love stories and reading romance novels and comics and believing that one day, everything would just fall into place that way it did in her stories. So when her longtime friend confesses his love to her, in a very comparable way as you would see done in something like a manga or TV show, and she feels absolutely nothing, what does she do? Everything played out before her exactly as she hoped it would and yet her expectations for love failed to be met. This leaves Yuu going into high school, still not having given her middle school friend an answer to his confession and completely unaware of what she really feels in regards to romance. She\u2019s lost, drifting like a leaf on the wind. However, that same breeze is what eventually leads to her sitting in with the student council. Yuu, having not joined any clubs or organizations at school, is compelled by her friends to at least try something out. In this process, she meets Nanami, or rather, she witnesses Nanami rejecting a boy confessing his affection for her, which Nanami attributes to her not being able to really feel love. Her ability to do this so effortlessly compels Yuu to confide in her about her own situation where she has yet to reject her friend (even though she knows that that is what she wants to do). After hearing her story and the emotion Yuu feels behind her situation, Nanami has only one thing to tell Yuu: that she thinks she is falling for Yuu.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, right off the bat, this show is complicated with its romance. Two characters who can\u2019t appear to love anyone, yet upon meeting, one falls for the other. What I very much appreciate about this show, though, is how well it avoids falling into the same pitfalls of other romance anime. Sure, there\u2019s a jealous friend who makes the romance (or lack therof) situation more complex, but this doesn\u2019t make her a one-dimensional side story that is only there to create conflict; she has her own flaws and moments of growth and personal motivations. There are side characters who unknowingly provide the lead characters with reasons for doing what they do, but they aren\u2019t just throwaway figures, they play important roles in their own stories and build upon the overarching plot\u2019s idea of romance. Yes, there are moments of sexuality, but it\u2019s never played just to make the viewer feel hot and bothered and, honestly, those are some of the greatest scenes for character development. The reason being is that \u201cBloom Into You\u201d depicts something you don\u2019t often see in romance: unhealthy relationships. I\u2019m not talking about physical/sexual abuse or incest or whatever (man, that sounds like I\u2019m ragging on \u201dCitrus,\u201d but that\u2019s a great yuri series too, or at least the manga is\u2026.where was I? Oh yeah). As I\u2019m sure many people can attest, unhealthy relationships come in a variety of forms. In this case, a lot of it comes down to characters being overly dependent on others, not expressing their true feelings with one another, and letting past experiences and relationships define their new one. What \u201cBloom Into You\u201d does is it takes unhealthy relationships and makes you want to see it work out for the better. Just as many of these moments are tender and sweet as they are painful and gut-wrenching, but you can see under all the dirt that a treasure is waiting to be dug up, and you want it to be dug up so badly, it just...takes the characters awhile to find their shovels. In fact, by the end of season 1, whether or not they\u2019re even close to finding those shovels is really up in the air. Yes, sadly, this is another anime series that does not wrap up with a neat little bow, but the bow is at least on the present that they gave us, so it\u2019s not remotely as bad as the ending to something like \u201cNo Game No Life\u201d season 1 (please, Madhouse, I\u2019m begging you, just one more season).\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s really mesmerizing about this show is that while the story itself is wholly unique and a treat to watch, it\u2019s also a sight to behold. Much of my enjoyment from this series came from visual cues and imagery that boosted already heartfelt or emotional scenes up to a completely unreachable level. Many shows take for granted the tropes that have been formed in romance series across the decades, but this one perfects them, and even goes against the grain to produce something special. I\u2019m not saying every scene here is entirely breathtaking or one-of-a-kind (even just the student council schtick has been done to death in anime), but this was easily the show this year that not only looked the most beautiful, but *was*, subtlely, the most beautiful (I didn\u2019t watch Violet Evergarden, but I hear that would be a quick contender). Amplifying this effect is the sound design. Normally I notice the music in series, but here it was often the lack of music or the environmental ambiance that took center stage. In the last episode alone, I can count at least 5 times where I felt a scene was enhanced by its music, only to realize that there was no music, only natural sound effects. THAT is was good music is in a series, something that builds up what you\u2019re watching as much as it can without totally taking control. It doesn\u2019t have to be a Sawano drop, it doesn\u2019t have to be an epic orchestral score, sometimes, all you need is the base sounds of nature and daily living to bring your series to life.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think everyone who watches this show will enjoy it as much as I did. Much of my satisfaction comes from being able to relate with my own experiences in unhealthy relationships and those feelings of wanting to find love and just not quite getting there. Many people struggle with it and I think that\u2019s something many romance series fail to capture, or if they do, they blow it far out of proportion into ridiculous scenarios that would just be solved if characters communicated with one another. I\u2019ve had people I should\u2019ve let go of sooner, I\u2019ve had people who I became far too dependant on for my own good and I got carried away with that, and I\u2019ve been in the shoes of a friend helping somebody else through those kinds of situations. That\u2019s probably why this show had me on the brink of crying by episode 3 when only one other anime has ever made me shed tears before (...freaking \u201cAnohana,\u201d man). I personally attached myself to these characters and their struggles and understood what someone who hasn\u2019t experienced that may not be able to understand, that it can\u2019t just be solved with a wave of your hand. This show is different, it\u2019s compelling, it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s deep, it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s painful, and I love it. I highly recommend this show to anyone with similar experiences to those kinds of unhealthy relationships because it\u2019s not often you see a sort of middle ground like that represented in any medium, it usually only being one extreme (pure romantic bliss) or the other (dramatic, heartwrenching struggles). It\u2019s not your typical romance anime, but if you\u2019re here for the romance, you\u2019ll find it. If you\u2019re here for the drama, you\u2019ll find it. If you\u2019re here for well-written, well-developed characters, you\u2019ll DEFINITELY find it. But for some, well, it may just take some digging to see the treasure lying there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating:\\n\r\nRight In The Feels/10",

            "content": "Perfect yet flawed...wait are we talking Asuka Tanaka or Touko Nanami?\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru is a rather unique take on the shoujo ai/yuri anime, where Yuu Koito voiced by Yuuki Takada was confessed by a boy, but she didn't feel anything, she tells this to Touko Nanami, the school council president voiced by Minako Kotobuki and well Touko falls in love with Yuu. With this Yuu tries to recollect her thoughts and maybe see to this relationship...or maybe not?...thus begins their shoujo romance. \r\nSo Yuu is a rather dry towards romance whilst Touko is thirsty for it but like many romances we see Yuu andTouko grow from their unexpected relationship, Yuu for opening up to romance in general and what love actually is, while Touko opens up in a different way, mainly through her backstory of \"perfection\" and her actions and goals she strives to want. While we see both of them grow, there really isn't many obstacles, though most of them are personal especially with how unresponsive towards romance Yuu is at first. Many of the personal obstacles gives us an insight to how Yuu works and thinks and later on, how she came to love and wants to carry on having a relationship with Touko as they interact with one another, while Touko's obstacles are more to both her backstory and her goals of perfection in the eyes of the school and the people around her and how she can just relax and be her \"true\" self around Yuu as a result.\\n\\n\r\nNow as much as there aren't many serious obstacles barring Yuu and Touko's relationship, there are some, like Sayaka Saeki voiced by Ai Kayano being the third wheel to Touko, her being a friend of Touko but also having a crush on her to the point of her sacrificing her own desires just to be with Touko. The only other \"obstacle\" that comes into play is Seijii Maki voiced by Taichi Ichikawa but he's a person who likes being a spectator and likes to see how things progress so in a ways he's an audience surrogate and he doesn't want to interrupt Yuu and Touko's relationship and he's intrgued by them. Yagate Kimi ni Naru's focus in mostly on Yuu and Touko's relationship and builds onto it as a result and as such even though there are little obstacles, it's more like the case of both Yuu and Touko accepting themselves as well as each other being the biggest obstacle in this romance.\\n\\n\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru gives us some subtle plot twists mainly involving unexpected relationships from the minor characters but considering Yuu and Touko is ALSO unexpected, well it's to be expected in this case and allows Yuu and Touko's relationship to be used to compare and contrast with other relationships and some characters themselves individually and how they cope with it all just to see to their happiness at the cost of their own desires. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by TROYCA was very well done, everything from background work being beautiful in it's simplicity with lots of bloom (HA), character designs being very polished and distinct as well. TROYCA's animation to be honest was consistent throughout and one of the good points to Yagate Kimi ni Naru. Nonetheless a smooth animation across the board for Yagate Kimi ni Naru with little to no derps with consistency in it's beautiful animation from TROYCA.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was well done as well. \"wait are we talking Asuka Tanaka or Touko Nanami\"...yeah is it just LA or is Minako Kotobuki voicing archetypes of perfect yet flawed characters alot since voicing Asuka and yeah LA really liked the voice cast of Yagate Kimi ni Naru, everyone from Ai Kayano to Yuuki Takada to Minako Kotobuki to Konomi Kohara was very well executed and played to their respective roles as Touko, Yuu and Koyomi. Yagate Kimi ni Naru is by the by, mostly a talkative anime and with the majority of the anime NEEDING the characters to express tons of emotions, come confused, some aligned, the voice cast did an amazing job, main or otherwise. Great voice cast, what else can LA say?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more interesting plotlines in Yagate Kimi ni Naru comes in when it comes to the play that the student council reenacts where it has subtle nods to Touko as a character being a character who looks to strive to be perfect but when the play gives comparisons to Touko as the main character who's lost her memories and she tries to find her true life she'd forgotten, Sayaka being Touko's lover and Yuu being a bystander but still in the play, it gives off double meanings to not only Touko but to how Yuu sees Touko by the end of the series, this is noting that Yuu's friend Koyomi Kanou being the scriptwriter to the play and all. Through this, Touko becomes one of the most introspective characters in the anime while Yuu also simultaneously develops alongside her in different ways both showing off Yuu's devotion and subtle love to Touko while Touko opens herself up to Yuu and showing off her flawed perfection and that being \"perfect\" is impossible to handle and through Yuu, that she can be \"flawed\" around Yuu. In a ways, Touko looks into themes of identity and the facade of wanting to be perfect in the eyes of everyone, but be flawed and shows in in it's entirty towards Yuu, while Yuu struggles with the concept of love, but with her relationship with Touko, she finds it as her relationship progresses and Yuu becomes more in-tuned with Touko. This relationship to say the least and the major focus of the entire series, Yagate Kimi ni Naru did itself excellently intertwining both their relationship to Yuu and Touko's personal dilemma's.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one flaw in Yagate Kimi ni Naru then LA would say it has a very slow pace to it, even in the more plot twist of moments it takes it in subtle strides with little to no melodrama thus the anime doesn't exactly have a climax either but nonetheless it's what the characters themselves and how they feel about it, through introspective that is it's strengths thus feels slow paced to say the least and with a huge defence LA will say this pacing which is consistent at least allows the characters to rationally think things through and NOT make it melodramatic to high heaven as a result, so for it's slow paced nature it gives us it's melodrama which by all means is a huge plus for a character and relationship introspective shoujo ai anime like this one.\\n\\n\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru is by far a slow yet interesting shoujo ai romance and heck it's quite the opposite to the outrospective Citrus as Citrus is much more aggressive and melodramatic, Yagate Kimi ni Naru on the other hand looks at a shoujo ai romance not through melodrama but through character introspective look at romance in general but how characters cope with their relationship and what it means to be happy with their relationship and the sacrifices it means to have it and sometimes NO sacrifices at all.",

A must watch for romance fans in my opinion.\r\n________________\r\nStory & Characters:\r\nAlready the first few episodes got me hooked. Both of the main characters have very interesting personalities and are well developed. One of them being very open about her feelings, while hiding a side of herself to everyone else, the other having difficulties actually feeling love but wanting to actually fall for her. This makes it less plain than simply 2 people starting to go out immediately, and in some way more realistic as well. \r\nIt is really nice to see thecharacters slowly growing closer and strengthening their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation and Sound are truly amazing in my opinion. The detail, especially the trees, plants and leaves are really beautiful.",

            "content": "I was really hesitant in watching this anime. I wanted to just forget about it and move on to what else is airing. An anime like this isn't really my cup of tea. Yet... after experiencing the dazzling animation displayed in the trailer, I couldn't resist the urge to try this one out.\r\nThis is actually my first Shoujo Ai. I've heard about shows like Aoi Hana and Strawberry Panic, but I'm not at all familiar with the genre besides its general premise. My standards are neither high nor low, although it isn't really what I prefer. With that in mind, I'm genuinely glad I've takenthe time out of my day to watch the first few episodes of Bloom Into You.\\n\\n\r\nStuff like Steins;Gate, True Tears, Hotarubi no Mori e, while all are, for the most part, completely different, they still contain something crucial in watching an anime. Investment. You can't fully enjoy an anime if you don't care about the characters, right? And while there are many shows that are light-hearted or utilise over-the-top comedy, there are some that take a more serious route, and therefore require a bit more of your time. \\n\\n\r\nBloom Into You is exactly that, but it's far more than what some might expect it to be. I've seen people who regard this as Yuri, and keep mentioning some of the kissing scenes as \"yuri moments\". Really? If you want Yuri, then Citrus is the right anime. But not this show. Bloom Into You is far more mature, and far better handled. There is no deliberate fanservice, in fact, there are none at all. There is no exaggerated and obnoxious melodrama. There is nothing of that sort. It is just two high school girls figuring out their feelings for one another. It takes its time, it's rather slow, but the subtle cues of inner conflict are timed perfectly, and the characters actually feel real. You can understand and sympathise with both Yuu and Touko, catalysts of the romance. Their personalities are just too endearing and adorable to not like.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the fantastic animation! A lot of the imagery perfectly reflects that of the emotions of the characters. The glittering purple-filled palette of colors that fill the screen when you don your first kiss. The bleak black emptiness of jealousy and worry. Without the vibrant animation that is executed efficiently, I probably wouldn't be that keen on continuing. Not to say the only good part is the animation, but it really brings the full scope of what this anime offers.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music is also far better than average. It's calming to listen to, and the Opening and Ending are both great songs. And I must say, that Opening is animated beautifully. Really awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has great potential to be one of the best underrated anime in the fall season. If it continues at this current pace, I'm sure it'll be top notch. I am actually invested now, something that is rare in my experience in seasonal anime. I am curious on how it will turn out, and hopefully it doesn't take a drastic turn for the worst because that'll be disappointing. As for people reading my review, do I recommend it based on what's been given so far? First, Bloom Into You is a slow burn romance. Are you easily bored? Second, do you like natural and believable characters that are also adorable and endearing? Last, do you prefer a more mature approach to romance? Bloom Into You may appear \"dull\" or \"lackluster\" to others, but I personally like the direction its going. Nothing spectacular, that's for sure, but it's always great to watch something more peaceful. Of course, there's bits of light drama, but it isn't exaggerated to huge proportions. Like I said, it all feels like it makes sense. You can believe what's going on, something that some anime can't really portray.\\n\\n\r\nBut that may all change depending on the route it goes. This is just my observations based on the four episodes I watched. Still, I hope it stays with its current flow, and no unnecessary stupid melodrama either.",

            "content": "No Spoilers.\r\nThis was a really cute anime.  The interpersonal relationships are very well done and the characters are interesting in their own individual ways.  The artwork is absolutely stunning.  They do a good job of drawing the viewer into the gravitas of the high school drama, without overstating it or going over-the-top, a la Strawberry Panic (which is awesome).  Overall the show was quite enjoyable and I have few complaints or criticisms.\r\nThat said, I was put off a bit by Maki-kun's character introduction, as it really gave me this dangerous and perverted feel from him which is not at all whatthe authors intended and which doesn't play out in the show.  They attempted to make him seem nonthreatening but the intensity they put behind his feelings makes it difficult for the viewer to initially catch what's going on.  Also, Yuu's character was often quizzical, and her personal motivations consistently elude me, which I do not think is the intention of the author.  I also feel like Nanami's root motivation is strangely unquestioned; realistically even high school kids wouldn't hear something like that and be like \"Oh well I guess that's a cool life goal to have\", especially to a friend.  Which once again adds to the quizzical quality of Yuu's personality, as it seems to me like even as just a friend she should be fighting against that idea.  A lot of times it feels like the words being said don't really mean anything, especially in romantic conversations, because so much is unspoken.  This is good in that it's how romance should be written, but also bad in that the nonsense words they speak over their actions really muddle any implied emotional tells of the characters, and just left me kind of confused at times.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, I still think this is a spectacular anime, and a wonderful example of high school romance.  There was no point throughout the series where I felt bored or less than excited for more, and even the less-consequential characters seemed realistic and deeply-written.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this to anyone who has a soft spot for yuri, likes melodramatic high school romances, or who likes realistic anime with a strong focus on character development.",

The colors were beautiful and the art style completely suited the story and was extremely calming and detailed, and so was the music it completely matched both the art and the story turning it into an extremely enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\ni wish there was more but the manga is still ongoing, i was left wanting more and that is why i will gladly wait for another season and read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nIT was an overall great experience that left me wanting more 9/10",

            "content": "First of all, I shall apologize for not reading the source material just yet; this review is purely based on what I've experienced with the anime. Also, this is completely spoiler free, so is extremely suggestive and perhaps intuitive. I won't even include summary, since is better to preserve one of the good aspects of the show: surprise.\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru; Bloom Into You; Eventually, I Will Become You... the title fits perfectly, because this is a story about grasping into memories, perceiving thyself and mostly expressing characters identities as they progress with their own perception about themselves, about how others perceive them and abouthow they perceive the world and the ones interacting with them.\\n\\n\r\nAt first it may not seem like it, since it goes slowly building those aspects into proper development. But even though it may appear that romance is what this story is all about, love is solely the thread that guides the characters through their own identity, and as they perceive love they express what existence really is, and how they should particularly interact with themselves and the world. Subjectivity is indeed a big keyword here.\\n\\n\r\nStorywise, the plot is focused on Touko Nanami, a second year high school student and member of the student council. But the way the story is told is very particular, since we have the opportunity to glimpse at each of the characters perceptions about Nanami, especially the first year high school student, Nanami's kouhai, Yuu Koito. This is a very intelligent approach, and probably one of the best things about the anime, since it gives the viewer the opportunity to think about what they're watching and receiving, as each of the characters perception differs from one to another, and you never really get all the answers. But don't worry; all you have to do is let yourself follow the pace, because the anime manages to convey all of those messages and perceptions in subtle facial expressions, environment dynamics, sound execution and smart direction choices.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really beautiful and fits perfectly with the general aura of the show, expressing the wholesome idea of the universe the characters live in, at the same time with all the heavy sorrowfulness of the depths of consciousness, self-perception and the pain of growing up and learning how to choose, how to live, how to perceive, how to love and how to be alive.\\n\\n\r\nI could say the music is scarce, but the sound is always there, lingering through the environment. Sometimes it's really quiet and all we have is how the characters interact with each other, while portraying in specific behavior settings. Everything about the sound direction is really good and gives you the feeling of being inside the story, capturing each moment with dazzling melody. But then, all of sudden, the music arises and is too late; you're catch off guard and simply emerge with its wonderful tones.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the way the characters are depicted really is the strong aspect of Yagate Kimi ni Naru. As I said previously, love is the thread that guides them through their own perception and to development itself, and with it the identity of each one of them represents unfathomable horizons, always preserving a subtle realism that builds up slowly and steady.\\n\\n\r\nOverall is a great anime, a fine piece of art, which shines through the depths of real, innermost and everyday life. I won't give it a 10 because unfortunately the story has not ended yet, so as far as progression and development goes, you still are left unfinished, with a feeling of wholesome, yet bitter and depressing affection. Notwithstanding, I might say it really is a masterpiece after all, since it conveys so much in so simple and subtle exposition. Bloom Into You is one of those things that really makes you proud to be an anime fan.\\n",

            "content": "Bloom Into You is an excellent character study through the lens of romance.\r\nThe main character of the story is Yuu, a character, who, interestingly, does not seem to be able to fall in love like a 'typical' romance. Now, all the reviews you'll see will praise this approach of the show, but personally, I don't think it's particularly that phenomenal or novel of an approach.\r\nWhere the show truly shines is in the character of Touko.\r\nTouko is your typical overachiever character at first, but it's slowly revealed that she's really putting up a tough front.\r\nOkay, that's kinda interesting, but so what?\r\nWell, the reason she does sois because she feels obligated to follow her dead sister's footsteps, which is interesting enough. \\n\r\nThroughout the series, she struggles through doubt and dissatisfaction from her inability to grow into this role she's set for herself. Through the romance she creates with Yuu and the influence and knowledge of the people around her, she discovers a new identity for herself and learns to accept herself. \\n\\n\r\nI do think the show also does explore some interesting perspectives on what love is and almost deromanticizes romance in a way, though. It's not really what landed this show in my heart, but was definitely a plus.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I'm going to be honest though, there are a couple too many lesbians. I wish the show would fulfill some straight couples already... guess we'll have to wait for season 2.",

            "content": "\"Yagate Kimi ni Naru\" is a shoujo-ai school romance anime. And that's it. In relation to the story, it is not much different from a typical anime. It uses much of the shoujo-ai cliches popularized from \"Oniisama e\" (and that exist in non-lesbian school romances). The (principal) scenario is a school, the protagonist is an innocent new student (Yuu), meets a senpai (Touko), feelings begin to emerge, and one of the two has a friend (Sayaka) who may or may not represent an obstacle to the two staying together in some way. All this while dealing with your school routines that usually do not haveanything very interesting. And like many modern anime, here we have a season that doesn't completely close the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut then it's a bad anime? No. At first it seems to be because the way a certain feeling between Yuu and Touko arises is quite sudden. But it's not sudden in the sense of \"love at first sight,\" just suddenly enough to look and wonder what exactly made it start. It was not a plausible start. But the anime is not too daring or sexy to please a male audience or perverted girls. It is even subtle at times, and despite having rushed to make a mood come up between the characters, he recognizes that they have their moral senses and contexts that prevent them from wanting to date at the moment. But a good romance anime is not only about that, but also about how the characters deal with each other, and whether there is a psychological justification for them to be the way they are. And it is especially the case of Touko. Your personality, way of relating to people and desires has motives. Other characters are not so rich in these quests and the most interesting is to see how they act with Touko being the way it is or shows itself to be. Most of the time we see things from Yuu's point of view, and it is interesting to see how it deals with Touko's \"true self.\" In addition, Yuu's quest to understand herself, her identity, and her attempt to form her opinion about love also make her an interesting character, though not as well-characterized as Touko. But it's a good representation of a teenage girl. I also like the fact that the anime has almost no comedy, since most of the school anime and yuri are in excess and are rarely well used.\\n\\n\r\nYuu's alleged rivalry with Sayaka (Touko's best friend at first) is not interesting and seems almost non-existent, but Sayaka at least is not a bad girl, and there's something interesting about her past. But one problem with the cast is that sometimes they seem to think that there is something absurd in a lesbian relationship, but it seems to be something without justification and that it exists only for no couple to be officially signed. The rest of the cast isn't good, but I saw potential in Seji for the metaphorical form as the direction of the anime showed his interest in observing couples' lives (I'm naive to expect anything from a male character in a yuri). Most dialogues on school subjects are tedious, though necessary to develop the relationships between the main female characters.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the anime is nothing special, but it's good. The animation works, although it does not have so much fluidity or detailed character designs (I think it's even better for this type of story that the characters' visuals are simple). Like the anime sometimes uses certain visual metaphors to express the thoughts of the characters, as well as some tricks of direction like sometimes to use some angle where we do not see the eyes of a character, to the facial expression of being \"ambiguous\". The soundtrack and voice acting are nothing special, but neither was a bad job done. The most noticeable thing is the opening.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, what can be said is that it is a simple anime without much story, but with two interesting characters dealing with adolescence experiences and discovering more about who they are, without the drama being interrupted by much sexual fanservice or stupid humor. If it was not in the terrible 1-cour format, had more character development, or was good since the first few episodes, I would have appreciated more it would be a 7/10. But unlike what most users of MAL think, SIX IS ALREADY A NOTE ABOVE THE AVERAGE! And Yagate Kimi ni Naru was easily one of the best anime of the deplorable year 2018.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm hoping to do AMV's with the song \"All the things she said\"",

Porqu\u00ea em portugu\u00eas? Mesmo que n\u00e3o alcance tantas pessoas como alcan\u00e7aria em ingl\u00eas eu sinto-me bem em escrever na l\u00edngua em que fui ensinado.\r\nSem mais delongas passando ent\u00e3o \u00e0 review em si:\r\nHist\u00f3ria/Plot (8/10)\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru, tamb\u00e9m conhecido como Bloom Into You, \u00e9 claramente uma hist\u00f3ria feita para todo o tipo de idades, sem grandes temas pesados ou que causem desconforto a quem assiste (isto\u00e9 se n\u00e3o houver preconceito com Shoujo Ai). Nunca tenta apresentar algo a que n\u00e3o se comprometeu, tem uma escrita simples mas que ao mesmo tempo consegue passar uma profundidade enorme com temas \"clich\u00eas\" como o romance e o desenvolvimento pessoal atrav\u00e9s do mesmo.\\n\r\nSendo honesto, n\u00e3o sou o maior f\u00e3 de animes Shoujo Ai e at\u00e9 agora nunca nenhum me tinha cativado mas Yagate conseguiu fazer isso. Com o seu charme inocente e ao mesmo tempo maduro, transmitiu algo que a maioria dos animes de romance falham em conseguir.\\n\\n\r\nArte, Dire\u00e7\u00e3o & Sound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nO est\u00fadio TROYCA com certeza n\u00e3o \u00e9 dos mais influentes na ind\u00fastria da anima\u00e7\u00e3o nem nunca apresentou um grande hit que fosse falado por v\u00e1rias pessoas mas mesmo andando sempre nas \"sombras\" dos grandes nomes, o est\u00fadio tem uma pol\u00edtica que eu gosto, poucos animes mas que visualmente costumam ter uma qualidade muito boa principalmente se eles forem dirigidos pelo Makoto, que na minha opini\u00e3o, \u00e9 o melhor diretor de l\u00e1.\\n\r\nYagate nesse quesito \u00e9 muito interessante, todos os cen\u00e1rios e certos cortes de anima\u00e7\u00e3o corporal t\u00eam um tratamento especial, a paleta de cores entra em harmonia com o ambiente e consegue proporcionar cen\u00e1rios que, embora simples, neste contexto elevam-se para um patamar superior.\\n\r\nA dire\u00e7\u00e3o do Katou Makoto tem sofrido ao longo dos anos uma melhoria muito positiva e que cada vez mais te deixa com vontade de assistir algo dirigido por ele.\\n\r\nA parte sonora tanto a atua\u00e7\u00e3o dos seiyuus quanto a soundtrack \u00e9 muito boa e encaixa perfeitamente com o clima do anime, de real\u00e7ar a Kotobuki Minako que consegue elevar qualquer personagem a um n\u00edvel estonteante com a sua capacidade de passar os sentimentos na hora certa e de forma, \u00e0s vezes, imprevis\u00edvel.\\n\\n\r\nPersonagens (9/10) \\n\\n\r\n\u00c9 neste territ\u00f3rio que Yagate brilha, cada personagem tem uma individualidade especial mas que ao mesmo tempo \u00e9 algo que conseguimos relacionar com a nossa vida ou de pessoas pr\u00f3ximas.\\n\r\nA Touko e a Yuu sofrem do mesmo problema, nunca terem conseguido se apaixonar de verdade, mas o que mais me impressiona \u00e9 como o mesmo problema consegue criar 2 personagens t\u00e3o distintas e com abordagens diferentes. Como sempre \u00e9 muito gratificante ver que no fim de 13 epis\u00f3dios existe uma evolu\u00e7\u00e3o nas suas maneiras de pensar e at\u00e9 mesmo como aprendem a amar e a superar o problema que no final das contas, as juntou.\\n\r\nAcho importante referir que a autora sempre tenta mostrar personagens que n\u00e3o dividem do mesmo tipo de rela\u00e7\u00e3o das nossas Yuu e Touko, o que torna uma hist\u00f3ria muito mais cred\u00edvel e n\u00e3o um s\u00edtio onde todas se sentem da mesma maneira, mecanismo que apenas serve para criar um drama for\u00e7ado. Isto tudo ao contr\u00e1rio duma certa obra que acabou por ficar mais famosa, infelizmente.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nN\u00e3o me vou alongar aqui apenas que me diverti todas as semanas e fiquei sempre com vontade de ver o pr\u00f3ximo epis\u00f3dio e ver como todo o plot evoluir\u00eda. Tudo que disse em cima aplica-se aqui.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nFoi o meu AOTS e que s\u00f3 n\u00e3o dou a minha nota 10 pois a hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o \u00e9 toda adaptada aqui e seria injusto dar uma nota mais alta sem saber como tudo terminaria at\u00e9 porque um final fechado ajuda sempre a avaliar melhor uma obra.\\n\r\nEsta foi a minha primeira review, acho que ficou um bocado extensa mas \u00e9 com o tempo e pr\u00e1tica que o ser humano melhora. Obrigado a quem leu at\u00e9 aqui!",

This anime about \"Mask of people\".\r\nSome people create mask to undefined self, to be with surroundings and social in different situation. Yuu, girl who cannot love in someone. Touko, girl who hide her true self and want to be like her older sister for that, she go to be student president and attempt to track that her diedolder sister do with. Both meet up together and this is story of them. Story have question and issues that make me think all times that I watching.

It's a beautiful adaptation that's -- so far even with the minor and inconsequential tweaks which I guess are due to time constraints -- very faithful to the source material.\r\nHonestly? I have little to no complaints.\r\nPutting the flashy stuff aside, the story itself -- which follows the interactions of the characters -- develops really well. Even with the limitednumber of episodes, the pace of gradual progression can be considered neither too fast or too slow. It may be a story about romance but that's not all there is to it.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe from anther perspective, it can be said to have started on the bland side with small \"gimmicks\" that aren't really gimmicks.

No. YagaKimi goes multiple steps further by not giving us all the information right off the bat. It  also doesn't randomly add information that clearly didn't have enough thought put into it. What it does is giving us a wrapped box that we can only open up bit by bit.\\n\r\nThe characters are buds and we watch them bloom into their future selves.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are human.

After talking for a while with Touko, Touko invites Yuu to join the student council, which she does and after the first student council meeting Touko, surprisingly to Yuu, confesses her love for Yuu. Yuu does not really know what to say in this situation and the next time they talk about this event Yuu says that she does not feel anything for Touko, but Touko wants to keep being in love with Yuu, which Yuu accepts. The rest of the events in the anime revolves around Yuu's and Touko's relationship evolving, several events which have happened in Touko's past and the events surrounding the student council. The story also has several themes to tell, for example about what defines a person. Many people have many different opinions about a person and see him or her in a different way, but what really defines the characteristics of someone and can someone really have a correct way of knowing who someone really is? As well as the theme of trying to be someone else, but still not being able to fully be like that person. Overall, the story has some interesting themes to tell, although the development between Touko and Yuu is very slow in my opinion. This is good in the regard that it makes the romantic progression feel more realistic, but because the story is mostly about their romantic progression, it makes the story feel a lot slower  \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is very good animated overall. Sometimes it uses pretty unique camera angles as well as the anime showing some scenes in first person, which can really add to the experience. The scenes are made very colourful and often have a lot of details, as well as there being a lack of bad CGI. The opening also has got pretty interesting animation with some symbolism mixed in. Overall, studio TROYCA did a very good job in the animation department. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall the soundtracks and voice acting in this anime are very good. The opening theme song and ending are pretty good and the anime has several recurring soundtracks throughout its runtime, showing the more tranquil setting of the anime and thereby fitting the anime quite well. The voice actors also do a good job showing the emotions of the characters and how they are feeling about several of the situations in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime mainly revolves around the main characters Yuu Koito and Touko Nanami and their relation of blooming into each other. Yuu Koito does not really know the concept of love from a practical point of view, as when someone confessed to her in the past, she felt nothing. When Touko Nanami confesses to her she feels nothing as well and this all even though she definitely would like to be in love with someone and know the feeling of love. Throughout the anime, she gradually falls in love with Touko Nanami and tries to progress as a person. Touko Nanami on the other hand, does not like her own character and cannot love herself as a person. She tries to be like her sister and hides her own feelings and personality, trying to be a perfect student and student council president. She opens up to Yuu about her hidden personality and tries to overcome the problems she has with herself throughout the anime. The side characters are somewhat less interesting than the main characters, although several characters have been given a bit of depth and some motivations for their actions. Overall the characters in this anime are pretty good, but could have been given more depth. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru was a bit disappointing on the enjoyment part for me. While the story and the characters have something going for them, the pacing of the story (and romantic relationship) is very slow and not a lot of progression is made per episode, having made it hard for me to continue watching the anime. The ending also is not really satisfying, as it does not give a good conclusion to the part of the story it has told, making the ending seem more like a normal episode ending. I think that if the pacing was somewhat faster or the anime would have a somewhat bigger story, the anime would have been more enjoyable to me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (7,2/10)\\n\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru is a pretty good anime with very good animation and a very good soundtrack as well as some pretty well written characters and character interactions with a story that has some interesting themes to tell. It is also original in its genre, because the romantic progression is a lot slower and more realistic that way. However, this can also cause the story to be a lot slower and less enjoyable, because the story mainly revolves around the romantic progression between Yuu and Touko. Overall, Yagate Kimi ni Naru is a pretty good anime and it still has a lot of room for character development left in a potential second season. \\n",

Watching the relationships play out in this story just keeps me hooked for the entire run.\r\nArt: The designs are cute as hell. Every facial expression is adorable, so I can't help but want to give the art a high rating. The eyes are cute, and when emotion is intended, the art really helps get that across.\r\nSound: The music played, especially the OP and Ending themes, are very memorable and I never once skippedthem. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: While the story mostly just focuses on the two main characters, as well as Sayaka, there are a few supporting characters that the show gives screen time to that, despite not being that often or focused, does an excellent job of portraying as much of that character as is needed. Nanami, Sayaka, and Yuu all have very interesting personalities, and I was extremely invested in all of them!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: While comedy wasn't a major focus, I laughed quite a fair bit but it was more out of giddiness and joy at the cute interactions between characters than straight up laughs. The amount of emotion that comes off this show makes it a must watch for anyone that enjoys a good romance story!",

            "content": "I'm a fan.\r\nYagate Kimi ni Naru is very good slice of life, a slow-moving and beautiful picture of high school romance and growing up wrapped into a portrait of wide-ranging LGBT issues. By LGBT issues I mean quite a lot-- lesbians kissing, of course, but also bisexuality, repression/\"phases\", and asexuality. That last one's the big one.\r\nProtagonist Yuu is rather unique in that she is very much gray in her own sexuality, finding it difficult to feel the same love that her senpai Touko gives onto her. Asexual/aromantic characters are almost entirely unrepresented in fiction, and the fact that Yuu is the central focus here ispretty incredible. It's not a POV we see often in anime, let alone in a show already embroiled in LGBT romance. \\n\\n\r\nAnd to say that the show is primarily about Yuu and Touko's romantic relationship is a mighty understatement; almost every single bit of the series is dedicated to the two characters discovering and learning to love each other, and in turn learning to love themselves. A lot of the plot beats here are familiar for anyone who's read a shoujo manga; the drama is pretty predictable, with doomed love triangles and sad backstories and school life troubles, but the show is able to move past that on the strength of these two characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe show revels in subtlety and visual storytelling. While the animation is alright, the \"cinematography\" is fantastic, using film techniques like close ups, POV shots, cutaways, interesting camera angles, the kinds of stuff you don't see often in anime, all to show the characters' emotions without actually spelling it out directly. Yuu learning to love Touko is a long, gradual process, and doesn't take form in a specific moment but throughout the series, and never with any dramatic revelation. Just some eyes fluttering, some long stares, and some beautiful glowing scenery. I'd call it a general \"softness.\"\\n\\n\r\nYeah, that probably sums up the series as a whole. Very soft.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the anime does nothing revolutionary outside of the typical Shoujo confines-- you've got a lot of internal monologuing, a quirky side cast, some obligatory makeouts and a sex scene that cuts from the actual sex-- but it is a well-refined work and its exploration into asexuality is really nice. The extreme frankness with which Yuu and Touko discuss their feelings (or lack thereof) for each other is also refreshing. So many good moments come from them actually communicating and being open with one another.\\n\\n\r\nThough, I do gotta mention that Touko, mostly in the earlier episodes, is pushy on a level that veers towards breaking consent, and that isn't a nice thing at all. Yuu eventually chews her out, but there are a couple uncomfortable moments before the two finally settle on themselves, and I don't think the issue was addressed as firmly as it needed to be because pushiness and dubious consent is a sadly common occurrence in LGBT anime of all genres. Every romantic moment in the second half of the show is pretty firmly consensual though, in a nice way.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the show? It doesn't friggin' end! The last episode cuts off with something of a character moment between Yuu and Touko, one that essentially solidifies everything that came before it, but there is no climax and no resolution, as if we are just supposed to wait for the second season now. Which is real lame, guys. Give us a real season finale even if the continuation is inevitable. Because sometimes inevitable continuations don't actually end up working out that way... (Gakkou Gurashi RIP) I will genuinely lower this to a 5 if there isn't a second season in the end, because of how much this show leaves things dangling. Don't do that.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this show if you're looking for a bunch of fanservicey heavy petting and any super dramatic moments. Because you ain't gonna get that with Yagate Kimi ni Naru. Watch this for some really good characters, really good discussions of LGBT issues, and some really doki doki romantic moments.\\n\\n",

What I got instead was an incredibly well written and developed romance adventure that just so happens to involve two girls. Stunningly beautiful imagery and symbolism throughout the show, and an equally beautiful soundtrack. Every one of the voice actresses and actors felt perfectly chosen for their individual roles. Dialogue is strikingly lifelike.\r\nThough romance isn't exactly my favorite genre, I feel like I would be doing a disservice rating this anything lowerthan a 10. I would highly recommend anyone with the slightest interest in romance (or lesbians) to watch this masterpiece.",

            "content": "Yagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom Into You) takes a fairly simple premise of unrequited love and adds some unique complexity: our main character is the recipient of these feelings from a popular girl, but feels that she is aromantic. While additional complications come later, what Bloom Into You really uses to spread this conflict across thirteen episodes is a carefully crafted tension that bleeds into every scene.\r\nWatching the story from the perspective of the object of these unrequited feelings is surprisingly refreshing. Usually, and especially in anime, a protagonist only finds themselves in this position simply because they are oblivious to the feelings of theother or because they love somebody else. Bloom Into You eschews these tropes with Yuu displaying an aromantic and/or asexual inability to feel attraction. It is worth noting that they never explicitly use these terms, and instead describe it quite touchingly. Yuu really wishes she could feel the same things everyone around her, but doesn't force herself play the part. It is also worth making the disclaimer that Maki, someone who claims the same aromantic incapabilities as Yuu says fairly early on that he doesn't believe she is truly like him. This allows the wondering of whether or not she will ever be able to feel romantic love contribute to the underlying tension of Bloom Into You. \\n\r\nThere is something strangely relatable about the isolation Yuu feels as a result of her inability to reciprocate feelings, as it appeals to any viewer who has felt that life, as depicted in the love songs and romantic stories that make up so much of our cultures, was passing them by.\\n\\n\r\nTouko Nanami is an intriguing character from the start. and her facade seems recognisable even before it is revealed. I felt that her determined effort to emulate her deceased sister would work better if she were not as self aware of it, as her internal monologue can sometimes make it sound a bit more simple than it really is. Nonetheless, it is a compelling endeavour to watch, particularly after she drops the act for the first time around Yuu, and it adds a certain meaningful sadness to all scenes where she appears to be a confident student council president in front of others.\\n\\n\r\nIf Saeki Sayaka is meant to be as likeable as the two leads, then she feels slightly underdeveloped. Her revealed feelings for Nanami add a lot of suspense to the narrative, due to the times she is deliberately positioned as an obstruction to the flagship relationship. This seems strange when contrasted with scenes that garner empathy for her own unrequited feelings, leaving one unsure of her role.\\n\\n\r\nBloom Into You is at its strongest when Yuu and Nanami find themselves alone. At times, these scenes are absolutely overflowing with suspense - the timing and careful choosing of every word and movement contribute to a perfect recreation of heart-pounding high school romance. Alternatively, these scenes can be relaxed and comfortable, giving a feeling that the two are undeniably meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nAnother master stroke of Bloom Into You is the student council theatre performance. It is used as a microcosm of the overarching story itself, explainable by the fact that the observant Koyomi wrote it to match the student council members. Having the complications of Nanami's identity reflected in the play serves to bring a deeper understanding to her struggle.\\n\\n\r\nThere's an emotional intelligence and maturity that Bloom Into You impressively upholds. Sympathetic descriptions of how someone feels (or doesn't) are used well, and in lieu of labels. Characters can also be hard to read at times because the show does not rely on over expressive caricatures, utilising subtext and impressive dialogue instead. As someone who is heterosexual, representation is not something I have ever had to consider, but I would like to think Bloom Into You does a great job with its depictions, especially the glances at the relationship between Riko Hakozaki and Miyako Kodama.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode being anticlimactic will work against Bloom Into You if there is no sequel, but I understand that the manga is still ongoing and hopes are in place for a sequel to this season, therefore the lack of resolution to the tension that Bloom Into You masterfully commands can be mitigated. It's somewhat nice that the series does not culminate with a changing of who someone is (despite Maki's observation being an out in this regard for Yuu, and more debatably Yuu's gradually changing participation in Nanami's 'indulgence'). Rather, we are presented with characters becoming more comfortable with who they are individually, and Yuu and Nanami enjoying their unusual relationship for what it is. I hope that viewers can share this enjoyment, but I entirely understand anyone feeling let down, because I too am left hoping to see more closure to Nanami's struggles of identity in a possible follow-up.",

            "content": "I won't compare the manga to the anime but I will say one thing. The anime is a bit too loyal to the manga. \r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe story is somewhat weak in Yagate Kimi ni Naru. It lacks any major strong point except for it's sheer realistic nature. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is actually damn well written, but one reason why I regard the manga much better than the anime is for one sole reason. THE PACING. The anime is way too slow to progress. It feels like real time is passing as you watch the anime and honestly. This isn't a realityshow that will go on for years on end. The pacing is wack too slow, but it's realistic and I can guess why people like it. Other than that, the story is quite strong in regards of foundation. It really doesn't have too much of a plot but it works. But the pacing just ruined it for me. Ideally, it should be an 7-8 episode adaptation for how much they are really adapting. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely beautiful in this anime, the animation and blending is absolutely spectacular and this anime obviously possesses some of the best art one can produce with such a budget. It's absolutely amazing and beautiful to look at. Tho I can say that the characters look quite the same. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point of the anime. The OP and ED are great and the soundtracks really fit the slow pace of the story. Really enhances and compensates for the slow pacing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are what you call, interesting. The story lacks any real and major antagonist, but the antagonist seems to be the character themselves. There's a constant masquerade that fools the viewer and leaves the viewer questioning some of the character's portrayals which is exactly what the anime wants the viewer to do. The characters develop a bit slowly yes, but when they do, it reveals inner parts of themselves that you don't really expect to see. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing. Too slow. You might as well end up falling asleep. That's just how slow the pacing is. Nothing happens that can retain the viewer's attention for too long. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a great anime. It's perfect if you want to rest and you need to relax. That's the best time to watch this anime. The show is fairly light and doesn't delve too deep into emotions and psychology. Honestly just a great show to relax to. However if you've just come off a series like My Hero Academia or Attack on Titan. If you're one of those people who likes heavy shows and action, this anime is not for you.",

            "content": "\"MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS\"\r\nAlright, review time:\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is well made. I can definitely agree on that. It creates emotion and doesn't really get boring after the first few episodes. Basically, it's well made enough to be interesting. Its also somewhat unique because its not like the usual romance stories of just simply falling in love with each other with a bit of drama here and there, not saying these are bad. This one's just different is all. \r\nCharacter: 9\r\nThe characters are also pretty complex and in general, pretty well made. I can definitely imagine others in real life who may act like this. They'renot some random characters who're so one dimensional that you can't relate. Overall, I can see the changes in these characters and their growths as a human being.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are nothing to complain about. Sound works for the most part and the voices all seem pretty accurate with perhaps, the appearance of the characters. They also have a lot of emotion in them; I'd say the voice are great. The art looks pretty crisp and beautifully animated too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nLooking at everything, this should be an anime that I'd rate at least a 9. Unfortunately, there's one rating that I haven't mentioned yet. If it wasn't for this rating, the anime would definitely be a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe one most important rating that ruins everything is my rating for \"Enjoyment.\" \\n\\n\r\n(BE WARNED. THIS IS WHERE THE SPOILERS START.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe reason is simple. The story itself and the characters are all well made; I can't deny this fact. However, some of the episodes near the end were just so infuriating. BOY, did I HATE Touko. I know she's been through a lot, but that's no excuse for her behavior/mentality. If everyone who loses somebody close to them acts like this, well I'll be damned. I'll probably want to go drown myself in a pit full of lava. Even Maki sounds perfectly normal compared to her. Touko's delusions go way too far; I'm so damn thankful that she slowly seems to be realizing this, but the several hours of anger I felt aren't just going to disappear. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Touko restricts Yuu's emotional growth and tells Yuu not to love her back, but at the same time, she tells Yuu to not hate her and expects Yuu to never change is just so selfish and irrational. You hate yourself so others shouldn't love you? Well, what about their feelings? \\n\\n\r\nYou're giving someone your emotional and physical love, but you don't want their love back and also don't want them to leave you? Who are you to do something so cruel to someone? This is literally a prime example of a toxic relationship. This relationship has to be hurled immediately into the garbage dumps unless Touko changes. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the look of things, I'm assuming Yuu is slowly falling in love with Touko. If this continues, eventually, Yuu will probably confess to Touko or Touko will somehow find out. Once that happens, all I can see is a train wreck of emotions and drama.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever I imagine myself being in Yuu's situation, I just can't stand it. It makes me want to strangle somebody. Even Sayaka seems to grow as a character. She's so much more tolerable than Touko. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all:\\n\\n\r\nDecent anime. Would never watch again. For you, fellow reader, it might be different. For better or worse, I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nPS: My personal favorite characters are Maki and Koyomi.",

            "content": "Yagate Kimi ni Naru is simply put a great love story. Sure, it is about about girls, but that actually makes it better. If Touko was a guy I guess some of the stuff she does would not be looked favourably upon by some more sensitive people. And even though Yuu develops a vibe of the guy in the relationship, she ultimately is not one. I could not imagine Touko confide in a guy, even someone like Maki.\u2028\u2028\r\nThe story starts a little bit slow and feels straightforward, then it grows into something which does not seem to have an obvious answer. But in the endit heads towards something bit more concrete. One thing I regret is that the story should have ended at ep. 13. It even seemed like it will end. Sure, some loose ends would not end up tied up but that could have been left to the imagination of the viewer. Or they could be accounted for in potential sequel which could have been a new chapter trying to depict new topics, not a continuation of the current one.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the side characters, I cannot think of any of them being weak or unnecessary. The main couple has nice balance to each other and the artwork is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yagate Kimi ni Naru is a great show worth watching and even though I said earlier I would prefer it to end sooner I cannot wait for the sequel.",

            "content": "Bloom Into You is probably the best yuri anime produced to date, even though it's not really the romance tale you might expect it to be and it can be, in my opinion, quite painful to watch from an emotional standpoint. It starts with Yuu, a girl who cannot feel love and more or less resigned herself to the thought she'll never find it, catching the attention of Nanami, the seemingly-perfect president of the student council. The actual focus of the story, however, is Nanami's internal struggle - the trauma of losing her beloved sister and the self-destructive drive to become a perfect replacement forher, to \"bloom\" into being her, which is what the title references. Yuu, the only person who really understands Nanami and the only one the president allowed close enough to learn her true feelings, has to find a way to help her find her own path, while possibly also getting more in touch with her own feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama in the series is actually pretty low-key, but the emotional weight of Nanami's struggle and the way she manipulates people around here to achieve her goals are rather heavy. Some people see this series as slow-paced and relaxing, but I actually found it quite excruciating - never because of cheap melodrama or edgy plot devises, but exactly because of how convincing and emotional the whole scenario was. Also, while the main couple is already quite interesting and unusual, the supporting cast is similarly excellent, having both a decent amount of depth and meaningful roles within the story (particularly the council vice-president, Sayaka, who's clearly in love with Nanami). Even the general approach to lesbian romance is fairly serious and realistic, not placing the story in some kind of \"yuritopia\" where everyone's gay and happy about it, but very subtly signalizing the internal struggles and societal scorn connected to being a homosexual.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual and sound quality are top-notch, just as you'd hope from this kind of series. Nothing in it really left me many reasons to complain - despite the anxiety-inducing story developments and Nanami's relentless emotional self-harm, it was a fascinating watch and easily surpassed any other yuri drama I've seen in anime form (nothing beats yuri visual novels, but that's beside the point). I just have to warn any potential reader that while the show has its share of romantic moments, kisses etc., the romance part is far from being conclusive. It ends on a very positive and hopeful note, but leaving a lot to watcher's imagination, so if you're looking for a romance above anything else, it might not satisfy you. Other than that, I think it's a great series and something definitely worth watching, not just for yuri fans, but anyone looking for a good drama VN.",

            "content": "What is the essence of a good romance story? What makes it tick?\r\nIt's a well-trod genre, one of the oldest and most trafficked, probably dating back to before humans even had written language, back when we all gathered 'round the fireside and told tales.  And it's easily defined: If a story's primary topic is romantic love, it's a love story, or a romance, or however you'd prefer to describe it.\r\nBut I believe that whenever you use a genre to tell a story, that story should justify occupying its place within the genre. In other words, a romance story should be a story which couldonly be told as a romance story.  That might seem easy and obvious, but it's not necessarily so; many's a tale where the relationship is only held apart by obstacles which really have nothing to do with love.  The romance becomes a McGuffin, a goal to be achieved but not the subject of the journey itself.\\n\\n\r\nNot so for Bloom Into You.  It is emphatically a love story; the topic is love and romance, and the story's conflicts are internal to the characters, and have to do with their relationship with each other, and more importantly, to themselves and to love generally.  And although it's marketed as Yuri, its themes are universal and personal.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't tell already by my long-winded introduction to this review, I seriously enjoyed Bloom Into You.\\n\\n\r\nSo, beyond being a real, honest-to-goodness romance, what's there to like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that grabbed me was the tone.  It's serious, mature, and even grave at times.  If you're looking for comedy, you're looking in the wrong place.  But for all that Bloom Into You is serious, it handles itself well, without falling into cringey dialogue or overwrought emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing I loved was the reversal of some iconic tropes.  In a typical high school romance, the main character falls in love with somebody else, and isn't sure whether their feelings are returned; in Bloom Into You, that premise is inverted: the main character is confessed to early on, but feels nothing in return.  And yet her eagerness to please others and her loneliness keep her engaged in the situation, and--we're off.  Prepare for some real, deep character work, and even further inversions on the expected, which I won't spoil here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, Bloom Into You deals heavily in character and identity.  Gradual evolution is the name of the game, as the characters change and learn more about each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe only unfortunate thing is that this is very clearly half a story.  We get evolution, but we don't get revolution; there's no catharsis here, no climactic conclusion, and no answer to the central questions that are posed.  For that, we'll have to wait for season 2, or the ending of the manga, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also merely adequate.  The character designs are easily identifiable, if a little plain, and the background art is fine, but there are many shots where the animation is minimal to cut costs.  It's not an ugly anime by any means, but it's rarely beautiful, either.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, this is a series with almost no fan service or slapstick humor whatsoever, allowing you to relax and enjoy the excellent writing.  And there are some interesting stylistic choices in the animation, too, such as the occasional use of first person perspective.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the voice acting and music really make a big difference, as well--both impeccable and perfectly suited to the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it comes down to it, you're here for the characters and for the writing.  Both are excellent, some of the best I've had the pleasure of experiencing in this genre.  If you have any interest in the premise whatsoever, watch this show, and cross your fingers for a second season.  9/10.",

            "content": "Now, I was a little concerned with how things were going to play out from past series/experiences with Shoujo Ai but Bloom Into You delivered more than I was expecting. I was debating whether to give it a 9 or a 10 and eventually settled on the top rating for numerous reasons.\r\nMy main worry was a progression or introduction to the beginning of the relationship such as Citrus which had minimal to no development, nor did it have any suitable introduction for the actions within Ep. 1. It turned into a bit of a train wreck for myself until the halfway point but the damagehad been done. Sakura Trick jumped into things quickly but there was an introduction to things. The fan service was high and would please anyone who was into a light form of Yuri. Akuma no Riddle was more of a combat based series with light Shoujo Ai feelings, so I can\u2019t say much for development there and Aoi Hana...well, I didn\u2019t have problems with the series nor can I say much about it. Bloom delivered heavily for myself and for good reasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was easy to work out and follow I\u2019d say, involving Yuu\u2019s discovery of what it\u2019s like to have a sense of love, while Touku wanted to follow in her sisters footsteps and hid her real self, one that was fragile and worried/scared.\\n\r\nThe first episode involved the confession and things progressed from there, Touku\u2019s interest in Yuu growing stronger even though she didn\u2019t return those feelings. The pacing felt extremely good and I never felt like anything was rushed. The development was pretty good as well with the relationship slowly progressing. Yuu slowly started gaining an interest in the actions performed by Touku. By the end of the final episode, I was left extremely satisfied and excited for Yuu.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the progression of the relationship alongside development for me was on point and I\u2019ll say it once more; my expectations were exceeded.",

            "content": "\"Bloom Into You\" is a frustrating experience. It does just about everything right, but when it comes to delivering on its main selling point it chickens out because \"muh subtlety\" or some bullshit that's really just an excuse to not go Full Gay. LGBT stories are the LAST thing that need subtlety, especially in a medium that so firmly refuses to acknowledge that LGBT identities exist. But before I get into The Big Gay Elephant in the Room, here's what the show does well: \r\nArt and Sound: 8/10\r\nThe music is great (particularly the OP and ED songs). I really like the character design and artstyle; the color palette is beautifully warm and inviting. Nothing groundbreaking but nothing to sneeze at, either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nIt doesn't have any of the gross fanservice or sexism or other nonsense that stains even some of the best anime shows, so you can comfortably recommend this series to just about anyone. (And if you know someone who's uncomfortable with seeing gay people kiss, do yourself a favor and drop contact with them.)\\n\\n\r\nThis score would be higher if it weren't for The Big Gay Elephant in the Room.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are complex enough to feel like real people and we learn more about them with each episode. They're realistically flawed in ways that don't make them irredeemable\u2014particularly Touko, who by all accounts is an angsty piece of shit but manages to remain a great character because she has room to grow. I at least cared about her enough to want to see her become a better person even when she was at her worst.\\n\\n\r\nYuu is an amazing character, whose experiences and perspective as an ace/demisexual feel like they come from a genuine place. It's scary just how accurate this character's experiences are to my own. Her character development is also the most pronounced. In fact, the only time this show did subtlety well is its depiction of Yuu's budding romantic feelings for Touko. When she eventually reciprocates Touko's feelings she never states it outright through the typical anime inner monologue, but it's still made extremely obvious. I say this was done well because it further cements that Yuu and Touko are foils to each other: Touko falls hard for Yuu almost instantly while Yuu doesn't fall hard at all and just kind of gradually slips into these new romantic feelings.\\n\\n\r\nSayaka is another complex mess of a person, and I mean that in a good way: Due to her unrequited love for Touko, she has a complicated relationship with her and there's no easy way out. A lot of her barriers are rooted in the fact that her sexuality was treated as \"just a phase\" by the first girl she fell in love with. This is the kind of complex and nuanced storytelling I love, and I would've liked to see more of Sayaka because of this. (Though, also I just want to see Sayaka be happy and get a girlfriend.)\\n\\n\r\nMiyako and Riko are the best supporting characters because 1. Their relationship is adorable and 2. they actually get to be in a canon lesbian relationship that is explicitly spelled out to the audience with the most satisfying delivery of a \"she is my girlfriend\" line I've seen (and yes, I know that bar is incredibly low; it was still satisfying.) Honestly, these two were robbed and need their own show. \\n\\n\r\nSeiji is a great supporting character\u2014at least conceptually\u2014because once it becomes clear Yuu IS capable of romantic feelings, it left a gap in the show. Aromantic and asexual characters don't get much representation in media either, so it was nice to have another ace who stayed that way and is also perfectly happy the way he is. \\n\\n\r\nNow, it's time for...\\n\\n\r\nThe Big Gay Elephant in the Room: 2/10\\n\r\nIt's extremely obvious that the main reason someone would want to watch this show is for the lesbian romance\u2014just look at the cover art for this series and it's hella gay. There's also a lesbian love confession in the first episode, a lesbian kiss in the second episode, and if you can tell by my character ratings, pretty much all of the main characters fall under the LGBT spectrum or ace umbrella. These characters all feel like they were written by someone who's actually part of the LGBT community and not some straight person fetishizing yuri or something gross like that. So it's extremely disappointing that this show refuses to deliver on its main romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe first six episodes made me uneasy because I kept worrying it would pull The Bad Anime Thing and just go, \"LOL nevermind it's not gay!\" Episode seven made it seem they weren't going to do that, but then every episode after that just became the typical anime shiptease where nothing gets resolved. By episode nine I was already sick of it and just wanted them to get together already. By episode eleven I wanted Yuu to smack Touko upside the head and deliver this exact line: \"Touko, I'm in love with you, you fucking idiot. Stop being a self-hating edge lord and let yourself be loved already.\" Episode thirteen is the worst offender of the shiptease, with heavy buildup toward Yuu finally confessing to Touko only to just... not do it. And trust me, there is A LOT of buildup, to the point where there's an after-credits scene that almost feels like a \"gotcha\" that's finally going to deliver only to chicken out for the umpteenth time in the same episode.\\n\\n\r\nYeah yeah, I know Yuu's final line, \"Touko, it's time to change trains\" was supposed to be symbolic or whatever, but I'm going to say it again: LGBT romance doesn't need this vague, pussyfooting nonsense. If you're going to write an ambiguous, \"subtle\" romance with that stupid You'll Never Know if They Actually Get Together Ending, at least have the decency to make it straight; straight folks aren't starved for good content, but LGBT folks ARE. If you're going to write an LGBT romance, either make it explicit and definitive, or GTFO.",

There's no fan service, the characters aren't sexualized, and the shows drama and relationships  are grounded in reality. This feels like a show made for lgbt youth, it's not pandering to the otaku crowd and instead is a realistic portrayal of being young and experimenting with your sexuality. It's not perfect, the art can be inconsistent and the show feels slow at times but watching the relationship of the 2 main girls grow brought back many memories of similar relationships i've had in the past and that's not something I experiencewith anime often.",

            "content": "Before i start this review i want to point out one thing about this anime. As much as it may seem like a romance anime and even though it is one this anime is more of a self-realization story then anything as the main character Yuu Koito wants to find love but has a hard time falling in love in the first place. And now in high school she is having a hard time wanting to fall in love with Touko Nanami who is madly in love with her. \r\nFirst let me talk about the story. Personally i always find Yuri stories so heartwarming. Thestories they tell are completely different then a normal romance story as it deals with same sex love and not your normal run of the mill love. What i find in this story are characters having different feelings for each other, but having a hard time trying to be themselves and trying to say the words they want to say to that other person. It goes back to me saying this is a self-realization story because of the fact not just one or two characters are trying to figure things out, but it comes down to a few of the characters inside this beautifully crafted story. \\n\\n\r\nNext the art. The art for this anime was a little different then a normal anime as it shows different visuals the characters themselves see themselves in. Some examples are Yuu being in the water not being able to reach the same place that Touko is at which is in the stars. You see this a lot in the anime when they are together, alone, or thinking about what is going on. They want to show the viewer that even though two or more people might think the same or differently they see themselves not in the same light as the other person even though they try to be at the same level as that other person. Plus the art visuals also pull you in to watch every bit of the screen and just take in the wonderful visuals the animators have brought to this anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow the sound. The sound was good in the anime. When the characters walk you hear that in rhythm to each other. When the wind blows on to the trees or the characters themselves you can easily hear it. But what was good about the sound was the use of the music through out the whole anime. It knows when to use the right music to each of the moods. When the characters look at each other or when they have a romantic moment the music brings you in more to the scene. When someone is thinking a different melody plays to make the viewer understand what the character is going through and they are more invested and that character though the rest of the anime. The music has a warming feel to the anime and its not thrown at you out of no where so you are able to enjoy listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nNext are the characters. I really loved each of the characters in this show. From Yuu's shy but always here for you attitude  to Touko's loving attitude towards Yuu, but also has a side that she can show to Yuu and can talk to her about her problems. Even other characters like Sayaka who also has a personality to keep with the viewer and doesn't become stale over the viewing for this anime. But what i really like about the characters in this anime is the fact is you are able to see and hear the conflicts they have within themselves and expressing themselves to other people around them. They want to show other one side of them while the viewer is able to see the other parts of the characters and can relate to them in some sort of fashion. When you can relate to a character in an anime you know the characters in general are going to be entertaining to watch throughout the entire thing. \\n\\n\r\nFinally my enjoyment of this anime. While there were a few parts in this anime that were slow or not very good the overall pace of the show is really good and you get to see everything you are wanting to see whether that be from the characters point of view, the art of the anime, and getting invested with the story just because of how good it really is.  I enjoy seeing what the main characters think of each other and seeing what they are going through in there own mind. I really enjoy just watching the next episode not wanting to get behind just because of how good it is. So really this is an anime you will want to watch in its entirety in just one sitting just because of how good it really is. And with the ending you will be wanting a season 2 just so you can watch the characters develop even more and see where they will go later down the line. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i really think this anime was great. Even though there were a few problems here and there i really think this is worth the watch and something i think people could relate to just because of what the story is telling the viewer.",

            "content": "I loved the concept of this show from the moment I read the synopsis. Love is a complicated thing, so to make a story where a character is trying to figure out for herself what love feels like, is for me an interesting concept. \r\nIt didn\u2019t start out too spectacular but enough to keep me invested. After around episode 3 I started to really get into the show and wanted to watch it until the end. \r\nThe story had a nice slow pacing fit for the development of the main characters. \r\nThe characters in the show felt realistic and natural to me. Yuu is notsimply giving in just because someone fell in love with her at first sight. She stands by her point of not knowing how it feels to be in love and rather needs to find this out before even considering dating Touko. I liked this aspect a lot of the show. \\n\r\nTouko is an interesting character as she has some sort of ideal form of herself that she needs to keep up instead of being her real self. She only shows this to Yuu, which gave them a special relationship on its own. \\n\r\nSayaka was also a very interesting character to me later in the show. I won\u2019t tell details as it is more fun to watch for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful, that\u2019s all I can say. The animation was solid and the character design is pretty to look at. No negative comments on it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you are into romance anime of the serious kind with good character development and even some cute moments, then this is your type of show. \\n",

Personally, there were a few moments & character actions that raised red flags for me.\r\n'Yagate Kimi ni Naru' is endearing in how it tackles the topic of love, dissecting and exploring it in ways akin to the Greek words distinguishing it. I appreciate how its tackled the LGBTQ+ theme, portraying it through a modern understanding of the community.\r\nIt's gentle in its reflection of adolescence; and I could go on about the use of the language of flowers, the water motif, etc\r\nSomewould say it's anti-climatic & too mundane.

            "content": "When Troyca was announced to be in charge of this adaptation, several alarm bells sounded in my head. The studio behind such trashfires such as Aldnoah Zero and Re:Creators doing a slice of life yuri with light drama? And to top that off with a really ugly promotional poster that really emphasized the chin sharpness of the two mains, looking nothing like Nakatani's art. Miraculously, Yagate Kimi ni Naru is not only the most visually stunning show of the season, thanks to it's impeccable direction and strong source material, but also one of my personal favourites of the season. \r\nIt's just a very relaxing show.Whatever light drama in it is just enough to make me want to watch future episodes without making me bored after each episode ends. Takada Yuuki's portrayal of Yuu is simply perfect, there's the innocence and emotionless tone to her voice that's subtle yet adds to Yuu's overall character so much. It's one of those cases where a seiyuu's performance truly makes the work what it is and elevates it to something truly spectacular. Yuu's interactions with Touko are a joy to watch. It's a nice blend of comfy with just that little bit of drama to keep things moving. \\n\\n\r\nThe music too. By God does it really complement each scene well. The composition has a real fairytale vibe to it, which actually reminds me of a less mischievous Little Witch Academia score. It does suit a more fantastical show, but is no less effective there than it is here. The piano leitmotif punctuates important scenes well, and it's a tune you can't get out of your head. It's the perfect soundtrack to listen to on a nice gentle afternoon.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of gentle, I just love how gentle the color palette and overall visuals of the show are. It all adds to the comfy, relaxing nature of the show, but can get vivid and striking when it needs to. The promotional poster was thankfully a fluke, but I wish it wasn't used as the album cover for the official soundtrack. Kinda dampens the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nMy one gripe is how short it all felt. This really should've been 2-cour, with all that buildup to the Seitokai Drama Show all being for nothing if they're not gonna adapt it, as with how almost nothing gets resolved, and how character development for both mains only really just went past the first checkpoint, still far from the finish line. \\n\\n\r\nOh well, one can only dream of a Season 2. Just reading the manga without the excellent music, the smooth voices, and of course, that brilliant direction feels so empty somehow. \\n\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "I got really curious about Shoujo Ai, and Bloom into you was only a couple episodes in at that time ; the score was around 7.5-ish? So I told myself what the heck let's try it, and whatever will be will be.\r\nThe show surprised me with really nice art, you can see there's some good time and money invested in the cuts and details. Great lines and amazing colors, really. After 12 episodes, the art never falters, even the visual storytelling is good, it's just like watching a Hitchcock or something, only it's an anime xD\r\nOn the contrary the main character starts off pretty badlyin my book, as she's having pretty much the same issue as a certain auto memory doll... Yes the premises appeared to be a bit ridiculous to me, that's how I felt about it anyway, but then I'm not used to that type of anime ; eventually the first episode left me circumspect about what would only serve as pretenses for the show, and wanting to know how it was going to unravel. The main characters are burdened with relatively straightforward core issues which were of course going to clash and create a bunch of happy accidents among which the classical love triangle. By the way one interesting fact and strong point for the show : the hell with boys and men. Male characters are just left aside to dry (some are even faceless) with the exception of one that maybe could remotely have an impact on the story.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that piece by piece the show did everything it needed to do to keep me within its reach : there's good humor supported by awesome voice acting, the rapport between the main girls builds up in intensity at a fair pace, the supporting cast is no accessory and there's no episode that feels like a filler... And of course the \"shoujo ai\" sides of the show seemed pretty good and convincing to me. When they happen I don't feel anything off or awkward about them, maybe because there's a lot of silence. Yes words tend to ruin things for me, because why would you use words when you can use visual story telling and faces and silence. Sometimes your viewer just do not need you to explain everything because he's just that smart. Also some things are just absurd and can't be explained with words!\\n\\n\r\nThere's only one episode left at the time I'm writing this. I can try and guess a couple of different conclusions, but I think I hope I'll be surprised by 'how' they're going to present the ending to us, more than 'what' is going to happen. Because the show is no crazy mindfuck, it's a piece of heartwarming animated events, don't expect something super deep and you won't be disappointed. \"Bloom into you\" is a focused story, well executed, not pretentious for a cent, the characters start pretty stupid, then we discover them as being wicked, weak, lost and flawed. In one word : humane.",

            "content": "Hi! Welcome to another of Robert's Too Late Reviews! This time we have an interesting title, one that I'm so very glad I came across. I will say up front that I do tend to write my reviews as 'blind' as possible, skimming overall scores and perhaps first lines of a few reviews to see if I think a series is going to be worth my time. Having done that with Yagate Kimi ni Naru I saw a few different statements saying how this is a story of self realization and of love and personal growth. I will say now that I too agree onthis general theme, so this is going to be my own personal spin on that view. Considering my overall score, I wholeheartedly recommend this anime series, especially if character driven storytelling is something you enjoy. As for the RTLR wall of kissy faces, I'm guessing you can already tell how that's going to go. Nevertheless, we're off!\\n\\n\r\nStory (and partial Character): 9\\n\r\nTo start with the less stellar issues involved in the story section, I must say that this is a bit of a slow burn. Now we do have some immediate love proclamations and a bit of kissing early, but the true heart of the show, the true stylings come much later into the tale. We first have to learn about who the characters are from the opening point of view to gain the understanding needed for the existential questioning that comes towards the end. Before we realize that the characters are having such personal issues, it can seem a little on the slow side. To me, it reminded me of my most beloved Maria-sama ga Miteru which also started slow before pushing hard as it progressed towards the end of the first season. In fact, if you are a Marimite fan like me, then just go watch this one, you'll love it I promise. But back on point, we have a bit of slower progression than many other series which does require a small amount of dedication to stay with, but the payoff is more than worth it. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main issue I had story wise was the main character Yuu holding so hard to her mantra of not knowing how being in love feels, even long after it was more than apparent she had fallen for her senpai. I understand that is part of her story arc, but the decision to have her still think she's above love even when showing it with her actions is a writing choice I personally would not have made. Her admitting she was falling would have not broken her character, I think. \\n\\n\r\nNow the meat. The story really is about who we are, or who we think we are. When we are faced with perspectives on ourselves that refute or challenge our self imagine, what do we do? How do we respond? How do we determine what is important, what we want to live for? No matter the answers to these questions, there is growth. Sometimes it can be negative, but in this case, it's primarily positive. Our aforementioned senpai can easily be considered our co-main character, and her growth is driven by what appears at first to be just an overwhelming desire for excellence, as we see in so many overachiever type people, but in the end we find out she has a deep, painful reason for being who she is trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nTherein also lies a major plot point. Should she try to be someone else? Is she failing herself by trying to honor another? Has she lost sight of who she really is in her quest to live the life she does for the reasons she has? And what about the feelings sparked by Yuu? She develops a near instant romance with the underclassman, but yet does not want to see Yuu return her love. She seems sometimes to have picked Yuu precisely because she is unlikely to return her affections. But is that the way she should live her life? Why would she make that choice? All these questions and more drive the story forward, and the answers can be shocking and painful. \\n\\n\r\nThere is the arc of the romance between senpai and Yuu, which for senpai seems to happen nearly at first sight. But with Yuu's reluctance to open herself to love, it is a rather one sided romance for most of the story. Even at the very end Yuu tells herself she isn't in love when her actions clearly say otherwise. This is less a yuri romance than it is a special relationship between two girls driving their self discovery. Think much less Asagao to Kase-san and much more Citrus like. \\n\\n\r\nThe story moves through an arc of self discovery, understanding and acceptance, which I found as a wonderful message that should be shared with the world over. If we learned the lessons our characters learned in this series, we would all be better people for it, and by extension, the world itself I would love to believe would be all the improved by it. I strive myself to remember these lessons now that I've seen them in series like this and other forms of media, so that perhaps I can help brighten the world, if only in the smallest manner. As I finished this series, these are the kinds of thoughts triggered by what I have seen, which I believe speak well to the quality of the story in general. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe series is really good looking. The eyes were duly expressive, and each character was easily identified, even in situations where they were not in their standard clothes/hairstyles. The lines were cleaner and simpler than some anime series, but the overall artwork matched the themes and feelings invoked very well, so they earn high marks from me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\r\nTo explain the knock, both the opening and closing themes were pretty, and the standard fare one would expect for a romance based title. I just did not find that either theme had any ear catching qualities. They did their job, and were pretty enough, but just not moving in the sense that say, the opening of Aoi Hana has. It was serviceable, but I don't find myself going back to listen to the songs alone like I do with many other anime. The voices are well done however, and everyone sounds appropriate. My only complaint was the themes themselves, everything else is well done. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI have already spoken at length about senpai and her character in the story section, and I will elaborate a little more here. Her character is just absolutely painfully beautiful to take in as the series concludes. She might seem bland at first, but before it was done I had become misty eyed more than once due to her circumstances and motivation. She also struck a chord with me in that her feelings seemed genuine. I think if I was in her position I would feel, and act in the same manner she does. This to me speaks to how well thought out her character truly is. \\n\\n\r\nYuu as a main character is interesting in that we see her growth as well, it's just a bit less pronounced. She's on a journey to discover who she is, and even who others around her are, especially senpai, though she does so with a little more subtlety than other characters. She learns about herself through observing others, and even though she holds out seemingly to the very end, I believe the ending makes it clear that she has grown in character as well, and has come to experience the very thing she thought she was never going to have. I think she learns, and we with her, that sometimes life events come to us in ways we don't expect. Sometimes we're looking for a gentle breeze and instead get hit by a train. Other times we're expecting a hurricane and instead are introduced via the whisper of a child. Now in both those situations the event, emotion, or situation may later have all the impact and importance in the world, but sometimes they just arrive in a manner we're not expecting. I believe Yuu experiences this very event. \\n\\n\r\nThere is another character, a blonde that loves senpai, but is ultimately left out that is my only real holdout character wise. She's a bit aggressive in protecting her turf, even though senpai has not agreed to be with her romantically. She's so obviously in love with senpai that when an underclassman writes a play, she writes two characters romantically linked with senpai and blondie in mind specifically. Kind of an open secret. Blondie of course is not a Yuu fan, but this serves to provide a bit of an antagonist for the series. The point I have with blondie that I make a deduction for, is that in the ending she's shown as being relatively at peace, as though we're to think that in the end she's fine with everything without a level of growth that would warrant such acceptance. I think for her the best ending would have been one like Tamao from Strawberry Panic suffered in regards to Nagisa, that of support, but yet still a bit forlorn for what they can never have. \\n\\n\r\nOnce the story begins turning and showing us new angles on our characters, we find a depth I don't think is very often discovered, whether it be in anime, television, or even movies. Usually one has to turn to written literature for such character depth. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI will admit around episode 3 and 4, possibly even 5, I was slightly worried that this thing was never going to come together but how wrong I was. I think I now have a new favorite to throw on the old 'great shows' list. For me, once I found out senpai's motivation for her actions, I was in love. Again I fell when I got to the point where she reveals how she feels about herself. This may not be Aoi Hana, but boy did it get close for me, and if you have read any of my reviews you know how much Fumi has my heart. I will remember this series for a very long time. \\n\\n\r\nThere you have it, if you don't mind a slow start, and taking in a bit of character building before the movement really gets started, you really can't go wrong here. This is a love story but more so a story of how love helps the girls learn and grow in their own lives. It's not the girls that move the romance, it's the romance that facilitates the girls' growing up. You better believe senpai and Yuu made the Great RTLR wall of anime goodness! All three thumbs up! (what you don't have three thumbs?)",

Eventually Yuu stops resisting and tells Nanami to just do whatever she wants to her, which Nanami would have done anyway. Yuu never loves Nanami back but eventually they become closes friends, which causes me to realize how twisted this show is - Just keep on sexually exploiting someone and she'll eventually be your BFF.\\n\r\nI said this should be rated 18+ because I seriously hope no love-sick teenager ever watches this and thinks this is actually love or romance.\\n\r\nThe last 3-4 episodes have more depth in them and focus on Nanami's past.

This show was not originally in my watchlist for the season, because it seemed like another version of Citrus which was utterly disappointing. While this show isn't as horrible as Citrus, it definitely IMO is overrated atm.\r\nThe animation and art are good at expressing the facial expressions, but there are some moments where the faces and art just seem dull. \r\nThe plot and story are interesting, but after episode5 or so most interactions are cliche. This show is obviously not a drama but with little intuition, it's almost obvious what is going to happen. Honestly, I was expecting the relationship to face more difficulties,\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show isn't as horrible as Citrus. The show has more enjoyable elements, no over-excessive fanservice, and decent art/sound. However, it is definitely overrated ATM which is probably due to the small viewer base and the number of ratings.\\n\\n\r\nAt the time of writing this, the show has 2x fewer members and 4x fewer ratings than Citrus. The rating for this show has been slowly dropping as more people contribute and it'll probably balance out in the low 7 range. \\n",

And that's because the story is pretty cerebral, lots of internal thought processes and monologue going on, but for myself that's where the beauty lies in Yagate Kimi ni Naru. We get to see everyone's inner world, the way their minds have shaped the reality around them.\r\nAnd obviously not everyone would consider this enjoyable.

            "content": "THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS.\r\nBloom Into You is a show about finding the feeling of love and the ways of expressing it. It is a fresh look on the shounen-ai genre which lacks a good shows about girls love. The story follows 2 main heroines, Yuu Kaito and Nanami Touko. Both of them do not know what love is, because they could never feel it, and this is what connected them or rather, convinced Nanami to confess her feelings to Yuu. The confession was astonishing, it happened out of nowhere, and that gave this series a powerful boost from the start. The nextepisodes shows an unusual relationship between two main heroines. Nanami need the feeling of loving someone even if the target of her love doesn't care, and then comes our second heroine, Yuu Kaito who is like a black hole that absorbs Nanami's feelings. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what is good about this show? Well, for sure it's a story writing and the character of Yuu. The topic of homosexual relationships is generally difficult to talk about and it also may be really controversial. Bloom Into You presents it in a very warm and pleasant way. The dialogues have \"slice of life\" aura making the whole relationship easy to empathize with. Nanami is relieved every time he sees Yuu, all her stress is disappearing in a moment when she talks with her. Okay, but what about Yuu? What makes her character so great? It is mainly her development throughout the series. We meet Yuu as a person who looks like she doesn't care about anything, of course she isn't an emotionless monster, the thing is that she never gets fully involved in anything. The more time she spends with Nanami the more she is changing. Yuu is always there for Nanami, she is starting to get involved in things that she doesn't even like, just because Nanami needs her. It can be seen as a Yuu's journey to finding the true feeling of love. The music and the art was good, because it fitted perfectly to this series and his genre, just like I imaged shounen-ai anime. The beautiful soft and music that carried the atmosphere. The art with charming bright colors and colorful style.\\n\\n\r\nNow we can get to the bad side of the show. I said that story writing is a good said of this series, but from a particular scene it begins to fall apart. We find out that Nanami has some existential issues. It may sound very weird, and it is. Basically she wants to become her beloved sister, or rather, she feels like she is obligated to. Is isn't really necessary to this series, because it's stealing the main show which is the shounen-ai genre. However, it somehow explains Nanami feelings toward Yuu, because she can rest and be herself with her, and no longer pretend to be someone else. From this point I felt like I am watching some average drama. Moreover, the background characters were really poor developed that their existence did not bring anything to the series, except Sayaka. We got some lesbian pair, for no particular reason, like the series tried to tell us that \"it's okay to be gay\". Though, I really liked the background story of the Sayaka but it was way too short. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, I really enjoyed this series, even if the second half was not that good. I think that it is a really well-made show but not really thought out. \\n\\n\r\nActually I should have give it 6/10 but i really liked the atmosphere.",

            "content": "This anime strikes me as a sort of soap opera. I don't really know how to review it as it was kind of bland yet interesting the whole way through. Whatever, I'll give it a go.\r\nSo, the story had potential. I think the characters being what they were allowed for a really inspirational story. The idea of a person becoming someone else because they hated who they were is a really touching idea. However, this anime didn't pull it off as well as it could've. It sort of focused in on the romance aspect of the story before focusing in on the main characters andhow they could change each other for the better. Romance took the priority, and it wasn't the best thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty decent, as I said, they were just a little bit boring. Again, they had the potential to really change and develop, but they didn't. They stayed pretty stagnant up til the end. I think their stories could've been done a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was gorgeous, so you won't have a problem with this anime on that front. Other than that, I'd say this anime was alright if you're interested in it, but if it seems eh to you, then don't bother. I had a decent time watching it, at least.",

            "content": "Story is very good and I feel pretty realistic of someone starting to realize that contrary to the societal pressure they feel constantly, they are infact drawn to the same sex. Japanese culture is still very severe on homosexuals and being one can often lead to being shunned in a professional setting making it hard to find work other than bottom rung things if you are more open about your sexuality.\r\nThe relationship dynamics are really well done, I enjoy the sound and the art quality is plain but enjoyable. The main stand out and the only thing that will really keep you coming back isthe Characters and their story more than the sound and art. \\n\\n\r\nThe story though is where I personally lose my enjoyment. It's a tease and it is very frustrating. Episode 13 currently is where it leaves off and I feel that like with many other very good romance anime that the series is all just a long advertisement for the Manga or light novels. The cliff hangar is so large that pretty much the entire series answers few if any questions of the plot and just leaves everything hanging in the air like \"wanna find out what happens next? too bad! go read our other content for those answers ya tosser!\"\\n\\n\r\nCan't really give a more than average review for something if it can't even wrap up the main part of the plot.",

            "content": "-This review contains major spoilers-\r\nThis is probably the best series I have seen that I would never recommened to anyone. That might sound strange, so let me explain.\r\nThis series is pretty good. Some might even say fantastic. And that in pretty much every aspect. The characters feel real and believable, The animation ranges from good to breathtaking and the story/main relationship is very well handled.\r\nThe reason I would still never recommend this series to anyone despite all of its amazing atributes is one simple fact: It doesn't end, it simply stops. Now, being an adaptation of a still ongoing manga, that is nothing out ofthe ordinary and has happened with many other series as well. However, it is a bit different in this case.\\n\\n\r\nThe main bulk of the series' second half focuses on the play the student council is preparing for the culture festival. This play is the obvious emotional climax that the feelings of every single character are building towards. Touko feels that she has to do the play for her sister, but is also unsure whether the sister she knew even existed. Yuu wants to help Touko by means of the play, but also wants attention for herself. It is clear that this play will be a very important turning point in the narrative. However, the anime never gets to that point, rendering the second half of the series effectively pointless unlike other shows with incomplete endings which most of the time stop at the end of an arc, not in the middle of one.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, if anyone were to ask me whether or not I'd recommend them this series, I happily point them towards the manga instead. It has the same story and will actually finish it one day, which does not seem likely with the anime at this moment. However, even if a continuation were to be released one day, it wouldn't change the fact that the series was originally supposed to end without any conclusion.\\n\\n",
