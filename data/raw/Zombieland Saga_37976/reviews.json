But that ain\u2019t shit!!!  Because having the zombie versions of Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash (MY LITTLE PONY, PEOPLE!!!), break out in a rap battle while TAE YAMADA\u2019s head goes flying into the audience during a rock/pop/rap concert was about as excessivelybodacious as you can get, because\u2026\u2026\u2026wait a minute?

Koutarou exhibits all the extraordinary qualities each man should be striving for in their lives, including: excessive yelling, being a bad-ass, shouting profusely, dressing to the nines, screaming at the top of his lungs, wearing shades inside a dimly lit prison cell, etc., etc., etc.,\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.and shrieking with reckless abandon.

            "content": "Doesn't it feel like in today\u2019s world, there\u2019s way too many horror media that does same things over and over again? I\u2019m not solely talking about anime alone but the horror genre has gotten to a point where it feels like we\u2019ve seen just about anything. One of the most iconic type of horror is the dead coming back to life. In this case, I\u2019m referring to zombies. Franchises like Resident Evil and The Walking Dead are among just a few well-known ones that comes to mind. But what if I told you that Zombieland Saga manages to revitalize a bit of the horror genreinstead of falling to common cliches? \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, Zombieland Saga isn\u2019t really a horror show at all although the first episode\u2019s opening suggests so with a clich\u00e9 setting and a young girl facing a crisis between life and death. It manages to trick viewers through its opening and does a 180 degree turn after revealing the series\u2019 real concept \u2013 a horror comedy that satirze Japanese idols with an absurd character cast. As a collaboration project by Cygames and Avex pictures (with studio MAPPA), they managed to keep this show a secret from the start. \\n\\n\r\nNow that we got that out of the way, it\u2019s time to realize what Zombieland Saga really offers. I watched plenty of zombie shows in the past and most of it attempts to do the same things over and over again \u2013 evoke a sense of fear. Zombieland Saga does the opposite and creates a sensation of genuine entertainment with its comedy elements. In fact, I\u2019d say the show is self-aware enough to satirize the idol industry. In the first few episodes, protagonist Sakura Minamoto ends up dead after being hit a trick. But rather than awakening in some fantasy world, she is reborn as a zombie. It doesn\u2019t take long for her to join a group with other zombie girls together. This group collectively is formed by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi with the purpose to save the Saga Prefecture. Say hello to Franchoucou.\\n\\n\r\nIdeally, a show like this sounds like it took a big risk as it sounds like a dumb joke of itself. Watching Zombieland Saga does feel like the show plays with itself a bit too much but it didn\u2019t take long for me to accept and grow attached to the main characters. That\u2019s because each of them have a life of their own with colorful personalities. As an inspiring idol, Sakura\u2019s dream became a reality when she steps onto the stage. Sakura\u2019s friendly personality enables her to easily get along with everyone. That\u2019s the opposite of delinquent yankee, Saki Nikaido. Unlike Sakura, she is difficult to get along with because of her tough personality. Deep down though, Saki isn\u2019t a malevolent character and in fact manages to develop some deeper bonds with her idol comrades. We also meet Ai Mizuno, a girl who desire to make the best of her current life. Junko Konno, Lily Hoshikawa, and Tae Yamada make up the rest of the group after being reborn. Despite dying under different circumstances, they all serve the same purpose and that\u2019s to make their group into a sensation. \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably asking yourself if Franchoucou really is a sensation in their world. They didn\u2019t start out with popularity and instead had to work their way up. Through hard work and motivation, the group does gain popularity as Sakura leads them to stardom. My interest for the show grew more and more as I wanted to see this group succeed. It also helped that the show constantly got me feel attached to the characters through effective storytelling. We learn of their past, their motivations, and what they hope to accomplish in the present. There are also some episodes that throws in some surprising plot twists and bittersweet ending moments. I\u2019m not going to spoil it but it manages to become even emotional at times so prepare for some tissues.\\n\\n\r\nAs a horror/idol comedy, the show contains countless amount of humorous gags. Most of the humor revolves around the concept of zombies. Characters retain personalities from their past lives but sometimes finds themselves surprised by unnatural events. This often includes body parts coming off unintentionally that\u2019s played with absurdity. The guiltiest member of the group that people will point fingers at would be Tae Yamada, the legendary title-less girl. Unlike the rest, she has yet to regain her personality and behaves like a zombie. She has an unhealthy appetite that seems to have a personality of a kid stuck in an adult\u2019s body. The show constantly pokes fun at her character by showing what zombies can do. It\u2019s the type of satirical humor that is aware of its intentions and seeks to make the audience laugh. And to be honest, it works. \\n\\n\r\nSo now what? Is this just a show of humor nonsense or is there something bigger that meets the eye? It honestly depends on how you approach this show. The more I watched Zombieland Saga, the more I felt compelled to see how different this anime is compared to other genres of similar nature. In fact, I\u2019d say that Zombieland Saga offers an experience that is refreshing by mixing in comedy with musical themes. It\u2019s not often you get to see these two mixed together in today\u2019s world. The project creators managed to effectively create a fakeout of the show from the first episode while ultimately making this into a parody. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. You\u2019ll still occasionally see some \u201chorror\u201d content pop up but it satirizes to make it absurd as possible. \\n\\n\r\nIt should also be said that the voicing cast of this show deserves recognition for their talent. In particular, voice actress veteran Kotono Mitsuishi plays her role as Tae Yamada flawlessly. She\u2019s able to step into the shoes of her character with the mindset of a zombie. Others such as Asami Tano is able to take on their character role as a yankee and her accent proves it. As a show about idols, you should also expect tons of catchy songs. While most of them relates to J-pop, there are occasional times when the show throws in a surprise or two such as a battle rap in one particular episode. The bottom line is, this is so much more than just a horror-idol comedy as it also manages to embrace its music culture. \\n\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA did it again. They managed to create a show that not only surprised me but also give the zombie concept a breath of fresh air. Zombieland Saga manages to reinvent itself by stepping out of the comfort zone. It satirizes the idol industry by combining its self-aware humor and absurd character cast. Yet, it manages to deliver effective storytelling that is important for the overall direction of the show. As I learned more and more about the characters, it felt hard to let them to go when everything concluded. By accomplishing such a feat, this anime is definitely a sensation to take attention to. The secret is out now and it\u2019s easy to say that I need more anime like Zombieland Saga in my life.",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga is unironically the best anime of Fall 2018.\r\nLet me tell you a little story. Once Upon a Time, I got hooked on the idol genre, and descended into what is commonly referred to as idol hell. However, contrary to popular belief, I was able to snap out of my zombie like trance and escape from idol hell, and I can happily say that I\u2019ve been clean for over two years. No longer having an interest in idol anime, I had no inclination to watch Zombieland Saga, and had planned on skipping it. What a sad, misguided fool the me of three or somonths ago was\u2026anyway, I eventually got around to watching it thanks to my weak mind being influenced by Youtube videos that told me to give this anime a shot. In this review, I\u2019ll explain to you why Zombieland Saga isn\u2019t just great for it\u2019s drop-dead hilarity and entertainment value, but for its unexpected complexity that you might just miss out on if you just skim the surface of this surprisingly great anime.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right, this is actually going to be a somewhat intricate review since Zombieland Saga is totally worth analyzing. So if you don\u2019t have much time and have to Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!, here\u2019s a little tl;dr for you: I came for the quirky idol shenanigans + zombies combo, stayed for the amazing comedy, and left absolutely loving the diverse and both figuratively and literally fleshed out characters (Get it? Cuz they\u2019re zombies?)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really hits like a truck in how quickly it transitions from a seemingly typical idol anime opening sequence what with our heroine Sakura\u2019s upbeat and energetic disposition to an intense and hilarious death scene backed by heavy metal music after like 30 seconds into the first episode. I was instantly hooked after this unique beginning, and the anime just got better from there. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no spoiler to say that our protagonist is as dead as someone who, well, died. However, she is revived via necromancy by a sunglasses wearing manager dude named Koutarou who also brought back six other SUPER LEGENDARY girls from the dead all for the purpose of them forming an idol group with the monumental goal of saving a declining Saga.\\n\\n\r\nIf that sentence long synopsis doesn\u2019t get you to tingle with excitement in anticipation to see where the heck this anime goes, then I don\u2019t know what will. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no secret to say that I didn\u2019t watch this anime hoping to find something with a compelling narrative and developed characters and was instead looking for something that would make me smile in amusement. And I can happily say that Zombieland Saga made me die of laughter (Don\u2019t worry about me though, I was brought back to life\u2026Though sadly not as a LEGENDARY zombie idol) This is the funniest anime that I\u2019ve seen all year, even beating out good comedy anime like Grand Blue and How Not to Summon a Demon Lord. Each episode contains a plethora of comedic moments, and there was always something new and creative so it never felt like I was watching the same routine with each passing episode. Now if the good comedy was all Zombieland Saga had, I would have been perfectly content with the anime and left satisfied. However, there is so much more to this anime than that, and its greatest strengths revolve around the cast.\\n\\n\r\nYou really can\u2019t go wrong when your characters are a bunch of LEGENDARY girls in an idol group called FranChouChou. Outside of Sakura, who suffers from memory loss, a typical anime trope that Zombieland Saga actually executes better than literally every other anime that utilizes memory loss, our girls include my personal favorite, the LEGENDARY Saki Nikaidou, a fiery, outgoing girl whose voice and character design are so hot that they make me catch on fire. Plus she\u2019s a rapping biker girl who likes chicken and goes down in a blaze of glory TWICE. I guess the perfect girl does exist. We also have Ai Mizuno, a girl who was a successful idol in life who had a simply LEGENDARY death after giving one last electrifying performance. Let\u2019s not forget the soft spoken yet powerhouse vocalist Junko Konno, whose LEGENDARY rise to stardom may have been cut short by an unexpected crash and burn, but she lives on in our hearts\u2026and as a zombie. Lily Hoshikawa is a kawaii girl who was a LEGENDARY child actress who unfortunately ended up in a hairy situation that her little heart just couldn\u2019t take. Still, she\u2019s a true star, and her cuteness is infectious. Next, we have the ever enticing and LEGENDARY Yuugiri, who is the most experienced of the girls in more ways then one. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have THE LEGENDARY TAE YAMADA, and thanks to her inclusion as the star of the show, I was practically mandated by the animu gods to bump up my score for this anime by a full point. So yeah, the girls in this anime are pretty\u2026Illustrious. \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ll notice that the girls all lived in different eras, so they obviously were exposed to different cultures based on the times that they lived in. A lesser anime would have glazed over this fact, but not Zombieland Saga, and this was the point that I realized that this anime was something special. Junko and Ai were to first to go through compelling character arcs, and their stories were pretty engaging, and set the stage for the upcoming character arcs. The episode dedicated to Lily was, to put it bluntly, LEGENDARY. Zombieland Saga had done it. It became the first anime I\u2019ve ever seen to make me laugh hysterically AND be brought to the verge of tears thanks to an incredibly well produced character driven episode. I didn\u2019t think anything could top the epicness of the rap battle, but the emotions I felt thanks to Lily\u2019s story certainly did. I was trapped in a sea of emotions throughout the entire episode, and I could probably write an entire review just dedicated to that episode alone. Seriously though, I have never seen an anime handle Lily\u2019s character type nearly as well as Zombieland Saga did, and at the end of the day, Lily is Lily. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, it goes without saying that Saki\u2019s episode was pure greatness. Saki is just that good.\\n\\n\r\nA strong demonstration of camaraderie between characters is something that I rarely see sufficiently executed in anime. So imagine my shock when I realized that Zombieland Saga of all things was able to pull it off. The bonds that these characters have with each other grew from constant arguments and not being on the same page in the first few episodes into an in sync family who would do anything to help each other out. This is demonstrated the clearest near the end of the anime. I won\u2019t spoil exactly what, but something happens to Sakura that causes a rift between her and her fellow zombies. The way that all of the girls try to get her back to her old self is extremely heartwarming, and it really goes to show how far these girls have come. And thanks to their positive relationship with one other, they\u2019re able to put on some spectacular performances. And now we get to the other great part about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIts music is hella good.\\n\\n\r\nFor the past several weeks I\u2019ve been listening to the opening theme song, Adabana Necromancy, constantly. I play it when I eat. I play it when I sleep. I\u2019m playing it as I\u2019m writing this review. It\u2019s a pretty damn good song. And you know what else is good? Literally every insert song in this anime. I\u2019ve already mentioned the rap battle, which was pretty off the chain. Lily\u2019s song and Saki\u2019s song are two personal favorites of mine, and every musical number in this show is just really catchy. If FranChouChou ever put on a show irl, you better believe I\u2019d buy tickets to go and see them, and I would be screaming and crying at the awesomeness alongside those two heavy metal guys who\u2019ve attended every show that the girls have put on. Seriously though, those two guys really are the unsung MVPs of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the voice acting, as Phil from Hercules would say, I\u2019ve got three words for ya: My Man Miyano Mamoru! This boi is my favorite male seiyuu, and his performance as Koutarou is simply LEGENDARY.  Some of the best comedy from this anime comes from the combination of Koutarou\u2019s absurd lines plus Mamoru\u2019s expert delivery of them. And of course, the ladies voicing our lovely zombie idols do an exceptional job. And they even got the LEGENDARY voice actress of Usagi from Sailor Moon to voice the LEGENDARY Tae Yamada. I didn't expect anything less. \\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, this anime is animated quite well. I love the character designs, and the fluidity of their movements during scenes like the rap battle and Lily\u2019s song is very impressive. But there\u2019s one glaring issue with the visuals, and I\u2019m sure you know exactly what I\u2019m referring to. You guessed it, I\u2019m talking about none other than the CGI.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is an acronym that I made for Cute Girl Idols.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right, as I said before, these cute girl idols are drawn to look pretty attractive, but they\u2019re, you know, rotting corpses, and I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m not into necrophilia. Yet the girls\u2019 cutesy designs have consistently tempted me throughout the anime\u2019s run time, which has been problematic since it\u2019s called into question my morality and\u2026Oh wait, you thought by CGI I meant the Computer Generated Imagery that this anime scarcely deploys? The CGI implemented during some of the dance sequences that is literally used for less then ten minutes of the entire anime\u2019s run time and doesn\u2019t look nearly as bad as people make it out to be? Well personally, I have absolutely no qualms with the CGI. There\u2019s definitely worse out there, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga impressed me. It put a fun twist on the idol genre that not only made it incredibly entertaining to watch, but also allowed it to develop some truly great and unique characters. I haven\u2019t enjoyed watching an anime this much in a long time. And if you haven\u2019t watched this anime yet, you really should Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! and watch it as soon as possible. It just isn\u2019t right to miss out on such a LEGENDARY anime.",

            "content": "If this had been my first idol anime, I would have been gravely confused when watching the second.\r\nZombieland Saga is a story about these cute anime girls who die, then come back as zombies and start making badass heavy metal music / stand up comedy / rap battles in a comedic manner. \r\nThe creativity of this series pretty much ends with its idea for main characters. Outside few nice ideas, such as diving into the audience before the music even starts playing and the Hunter x Hunter parody seen in episode 02, I can't say many scenes have made me laugh or felt satisfactory. Vastmajority of the events that occur and scenes that play aren't nearly as bizarre or weird as they have potential to be. It's pretty basic stuff which pretty much anyone could have written. For example, the rap battle lyrics are pretty much just filler. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of the comedy is executed with and relying on voice acting. The guy who voiced Okabe is here as the main dude and once again offering zero personality, all yelling. It's not entertaining the least, just stupid. Same thing occurs with great many side characters who realize that our girls are actually zombies. Cop yells, other side characters yell, our female main characters yell. End of story. I am not personally finding much enjoyment from scenes such as these. If I want to watch people yell, I watch shonen anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design from heavy metal audience to the main chicks gets a plus. This is pretty based MAPPA production for that matter. It looks glorious outside the weird lipsync issues that are over exaggerated mouth movements to a point that it comes highly visible. Or that's what I thought before I saw episode 03 and that god awful CGI dance scene they used there. Beyond ugly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this series doesn't have much to say nor do I have much to say about it. It relies on the slice of life side of being a zombie, it is already getting old because it's lacking in content, becoming repetitive and the cast isn't strong enough to carry anything with their miniscule personalities. Yamada is pretty hot tho.",

I'd definitely recommend you at least try it out, though it will not be for everyone.\r\nAlso sports a cameo by everyone's favorite Truck-kun.\r\nStory - So far the story itself is quite simplistic, but it is full of charm and humor, which is rare for me to like but it meshes well.\r\nArt - Typical of the art style in this decade, its the weakestpart of the show. Not because it is bad but because it is rather generic.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The sound design itself is the most surprising element once you get past the shock of the opening few minutes, the songs are well put together, and the sound design is catchy. It is rather unconventional, which may turn away potential viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Many of the characters are yet to be developed as of episode 2, but so far the MC and Tae are definite stand outs. I look forward to the development of the cast, and the character designs are fantastic. \\n\r\nMiyano Mamoru has particularly good voicework for his character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - So far I have laughed out loud at least once an episode, a rarity these days. I quite enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - A solid 8 so far, with potential to slip to a 7 or raise to a 9 depending on how the show develops.",

            "content": "It\u2019s pretty clear that in today\u2019s society, anime seems to be churned out in droves. You bare witness to the regurgitation of carbon copies, causing the medium you hold dear to fade into the bleakest grey...\r\nAnd then Zombieland Saga busts in through the fucking window in a speeding minivan going 156 mph, shouting \u201cFUCK YOU; GET IN\u201d before flooring it faster than you can say \u201cThe Legendary TAE YAMADA!\u201d It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s quirky, it\u2019s loud as all hell, and most importantly, it\u2019s as vivid as a sunset. Sure, your weeaboo mancave of a room is busted and your waifu collection is in pieces, but weall know you\u2019ll replace that with a shrine dedicated to a bunch of zombie idols in no time. You\u2019ll get used to it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWe should probably get the most colorful, charming parts of this show out of the way. These visuals pop. The colors strike like God\u2019s lightning, especially in both the opening and ending. These character designs are as bombastic as the personalities of the girls when they\u2019re off doing weird hijinks. Their facial expressions and clothes are so glorious that it\u2019s easy to forget that you only give a shit about like half the characters until their pasts get revealed. Sure, there are some fugly CGI idol models in a couple of dance sequences early on, but then we get oil paintings for menus and real-life footage. Studio MAPPA poured their blood, sweat, and tears into injecting nothing but style into this show.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of hijinks, there\u2019s a ton of variety in these spectacles. Horror movie/game parodying, playing hot potato with Tae\u2019s severed head, fucking chicken performances and rap battles?! How can anyone object to this?! This is a perfect venue for vibrant character chemistry, as evidenced by the two best characters in the show, Saki and The Legendary Tae Yamada! These two embody the best aspects of the show, with them getting a majority of the best gags. Saki\u2019s loud and abrasive personality makes for perfect chemistry fodder with the rest of the cast, and the inner machinations of Tae Yamada\u2019s mind are an enigma. She is a joy to witness.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters took a while to become even remotely interesting, and this is for a few reasons. For one, several of the main characters are often more drama focused. While this isn\u2019t a bad thing on its own, not only are the personalities of characters such as Junko and Ai not very interesting, but given the limited time spent on drama in comparison to everything else in the first 4 episodes, the drama often feels like a detour. Admittedly, very few of these characters are that great when they aren\u2019t dealing with absurd scenarios, but some are especially dull early on. The latter half thankfully has episodes designed around fleshing out the characters and giving them an emotional arc, but not every character gets this luxury. Granted, none of the main 7 idols are as grating as their manager Kotaro (cuz that guy can get fucked by a cactus more than half the time) but the show still has a hard time giving everyone the spotlight. Thankfully some of the side characters introduced in some of these character-centric mini-stories are written and explored efficiently. Without them, the drama-centered focus of the second half would have felt like an agonizing shift considering how lackluster the more serious portions of the show felt beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing left to touch on is the music. The background tracks are catchy, with neat jingles to compliment the lighthearted and comedic moments. However, the real meat comes in the form of the songs by everyone in this idol group: Franchouchou. The OP \"Adabana Necromancy\u201d is as vivid as the visuals that it plays over, and the watercolor visuals really help sell the emotional ED \"Hikari e\u201d. As for the insert idol tracks, several of them are pretty nice to listen to as well, with the only real exception being the ear-piercing Vocaloid-esque song that plays at the end of the 7th episode. It would be rather ghastly if these performances sounded dead, so thank the maker this ain\u2019t the case.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s refreshing to have an anime run you over, screaming. It calms down, and there are some growing pains, but I\u2019m happy to see some life here. There\u2019s a vivid pulse to this one, a wild and unique expression so charming and sincere that I nearly overlook how uneven and easy to break this show can be. With this performance now over, it\u2019s your turn to take part in the saga. What are you waiting for? Do it while you\u2019re still alive!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Tae Yamada dabs in episode 7, so that\u2019s an Easter egg to look out for.\\n\\n\r\nWritten/Edited by: CodeBlazeFate \\n\r\nProofread by: Peregrine",

            "content": "\u201cAnother idol Anime!\u201d A lot of eye rolling and sighs going into this series, though the fact that it was an original, I was intrigued enough to give it a chance. The first episode makes a loud statement on what it\u2019s about, taking only a few minutes to set up its \u201cfirst day of school\u201d clich\u00e9 before crashing the premise of the show which is under the guise of everyone\u2019s favourite automobile in \u201cTruck-kun,\u201d into our main heroine in Sakura Minamoto, and the audience. It\u2019s so unexpected, it\u2019s so shocking and the timing couldn\u2019t be any better, it immediately has you in a fit oflaughter. \\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn\u2019t end there, luckily, exactly ten years later, the mysterious music producer Koutaro Tatsumi decides he's going to put together a legendary idol group called, Franchouchou. Thanks to some behind-the-curtain methods, he can assemble the world's seven greatest singers and dancers\u2014who are dead in order to inject some liveliness into Japan\u2019s Saga prefecture. Which is how Sakura finds herself terrified and confused in a house full of dead girls. If you couldn\u2019t tell at this point, Zombieland Saga is an imitation on the popular sub-genres of idols and zombies with a twist to create many bizarre, strange, amusing, hilarious and unexpected moments. It uses exaggeration, inversion and trivialization effortlessly\u2014zombie addicts will be surprised to find that it\u2019s not your typical \u201csurvive the zombie apocalypse\u201d archetype but uses the trope of zombies to establish a unique stage for an idol series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are breathing moments as it cleverly takes a step away from the blistering comedy, every now and then to pull back the curtain a bit on the main story for some social commentary on the dark side of the idol industry as well as alluding to some interesting themes that provokes a lot of thought and feelings which was more prevalent in episode six, \u201cBecause It\u2019s Sentimental SAGA.\u201d Unfortunately, the latter end of the series, it lingered on this aspect a bit too long when chronicling Sakura\u2019s origins. It upsets the tone too much, taking away the charm and hilarity that gives this anime much of its punch. Luckily, there are characters who prove to be the perfect counter-balance when these tonal shifts occur, like Koutarou, the manager of the girls, an over-the-top type of persona, voiced by the legendary voice actor Mamoru Miyano. He is the perfect casting choice, he makes Koutarou special in a way where every time he appears on screen, you know something special is about to take place, which normally leaves you in hysterics. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, there is a colourful cast of characters as well, with a selection of idols who run quite a range of personalities. The interactions and dialogues between them never feel overly sappy or dull, most of the shows best moments come when these personalities are colliding with each other. Each one gets there 1 or 2 episodes of shine time that sheds light into their backstories, their current conflict and then a resolution to said conflict where we can see some character development and chemistry take place. Zombieland Saga is the type of anime that has characters who will happily tear each other apart, both figuratively and literally, and it's nice to see them not hold back. It is absolutely a comedy first, with missing limbs, heads popping off all over the place and some hilarious ways of dying, yes, I am looking at you, Lily! And when it sticks to the winning formula, the show doesn\u2019t feel derivative but, feels refreshingly unique, and all it took was mashing GCDCT and horror elements together.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, MAPPA has been nothing short of impressive, seeing that this is an original series. Surprisingly enough, they were able to maintain a solid consistency level throughout the show with its art and animation with the occasional drops in production value. Character designs alone tell the personalities of each character, they are somewhat distinctive but when assembled, it\u2019s easier to see that certain features are generic. And for a parody show such as Zombieland Saga, it works. The zombified looks go hand in hand with the slapstick, and as to be expected, along with the facial expressions and the way their limbs were flying around all over the place was very well animated. The colour palette is very bright, vibrant and sometimes has this watercolour paint look to it. The downside here is definitely in several moments when they did their idol performances, the sequences were in cringe CGI and it wasn\u2019t the pretty kind at all. Apart from that, the job they did on performances such as the Babymetal scene in episode 1, the Battle Rap scene in episode 2 and the Fast food commercial scene in episode 5 won me over.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, MAPPA nailed the OP with the perfect song choice and visuals. \"Adabana Necromancy\" by Fran Chou Chou is a tribute to the music used in anime series openings from the late sixties to late seventies. Especially anime of the genre in action and mecha. The musical arrangements dominated by trumpets, violins, the background lyric chorus and quick tempo. Some of these openings also used sound effects in the action sequences. Its bodacious and balls to the wall seeing these power ranger-like zombie girls throwing shapes. The ED \"Hikari e\" which is also done by Fran Chou Chou, is sincere and beautiful, full of farewells and gratitude, similar to graduation songs. The soundtrack has a few memorable songs, very catchy and although they are repeatedly played often, it\u2019s never annoying. The idol songs are the type of musical items that you\u2019d get from your typical idol anime. The casting for this show is perfect and it is very hard to imagine each character being replaced.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s nice is that each of these girls\u2019 lives was cut short, they have been given a second chance to live out their dreams. The sentimental moments are good in between all the goofs and laughs. It is similar to Asobi Asobase in terms of a good unexpected comedy, it\u2019s absurd yet grounded when it needs to be. Despite a few glaring flaws, it definitely feels as if it achieved what it set out to be and Zombieland Saga deserves its credit for taking the idol show rulebook and rewriting some pages, changing the game in the oversaturated sub-genre that is filled with shows that shy away from taking chances. You'd have to be dead inside not to laugh while watching this. In fact, they're head and shoulders above most comedy anime this year, not giving it a chance would be a grave mistake.\\n",

            "content": "If there was a word to describe Studio MAPPA it would be disappointing. Being the spiritual successor for Studio Madhouse many of the shows least, in my opinion, fell flat in they face mainly because MAPPA loves the play the field spell card called style over substance where the writing for these shows seemed to fall by the side in favour of pretty colours and flashing scenes. Because of that I grown to dislike MAPPA as a whole as they seem to prioritised flashing visuals over storytelling. Zombieland Saga is, unfortunately, no exception to this as despite the show being advertised as a parody idolanime that had a lot of potential to be good. Unfortunately it the end it ended being another generic seasonal anime that you will easily forget once the anime season is over.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nIn the year 2008 high school girl named Sakura Minamoto is abruptly killed in a traffic accident by a truck. Ten years later, Sakura, along with six \"legendary\" girls from various eras of Japan's history, are brought back as zombies by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi, who seeks to save Saga Prefecture by putting together an all-zombie idol group known as Franchouchou.\\n\\n\r\nIf where was a two words to describe the story of Zombieland Saga it would be missed potential as the series had potential to be this fun parody of the idol genre as a whole would made me laugh for days. Unfortunately as the series progresses the series starts falling apart as it eventually showed it's true itself where it ended up being a generic idol anime that barely doesn't do anything different apart from the zombie-idol gimmick. Before I talk about the problems with Zombieland Saga I'm going to talk to quickly talk about the things that I liked about Zomebieland Saga.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that sold me watching Zombieland Saga is that it was a nice parody of the idol genre as it showcases all the tropes and elements that were using in the idol anime genre and no surprise the first 4 episodes actually did just that as it never took itself too seriously.\\n\r\nThe best and most memorable part of Zombieland Saga was the rap battle in episode 2. Not only the rap battle was very hilarious and entertaining to watch from start to finish, but it was very well set up and timed narrative and visually\\n\r\nIf only the rest of the series was as consistently good as the rap battle in episode 2 and with that said it's times to dive into this show problems.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when I said that Zombieland is a nice parody of the idol genre. Well the second half did something that it should have not done and that is devolved into a generic copy and paste idol anime where not even the zombie idol gimmick can fully save it. Many character drama aspects in this show were copied and pasted from other anime of it's generic and the dialogue just became trying. It did have some story moments with Saki and Sakura but other than that the show complete loss of what it made it unique in the first as it sadly devolved into a generic idol anime.\\n\r\nThe worst thing about Zombieland Saga is that simply not all that funny as many of the comedy comes in the form of characters doing dumb things and screaming. The comedy timing was terrible for the most part and many of the jokes ended up becoming forced and boring.\\n\r\nOverall, despite the show being a decent parody of the idol genre that has an interesting zombie gimmick it ultimately ended falling apart into this generic style over substance anime that lost a lot of charm.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in Zombieland Saga were just okay. Not memorable but at the same time they are not bad.\\n\r\nThis may come off as an unpopular opinion, but I don't like the producer Tasumi all that much. Yes, he had some cool moments every now and then but a lot of the time I found him pretty irritating especially when most of his dialogue is consistent screaming and screeching at set idol.\\n\r\nAs for the zombie-idol girls themselves well I thought there was one note. Yes, there was 2 expectations being Saki and Sakura (which I will talk about in a bit) but other than that the zombie idol girls are nothing more but idol cliches on screen.\\n\r\nSaki was by far my favourite character in Zombieland Saga as well being the most entertaining. She may appear to a typical badass jerk at first especially to Sakura as the series progresses she slowly starts open up to Sakura after proving that she isn't as completely gutless. I really liked her character development in the series and it really shows in episode 9 where she meets up with her old best friend and biker gang. She proves to Reiko daughter that if she contiines acting the way that Saki did when she was alive then she would end up falling in the same fate that caused Saki to die.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWhat really made Saki my favourite character happens in episode 2 during the rap battle with Sakura \" Who cares if you've got memories\" \"you won't get to see your friends and your Tamagotchi's long dead\" We're done got it?!\\n\r\nSakura herself was a pretty good character. She as this typical idol protagonist archetype at first however as the series progresses she becomes more of an interesting and somewhat relatable character that we can relate. Her backstory in episode 11 was the prime example of this as perfectly showcases of what Sakura would have been as a person if she didn't get hit by truck kun and as a result, she starts going into heroic BSoD.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Zombieland Saga for the most part were pretty forgetful and at times lame. Yes, there was Saki and at times Sakura were good but it ultimately cannot save this gimmicky generic cast of characters.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nThe visuals in Zombieland Saga are a mixed bag. While it had a solid colour art-style that fits well with the setting of the series I feel the animation especially the CGI moments hold the visuals back from being great. The models both the human, and zombies are nicely drawn appealing to look at. The background scenery was decent, and lighting was solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself ranged from pretty good to okay. That's about it really. The only thing left I say about the show visuals is the use of CGI which was absolutely horrendous. I understand the show was meant to parody CGI in idol anime but there's a difference between actually parodying the CGI and actually making worse than thing that your parodying and Zombieland Saga officially hit the jackpot. MAPPA what the hell were you thinking?\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nFor a show that mainly focus of music I thought the soundtrack for Zombieland Saga to be underwhelming at best. It's not a soundtrack I consider to be awful, but it failed to impress me especially when many of the tracks in Zombleland Saga just comes off as generic background idol noise. While the soundtrack was lacking the insert songs completely make it up because they are actually pretty damm good. My favourite insert songs in the show would be Mezame Returner and Dance.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme Adabana Necromancy sung by zombie idols was a decent opening theme. While I really liked the opening visuals for it, I cannot say the same thing for the song itself which I found to be pretty forgetful.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Hikari e sung by the zombie idols was a pretty enjoyable ending that has a nice clamming song that contained good-looking visuals art.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe Seiyuus in the sub did a pretty good job with the roles that they were given. As much I don't like Tatsumi I thought Mamoru Miyano did a fantastic job voicing the character. Asami Tano as Saki was a also another great performance as she really made this hot headed badass girl come to life.\\n\r\nThe dub, on the other hand, is pretty bad as it's filled with mediocre to bad performances that actually ruins key scenes in the anime. Not only that but the comedy in the dub version is pretty insufferable to listen. Also let's not forget how Funimation was incredibly lazy when they decided to do the rap battle episode 2 because frankly they didn't bother to dub at all.\\n\r\nStick with the sub for this one.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nZombieland Saga is a bizarre series to judge. There were some strong areas that I really liked like Saki and Sakura, the rap battle in episode 2 and the idol parody stuff unfortunately the flaws in Zombieland Saga outweigh the good. Not only that but the same the series got to the second half the series devolved into this generic flashy idol anime that has a zombie gimmick that contains repetitive/forced comedy and underwhelming characters. If the series actually stocked to of idol parody routes than this show would have been one of the better animes of 2018 but we ultimately didn't get that and what we got instead was an idol anime that kinda overstayed it's welcome and should have been 10 to 6 episodes long instead of 12.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad series by any means but at the same time it's not all that memorable outside the rap battle and Saki's character development.\\n\r\nFinal Score 5/10",

At first I thought this anime would just be another copy of \"Highschool of the Dead\" but boy I was wrong. The cover art you are seeing now on MAL wasnt the first one that was displayed on the anime, the first one just had a bunch of spooky zombies on it, and that at first had me skeptical about the anime, as I first thought it would be nothing but chaos, gore and a failed attempt at copying \"Highschool of the Dead\".But it turns out that this anime has absolutly nothing to do with the previous mentioned one, in fact if you look at the genres of this anime, it has the \"Comedy\" and \"Music\" tag on it. Overall, I didnt expect the Story to turn out the way it is and I consider the story to be absolutly hilarious in a good manner. In fact, I have never laughed this hard after the first 2 minutes of an anime EVER! Overall I rate this anime a solid 7/10. Give it a go! Its quite funny indeed! <3\\n",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga is a comedy about a group of zombie girls being marketed as idols by a red suit-toting weirdo through unconventional and sometimes embarrassing means of gaining popularity.\r\nZombieland Saga is an idol drama about a group of zombie girls on a quest to become idols but are held back the the implications of their deaths, their past traumas, their memories and the era they lived in.\r\nZombieland Saga works great as either show.\r\nZombieland Saga doesn't work at all as both.\r\nBy trying to juggle these two ideas, it becomes a tangled up and comes short of fulfilling either of those premises satisfyingly. It's not that theshow transitioning between these ideas are jarring (in fact, it does that just fine), but rather, by trying to keep the first half of episodes comedy then leaving all the heavier stuff for later kind of chokes the pacing of those. As a result, character arcs and story threads, while fine, leave so much to be desired, especially with regards to Sakura. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fine. I enjoyed a lot of the comedic storyboarding, the hilarious character acting and expressions in early episode (1-5), as well entire sequences of Tatsumi Kotarou's screentime and dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is kinda shit. I didn't remember a single track, much less the BGM, so not much comment there other than forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a splendid job and, again, a ton of the script from the comedy episodes were fantastic and the did a good job with those.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a fine show. It's freaking hilarious when it wants to be and the writing is pretty alright, if not really unsatisfying. I recommend it if you have the time. (6/10)",

            "content": "This is my first review, so please bear with me.\r\nAlthough having not watched much if not any idol anime, it was intriguing to see a spin on this conventional genre. With a synopsis such as \"The peace these seven girls experience will suddenly be destroyed. By the living dead... zombies,\" I couldn't help but check the show out. Unfortunately, by the end of it all, it just felt like it fell flat.\r\nTo get straight to the point and not waste any time, let's look at the positives of this show. Firstly, I'll admit that it was quite enjoyable for what it was at times. Forexample, our main girl getting hit by truck-kun was a nice addition to the amount of destruction he has already done throughout the entire history of anime, and he may never stop... Events such as the infamous rap battle, and the general interactions between the idols could be pretty funny at times.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the character designs like of Saki and the rest of the group gave a unique style to each of the characters (exceptions being Junko and Ai, they look like copies of one another to an extent). Facial expressions were pretty nice, and to each of their own had a distinct sense of personality. The aforementioned Saki with her rough and daring ways of going about things, Lily being very ecstatic, and Yuugiri with her calm and collected tone made for characters that could stand on their own. It all may have felt pretty generic I might add, but for me it's at least worth mentioning as something it didn't completely fail on. However, it's nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme was pretty cool with the visuals I guess.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the negatives of this show made for the biggest gripes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was mixed. I had mentioned the character designs before as being fine, and the backgrounds and style of the show were pretty good and felt appropriate , but the consistent use of CGI dances however were absolutely horrendous.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, obviously being a parody, wasn't trying to take itself too seriously. This isn't a negative in in of itself, and is actually completely fine, however it seemed as if it couldn't hold that mentality together. Character development is fine and all, but serious overtones and unneeded drama was apparent throughout multiple parts of the story, and it almost felt like it was straying away from it's own purpose that it established from the beginning, as being a fun comedical straight forward show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music didn't catch on with me, and wasn't really engaging, just sounded pretty meh.\\n\\n\r\nThe manager could not manage himself. His loud and obnoxious yelling was not funny, and only set himself up as a failed comedian. Loud does not equal funny, and he should have either stuck to being mature as shown occasionally, or just a running gag. Combining the two just doesn't sit well (even if being voiced by Miyano Mamoru).\\n\\n\r\nTalking about running gags, the whole policeman and sudden interaction between the Idols was just as equally as bad, but thankfully it wasn't so repetitive and recurring that I had to sit through it constantly like the manager.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, possible spoilers or not, but it was hinted at several times where a couple of guys were interested in finding more about these idols and their true identity so to say. However, absolutely nothing happened with this, and only seemed to waste time, falsely leading the viewer to expect something interesting and dramatic to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime could have been better. If it had only stuck with what it set out to do, it could have been a pretty decent, or even good show. If you like the show and enjoy it despite my personal criticisms, that's totally fine, to each of their own. It was alright while it lasted, but again, ended falling flat with the issues I had with it. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and if their is anything I can improve on, feel free to let me know!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

But beware, they're just a jebait\r\nThe rest of the episodes are utter garbage and those who claim different have watched too much anime that they can't differentiate between something that's just awful and something that they find \"okay\"\r\nI really don't have much else to say, the first scene of the first episode is 10/10 but it's just downhill from there.\r\nI sincerly would recommend at least watching that first scene due to it's comedic value the way it's set up, but other than that I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this anime.\r\nThere's 6 episodes out currently, and only thefirst 2 episodes were enjoyable in the slightest. The comedy goes from \"haha okay that's kinda funny\" to \"just shut up, is there anything interesting at all anymore\", not kidding either that is my sincere view on this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI was originally planning on giving up just right away after I saw that third episode, but I gave it another episode and pretty much just skimmed through episode 5 and 6, there were moments that could have been done different that would have served great for comedic purpose and been in the same kind of flow like the first two episodes.. But no, just.. Basic idol stuff\\n\\n\r\nAnd just incase you're wondering, no I absolutely hate idol animes, they're usually just slight fanservice and garbage combined into one.\\n\\n\r\nStory, it's trash, it's just made up on the spot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent but I'm not going to give it a higher mark since it literally doesn't matter if everything else is shit.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is.. Meh, as I said I really dislike idol animes so I wont like the songs in this for obvious reasons other than the first 2 episodes as previously stated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, it's just bad, it's just stereo types, one screeching idiot and a couple of whiners.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, if I only watched the first 2 episodes I would actually give it a good score, but seeing as the majority of the episodes that are out makes me rather watch Boruto should speak volumes. There is no enjoyment to be had.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, trash anime with 2 jebait episodes that it wont be the typical trash idol anime. If you're going to watch more than 2 episodes anyway, I really do apologize that you have to suffer for your own curiousity. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I'm pretty much dropping this in the trash where it belongs. I wont be watching anymore episodes, it's clearly a waste of time.",

            "content": "Zombies and idols. Both are oversaturated in their respective parts of the world with zombies in the west and idols in the east. I'm pretty sure that we are fed up of both and don't take interest in watching them and just look for something else to watch. I imagine it is going to take a lot to get people into watching an idol or zombie show. But along comes this show. This show which combines these two together into one caught many people off guard and provided us with something we did not expect. So why, I ask, did I keep watching this showto the end while knowing what kind of show it is? \\n\\n\r\nSit back, relax and bow down to THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE!!! as I present to you the anime review for Zombieland Saga. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with Sakura Minamoto looking forward to what she thinks will be the best day of life. She gets dressed; rushes down the stairs; out the front door; looking into the sun with a smile on her face and then gets immediately hit by a truck (that's right, TRUCK-KUN STRIKES AGAIN!). She finds herself awakening in a seemly abandoned old mansion crawling with Zombies. She then finds out she is also a zombie and has been for 10 years. Under their charismatic but self-absorbed leader Koutaro Tatsumi, she joins several other girls who are considered legendary in their own time with one goal in mind. To become the ultimate idol group in order to save Saga, the location where these girls will perform and revive the idol industry there.  \\n\\n\r\nThe way this show was built up before its airing was interesting. We pretty much had no idea what it was going to be. Going from the trailer and the poster, it looked like it was going to be an over the top, zombie slaying action series. When the show aired its first few episodes, I think the show just went ahead and said: \\n\\n\r\n\"Oh you thought this was a zombie action series? Well PSYKE, it's an idol show. Except PSYKE, it's not really an idol show but rather a parody of the idol industry. Except PSYKE, it's an genuine idol show but you don't care because you are already invested.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd you know what? I was invested. The way this show is structured is very well done. It starts off with something so abrupt, it is absolutely hilarious and sets the tone pretty well. It follows up with some unconventional music that doesn't really associate with idols. It then gives us actual idol s**t when we are invested into the show and when we get invested into the characters, we learn more about them. The show knows when it is a good time to change the focus of the show and then develop on it in order to keep it fresh, making the show's pace very well executed. \\n\\n\r\nNow, since this show's idols are also zombies. It leaves a question that it asks us. Does the zombie aspect add anything to Zombielad saga or are they mainly used for comedy? Well yes, they do add something. Considering that these girls have all been resurrected from different time periods, they also bring their backgrounds, ideals and personalities from that time period with them. This creates some conflict between the characters as their ideals are different from one another. Creating tension and also character building. Of course, them being zombies also means that some people will start catching on that these girls who are supposed to be dead have started to walk around again and are performing as an idol group. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEach of our main cast of female characters are rather distinct from one another and each have their own personality. It is important that each character has their own personality in this case in order to stand out in their own way. Whether it is Saki's brash nature or lily's love for everything cute, they all have their own quirks that all make them stand out in their own way. Sakura is the only character I have some gripes with due to being a blank slate character due to her having amnesia. But I can forgive that because she really comes into her own near the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nEach get some development as well and and we get some insight of what their lives were like before they became zombies. Well maybe except Yuugiri and THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE!!! They don't get as fair of development than the rest of the cast. I can forgive THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE!!! due to her actions speaking for herself. But Yuugiri, not so much. Either way, the characters are enjoyable, likeable and their deaths are hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the best character in this show is definitely their manager, Koutaro Tatsumi. Basically, he's as if Houoiun Kyouma decided to ditch the mad scientist gimmick and decided to become a manager instead. He's loud, he's brash, he has no sense of personal space, loves the sound of his own voice and is a complete idiot. He's basically a parody of the standard idol manager considering he has little interest in the girls' feelings or health whatsoever and will do his own thing while the girls have to practice. He's pretty much is looking to advance his own fame rather than the girls because they are zombies and everyone would want to kill them if they find out. Thankfully, he does get his s**t kicked in at times by Saki and Ai at different points of the show due to his idiocy. He is where the comedy is at its best due to Mamoru Miyano's performance and delivery (and we will get to that) but he is genuinely funny and is definitely the highlight of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMAAPA has done a good job here animating this show. Everything about the animation of this show feels vibrant with the colour especially feeling lively or when the cinematography changes like whenever Koutaro shouts at people or saying \"MUSIC, COME ON!!!\" It really is a nice treat for the eyes. The character designs as well are well done, especially with the girls' zombie aspects. Each character is designed in correlation to how they died. This includes bandages, stitches and scars. It's that nice attention to detail that makes the animation quality that much better. Also, those faces. Whether it is from getting shocked, their scary zombie face or Saki's smug face on episode 4, they add to the comedy which is especially important as body language can also make the scene more humorous. \\n\\n\r\nNow there is also CGI used in this show when the girls start performing actual idol performances. At this point I've come to the belief that CGI is to anime what microtransactions are to video games. You don't want it to be there, but you'll know it will be there. Thankfully, it doesn't look bad as the CGI doesn't look stiff and doesn't look too out of place. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis being an idol show, the music must take high priority. Otherwise, what's the point? The soundtrack used is very catchy and enjoyable to listen to. Very diverse as well with different types of songs and music across the entire show to hammer it home that this is an unconventional idol anime. The rap battle sequence from episode 2 ALONE deserves a point as it is so well done, so catchy and so f***ing funny that it was the highlight of the show for me. Of course it can take itself seriously as well. The song played at the end of episode 8 is a heartwrencher that made me shed one single tear when I watched it. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"Adabana Necromancy\" that is performed by the main cast of girls is also very well done. It just has so much style and character to it as it looks like the opening is just trying to have some fun. Power ranger idols, a zombie dance number and Koutaro showing off his moves. It just relates to the unconventional nature of the show. The music as well is done well with bombastic trumpets and trombones combining well with the drums and violins. Combine this with the sound effects to make a fast paced, well done opening altogether. In fact, the sound effects are so crucial that when I listened to a version of the opening without the sound effects. It felt off as if the opening lost a key part to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending sequence is a standard calm down ending where after the events of the episode, you need to listen to something that will calm you down and make you feel relaxed as you reflect upon the episode you just saw. So yeah, pretty standard. \\n\\n\r\nNow I was curious as to how the english dub would be handled. Mamoru Miyano's performance as Koutaro Tatsumi is absolutely brilliant with him constantly changing the tone of his voice and shouting at the top of his lungs. It was like Koutaro was made specifically for him. It sounded like he was having so much fun with the role. So I was interested to see how the English dub would compare. And you know what? Ricco Fajardo did a damn good job as Koutaro as he also brings a charismatic and bombastic performance that is also enjoyable. The rest of the cast also does a good job with each of their respective roles. But considering Mamoru Miyano's performance and the fact that the idol performances have not been dubbed and are still in Japanese. I would still choose the sub over the dub. But if you want to watch the dub, go right ahead. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nI didn't know what to expect from Zombieland Saga and after watching the entire series, I was surprised as to how I managed to watch an idol show without considering on dropping it altogether. But I would say it earns that right of being an idol show by giving us something different to start with before giving us all that idol crap while still realising its roots. Its characters are likeable and enjoyable for the most part, its animation is great and the opening is something I will remember for years. It has cute zombie girls, Truck-Kun, Mamoru Miyano, a rap battle, more Truck-Kun and a whole lot of comedy. I would even call this the surprise show of the season. Some people may argue Bunny Girl Sempai or that Isekai slime show, but at least you got some idea of what you were getting. This being many peoples' first idol show that they have watched (myself included), it caught everyone off guard as to how enjoyable it was. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for your first idol to watch, this is a great starting point as it does something different before it does the idol stuff and is a show I highly recommend you watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 9.1/10  Recommendation: Go f***ing watch it\\n",

I went into the show expecting nothing and by the end of the second episode I was ready to give it an extremely high score.\r\nplus the opening is my aesthetic.\r\nThe sad thing is that it goes on to parody idol shows (I guess?) in the next episodes and really falls flat for me. Maybe I haven't seen enough idol shows to get the jokes but it really seems more like a copy thana parody. Don't get me wrong there are some funny parts and the writing isn't awful, it just starts to feel like a different show. It starts to be more slice of life and less full blown comedy. Since the first two episodes were so good this makes episode 3 and 4 feel more like filler.\\n\\n\r\nHoping they go back to their initial style in the coming episodes, still on the fence about this show.",

Had someone told me a year ago that I would watch an idol show featuring zombie girls nonetheless, and whole heartedly enjoy it, I would\u00b4ve laughed said person straight up in the face. Honestly, I\u00b4ve never seen an idol anime before Zombieland Saga (ZS) and will probably never see one again. Because ZS came and rocked my world (yes, pun intended), with what doubtlessly is mostly a great grand parody of the idol genre. MAPPA has gone and done it again, and this time with genres that I for my life never thought I would ever appreciate. So why is ZS theonly idol anime you ever need to watch? I will tell you right now. \\n\\n\r\nAnd since the synopsis nowhere near doing the show justice, I will elaborate it a bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe fabulous and self-proclaimed zombie girl idol producer Koutarou Tatsumi has a mission, and one mission only - to save the district Saga. Saga\u00b4s population is declining; especially young people is leaving to find their luck elsewhere. Koutarou-kun want to fix this ASAP, and what better way to do it then with a Saga idol group, right? And if you can\u00b4t find living young girls who\u00b4s up for the task, what better way is there than revive a bunch of dead ones and create an idol group of zombie girls?! \\n\\n\r\nYou might wonder how the hell Koutarou-kun made them into zombies? To cite the grand man himself when asked; \u201cA little bit of this, a little bit of that and bang, you\u00b4re out of the grave, right?! Isn\u00b4t that all you really need for zombies?!\u201d So, there you have it.\\n\\n\r\nSakura were in her teenage prime, with big dreams of becoming an idol. But one day when she is running in excitement with her song-CD to the mail-box, a truck hits her and bang! Sakura is dead, and no more idol dreams for her. At least until Koutarou-kun revives her 10 years later and informs her that she now is Zombie nr 1 and is going to be an idol together his little group of zombie girls to save Saga. Only one problem for Sakura though, she has lost her memories! \\n\\n\r\nWhat follows is the groups hilarious strive to be THE idol group everyone talks about to save Saga, in an era where the concept of idols is almost extinct. As you can guess, they have to start at the bottom, with all kinds of odd jobs. And all the while they have to hide the fact that they are zombies, which often leads up to violently comical situations. Even if I haven\u00b4t watched any idol/music anime, I expected an endless succession of disgustingly sweet love songs and girly group dances. Boy was I wrong. Ok, there are such later on, but the texts and songs actually have personal meaning for the girls, which made it kind of cool, but let\u00b4s get to the point. Their first gig is on a local freaking heavy metal event. Has Koutarou-kun prepared his zombie girls for such an event. Hell no. That scene set the bar for the rest of the show for me, and it did not disappoint. I laughed my ass of multiple times during most episode, and I\u00b4m no easy to entertain with comedy. Brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nSure, there is a little more serious moments with what I only can guess is the classic idol show concepts of a striving group towards success and for filling a dream, and of course the girls\u2019 personal issues. But such scenes didn\u00b4t ruin the all over mood of the show at all, they just gave more filling to the story and the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, such a great bunch of zombie girls!\u2764\ufe0fSaki the hardcore ex biker gang boss, Yuugiri the elegant ex courtesan, Lily the sweet little ex child actress, Sakura the kind and positive ex idol-dreamer, Ai and Junko the only revived ex-idols, and let us not forget the LENGEDARY Tae Yamada! No ex- before legendary here, Tae were and is the one and only legendary Tae Yamada. No explanations needed. All the girls get some nice backgrounds and episodes dedicated to them, which explores there past, cause of death and personalities, which often was really entertaining. Koutarou-kun is the best producer, often screaming in the girls faces when asked stupid questions (or often highly relevant questions, but whatever), throwing the group into situations they have no clue how to handle, and is a master at body make-up. He also has a super awesome seductive move, which works on women and men, both living and the dead. Who could\u00b4ve asked for more! It\u00b4s music on its own to hear him screaming \u201cOhay\u014dgozaimasu!!!\u201d, \u201cGO GO GO GO GO GO GO!!!\u201d, \u201cYOU STUPID ASS ZOMBIES!!!\u201d or \u201cCOME ON!!!\u201d on the top of his lungs. \\n\\n\r\nAs expected by MAPPA at this point, they have put their unique touch to ZS. Their trade mark is, unlike many other studies that make all their works looks similar, giving each project their own exclusive look and feeling. In ZS case they used bright and vivid colours, with lots of red, yellow, orange, pink and purple. Great and memorable character designs, with Saki being extra cool. Per usual they play with alternative angles, facial expressions and motion pacing\u2019s, and per usual hit the jackpot. I even found their use of CG pretty inventive. \\n\\n\r\nSince it actually is an idol show, of course it\u2019s a lot of music. As I said mentioned before, the music they performed was a very mixed bag with everything from heavy metal, rap to ridiculous commercial songs. I\u00b4m freaking loved the rap battle, Sakura & Co owned it! If not watch the show, I highly recommend you to look up at least that part. Even if the music performance goes more toward what maybe I would\u00b4ve expected from a regular idol anime along the way, most of the songs and dances have clever texts and choreography. And the OP is in a league on its own -> LOOK IT UP. The VA\u00b4s (Japanese) very all more than perfect for the roles, so arigato gozaimasu!\\n\\n\r\nSince I\u00b4ve never ventured into the genre only anime could come up with before, I had almost no expectations. And I was blown away. MAPPA once again has proven that they can do something different, and not only get away with it, but shining while doing it. I had a blast this fall watching the legendary Zombieland Saga and is proud to say that this is and likely will be my only idol anime. Because this is probably completely different from your regular idol show. I can highly recommend ZS to all you good and fine people out there. Take part of the legend! \\n",

            "content": "[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ONE PUNCH MAN, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST, ZOMBIELAND SAGA, AND YOUR LIE IN APRIL]\r\nYes, I know everyone and their dementia-ridden grandma has already reviewed this. So rather than just talking about what it is, we\u2019re going to attempt to fix Zombieland Saga. This show had way too much potential to simply accept its failures and move on. That section will be at the very end before the conclusion.\r\nFew things are more frustrating than wasted potential, and that phrase to me is quickly becoming synonymous with Zombieland Saga. This show had serious potential. From a parody perspective, ZLS had the potential to reach theholy grounds of One Punch Man. Its premise is THAT GOOD. But you can see the rating I gave it. You know how this is gonna go.\\n\\n\r\n~Story/Writing~ (Contains light spoilers for One Punch Man and BIG SPOILERS for Zombieland Saga)\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Zombieland Saga is simple: an absolute mad lad resurrects dead girls and turns them into zombie idols. Right off the bat, it\u2019s important to note how that sentence makes you feel as an audience member. The premise should lead you to a single conclusion about what you\u2019d expect: this will be a comedy/parody. However, the reason ZLS is so disappointing is because that assumption is correct. ZLS\u2019 premise is that of a comedy or parody/satire. But ZLS the anime adaptation is only partially a comedy. At its heart, its an attempt at drama. And it fails spectacularly at being a drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe first 2-5 episodes are indeed based around comedy, and they are powder kegs of canned comedy. Seriously, the first 2 episodes of ZLS are incredible. They\u2019re funny, satirical, and built entirely around the comedic structure of its premise. Here\u2019s what I mean: (This will spoil episodes 1, 2, 4, and 5)\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1- They win over the crowd due to a mental hiccup that occurs in the zombies that looks like headbanging. This hiccup was setup in the scene prior. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2- They win over the crowd because Tae's limbs keep popping off. This was set-up by the scene prior, when Mizuno's arms popped off when she tried to climb the fence. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 4, Yuugiri makes a comment about the girls getting the opportunity to \"wash away the decay from Franchouchou\", prompting the other girls to check themselves to make sure they don't stink. This is not random, as the previous episode had a scene where they talked about how zombies smelled bad. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nAlso in episode 4, the introduction sequence implies that it's going to be a hot springs episode. Once you as a viewer have settled into that fact, they change it up and tell the girls that none of them are going to the hot springs because they can't go outside without their make-up on. So that's a subversion based on the genre they\u2019re parodying and the logic that forms the premise of the show! They do end up going later, but that ends when Sakura\u2019s head pops off and floats to the surface of the water like a zombie movie. That\u2019s funny! Plus, it was set-up in episode 2 that their heads popped off. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5- The set-up here is they're going to compete in a mud race thing. So they do, but the twist on it is that once they're muddy, they can't rinse off because that would remove their makeup and everyone would see they're zombies. So, they have to stay muddy the entire time. That's funny! Then when they get Tae to tear off her muddy shirt to reveal the group t-shirt, she's still wearing the drive-in shirt from the first half of the episode. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nAll throughout this, Mamoru Miyano\u2019s performance as Koutarou drives the rest of the comedy. For the first 5 or so episodes, he is a firecracker of performance comedy that never failed to make me giggle when he\u2019s on screen. It sounds like Miyano is dicking around in the studio and the outcome is glorious. It\u2019s also paced out nicely, as him yelling in every scene would get old really fast.\\n\\n\r\nThere also good situational comedy like when they're in Ushino (spelling?) and they have Tae hold onto the rope at the shrine, which of course she mindlessly thrashes around which rings the bell! That's funny!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for me (because I loved the first 5 episodes) and everyone else, ZLS implodes after episode 5. It stops trying to be funny and parodical and settles for drama. And it DOES NOT WORK. Story/Writing 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ (Contains spoilers for Zombieland Saga, Fullmetal Alchemist, and maybe spoilers for Your Lie in April?)\\n\\n\r\nThe first misstep that kicks it in motion is the introduction of character backstories. Now before I say anything else, I have no problem with the writers including these backstories. They\u2019re plenty funny and would be great sources of satirical comedy. The problem is, the writers don\u2019t seem to understand that they\u2019re satirical.\\n\\n\r\nMizuno's backstory is played to be sad but having her die by getting struck by lightning on-stage is a really silly death to attach to a sad subplot. This is especially true after they show her burnt, crispy body still standing there on stage with her finger in the air, covered in black. That\u2019s a comedic set-up (like the ones I mentioned above) that\u2019s played straight, which cannot work because it's just too over-the-top to function as a serious plot point.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for all the other backstories too. Part of Sakura\u2019s backstory is that she was delayed getting to her big exam because she had to help too many grannies. Lily died because she had a heart attack that was a result of her finding a wayward hair on her chin. She\u2019s also revealed to be male in the scene. You see what I mean? Those are comedy set-ups. But they play it straight, and it makes no sense. If you're going for comedy or satire there, you play the ensuing scene where Lily and her dad meet for laughs. You don't make it a tear-jerker. That doesn't make any sense because the way Lily died was so stupid and absurd it cannot be played straight. ZLS seems to want to have its cake and eat it too. In that, I mean it wants to have stupid silly deaths the audience will laugh it but still try to make them tragic too. It doesn't work, it's too silly to work as tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, mixing comedy and tragedy is a risky move. In most cases, it backfires or doesn't have a good balance, resulting in a murky grey area between comedy and drama that just doesn't mix well enough to function as either. On one end of that spectrum, you could have a really good drama that's weighed down by ill-advised attempts at comedy. We'll call this the \"Your Lie in April\" tier. The biggest mistake you can make in this tier is placing the comedy in scenes they aren't appropriate in, which ruins the drama and the mood. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a good example of how to do this right, as its comedy was not only good, but placed in narrative openings that would work with comedy. At the end of the reveal about what the dog/human chimera is, Winry doesn't bust in and throw a wrench at someone's head. Because obviously, that would be stupid and ruin the moment. Your Lie in April apparently missed the memo on that because it tries to be funny at the end of fantastic character moments.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other end of that spectrum, you have Zombieland Saga. There's a bit too much drama that isn't interesting in ZLS, but its comedy scenes (first 5 episodes) are hilarious. They would have been better served scaling back the boring drama and focusing on comedy, because that's what ZLS is good at. It isn't good at being dramatic or sad. Its attempts at that are boring. That's what makes the shift in tone after episode 5 so disappointing. The first 5 episodes are powder kegs of comedy, yet for some reason they decide to shove in drama and it just doesn't work. It's important to have a nice mix of comedy and drama if you're going to try to mix the 2, but ZLS blows it by banking too much on its weak drama when it would function perfectly as a pure comedy. Zombies + idols is a set-up that screams comedy! That should be the focus!\\n\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to characters; as it turns out, Miyano's schtick wears off about half way through the show, mostly because they stopped mixing up his antics. Him yelling wasn't going to work on its own as a comedy pillar through the whole season and they should've known that. The real reason Miyano's schitck grows tired though is because they stop building comedic scenes around the other aspects of the show, which leaves Miyano as the main source of comedy. That was never going to work; it was a guarantee to get old once the other sources of comedy dried up.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the pacing debacle that occurs during episodes 10 and 11. They go back to the initial incident where Sakura was hit by a car and turned into a zombie, which is just as confusing in the show as it sounds. Initially, I thought she got hit by ANOTHER car. I couldn\u2019t believe they were going back to the events of the first episode right before the finale. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, it is generally not a good idea to stop everything that\u2019s happening and introduce a new sub-plot right before the finale. The episodes leading up to a finale are supposed to be putting all the pieces the plot has introduced into place and building tension for the final episode. Going back to episode 1 and going \u201chey actually this happened so now Sakura is feeling this\u201d is garbage writing. But the real problem is where in the story its placed. Why is it placed near the finale? This is a confused mess. These events take place at the very start of the show. Why isn't it placed there? I'll tell you why. Because the writers were like \"wait we need to focus on Sakura right before the last episode so it seems like we're adhering to the second act of the 3-arc story structure where the main character is at their lowest\". It's so transparent it's despicable.  Characters 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~Music/Sound~\\n\\n\r\nAll the vocal performances are great, too. Obviously Mamoru steals the show, but all of the idol characters are voiced well, too. Every character sounds like what you would expect them to sound like, with enough personal flair to make them feel memorable. You might think that is rather useless praise, but I just finished Naruto Shipudden and they used the same adult actors for characters like Shino and Shikamaru during flashbacks. That means 7-year old Shino has the same voice as 17-year old Shino. So yeah, good voice work is something to be appreciated and this is some good shit. Sound 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Art/Animation~\\n\\n\r\nVisually, ZLS is solid. In terms of hand-drawn animation, art, color palette, character designs, and background art, it\u2019s great. The character designs in particular are extremely well done. If you look at any one character without context, you could probably determine what they\u2019re like based off their appearance and how they\u2019re drawn. To me, that\u2019s the mark of great character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problem with ZLS visually is the CG idol performances. The frame rate on their dancing is too slow and makes it look choppy. It was somewhat distracting when Love Live did it, but in those shows it was pretty smooth. Here, it\u2019s too rough to not be distracting. Art/Animation 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really grade for enjoyment. How much you enjoy something is determined by the product of your experiences in life and what you consider to be a quality production, which are different for every single person. As such, attempting to grade something inherently subjective with an objective grading metric is a paradox.  I will leave this score blank.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~FIXING ZOMBIE LAND SAGA~\\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 routes you could take to fix ZLS:\\n\\n\r\n1. Make it a pure comedy. That means cutting out the bland drama and focusing on creative ways to build scenes around the characters being zombie idols. This is what the first 2 episodes were.\\n\\n\r\n2. Go for parody/satire. That means keeping the goofy backstories, but keeping the tongue planted firmly in cheek. One Punch Man is a great example of sincere satire, in that One Punch Man parodied the dumber aspects of superpower shounens while embracing what makes them fun. Take for example the scene where Mumen Rider is fighting the Deep Sea King in OPM season 1. The dialogue and structure of the scene indicate it's doing that \"the people believe in me and that gives me the strength to win!\" bullshit that runs rampant in a lot of other shounens. But instead of that actually giving Mumen Rider the ability to defeat the Deep Sea King, he just keeps getting annihilated. This is hilarious, as they keep building up to the moment where you expect Rider to win out, but instead he keeps getting knocked on his ass. It's a bait-and-switch based on the genre, and it's what made One Punch Man season 1 work as a comedy. This comedic structure is a good foundation to build a sincere satire with given ZLS' premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe source material already appears to be satirizing idol and zombie tropes, so flipping the switch from drama to satire would be the easiest path to fixing it.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of those 2 options, there are ways to improve it if you wanted to keep it a drama (I don\u2019t know why you would but I digress):\\n\\n\r\n3. You could go for more of a gray area approach, although it wouldn\u2019t work as well for a comedic premise. You\u2019d still have to sprinkle in light bits of character drama, but I think it could still work. I\u2019d also want to iron out the clich\u00e9 narrative items for the plot, as they would drag the show down regardless of approach.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"we need each other\u201d, and \"the group isn't the same without you\" tropes became clich\u00e9s right around when Love Live came out, so that particular plot point should have been avoided. Instead, it comes in during episode 3 and it is just lame as it always is.\\n\\n\r\nThey could've gone in a much more interesting direction by having one or both girls that were having doubts actually leave for good. Maybe they could have instead made one of them proficient in their past life at something else, making them able to go out on their own and try their hand at whatever that thing is. They could've done a Perfect Blue thing where they end up questioning their decision to pursue other interests and it drives them insane while the group takes off without them. That would have been the more career-oriented twist they could have done.\\n\\n\r\nThey also could have gone the Mawaru Penguindrum route and have the same thing happen, but make the girl feel guilty for abandoning their friends, even though the group in question has become massively popular. Or they could have gone gray area and shown her doing whatever she thinks is her purpose in her second life at certain parts of the story, and then maybe she shows up at the final concert to root them on? Anything other than the clich\u00e9 \"oh yay they came back!\". \\n\\n\r\nThose routes would work well to fix 2 big problems that reared their heads as soon as they went the drama route: the girls go along with becoming zombie idols far too easily, and no one suffers severe emotional distress from realizing they\u2019re dead. For some of them, everyone they\u2019ve ever known is dead. Don't you think it might mess someone up pretty bad if they woke up and you told them everyone they know has been dead for decades? But ZLS elects to ignore that. This isn\u2019t an issue if it\u2019s a comedy because it doesn\u2019t impact the narrative that much and it wouldn\u2019t be compatible with comedy. After all, it\u2019s hard to write good comedy if you insist on explaining every single detail of what\u2019s happening. But if you\u2019re going to make it a drama, that issue has to be addressed. The more seriously you take your story, the more seriously your plot will be looked it and examined, as the story is what drives any drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe other issue that could be solved by having a character branch off on their own path is motivation. It\u2019s odd that none of the girls already have dreams and aspirations they still wanted to pursue. If they did, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be impossible to achieve just because they\u2019re zombies. Could none of those dreams be similarly reached using make-up and maybe perfume? It isn't a big deal but it annoys me considering the plot shifts to drama and then ignores the obvious dramatic conflicts that would arise from its premise. Even worse, it ignores these so it can indulge in the trappings of idol anime.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, if they wanted to keep this a drama, they should have made Saga more of a focus in the narrative. If it had jettisoned the silly backstories and used those 3-4 episodes to expand on Saga and why Koutarou wanted to revitalize it, it could\u2019ve done wonders to flesh out his characters as well as give the audience more reason to care. As it stands, Koutarou is a purely comedic character with little to humanize him. Again, that works in a comedy but it\u2019s strange in a drama. If you want to make a good drama, you have to give the audience a reason to care about the drama. Zombie Land Saga failed to do that.\\n\\n\r\n~CONCLUSION~\\n\\n\r\nEverything that\u2019s wrong with ZLS can be traced back to one problem: it is a comedy/parody that\u2019s played like a drama. You just can\u2019t take a parody and force it to be a drama. If they wanted this to be a drama, the characters' motivations to revitalize Saga as idols would have to be expanded far more. That detail literally doesn't matter at all if it's a comedy or satire. It would be a detriment. But you can't change a comedy into a drama and keep the same story structure! That makes no sense!\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy side of this show is fantastic, but the drama-based idol aspect of this show sucks. It's good in the first 2 episodes because it's driven by the premise, but after that it starts falling into all the trappings of Love Live. When it tries, the comedy is gold. So how do you grade something that's half good, half bland, and a general mishandling of a premise with great potential? That's a textbook 6.\\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga gets a 6/10.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT (Kind of. I'm gonna talk about some of the themes of the story)\r\nBefore watching Zombieland Saga, I had never watched an idol anime.\r\nIt's not that I had anything against the concept of the \"genre\", I just didn't have an interest in watching any of the few shows I knew of.\r\nBut when I looked at the anime of this season, I saw Zombieland Saga. And I had seen a clip of the first scene of the internet, so I knew what kind of show it was. And I decided that I was going to watch it.\r\nThe basic plot of the anime is that Koutarourevives 7 girls, who he gives the mission to save SAGA. They're basically zombie idols.\\n\r\nAnd something I found very interesting was how important it was for the plot that the girls were zombies. Cause a major theme of the show was how idols have to hide their personality and relationships to be successful as an idol. It is pretty disgusting, to be honest, and I appreciate how this is the first anime I have heard of that tackles the issue. \\n\r\nCause the zombie literally have to paint over their skin to not scare the public. The only difference is that it makes sense for them to do that since the public would logically try to kill them.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah it would have been easy for the creators to make them zombies so that it sticks out of the crowd just a little. But they thought of it a little more and made something great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSomething I didn't say in my synopsis is the \"era difference\" of the girls. Yuugiri, one of the main characters, dies in 1880, while Sakura dies in 2008. And the time difference shows a lot. You can see the different styles that the girls sing in reflect \"idols\" of the time. \\n\r\nAgain, they could have gone with it easy and just make them look their age. But they took time to make it a little more interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. If you want to see a show that tackles issues that idols have, or just talks about idols realistically. Then this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nweak 9/10, 3rd favorite of the year ATM",

This anime will make you confused not knowing if you laugh or cry about the girls' deaths, it's just incredible. Maybe I'm just pretty excited after a great final, but for me it's a 10.",

            "content": "Ah...Zombieland Saga. The one idol anime series that pays omages to past idol series and whacks them out of proportion with parodies and such, AND I LOVE IT. I'm not into idol anime, but much like Revue Starlight, this is super entertaining, at least to opinionated agreement.\r\nGoing into this series, MAPPA is telling us: \"If you think we're here to create some generic idol anime, Truck-kun will deal you heavy damage and subvert your expectations to the insane degree!\" And that's what they did, and whether you feel it succeeded or failed is up to debates, but none can deny that for what it wasgoing for: Zombieland Saga cuts to the chase, make some questionable decisions, and then hands down (what I think) deliver on its originality.\\n\\n\r\nLet us start with the bad, and we can end this on a good note, starting with the art and animation. MAPPA has been known for creating a lot of slick animation to boot, but the character designs, original as they may be and easy to differentiate the cast of Franchouchou as a whole, it leaves a lot to be desired. Even more is the very subjective animation, which I assume is for pretty much the parody of idol anime. Weird 3D models and whatnot, and I get it, the fact that this model exists is just for show, and many people will feel off-putting. As for myself, it's plentiful and does its job, decent at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe good-but-not-great part, the music. Created by the one and only Yasuharu Takanashi of Naruto: Shippuden and Fairy Tail fame, this was honestly the biggest standout to me, as the OST contained within this series is truly another great work that adds to his name. The next-level OP visuals with sound effects (something that's ultra rare in anime) that always pulls off excellently, to the calm ED, both songs sang by none other than Franchouchou. Simply just brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nFor most people however, its the simple story and backgrounds of the characters themselves that will earn praise over why this series is super popular now. Let's start with the man in question: Franchouchou's agent-cum-director/driver/counsellor AIO Kotarou Tatsumi. He has been the male elicit of the girls in whatever situations, and has outgrown and outshined himself as the main go-to parody, not caring what the girls' opinions are (until it gets serious like Sakura's). But like them, he has a dream to make Franchouchou known around the dead city that is Saga.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with the girls.\\n\r\nSakura Minamoto has been always looked upon as the MC girl ever since the beginning and recurrence of Truck-kun, and is always the person of ridicule when faced with Kotarou's whims, but ever since Day 1 when she wanted to be an idol, in a snap, she lost all hope as she not only got smashed dead by Truck-kun, but questions her intent and place in the unit, only to have these worries recitified to enjoy what has the new zombie life has in store for her.\\n\\n\r\nSaki Nikaidou, the group's bad-ass leader and former gang leader. Nothing short of the finest in life. She has that bad-ass attitude, and doesn't even spare that to Kotarou and his crazy antics, making sure that everything goes her way, and doesn't back out of a fight...that is until her untimely death when facing off another rival gang. For reference, please refer to Episode 2's crazily awesome rap. A gung-ho girl that everyone relies on heavily to get things going, I'd say she is someone you wouldn't try to mess with her wrong side.\\n\\n\r\nLily Hoshikawa, the youngest in the group, and an established idol well in her early years. Her dead-come-alive story is simple: transgender, died after that simple growing of puberty adolescence. But nonetheless, she has what she always had from the beginning: the support from her father-cum-former manager (And it's not easy for parents to guide their own children who have become idols, so to speak).\\n\\n\r\nAi Mizuno and Junko Konno are two separate humans, yet two separate entities which has come alive through lightning exposure and death from a plane crash. It's easy to see how both Ai and Junko are similar to one another, yet have different views when it comes to interaction with their own idols. Granted, Ai is modern (Iron Frill, 2008) and Junko is traditional (80s Showa era), but despite their bickering, sometimes (or much rather) they come together as one to give the performances that people need, and it is well worth it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's sad that Yuugiri and \"legendary\" BEST GIRL Tae Yamada hasn't has their backstories, but given the time frame of the series, they could have done much more into expanding on these two characters, best of the best and legendary status' girls. *ah-chou* Franchouchou is born! And come on, even the calefare Policeman had his moments!\\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga is parody, satirical, and a slap in the face to the archetypes we've come to know and love/hate, and how it manages to do all that, it does so brilliantly at its very best. All we know, there'll never be anything like it ever again on the face of this Earth, and so I must and shall say, it's a \"die, die must watch\" kinda feeling. It puts a smile on my face every episode whether good or hilariously bad, and farewell, hasta la vista to these zombie-fied girls which punch a good heartbeat into this series. Well done, MAPPA, CyGames and Avex Pictures (which this series is a collab! Suckerpunch!)!",

            "content": "Doesn't it feel like in today\u2019s world, there\u2019s way too many horror media that does same things over and over again? I\u2019m not solely talking about anime alone but the horror genre has gotten to a point where it feels like we\u2019ve seen just about anything. One of the most iconic type of horror is the dead coming back to life. In this case, I\u2019m referring to zombies. Franchises like Resident Evil and The Walking Dead are among just a few well-known ones that comes to mind. But what if I told you that Zombieland Saga manages to revitalize a bit of the horror genreinstead of falling to common cliches? \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, Zombieland Saga isn\u2019t really a horror show at all although the first episode\u2019s opening suggests so with a clich\u00e9 setting and a young girl facing a crisis between life and death. It manages to trick viewers through its opening and does a 180 degree turn after revealing the series\u2019 real concept \u2013 a horror comedy that satirze Japanese idols with an absurd character cast. As a collaboration project by Cygames and Avex pictures (with studio MAPPA), they managed to keep this show a secret from the start. \\n\\n\r\nNow that we got that out of the way, it\u2019s time to realize what Zombieland Saga really offers. I watched plenty of zombie shows in the past and most of it attempts to do the same things over and over again \u2013 evoke a sense of fear. Zombieland Saga does the opposite and creates a sensation of genuine entertainment with its comedy elements. In fact, I\u2019d say the show is self-aware enough to satirize the idol industry. In the first few episodes, protagonist Sakura Minamoto ends up dead after being hit a trick. But rather than awakening in some fantasy world, she is reborn as a zombie. It doesn\u2019t take long for her to join a group with other zombie girls together. This group collectively is formed by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi with the purpose to save the Saga Prefecture. Say hello to Franchoucou.\\n\\n\r\nIdeally, a show like this sounds like it took a big risk as it sounds like a dumb joke of itself. Watching Zombieland Saga does feel like the show plays with itself a bit too much but it didn\u2019t take long for me to accept and grow attached to the main characters. That\u2019s because each of them have a life of their own with colorful personalities. As an inspiring idol, Sakura\u2019s dream became a reality when she steps onto the stage. Sakura\u2019s friendly personality enables her to easily get along with everyone. That\u2019s the opposite of delinquent yankee, Saki Nikaido. Unlike Sakura, she is difficult to get along with because of her tough personality. Deep down though, Saki isn\u2019t a malevolent character and in fact manages to develop some deeper bonds with her idol comrades. We also meet Ai Mizuno, a girl who desire to make the best of her current life. Junko Konno, Lily Hoshikawa, and Tae Yamada make up the rest of the group after being reborn. Despite dying under different circumstances, they all serve the same purpose and that\u2019s to make their group into a sensation. \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably asking yourself if Franchoucou really is a sensation in their world. They didn\u2019t start out with popularity and instead had to work their way up. Through hard work and motivation, the group does gain popularity as Sakura leads them to stardom. My interest for the show grew more and more as I wanted to see this group succeed. It also helped that the show constantly got me feel attached to the characters through effective storytelling. We learn of their past, their motivations, and what they hope to accomplish in the present. There are also some episodes that throws in some surprising plot twists and bittersweet ending moments. I\u2019m not going to spoil it but it manages to become even emotional at times so prepare for some tissues.\\n\\n\r\nAs a horror/idol comedy, the show contains countless amount of humorous gags. Most of the humor revolves around the concept of zombies. Characters retain personalities from their past lives but sometimes finds themselves surprised by unnatural events. This often includes body parts coming off unintentionally that\u2019s played with absurdity. The guiltiest member of the group that people will point fingers at would be Tae Yamada, the legendary title-less girl. Unlike the rest, she has yet to regain her personality and behaves like a zombie. She has an unhealthy appetite that seems to have a personality of a kid stuck in an adult\u2019s body. The show constantly pokes fun at her character by showing what zombies can do. It\u2019s the type of satirical humor that is aware of its intentions and seeks to make the audience laugh. And to be honest, it works. \\n\\n\r\nSo now what? Is this just a show of humor nonsense or is there something bigger that meets the eye? It honestly depends on how you approach this show. The more I watched Zombieland Saga, the more I felt compelled to see how different this anime is compared to other genres of similar nature. In fact, I\u2019d say that Zombieland Saga offers an experience that is refreshing by mixing in comedy with musical themes. It\u2019s not often you get to see these two mixed together in today\u2019s world. The project creators managed to effectively create a fakeout of the show from the first episode while ultimately making this into a parody. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. You\u2019ll still occasionally see some \u201chorror\u201d content pop up but it satirizes to make it absurd as possible. \\n\\n\r\nIt should also be said that the voicing cast of this show deserves recognition for their talent. In particular, voice actress veteran Kotono Mitsuishi plays her role as Tae Yamada flawlessly. She\u2019s able to step into the shoes of her character with the mindset of a zombie. Others such as Asami Tano is able to take on their character role as a yankee and her accent proves it. As a show about idols, you should also expect tons of catchy songs. While most of them relates to J-pop, there are occasional times when the show throws in a surprise or two such as a battle rap in one particular episode. The bottom line is, this is so much more than just a horror-idol comedy as it also manages to embrace its music culture. \\n\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA did it again. They managed to create a show that not only surprised me but also give the zombie concept a breath of fresh air. Zombieland Saga manages to reinvent itself by stepping out of the comfort zone. It satirizes the idol industry by combining its self-aware humor and absurd character cast. Yet, it manages to deliver effective storytelling that is important for the overall direction of the show. As I learned more and more about the characters, it felt hard to let them to go when everything concluded. By accomplishing such a feat, this anime is definitely a sensation to take attention to. The secret is out now and it\u2019s easy to say that I need more anime like Zombieland Saga in my life.",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga is unironically the best anime of Fall 2018.\r\nLet me tell you a little story. Once Upon a Time, I got hooked on the idol genre, and descended into what is commonly referred to as idol hell. However, contrary to popular belief, I was able to snap out of my zombie like trance and escape from idol hell, and I can happily say that I\u2019ve been clean for over two years. No longer having an interest in idol anime, I had no inclination to watch Zombieland Saga, and had planned on skipping it. What a sad, misguided fool the me of three or somonths ago was\u2026anyway, I eventually got around to watching it thanks to my weak mind being influenced by Youtube videos that told me to give this anime a shot. In this review, I\u2019ll explain to you why Zombieland Saga isn\u2019t just great for it\u2019s drop-dead hilarity and entertainment value, but for its unexpected complexity that you might just miss out on if you just skim the surface of this surprisingly great anime.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right, this is actually going to be a somewhat intricate review since Zombieland Saga is totally worth analyzing. So if you don\u2019t have much time and have to Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!, here\u2019s a little tl;dr for you: I came for the quirky idol shenanigans + zombies combo, stayed for the amazing comedy, and left absolutely loving the diverse and both figuratively and literally fleshed out characters (Get it? Cuz they\u2019re zombies?)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really hits like a truck in how quickly it transitions from a seemingly typical idol anime opening sequence what with our heroine Sakura\u2019s upbeat and energetic disposition to an intense and hilarious death scene backed by heavy metal music after like 30 seconds into the first episode. I was instantly hooked after this unique beginning, and the anime just got better from there. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no spoiler to say that our protagonist is as dead as someone who, well, died. However, she is revived via necromancy by a sunglasses wearing manager dude named Koutarou who also brought back six other SUPER LEGENDARY girls from the dead all for the purpose of them forming an idol group with the monumental goal of saving a declining Saga.\\n\\n\r\nIf that sentence long synopsis doesn\u2019t get you to tingle with excitement in anticipation to see where the heck this anime goes, then I don\u2019t know what will. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no secret to say that I didn\u2019t watch this anime hoping to find something with a compelling narrative and developed characters and was instead looking for something that would make me smile in amusement. And I can happily say that Zombieland Saga made me die of laughter (Don\u2019t worry about me though, I was brought back to life\u2026Though sadly not as a LEGENDARY zombie idol) This is the funniest anime that I\u2019ve seen all year, even beating out good comedy anime like Grand Blue and How Not to Summon a Demon Lord. Each episode contains a plethora of comedic moments, and there was always something new and creative so it never felt like I was watching the same routine with each passing episode. Now if the good comedy was all Zombieland Saga had, I would have been perfectly content with the anime and left satisfied. However, there is so much more to this anime than that, and its greatest strengths revolve around the cast.\\n\\n\r\nYou really can\u2019t go wrong when your characters are a bunch of LEGENDARY girls in an idol group called FranChouChou. Outside of Sakura, who suffers from memory loss, a typical anime trope that Zombieland Saga actually executes better than literally every other anime that utilizes memory loss, our girls include my personal favorite, the LEGENDARY Saki Nikaidou, a fiery, outgoing girl whose voice and character design are so hot that they make me catch on fire. Plus she\u2019s a rapping biker girl who likes chicken and goes down in a blaze of glory TWICE. I guess the perfect girl does exist. We also have Ai Mizuno, a girl who was a successful idol in life who had a simply LEGENDARY death after giving one last electrifying performance. Let\u2019s not forget the soft spoken yet powerhouse vocalist Junko Konno, whose LEGENDARY rise to stardom may have been cut short by an unexpected crash and burn, but she lives on in our hearts\u2026and as a zombie. Lily Hoshikawa is a kawaii girl who was a LEGENDARY child actress who unfortunately ended up in a hairy situation that her little heart just couldn\u2019t take. Still, she\u2019s a true star, and her cuteness is infectious. Next, we have the ever enticing and LEGENDARY Yuugiri, who is the most experienced of the girls in more ways then one. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have THE LEGENDARY TAE YAMADA, and thanks to her inclusion as the star of the show, I was practically mandated by the animu gods to bump up my score for this anime by a full point. So yeah, the girls in this anime are pretty\u2026Illustrious. \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ll notice that the girls all lived in different eras, so they obviously were exposed to different cultures based on the times that they lived in. A lesser anime would have glazed over this fact, but not Zombieland Saga, and this was the point that I realized that this anime was something special. Junko and Ai were to first to go through compelling character arcs, and their stories were pretty engaging, and set the stage for the upcoming character arcs. The episode dedicated to Lily was, to put it bluntly, LEGENDARY. Zombieland Saga had done it. It became the first anime I\u2019ve ever seen to make me laugh hysterically AND be brought to the verge of tears thanks to an incredibly well produced character driven episode. I didn\u2019t think anything could top the epicness of the rap battle, but the emotions I felt thanks to Lily\u2019s story certainly did. I was trapped in a sea of emotions throughout the entire episode, and I could probably write an entire review just dedicated to that episode alone. Seriously though, I have never seen an anime handle Lily\u2019s character type nearly as well as Zombieland Saga did, and at the end of the day, Lily is Lily. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, it goes without saying that Saki\u2019s episode was pure greatness. Saki is just that good.\\n\\n\r\nA strong demonstration of camaraderie between characters is something that I rarely see sufficiently executed in anime. So imagine my shock when I realized that Zombieland Saga of all things was able to pull it off. The bonds that these characters have with each other grew from constant arguments and not being on the same page in the first few episodes into an in sync family who would do anything to help each other out. This is demonstrated the clearest near the end of the anime. I won\u2019t spoil exactly what, but something happens to Sakura that causes a rift between her and her fellow zombies. The way that all of the girls try to get her back to her old self is extremely heartwarming, and it really goes to show how far these girls have come. And thanks to their positive relationship with one other, they\u2019re able to put on some spectacular performances. And now we get to the other great part about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIts music is hella good.\\n\\n\r\nFor the past several weeks I\u2019ve been listening to the opening theme song, Adabana Necromancy, constantly. I play it when I eat. I play it when I sleep. I\u2019m playing it as I\u2019m writing this review. It\u2019s a pretty damn good song. And you know what else is good? Literally every insert song in this anime. I\u2019ve already mentioned the rap battle, which was pretty off the chain. Lily\u2019s song and Saki\u2019s song are two personal favorites of mine, and every musical number in this show is just really catchy. If FranChouChou ever put on a show irl, you better believe I\u2019d buy tickets to go and see them, and I would be screaming and crying at the awesomeness alongside those two heavy metal guys who\u2019ve attended every show that the girls have put on. Seriously though, those two guys really are the unsung MVPs of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the voice acting, as Phil from Hercules would say, I\u2019ve got three words for ya: My Man Miyano Mamoru! This boi is my favorite male seiyuu, and his performance as Koutarou is simply LEGENDARY.  Some of the best comedy from this anime comes from the combination of Koutarou\u2019s absurd lines plus Mamoru\u2019s expert delivery of them. And of course, the ladies voicing our lovely zombie idols do an exceptional job. And they even got the LEGENDARY voice actress of Usagi from Sailor Moon to voice the LEGENDARY Tae Yamada. I didn't expect anything less. \\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, this anime is animated quite well. I love the character designs, and the fluidity of their movements during scenes like the rap battle and Lily\u2019s song is very impressive. But there\u2019s one glaring issue with the visuals, and I\u2019m sure you know exactly what I\u2019m referring to. You guessed it, I\u2019m talking about none other than the CGI.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is an acronym that I made for Cute Girl Idols.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right, as I said before, these cute girl idols are drawn to look pretty attractive, but they\u2019re, you know, rotting corpses, and I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m not into necrophilia. Yet the girls\u2019 cutesy designs have consistently tempted me throughout the anime\u2019s run time, which has been problematic since it\u2019s called into question my morality and\u2026Oh wait, you thought by CGI I meant the Computer Generated Imagery that this anime scarcely deploys? The CGI implemented during some of the dance sequences that is literally used for less then ten minutes of the entire anime\u2019s run time and doesn\u2019t look nearly as bad as people make it out to be? Well personally, I have absolutely no qualms with the CGI. There\u2019s definitely worse out there, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga impressed me. It put a fun twist on the idol genre that not only made it incredibly entertaining to watch, but also allowed it to develop some truly great and unique characters. I haven\u2019t enjoyed watching an anime this much in a long time. And if you haven\u2019t watched this anime yet, you really should Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! and watch it as soon as possible. It just isn\u2019t right to miss out on such a LEGENDARY anime.",

            "content": "If this had been my first idol anime, I would have been gravely confused when watching the second.\r\nZombieland Saga is a story about these cute anime girls who die, then come back as zombies and start making badass heavy metal music / stand up comedy / rap battles in a comedic manner. \r\nThe creativity of this series pretty much ends with its idea for main characters. Outside few nice ideas, such as diving into the audience before the music even starts playing and the Hunter x Hunter parody seen in episode 02, I can't say many scenes have made me laugh or felt satisfactory. Vastmajority of the events that occur and scenes that play aren't nearly as bizarre or weird as they have potential to be. It's pretty basic stuff which pretty much anyone could have written. For example, the rap battle lyrics are pretty much just filler. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of the comedy is executed with and relying on voice acting. The guy who voiced Okabe is here as the main dude and once again offering zero personality, all yelling. It's not entertaining the least, just stupid. Same thing occurs with great many side characters who realize that our girls are actually zombies. Cop yells, other side characters yell, our female main characters yell. End of story. I am not personally finding much enjoyment from scenes such as these. If I want to watch people yell, I watch shonen anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design from heavy metal audience to the main chicks gets a plus. This is pretty based MAPPA production for that matter. It looks glorious outside the weird lipsync issues that are over exaggerated mouth movements to a point that it comes highly visible. Or that's what I thought before I saw episode 03 and that god awful CGI dance scene they used there. Beyond ugly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this series doesn't have much to say nor do I have much to say about it. It relies on the slice of life side of being a zombie, it is already getting old because it's lacking in content, becoming repetitive and the cast isn't strong enough to carry anything with their miniscule personalities. Yamada is pretty hot tho.",

It is a comedy, but less about individual gags and more about the absurd concepts presented in general. I'd definitely recommend you at least try it out, though it will not be for everyone.\r\nAlso sports a cameo by everyone's favorite Truck-kun.\r\nStory - So far the story itself is quite simplistic, but it is full of charm and humor, which is rare for me to like but it meshes well.\r\nArt - Typical of the art style in this decade, its the weakestpart of the show. Not because it is bad but because it is rather generic.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The sound design itself is the most surprising element once you get past the shock of the opening few minutes, the songs are well put together, and the sound design is catchy. It is rather unconventional, which may turn away potential viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Many of the characters are yet to be developed as of episode 2, but so far the MC and Tae are definite stand outs. I look forward to the development of the cast, and the character designs are fantastic. \\n\r\nMiyano Mamoru has particularly good voicework for his character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - So far I have laughed out loud at least once an episode, a rarity these days. I quite enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - A solid 8 so far, with potential to slip to a 7 or raise to a 9 depending on how the show develops.",

            "content": "It\u2019s pretty clear that in today\u2019s society, anime seems to be churned out in droves. You bare witness to the regurgitation of carbon copies, causing the medium you hold dear to fade into the bleakest grey...\r\nAnd then Zombieland Saga busts in through the fucking window in a speeding minivan going 156 mph, shouting \u201cFUCK YOU; GET IN\u201d before flooring it faster than you can say \u201cThe Legendary TAE YAMADA!\u201d It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s quirky, it\u2019s loud as all hell, and most importantly, it\u2019s as vivid as a sunset. Sure, your weeaboo mancave of a room is busted and your waifu collection is in pieces, but weall know you\u2019ll replace that with a shrine dedicated to a bunch of zombie idols in no time. You\u2019ll get used to it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWe should probably get the most colorful, charming parts of this show out of the way. These visuals pop. The colors strike like God\u2019s lightning, especially in both the opening and ending. These character designs are as bombastic as the personalities of the girls when they\u2019re off doing weird hijinks. Their facial expressions and clothes are so glorious that it\u2019s easy to forget that you only give a shit about like half the characters until their pasts get revealed. Sure, there are some fugly CGI idol models in a couple of dance sequences early on, but then we get oil paintings for menus and real-life footage. Studio MAPPA poured their blood, sweat, and tears into injecting nothing but style into this show.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of hijinks, there\u2019s a ton of variety in these spectacles. Horror movie/game parodying, playing hot potato with Tae\u2019s severed head, fucking chicken performances and rap battles?! How can anyone object to this?! This is a perfect venue for vibrant character chemistry, as evidenced by the two best characters in the show, Saki and The Legendary Tae Yamada! These two embody the best aspects of the show, with them getting a majority of the best gags. Saki\u2019s loud and abrasive personality makes for perfect chemistry fodder with the rest of the cast, and the inner machinations of Tae Yamada\u2019s mind are an enigma. She is a joy to witness.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters took a while to become even remotely interesting, and this is for a few reasons. For one, several of the main characters are often more drama focused. While this isn\u2019t a bad thing on its own, not only are the personalities of characters such as Junko and Ai not very interesting, but given the limited time spent on drama in comparison to everything else in the first 4 episodes, the drama often feels like a detour. Admittedly, very few of these characters are that great when they aren\u2019t dealing with absurd scenarios, but some are especially dull early on. The latter half thankfully has episodes designed around fleshing out the characters and giving them an emotional arc, but not every character gets this luxury. Granted, none of the main 7 idols are as grating as their manager Kotaro (cuz that guy can get fucked by a cactus more than half the time) but the show still has a hard time giving everyone the spotlight. Thankfully some of the side characters introduced in some of these character-centric mini-stories are written and explored efficiently. Without them, the drama-centered focus of the second half would have felt like an agonizing shift considering how lackluster the more serious portions of the show felt beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing left to touch on is the music. The background tracks are catchy, with neat jingles to compliment the lighthearted and comedic moments. However, the real meat comes in the form of the songs by everyone in this idol group: Franchouchou. The OP \"Adabana Necromancy\u201d is as vivid as the visuals that it plays over, and the watercolor visuals really help sell the emotional ED \"Hikari e\u201d. As for the insert idol tracks, several of them are pretty nice to listen to as well, with the only real exception being the ear-piercing Vocaloid-esque song that plays at the end of the 7th episode. It would be rather ghastly if these performances sounded dead, so thank the maker this ain\u2019t the case.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s refreshing to have an anime run you over, screaming. It calms down, and there are some growing pains, but I\u2019m happy to see some life here. There\u2019s a vivid pulse to this one, a wild and unique expression so charming and sincere that I nearly overlook how uneven and easy to break this show can be. With this performance now over, it\u2019s your turn to take part in the saga. What are you waiting for? Do it while you\u2019re still alive!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Tae Yamada dabs in episode 7, so that\u2019s an Easter egg to look out for.\\n\\n\r\nWritten/Edited by: CodeBlazeFate \\n\r\nProofread by: Peregrine",

            "content": "\u201cAnother idol Anime!\u201d A lot of eye rolling and sighs going into this series, though the fact that it was an original, I was intrigued enough to give it a chance. The first episode makes a loud statement on what it\u2019s about, taking only a few minutes to set up its \u201cfirst day of school\u201d clich\u00e9 before crashing the premise of the show which is under the guise of everyone\u2019s favourite automobile in \u201cTruck-kun,\u201d into our main heroine in Sakura Minamoto, and the audience. It\u2019s so unexpected, it\u2019s so shocking and the timing couldn\u2019t be any better, it immediately has you in a fit oflaughter. \\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn\u2019t end there, luckily, exactly ten years later, the mysterious music producer Koutaro Tatsumi decides he's going to put together a legendary idol group called, Franchouchou. Thanks to some behind-the-curtain methods, he can assemble the world's seven greatest singers and dancers\u2014who are dead in order to inject some liveliness into Japan\u2019s Saga prefecture. Which is how Sakura finds herself terrified and confused in a house full of dead girls. If you couldn\u2019t tell at this point, Zombieland Saga is an imitation on the popular sub-genres of idols and zombies with a twist to create many bizarre, strange, amusing, hilarious and unexpected moments. It uses exaggeration, inversion and trivialization effortlessly\u2014zombie addicts will be surprised to find that it\u2019s not your typical \u201csurvive the zombie apocalypse\u201d archetype but uses the trope of zombies to establish a unique stage for an idol series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are breathing moments as it cleverly takes a step away from the blistering comedy, every now and then to pull back the curtain a bit on the main story for some social commentary on the dark side of the idol industry as well as alluding to some interesting themes that provokes a lot of thought and feelings which was more prevalent in episode six, \u201cBecause It\u2019s Sentimental SAGA.\u201d Unfortunately, the latter end of the series, it lingered on this aspect a bit too long when chronicling Sakura\u2019s origins. It upsets the tone too much, taking away the charm and hilarity that gives this anime much of its punch. Luckily, there are characters who prove to be the perfect counter-balance when these tonal shifts occur, like Koutarou, the manager of the girls, an over-the-top type of persona, voiced by the legendary voice actor Mamoru Miyano. He is the perfect casting choice, he makes Koutarou special in a way where every time he appears on screen, you know something special is about to take place, which normally leaves you in hysterics. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, there is a colourful cast of characters as well, with a selection of idols who run quite a range of personalities. The interactions and dialogues between them never feel overly sappy or dull, most of the shows best moments come when these personalities are colliding with each other. Each one gets there 1 or 2 episodes of shine time that sheds light into their backstories, their current conflict and then a resolution to said conflict where we can see some character development and chemistry take place. Zombieland Saga is the type of anime that has characters who will happily tear each other apart, both figuratively and literally, and it's nice to see them not hold back. It is absolutely a comedy first, with missing limbs, heads popping off all over the place and some hilarious ways of dying, yes, I am looking at you, Lily! And when it sticks to the winning formula, the show doesn\u2019t feel derivative but, feels refreshingly unique, and all it took was mashing GCDCT and horror elements together.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, MAPPA has been nothing short of impressive, seeing that this is an original series. Surprisingly enough, they were able to maintain a solid consistency level throughout the show with its art and animation with the occasional drops in production value. Character designs alone tell the personalities of each character, they are somewhat distinctive but when assembled, it\u2019s easier to see that certain features are generic. And for a parody show such as Zombieland Saga, it works. The zombified looks go hand in hand with the slapstick, and as to be expected, along with the facial expressions and the way their limbs were flying around all over the place was very well animated. The colour palette is very bright, vibrant and sometimes has this watercolour paint look to it. The downside here is definitely in several moments when they did their idol performances, the sequences were in cringe CGI and it wasn\u2019t the pretty kind at all. Apart from that, the job they did on performances such as the Babymetal scene in episode 1, the Battle Rap scene in episode 2 and the Fast food commercial scene in episode 5 won me over.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, MAPPA nailed the OP with the perfect song choice and visuals. \"Adabana Necromancy\" by Fran Chou Chou is a tribute to the music used in anime series openings from the late sixties to late seventies. Especially anime of the genre in action and mecha. The musical arrangements dominated by trumpets, violins, the background lyric chorus and quick tempo. Some of these openings also used sound effects in the action sequences. Its bodacious and balls to the wall seeing these power ranger-like zombie girls throwing shapes. The ED \"Hikari e\" which is also done by Fran Chou Chou, is sincere and beautiful, full of farewells and gratitude, similar to graduation songs. The soundtrack has a few memorable songs, very catchy and although they are repeatedly played often, it\u2019s never annoying. The idol songs are the type of musical items that you\u2019d get from your typical idol anime. The casting for this show is perfect and it is very hard to imagine each character being replaced.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s nice is that each of these girls\u2019 lives was cut short, they have been given a second chance to live out their dreams. The sentimental moments are good in between all the goofs and laughs. It is similar to Asobi Asobase in terms of a good unexpected comedy, it\u2019s absurd yet grounded when it needs to be. Despite a few glaring flaws, it definitely feels as if it achieved what it set out to be and Zombieland Saga deserves its credit for taking the idol show rulebook and rewriting some pages, changing the game in the oversaturated sub-genre that is filled with shows that shy away from taking chances. You'd have to be dead inside not to laugh while watching this. In fact, they're head and shoulders above most comedy anime this year, not giving it a chance would be a grave mistake.\\n",

            "content": "If there was a word to describe Studio MAPPA it would be disappointing. Being the spiritual successor for Studio Madhouse many of the shows least, in my opinion, fell flat in they face mainly because MAPPA loves the play the field spell card called style over substance where the writing for these shows seemed to fall by the side in favour of pretty colours and flashing scenes. Because of that I grown to dislike MAPPA as a whole as they seem to prioritised flashing visuals over storytelling. Zombieland Saga is, unfortunately, no exception to this as despite the show being advertised as a parody idolanime that had a lot of potential to be good. Unfortunately it the end it ended being another generic seasonal anime that you will easily forget once the anime season is over.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nIn the year 2008 high school girl named Sakura Minamoto is abruptly killed in a traffic accident by a truck. Ten years later, Sakura, along with six \"legendary\" girls from various eras of Japan's history, are brought back as zombies by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi, who seeks to save Saga Prefecture by putting together an all-zombie idol group known as Franchouchou.\\n\\n\r\nIf where was a two words to describe the story of Zombieland Saga it would be missed potential as the series had potential to be this fun parody of the idol genre as a whole would made me laugh for days. Unfortunately as the series progresses the series starts falling apart as it eventually showed it's true itself where it ended up being a generic idol anime that barely doesn't do anything different apart from the zombie-idol gimmick. Before I talk about the problems with Zombieland Saga I'm going to talk to quickly talk about the things that I liked about Zomebieland Saga.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that sold me watching Zombieland Saga is that it was a nice parody of the idol genre as it showcases all the tropes and elements that were using in the idol anime genre and no surprise the first 4 episodes actually did just that as it never took itself too seriously.\\n\r\nThe best and most memorable part of Zombieland Saga was the rap battle in episode 2. Not only the rap battle was very hilarious and entertaining to watch from start to finish, but it was very well set up and timed narrative and visually\\n\r\nIf only the rest of the series was as consistently good as the rap battle in episode 2 and with that said it's times to dive into this show problems.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when I said that Zombieland is a nice parody of the idol genre. Well the second half did something that it should have not done and that is devolved into a generic copy and paste idol anime where not even the zombie idol gimmick can fully save it. Many character drama aspects in this show were copied and pasted from other anime of it's generic and the dialogue just became trying. It did have some story moments with Saki and Sakura but other than that the show complete loss of what it made it unique in the first as it sadly devolved into a generic idol anime.\\n\r\nThe worst thing about Zombieland Saga is that simply not all that funny as many of the comedy comes in the form of characters doing dumb things and screaming. The comedy timing was terrible for the most part and many of the jokes ended up becoming forced and boring.\\n\r\nOverall, despite the show being a decent parody of the idol genre that has an interesting zombie gimmick it ultimately ended falling apart into this generic style over substance anime that lost a lot of charm.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in Zombieland Saga were just okay. Not memorable but at the same time they are not bad.\\n\r\nThis may come off as an unpopular opinion, but I don't like the producer Tasumi all that much. Yes, he had some cool moments every now and then but a lot of the time I found him pretty irritating especially when most of his dialogue is consistent screaming and screeching at set idol.\\n\r\nAs for the zombie-idol girls themselves well I thought there was one note. Yes, there was 2 expectations being Saki and Sakura (which I will talk about in a bit) but other than that the zombie idol girls are nothing more but idol cliches on screen.\\n\r\nSaki was by far my favourite character in Zombieland Saga as well being the most entertaining. She may appear to a typical badass jerk at first especially to Sakura as the series progresses she slowly starts open up to Sakura after proving that she isn't as completely gutless. I really liked her character development in the series and it really shows in episode 9 where she meets up with her old best friend and biker gang. She proves to Reiko daughter that if she contiines acting the way that Saki did when she was alive then she would end up falling in the same fate that caused Saki to die.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWhat really made Saki my favourite character happens in episode 2 during the rap battle with Sakura \" Who cares if you've got memories\" \"you won't get to see your friends and your Tamagotchi's long dead\" We're done got it?!\\n\r\nSakura herself was a pretty good character. She as this typical idol protagonist archetype at first however as the series progresses she becomes more of an interesting and somewhat relatable character that we can relate. Her backstory in episode 11 was the prime example of this as perfectly showcases of what Sakura would have been as a person if she didn't get hit by truck kun and as a result, she starts going into heroic BSoD.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Zombieland Saga for the most part were pretty forgetful and at times lame. Yes, there was Saki and at times Sakura were good but it ultimately cannot save this gimmicky generic cast of characters.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nThe visuals in Zombieland Saga are a mixed bag. While it had a solid colour art-style that fits well with the setting of the series I feel the animation especially the CGI moments hold the visuals back from being great. The models both the human, and zombies are nicely drawn appealing to look at. The background scenery was decent, and lighting was solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself ranged from pretty good to okay. That's about it really. The only thing left I say about the show visuals is the use of CGI which was absolutely horrendous. I understand the show was meant to parody CGI in idol anime but there's a difference between actually parodying the CGI and actually making worse than thing that your parodying and Zombieland Saga officially hit the jackpot. MAPPA what the hell were you thinking?\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nFor a show that mainly focus of music I thought the soundtrack for Zombieland Saga to be underwhelming at best. It's not a soundtrack I consider to be awful, but it failed to impress me especially when many of the tracks in Zombleland Saga just comes off as generic background idol noise. While the soundtrack was lacking the insert songs completely make it up because they are actually pretty damm good. My favourite insert songs in the show would be Mezame Returner and Dance.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme Adabana Necromancy sung by zombie idols was a decent opening theme. While I really liked the opening visuals for it, I cannot say the same thing for the song itself which I found to be pretty forgetful.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Hikari e sung by the zombie idols was a pretty enjoyable ending that has a nice clamming song that contained good-looking visuals art.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe Seiyuus in the sub did a pretty good job with the roles that they were given. As much I don't like Tatsumi I thought Mamoru Miyano did a fantastic job voicing the character. Asami Tano as Saki was a also another great performance as she really made this hot headed badass girl come to life.\\n\r\nThe dub, on the other hand, is pretty bad as it's filled with mediocre to bad performances that actually ruins key scenes in the anime. Not only that but the comedy in the dub version is pretty insufferable to listen. Also let's not forget how Funimation was incredibly lazy when they decided to do the rap battle episode 2 because frankly they didn't bother to dub at all.\\n\r\nStick with the sub for this one.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nZombieland Saga is a bizarre series to judge. There were some strong areas that I really liked like Saki and Sakura, the rap battle in episode 2 and the idol parody stuff unfortunately the flaws in Zombieland Saga outweigh the good. Not only that but the same the series got to the second half the series devolved into this generic flashy idol anime that has a zombie gimmick that contains repetitive/forced comedy and underwhelming characters. If the series actually stocked to of idol parody routes than this show would have been one of the better animes of 2018 but we ultimately didn't get that and what we got instead was an idol anime that kinda overstayed it's welcome and should have been 10 to 6 episodes long instead of 12.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad series by any means but at the same time it's not all that memorable outside the rap battle and Saki's character development.\\n\r\nFinal Score 5/10",

At first I thought this anime would just be another copy of \"Highschool of the Dead\" but boy I was wrong. The cover art you are seeing now on MAL wasnt the first one that was displayed on the anime, the first one just had a bunch of spooky zombies on it, and that at first had me skeptical about the anime, as I first thought it would be nothing but chaos, gore and a failed attempt at copying \"Highschool of the Dead\".But it turns out that this anime has absolutly nothing to do with the previous mentioned one, in fact if you look at the genres of this anime, it has the \"Comedy\" and \"Music\" tag on it. Overall, I didnt expect the Story to turn out the way it is and I consider the story to be absolutly hilarious in a good manner. In fact, I have never laughed this hard after the first 2 minutes of an anime EVER! Overall I rate this anime a solid 7/10. Give it a go! Its quite funny indeed! <3\\n",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga is a comedy about a group of zombie girls being marketed as idols by a red suit-toting weirdo through unconventional and sometimes embarrassing means of gaining popularity.\r\nZombieland Saga is an idol drama about a group of zombie girls on a quest to become idols but are held back the the implications of their deaths, their past traumas, their memories and the era they lived in.\r\nZombieland Saga works great as either show.\r\nZombieland Saga doesn't work at all as both.\r\nBy trying to juggle these two ideas, it becomes a tangled up and comes short of fulfilling either of those premises satisfyingly. It's not that theshow transitioning between these ideas are jarring (in fact, it does that just fine), but rather, by trying to keep the first half of episodes comedy then leaving all the heavier stuff for later kind of chokes the pacing of those. As a result, character arcs and story threads, while fine, leave so much to be desired, especially with regards to Sakura. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fine. I enjoyed a lot of the comedic storyboarding, the hilarious character acting and expressions in early episode (1-5), as well entire sequences of Tatsumi Kotarou's screentime and dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is kinda shit. I didn't remember a single track, much less the BGM, so not much comment there other than forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a splendid job and, again, a ton of the script from the comedy episodes were fantastic and the did a good job with those.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a fine show. It's freaking hilarious when it wants to be and the writing is pretty alright, if not really unsatisfying. I recommend it if you have the time. (6/10)",

            "content": "This is my first review, so please bear with me.\r\nAlthough having not watched much if not any idol anime, it was intriguing to see a spin on this conventional genre. With a synopsis such as \"The peace these seven girls experience will suddenly be destroyed. By the living dead... zombies,\" I couldn't help but check the show out. Unfortunately, by the end of it all, it just felt like it fell flat.\r\nTo get straight to the point and not waste any time, let's look at the positives of this show. Firstly, I'll admit that it was quite enjoyable for what it was at times. Forexample, our main girl getting hit by truck-kun was a nice addition to the amount of destruction he has already done throughout the entire history of anime, and he may never stop... Events such as the infamous rap battle, and the general interactions between the idols could be pretty funny at times.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the character designs like of Saki and the rest of the group gave a unique style to each of the characters (exceptions being Junko and Ai, they look like copies of one another to an extent). Facial expressions were pretty nice, and to each of their own had a distinct sense of personality. The aforementioned Saki with her rough and daring ways of going about things, Lily being very ecstatic, and Yuugiri with her calm and collected tone made for characters that could stand on their own. It all may have felt pretty generic I might add, but for me it's at least worth mentioning as something it didn't completely fail on. However, it's nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme was pretty cool with the visuals I guess.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the negatives of this show made for the biggest gripes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was mixed. I had mentioned the character designs before as being fine, and the backgrounds and style of the show were pretty good and felt appropriate , but the consistent use of CGI dances however were absolutely horrendous.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, obviously being a parody, wasn't trying to take itself too seriously. This isn't a negative in in of itself, and is actually completely fine, however it seemed as if it couldn't hold that mentality together. Character development is fine and all, but serious overtones and unneeded drama was apparent throughout multiple parts of the story, and it almost felt like it was straying away from it's own purpose that it established from the beginning, as being a fun comedical straight forward show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music didn't catch on with me, and wasn't really engaging, just sounded pretty meh.\\n\\n\r\nThe manager could not manage himself. His loud and obnoxious yelling was not funny, and only set himself up as a failed comedian. Loud does not equal funny, and he should have either stuck to being mature as shown occasionally, or just a running gag. Combining the two just doesn't sit well (even if being voiced by Miyano Mamoru).\\n\\n\r\nTalking about running gags, the whole policeman and sudden interaction between the Idols was just as equally as bad, but thankfully it wasn't so repetitive and recurring that I had to sit through it constantly like the manager.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, possible spoilers or not, but it was hinted at several times where a couple of guys were interested in finding more about these idols and their true identity so to say. However, absolutely nothing happened with this, and only seemed to waste time, falsely leading the viewer to expect something interesting and dramatic to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime could have been better. If it had only stuck with what it set out to do, it could have been a pretty decent, or even good show. If you like the show and enjoy it despite my personal criticisms, that's totally fine, to each of their own. It was alright while it lasted, but again, ended falling flat with the issues I had with it. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and if their is anything I can improve on, feel free to let me know!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The comedy goes from \"haha okay that's kinda funny\" to \"just shut up, is there anything interesting at all anymore\", not kidding either that is my sincere view on this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI was originally planning on giving up just right away after I saw that third episode, but I gave it another episode and pretty much just skimmed through episode 5 and 6, there were moments that could have been done different that would have served great for comedic purpose and been in the same kind of flow like the first two episodes..

Meh, as I said I really dislike idol animes so I wont like the songs in this for obvious reasons other than the first 2 episodes as previously stated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, it's just bad, it's just stereo types, one screeching idiot and a couple of whiners.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, if I only watched the first 2 episodes I would actually give it a good score, but seeing as the majority of the episodes that are out makes me rather watch Boruto should speak volumes. There is no enjoyment to be had.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, trash anime with 2 jebait episodes that it wont be the typical trash idol anime. If you're going to watch more than 2 episodes anyway, I really do apologize that you have to suffer for your own curiousity. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I'm pretty much dropping this in the trash where it belongs. I wont be watching anymore episodes, it's clearly a waste of time.",

To become the ultimate idol group in order to save Saga, the location where these girls will perform and revive the idol industry there.  \\n\\n\r\nThe way this show was built up before its airing was interesting. We pretty much had no idea what it was going to be. Going from the trailer and the poster, it looked like it was going to be an over the top, zombie slaying action series. When the show aired its first few episodes, I think the show just went ahead and said: \\n\\n\r\n\"Oh you thought this was a zombie action series? Well PSYKE, it's an idol show. Except PSYKE, it's not really an idol show but rather a parody of the idol industry. Except PSYKE, it's an genuine idol show but you don't care because you are already invested.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd you know what? I was invested. The way this show is structured is very well done. It starts off with something so abrupt, it is absolutely hilarious and sets the tone pretty well. It follows up with some unconventional music that doesn't really associate with idols. It then gives us actual idol s**t when we are invested into the show and when we get invested into the characters, we learn more about them. The show knows when it is a good time to change the focus of the show and then develop on it in order to keep it fresh, making the show's pace very well executed. \\n\\n\r\nNow, since this show's idols are also zombies. It leaves a question that it asks us. Does the zombie aspect add anything to Zombielad saga or are they mainly used for comedy? Well yes, they do add something. Considering that these girls have all been resurrected from different time periods, they also bring their backgrounds, ideals and personalities from that time period with them. This creates some conflict between the characters as their ideals are different from one another. Creating tension and also character building. Of course, them being zombies also means that some people will start catching on that these girls who are supposed to be dead have started to walk around again and are performing as an idol group. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEach of our main cast of female characters are rather distinct from one another and each have their own personality. It is important that each character has their own personality in this case in order to stand out in their own way. Whether it is Saki's brash nature or lily's love for everything cute, they all have their own quirks that all make them stand out in their own way. Sakura is the only character I have some gripes with due to being a blank slate character due to her having amnesia. But I can forgive that because she really comes into her own near the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nEach get some development as well and and we get some insight of what their lives were like before they became zombies. Well maybe except Yuugiri and THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE!!! They don't get as fair of development than the rest of the cast. I can forgive THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE!!! due to her actions speaking for herself. But Yuugiri, not so much. Either way, the characters are enjoyable, likeable and their deaths are hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the best character in this show is definitely their manager, Koutaro Tatsumi. Basically, he's as if Houoiun Kyouma decided to ditch the mad scientist gimmick and decided to become a manager instead. He's loud, he's brash, he has no sense of personal space, loves the sound of his own voice and is a complete idiot. He's basically a parody of the standard idol manager considering he has little interest in the girls' feelings or health whatsoever and will do his own thing while the girls have to practice. He's pretty much is looking to advance his own fame rather than the girls because they are zombies and everyone would want to kill them if they find out. Thankfully, he does get his s**t kicked in at times by Saki and Ai at different points of the show due to his idiocy. He is where the comedy is at its best due to Mamoru Miyano's performance and delivery (and we will get to that) but he is genuinely funny and is definitely the highlight of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMAAPA has done a good job here animating this show. Everything about the animation of this show feels vibrant with the colour especially feeling lively or when the cinematography changes like whenever Koutaro shouts at people or saying \"MUSIC, COME ON!!!\" It really is a nice treat for the eyes. The character designs as well are well done, especially with the girls' zombie aspects. Each character is designed in correlation to how they died. This includes bandages, stitches and scars. It's that nice attention to detail that makes the animation quality that much better. Also, those faces. Whether it is from getting shocked, their scary zombie face or Saki's smug face on episode 4, they add to the comedy which is especially important as body language can also make the scene more humorous. \\n\\n\r\nNow there is also CGI used in this show when the girls start performing actual idol performances. At this point I've come to the belief that CGI is to anime what microtransactions are to video games. You don't want it to be there, but you'll know it will be there. Thankfully, it doesn't look bad as the CGI doesn't look stiff and doesn't look too out of place. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis being an idol show, the music must take high priority. Otherwise, what's the point? The soundtrack used is very catchy and enjoyable to listen to. Very diverse as well with different types of songs and music across the entire show to hammer it home that this is an unconventional idol anime. The rap battle sequence from episode 2 ALONE deserves a point as it is so well done, so catchy and so f***ing funny that it was the highlight of the show for me. Of course it can take itself seriously as well. The song played at the end of episode 8 is a heartwrencher that made me shed one single tear when I watched it. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"Adabana Necromancy\" that is performed by the main cast of girls is also very well done. It just has so much style and character to it as it looks like the opening is just trying to have some fun. Power ranger idols, a zombie dance number and Koutaro showing off his moves. It just relates to the unconventional nature of the show. The music as well is done well with bombastic trumpets and trombones combining well with the drums and violins. Combine this with the sound effects to make a fast paced, well done opening altogether. In fact, the sound effects are so crucial that when I listened to a version of the opening without the sound effects. It felt off as if the opening lost a key part to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending sequence is a standard calm down ending where after the events of the episode, you need to listen to something that will calm you down and make you feel relaxed as you reflect upon the episode you just saw. So yeah, pretty standard. \\n\\n\r\nNow I was curious as to how the english dub would be handled. Mamoru Miyano's performance as Koutaro Tatsumi is absolutely brilliant with him constantly changing the tone of his voice and shouting at the top of his lungs. It was like Koutaro was made specifically for him. It sounded like he was having so much fun with the role. So I was interested to see how the English dub would compare. And you know what? Ricco Fajardo did a damn good job as Koutaro as he also brings a charismatic and bombastic performance that is also enjoyable. The rest of the cast also does a good job with each of their respective roles. But considering Mamoru Miyano's performance and the fact that the idol performances have not been dubbed and are still in Japanese. I would still choose the sub over the dub. But if you want to watch the dub, go right ahead. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nI didn't know what to expect from Zombieland Saga and after watching the entire series, I was surprised as to how I managed to watch an idol show without considering on dropping it altogether. But I would say it earns that right of being an idol show by giving us something different to start with before giving us all that idol crap while still realising its roots. Its characters are likeable and enjoyable for the most part, its animation is great and the opening is something I will remember for years. It has cute zombie girls, Truck-Kun, Mamoru Miyano, a rap battle, more Truck-Kun and a whole lot of comedy. I would even call this the surprise show of the season. Some people may argue Bunny Girl Sempai or that Isekai slime show, but at least you got some idea of what you were getting. This being many peoples' first idol show that they have watched (myself included), it caught everyone off guard as to how enjoyable it was. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for your first idol to watch, this is a great starting point as it does something different before it does the idol stuff and is a show I highly recommend you watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 9.1/10  Recommendation: Go f***ing watch it\\n",

I went into the show expecting nothing and by the end of the second episode I was ready to give it an extremely high score.\r\nplus the opening is my aesthetic.\r\nThe sad thing is that it goes on to parody idol shows (I guess?) in the next episodes and really falls flat for me. Maybe I haven't seen enough idol shows to get the jokes but it really seems more like a copy thana parody. Don't get me wrong there are some funny parts and the writing isn't awful, it just starts to feel like a different show. It starts to be more slice of life and less full blown comedy. Since the first two episodes were so good this makes episode 3 and 4 feel more like filler.\\n\\n\r\nHoping they go back to their initial style in the coming episodes, still on the fence about this show.",

            "content": "MAPPA, you genius. Had someone told me a year ago that I would watch an idol show featuring zombie girls nonetheless, and whole heartedly enjoy it, I would\u00b4ve laughed said person straight up in the face. Honestly, I\u00b4ve never seen an idol anime before Zombieland Saga (ZS) and will probably never see one again. Because ZS came and rocked my world (yes, pun intended), with what doubtlessly is mostly a great grand parody of the idol genre. MAPPA has gone and done it again, and this time with genres that I for my life never thought I would ever appreciate. So why is ZS theonly idol anime you ever need to watch? I will tell you right now. \\n\\n\r\nAnd since the synopsis nowhere near doing the show justice, I will elaborate it a bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe fabulous and self-proclaimed zombie girl idol producer Koutarou Tatsumi has a mission, and one mission only - to save the district Saga. Saga\u00b4s population is declining; especially young people is leaving to find their luck elsewhere. Koutarou-kun want to fix this ASAP, and what better way to do it then with a Saga idol group, right? And if you can\u00b4t find living young girls who\u00b4s up for the task, what better way is there than revive a bunch of dead ones and create an idol group of zombie girls?! \\n\\n\r\nYou might wonder how the hell Koutarou-kun made them into zombies? To cite the grand man himself when asked; \u201cA little bit of this, a little bit of that and bang, you\u00b4re out of the grave, right?! Isn\u00b4t that all you really need for zombies?!\u201d So, there you have it.\\n\\n\r\nSakura were in her teenage prime, with big dreams of becoming an idol. But one day when she is running in excitement with her song-CD to the mail-box, a truck hits her and bang! Sakura is dead, and no more idol dreams for her. At least until Koutarou-kun revives her 10 years later and informs her that she now is Zombie nr 1 and is going to be an idol together his little group of zombie girls to save Saga. Only one problem for Sakura though, she has lost her memories! \\n\\n\r\nWhat follows is the groups hilarious strive to be THE idol group everyone talks about to save Saga, in an era where the concept of idols is almost extinct. As you can guess, they have to start at the bottom, with all kinds of odd jobs. And all the while they have to hide the fact that they are zombies, which often leads up to violently comical situations. Even if I haven\u00b4t watched any idol/music anime, I expected an endless succession of disgustingly sweet love songs and girly group dances. Boy was I wrong. Ok, there are such later on, but the texts and songs actually have personal meaning for the girls, which made it kind of cool, but let\u00b4s get to the point. Their first gig is on a local freaking heavy metal event. Has Koutarou-kun prepared his zombie girls for such an event. Hell no. That scene set the bar for the rest of the show for me, and it did not disappoint. I laughed my ass of multiple times during most episode, and I\u00b4m no easy to entertain with comedy. Brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nSure, there is a little more serious moments with what I only can guess is the classic idol show concepts of a striving group towards success and for filling a dream, and of course the girls\u2019 personal issues. But such scenes didn\u00b4t ruin the all over mood of the show at all, they just gave more filling to the story and the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, such a great bunch of zombie girls!\u2764\ufe0fSaki the hardcore ex biker gang boss, Yuugiri the elegant ex courtesan, Lily the sweet little ex child actress, Sakura the kind and positive ex idol-dreamer, Ai and Junko the only revived ex-idols, and let us not forget the LENGEDARY Tae Yamada! No ex- before legendary here, Tae were and is the one and only legendary Tae Yamada. No explanations needed. All the girls get some nice backgrounds and episodes dedicated to them, which explores there past, cause of death and personalities, which often was really entertaining. Koutarou-kun is the best producer, often screaming in the girls faces when asked stupid questions (or often highly relevant questions, but whatever), throwing the group into situations they have no clue how to handle, and is a master at body make-up. He also has a super awesome seductive move, which works on women and men, both living and the dead. Who could\u00b4ve asked for more! It\u00b4s music on its own to hear him screaming \u201cOhay\u014dgozaimasu!!!\u201d, \u201cGO GO GO GO GO GO GO!!!\u201d, \u201cYOU STUPID ASS ZOMBIES!!!\u201d or \u201cCOME ON!!!\u201d on the top of his lungs. \\n\\n\r\nAs expected by MAPPA at this point, they have put their unique touch to ZS. Their trade mark is, unlike many other studies that make all their works looks similar, giving each project their own exclusive look and feeling. In ZS case they used bright and vivid colours, with lots of red, yellow, orange, pink and purple. Great and memorable character designs, with Saki being extra cool. Per usual they play with alternative angles, facial expressions and motion pacing\u2019s, and per usual hit the jackpot. I even found their use of CG pretty inventive. \\n\\n\r\nSince it actually is an idol show, of course it\u2019s a lot of music. As I said mentioned before, the music they performed was a very mixed bag with everything from heavy metal, rap to ridiculous commercial songs. I\u00b4m freaking loved the rap battle, Sakura & Co owned it! If not watch the show, I highly recommend you to look up at least that part. Even if the music performance goes more toward what maybe I would\u00b4ve expected from a regular idol anime along the way, most of the songs and dances have clever texts and choreography. And the OP is in a league on its own -> LOOK IT UP. The VA\u00b4s (Japanese) very all more than perfect for the roles, so arigato gozaimasu!\\n\\n\r\nSince I\u00b4ve never ventured into the genre only anime could come up with before, I had almost no expectations. And I was blown away. MAPPA once again has proven that they can do something different, and not only get away with it, but shining while doing it. I had a blast this fall watching the legendary Zombieland Saga and is proud to say that this is and likely will be my only idol anime. Because this is probably completely different from your regular idol show. I can highly recommend ZS to all you good and fine people out there. Take part of the legend! \\n",

            "content": "[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ONE PUNCH MAN, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST, ZOMBIELAND SAGA, AND YOUR LIE IN APRIL]\r\nYes, I know everyone and their dementia-ridden grandma has already reviewed this. So rather than just talking about what it is, we\u2019re going to attempt to fix Zombieland Saga. This show had way too much potential to simply accept its failures and move on. That section will be at the very end before the conclusion.\r\nFew things are more frustrating than wasted potential, and that phrase to me is quickly becoming synonymous with Zombieland Saga. This show had serious potential. From a parody perspective, ZLS had the potential to reach theholy grounds of One Punch Man. Its premise is THAT GOOD. But you can see the rating I gave it. You know how this is gonna go.\\n\\n\r\n~Story/Writing~ (Contains light spoilers for One Punch Man and BIG SPOILERS for Zombieland Saga)\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Zombieland Saga is simple: an absolute mad lad resurrects dead girls and turns them into zombie idols. Right off the bat, it\u2019s important to note how that sentence makes you feel as an audience member. The premise should lead you to a single conclusion about what you\u2019d expect: this will be a comedy/parody. However, the reason ZLS is so disappointing is because that assumption is correct. ZLS\u2019 premise is that of a comedy or parody/satire. But ZLS the anime adaptation is only partially a comedy. At its heart, its an attempt at drama. And it fails spectacularly at being a drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe first 2-5 episodes are indeed based around comedy, and they are powder kegs of canned comedy. Seriously, the first 2 episodes of ZLS are incredible. They\u2019re funny, satirical, and built entirely around the comedic structure of its premise. Here\u2019s what I mean: (This will spoil episodes 1, 2, 4, and 5)\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1- They win over the crowd due to a mental hiccup that occurs in the zombies that looks like headbanging. This hiccup was setup in the scene prior. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2- They win over the crowd because Tae's limbs keep popping off. This was set-up by the scene prior, when Mizuno's arms popped off when she tried to climb the fence. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 4, Yuugiri makes a comment about the girls getting the opportunity to \"wash away the decay from Franchouchou\", prompting the other girls to check themselves to make sure they don't stink. This is not random, as the previous episode had a scene where they talked about how zombies smelled bad. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nAlso in episode 4, the introduction sequence implies that it's going to be a hot springs episode. Once you as a viewer have settled into that fact, they change it up and tell the girls that none of them are going to the hot springs because they can't go outside without their make-up on. So that's a subversion based on the genre they\u2019re parodying and the logic that forms the premise of the show! They do end up going later, but that ends when Sakura\u2019s head pops off and floats to the surface of the water like a zombie movie. That\u2019s funny! Plus, it was set-up in episode 2 that their heads popped off. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5- The set-up here is they're going to compete in a mud race thing. So they do, but the twist on it is that once they're muddy, they can't rinse off because that would remove their makeup and everyone would see they're zombies. So, they have to stay muddy the entire time. That's funny! Then when they get Tae to tear off her muddy shirt to reveal the group t-shirt, she's still wearing the drive-in shirt from the first half of the episode. Set-up and payoff!\\n\\n\r\nAll throughout this, Mamoru Miyano\u2019s performance as Koutarou drives the rest of the comedy. For the first 5 or so episodes, he is a firecracker of performance comedy that never failed to make me giggle when he\u2019s on screen. It sounds like Miyano is dicking around in the studio and the outcome is glorious. It\u2019s also paced out nicely, as him yelling in every scene would get old really fast.\\n\\n\r\nThere also good situational comedy like when they're in Ushino (spelling?) and they have Tae hold onto the rope at the shrine, which of course she mindlessly thrashes around which rings the bell! That's funny!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for me (because I loved the first 5 episodes) and everyone else, ZLS implodes after episode 5. It stops trying to be funny and parodical and settles for drama. And it DOES NOT WORK. Story/Writing 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ (Contains spoilers for Zombieland Saga, Fullmetal Alchemist, and maybe spoilers for Your Lie in April?)\\n\\n\r\nThe first misstep that kicks it in motion is the introduction of character backstories. Now before I say anything else, I have no problem with the writers including these backstories. They\u2019re plenty funny and would be great sources of satirical comedy. The problem is, the writers don\u2019t seem to understand that they\u2019re satirical.\\n\\n\r\nMizuno's backstory is played to be sad but having her die by getting struck by lightning on-stage is a really silly death to attach to a sad subplot. This is especially true after they show her burnt, crispy body still standing there on stage with her finger in the air, covered in black. That\u2019s a comedic set-up (like the ones I mentioned above) that\u2019s played straight, which cannot work because it's just too over-the-top to function as a serious plot point.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for all the other backstories too. Part of Sakura\u2019s backstory is that she was delayed getting to her big exam because she had to help too many grannies. Lily died because she had a heart attack that was a result of her finding a wayward hair on her chin. She\u2019s also revealed to be male in the scene. You see what I mean? Those are comedy set-ups. But they play it straight, and it makes no sense. If you're going for comedy or satire there, you play the ensuing scene where Lily and her dad meet for laughs. You don't make it a tear-jerker. That doesn't make any sense because the way Lily died was so stupid and absurd it cannot be played straight. ZLS seems to want to have its cake and eat it too. In that, I mean it wants to have stupid silly deaths the audience will laugh it but still try to make them tragic too. It doesn't work, it's too silly to work as tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, mixing comedy and tragedy is a risky move. In most cases, it backfires or doesn't have a good balance, resulting in a murky grey area between comedy and drama that just doesn't mix well enough to function as either. On one end of that spectrum, you could have a really good drama that's weighed down by ill-advised attempts at comedy. We'll call this the \"Your Lie in April\" tier. The biggest mistake you can make in this tier is placing the comedy in scenes they aren't appropriate in, which ruins the drama and the mood. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a good example of how to do this right, as its comedy was not only good, but placed in narrative openings that would work with comedy. At the end of the reveal about what the dog/human chimera is, Winry doesn't bust in and throw a wrench at someone's head. Because obviously, that would be stupid and ruin the moment. Your Lie in April apparently missed the memo on that because it tries to be funny at the end of fantastic character moments.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other end of that spectrum, you have Zombieland Saga. There's a bit too much drama that isn't interesting in ZLS, but its comedy scenes (first 5 episodes) are hilarious. They would have been better served scaling back the boring drama and focusing on comedy, because that's what ZLS is good at. It isn't good at being dramatic or sad. Its attempts at that are boring. That's what makes the shift in tone after episode 5 so disappointing. The first 5 episodes are powder kegs of comedy, yet for some reason they decide to shove in drama and it just doesn't work. It's important to have a nice mix of comedy and drama if you're going to try to mix the 2, but ZLS blows it by banking too much on its weak drama when it would function perfectly as a pure comedy. Zombies + idols is a set-up that screams comedy! That should be the focus!\\n\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to characters; as it turns out, Miyano's schtick wears off about half way through the show, mostly because they stopped mixing up his antics. Him yelling wasn't going to work on its own as a comedy pillar through the whole season and they should've known that. The real reason Miyano's schitck grows tired though is because they stop building comedic scenes around the other aspects of the show, which leaves Miyano as the main source of comedy. That was never going to work; it was a guarantee to get old once the other sources of comedy dried up.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the pacing debacle that occurs during episodes 10 and 11. They go back to the initial incident where Sakura was hit by a car and turned into a zombie, which is just as confusing in the show as it sounds. Initially, I thought she got hit by ANOTHER car. I couldn\u2019t believe they were going back to the events of the first episode right before the finale. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, it is generally not a good idea to stop everything that\u2019s happening and introduce a new sub-plot right before the finale. The episodes leading up to a finale are supposed to be putting all the pieces the plot has introduced into place and building tension for the final episode. Going back to episode 1 and going \u201chey actually this happened so now Sakura is feeling this\u201d is garbage writing. But the real problem is where in the story its placed. Why is it placed near the finale? This is a confused mess. These events take place at the very start of the show. Why isn't it placed there? I'll tell you why. Because the writers were like \"wait we need to focus on Sakura right before the last episode so it seems like we're adhering to the second act of the 3-arc story structure where the main character is at their lowest\". It's so transparent it's despicable.  Characters 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~Music/Sound~\\n\\n\r\nAll the vocal performances are great, too. Obviously Mamoru steals the show, but all of the idol characters are voiced well, too. Every character sounds like what you would expect them to sound like, with enough personal flair to make them feel memorable. You might think that is rather useless praise, but I just finished Naruto Shipudden and they used the same adult actors for characters like Shino and Shikamaru during flashbacks. That means 7-year old Shino has the same voice as 17-year old Shino. So yeah, good voice work is something to be appreciated and this is some good shit. Sound 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Art/Animation~\\n\\n\r\nVisually, ZLS is solid. In terms of hand-drawn animation, art, color palette, character designs, and background art, it\u2019s great. The character designs in particular are extremely well done. If you look at any one character without context, you could probably determine what they\u2019re like based off their appearance and how they\u2019re drawn. To me, that\u2019s the mark of great character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problem with ZLS visually is the CG idol performances. The frame rate on their dancing is too slow and makes it look choppy. It was somewhat distracting when Love Live did it, but in those shows it was pretty smooth. Here, it\u2019s too rough to not be distracting. Art/Animation 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really grade for enjoyment. How much you enjoy something is determined by the product of your experiences in life and what you consider to be a quality production, which are different for every single person. As such, attempting to grade something inherently subjective with an objective grading metric is a paradox.  I will leave this score blank.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~FIXING ZOMBIE LAND SAGA~\\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 routes you could take to fix ZLS:\\n\\n\r\n1. Make it a pure comedy. That means cutting out the bland drama and focusing on creative ways to build scenes around the characters being zombie idols. This is what the first 2 episodes were.\\n\\n\r\n2. Go for parody/satire. That means keeping the goofy backstories, but keeping the tongue planted firmly in cheek. One Punch Man is a great example of sincere satire, in that One Punch Man parodied the dumber aspects of superpower shounens while embracing what makes them fun. Take for example the scene where Mumen Rider is fighting the Deep Sea King in OPM season 1. The dialogue and structure of the scene indicate it's doing that \"the people believe in me and that gives me the strength to win!\" bullshit that runs rampant in a lot of other shounens. But instead of that actually giving Mumen Rider the ability to defeat the Deep Sea King, he just keeps getting annihilated. This is hilarious, as they keep building up to the moment where you expect Rider to win out, but instead he keeps getting knocked on his ass. It's a bait-and-switch based on the genre, and it's what made One Punch Man season 1 work as a comedy. This comedic structure is a good foundation to build a sincere satire with given ZLS' premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe source material already appears to be satirizing idol and zombie tropes, so flipping the switch from drama to satire would be the easiest path to fixing it.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of those 2 options, there are ways to improve it if you wanted to keep it a drama (I don\u2019t know why you would but I digress):\\n\\n\r\n3. You could go for more of a gray area approach, although it wouldn\u2019t work as well for a comedic premise. You\u2019d still have to sprinkle in light bits of character drama, but I think it could still work. I\u2019d also want to iron out the clich\u00e9 narrative items for the plot, as they would drag the show down regardless of approach.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"we need each other\u201d, and \"the group isn't the same without you\" tropes became clich\u00e9s right around when Love Live came out, so that particular plot point should have been avoided. Instead, it comes in during episode 3 and it is just lame as it always is.\\n\\n\r\nThey could've gone in a much more interesting direction by having one or both girls that were having doubts actually leave for good. Maybe they could have instead made one of them proficient in their past life at something else, making them able to go out on their own and try their hand at whatever that thing is. They could've done a Perfect Blue thing where they end up questioning their decision to pursue other interests and it drives them insane while the group takes off without them. That would have been the more career-oriented twist they could have done.\\n\\n\r\nThey also could have gone the Mawaru Penguindrum route and have the same thing happen, but make the girl feel guilty for abandoning their friends, even though the group in question has become massively popular. Or they could have gone gray area and shown her doing whatever she thinks is her purpose in her second life at certain parts of the story, and then maybe she shows up at the final concert to root them on? Anything other than the clich\u00e9 \"oh yay they came back!\". \\n\\n\r\nThose routes would work well to fix 2 big problems that reared their heads as soon as they went the drama route: the girls go along with becoming zombie idols far too easily, and no one suffers severe emotional distress from realizing they\u2019re dead. For some of them, everyone they\u2019ve ever known is dead. Don't you think it might mess someone up pretty bad if they woke up and you told them everyone they know has been dead for decades? But ZLS elects to ignore that. This isn\u2019t an issue if it\u2019s a comedy because it doesn\u2019t impact the narrative that much and it wouldn\u2019t be compatible with comedy. After all, it\u2019s hard to write good comedy if you insist on explaining every single detail of what\u2019s happening. But if you\u2019re going to make it a drama, that issue has to be addressed. The more seriously you take your story, the more seriously your plot will be looked it and examined, as the story is what drives any drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe other issue that could be solved by having a character branch off on their own path is motivation. It\u2019s odd that none of the girls already have dreams and aspirations they still wanted to pursue. If they did, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be impossible to achieve just because they\u2019re zombies. Could none of those dreams be similarly reached using make-up and maybe perfume? It isn't a big deal but it annoys me considering the plot shifts to drama and then ignores the obvious dramatic conflicts that would arise from its premise. Even worse, it ignores these so it can indulge in the trappings of idol anime.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, if they wanted to keep this a drama, they should have made Saga more of a focus in the narrative. If it had jettisoned the silly backstories and used those 3-4 episodes to expand on Saga and why Koutarou wanted to revitalize it, it could\u2019ve done wonders to flesh out his characters as well as give the audience more reason to care. As it stands, Koutarou is a purely comedic character with little to humanize him. Again, that works in a comedy but it\u2019s strange in a drama. If you want to make a good drama, you have to give the audience a reason to care about the drama. Zombie Land Saga failed to do that.\\n\\n\r\n~CONCLUSION~\\n\\n\r\nEverything that\u2019s wrong with ZLS can be traced back to one problem: it is a comedy/parody that\u2019s played like a drama. You just can\u2019t take a parody and force it to be a drama. If they wanted this to be a drama, the characters' motivations to revitalize Saga as idols would have to be expanded far more. That detail literally doesn't matter at all if it's a comedy or satire. It would be a detriment. But you can't change a comedy into a drama and keep the same story structure! That makes no sense!\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy side of this show is fantastic, but the drama-based idol aspect of this show sucks. It's good in the first 2 episodes because it's driven by the premise, but after that it starts falling into all the trappings of Love Live. When it tries, the comedy is gold. So how do you grade something that's half good, half bland, and a general mishandling of a premise with great potential? That's a textbook 6.\\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga gets a 6/10.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT (Kind of. I'm gonna talk about some of the themes of the story)\r\nBefore watching Zombieland Saga, I had never watched an idol anime.\r\nIt's not that I had anything against the concept of the \"genre\", I just didn't have an interest in watching any of the few shows I knew of.\r\nBut when I looked at the anime of this season, I saw Zombieland Saga. And I had seen a clip of the first scene of the internet, so I knew what kind of show it was. And I decided that I was going to watch it.\r\nThe basic plot of the anime is that Koutarourevives 7 girls, who he gives the mission to save SAGA. They're basically zombie idols.\\n\r\nAnd something I found very interesting was how important it was for the plot that the girls were zombies. Cause a major theme of the show was how idols have to hide their personality and relationships to be successful as an idol. It is pretty disgusting, to be honest, and I appreciate how this is the first anime I have heard of that tackles the issue. \\n\r\nCause the zombie literally have to paint over their skin to not scare the public. The only difference is that it makes sense for them to do that since the public would logically try to kill them.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah it would have been easy for the creators to make them zombies so that it sticks out of the crowd just a little. But they thought of it a little more and made something great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSomething I didn't say in my synopsis is the \"era difference\" of the girls. Yuugiri, one of the main characters, dies in 1880, while Sakura dies in 2008. And the time difference shows a lot. You can see the different styles that the girls sing in reflect \"idols\" of the time. \\n\r\nAgain, they could have gone with it easy and just make them look their age. But they took time to make it a little more interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. If you want to see a show that tackles issues that idols have, or just talks about idols realistically. Then this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nweak 9/10, 3rd favorite of the year ATM",

            "content": "Ah...Zombieland Saga. The one idol anime series that pays omages to past idol series and whacks them out of proportion with parodies and such, AND I LOVE IT. I'm not into idol anime, but much like Revue Starlight, this is super entertaining, at least to opinionated agreement.\r\nGoing into this series, MAPPA is telling us: \"If you think we're here to create some generic idol anime, Truck-kun will deal you heavy damage and subvert your expectations to the insane degree!\" And that's what they did, and whether you feel it succeeded or failed is up to debates, but none can deny that for what it wasgoing for: Zombieland Saga cuts to the chase, make some questionable decisions, and then hands down (what I think) deliver on its originality.\\n\\n\r\nLet us start with the bad, and we can end this on a good note, starting with the art and animation. MAPPA has been known for creating a lot of slick animation to boot, but the character designs, original as they may be and easy to differentiate the cast of Franchouchou as a whole, it leaves a lot to be desired. Even more is the very subjective animation, which I assume is for pretty much the parody of idol anime. Weird 3D models and whatnot, and I get it, the fact that this model exists is just for show, and many people will feel off-putting. As for myself, it's plentiful and does its job, decent at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe good-but-not-great part, the music. Created by the one and only Yasuharu Takanashi of Naruto: Shippuden and Fairy Tail fame, this was honestly the biggest standout to me, as the OST contained within this series is truly another great work that adds to his name. The next-level OP visuals with sound effects (something that's ultra rare in anime) that always pulls off excellently, to the calm ED, both songs sang by none other than Franchouchou. Simply just brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nFor most people however, its the simple story and backgrounds of the characters themselves that will earn praise over why this series is super popular now. Let's start with the man in question: Franchouchou's agent-cum-director/driver/counsellor AIO Kotarou Tatsumi. He has been the male elicit of the girls in whatever situations, and has outgrown and outshined himself as the main go-to parody, not caring what the girls' opinions are (until it gets serious like Sakura's). But like them, he has a dream to make Franchouchou known around the dead city that is Saga.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with the girls.\\n\r\nSakura Minamoto has been always looked upon as the MC girl ever since the beginning and recurrence of Truck-kun, and is always the person of ridicule when faced with Kotarou's whims, but ever since Day 1 when she wanted to be an idol, in a snap, she lost all hope as she not only got smashed dead by Truck-kun, but questions her intent and place in the unit, only to have these worries recitified to enjoy what has the new zombie life has in store for her.\\n\\n\r\nSaki Nikaidou, the group's bad-ass leader and former gang leader. Nothing short of the finest in life. She has that bad-ass attitude, and doesn't even spare that to Kotarou and his crazy antics, making sure that everything goes her way, and doesn't back out of a fight...that is until her untimely death when facing off another rival gang. For reference, please refer to Episode 2's crazily awesome rap. A gung-ho girl that everyone relies on heavily to get things going, I'd say she is someone you wouldn't try to mess with her wrong side.\\n\\n\r\nLily Hoshikawa, the youngest in the group, and an established idol well in her early years. Her dead-come-alive story is simple: transgender, died after that simple growing of puberty adolescence. But nonetheless, she has what she always had from the beginning: the support from her father-cum-former manager (And it's not easy for parents to guide their own children who have become idols, so to speak).\\n\\n\r\nAi Mizuno and Junko Konno are two separate humans, yet two separate entities which has come alive through lightning exposure and death from a plane crash. It's easy to see how both Ai and Junko are similar to one another, yet have different views when it comes to interaction with their own idols. Granted, Ai is modern (Iron Frill, 2008) and Junko is traditional (80s Showa era), but despite their bickering, sometimes (or much rather) they come together as one to give the performances that people need, and it is well worth it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's sad that Yuugiri and \"legendary\" BEST GIRL Tae Yamada hasn't has their backstories, but given the time frame of the series, they could have done much more into expanding on these two characters, best of the best and legendary status' girls. *ah-chou* Franchouchou is born! And come on, even the calefare Policeman had his moments!\\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga is parody, satirical, and a slap in the face to the archetypes we've come to know and love/hate, and how it manages to do all that, it does so brilliantly at its very best. All we know, there'll never be anything like it ever again on the face of this Earth, and so I must and shall say, it's a \"die, die must watch\" kinda feeling. It puts a smile on my face every episode whether good or hilariously bad, and farewell, hasta la vista to these zombie-fied girls which punch a good heartbeat into this series. Well done, MAPPA, CyGames and Avex Pictures (which this series is a collab! Suckerpunch!)!",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga is your stereotypical horror show with zombies.Nah,of course not,I'm just pulling a leg here.But,that is actually what MAL portrayed the show to be in its initial stage and with very little information,low expectations were immediately setted for the show.However,those very expectations will soon be exceeded.Let's start the actual review.Zombieland Saga is an anime about a group of undead zombies forming an idol group under the brilliant leadership of their manager,Kotarou,in their quest to accomplish Kotarou's goal of saving the Japanese prefacture,Saga.(I feel like this may be the show's way ofmaking a parody of idol anime settings like Love Live that requires the groupto save the school.)This general plot was whipped straight at the viewers after the 1st episode which disguised itself as the stereotypical zombie horror show that it isn't.I got to say that it was pretty good publicity as this is the first \"horror\" anime that anime fans will see in Fall 2018 and will watch this show purely to see whether this \"horror anime\" will turn out great.To generally summarise this anime,this is a comedy idol show that throws a lot of ridiculous moments and a huge meme on its own while it is also able to get serious when the show requires it to be.Now,I'll start discussing on the various parts of the anime that made me give it a score of 8.(There will be spoilers in this review as examples to substantiate certain points.)\\n\\n\r\nThe story in its own is of course,ridiculously simple.Our main protagonist,Sakura,gets whacked by a van,just normal everyday problems,and became a zombie,gets pulled in the idol group under Kotarou and the story continues to show the exploits of our zombie friends.The story is not particularly amazing but it is pretty good as compared to other \"idol\" shows due to its innovative ways of presenting the idol genre through the funny and interesting perspective of our zombie friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of this show is not particularly noteworthy in general.But,there are a few instances where the aesthetics of the show shines.For example,the show uses CGI during the earlier episodes to highlight how awkward and bad our Zombie idol group was when it comes to performing while simultaneously making a joke out of how other idol anime uses the CGI effect on a daily basis.The show then contrast this with using 2D animation when the group starts improving to show the visual improvement of the group,something that is lacking in most idol anime.The animation is also pretty fluid when the characters make over the top actions which made the scene extra hilarious.Therefore,although the general artstyle is mediocre,the way they animated the show is brilliant and innovative and is something other idol anime can learn from.\\n\\n\r\nLet us move on to the audio aspect of the show.The OST is ok,nothing praiseworthy but good noneoftheless.The idol songs are surprisingly good,I enjoyed every single one of them.They are generally on par with other idol anime in terms of its good quality.However,the most noteworthy thing about the audio of this show is the intro.The way the absolutely mind-boggling visuals were complemented by the equally ridiculous intro song made the intro a must-watch,this brilliant masterpiece should not be skipped.Lastly,the ending isn't as good as the opening but it is a good reminder that the show is not pure comedy and does have serious elements to it.(Backstory of some of our zombie friends and their respective arcs)\\n\\n\r\nLet us talk about the characters now.With a huge of 7 zombie girls and our godly manager,there will definitely be good and bad points about the characters of the show.On one hand,characters like Yugiri(lily to a smaller extent,outside her own arc) are certaintly neglected and feels like the cast may have expanded too much and have filler characters.But,the show still manages to add colour to the rest of the main cast,even though some of these characters have little screen time.Firstly,THE LEGENARY YAMADA TAE,an all-time favourite among fans of the show,certaintly lives up to her legendary status.Even though Tae doesn't talk in the show and little is known about her past self,she still manages to captivate the hearts of the viewers with her hilarious and insane stunts.Next,out idol pair,Ai and Junko,although not as amazing as Tae,are still essential to the show as a whole in providing serious analysis on the generation gap and their conflicting ideals on how an idol should act.Lily,although a weak character outside her arc,has shed light on how someone could lose their initial vision after acquiring fame and fortune,hurting their child unknowingly.Her arc is pretty good and is one of the most emotional episodes of the anime.Sakura,our main main girl,is actually not particularly amazing but is often the \"sane\" one of the group,though this is not the case for some of the episodes.The last of the zombie girls,Saki,is a reckless biker gangster whose own undoing is her own recklessness,she is also the leader of the group though she does not act like one well,which actually adds to the comedy aspect of the show.Lastly,we have the wise yet most ridiculous character of the show,Kotarou.Do I even need to spell it out?This man's weird antics never fails to make me laugh and on top of that,he is like a father figure of the group who is helping the zombie girls during difficult times under the guise of his crazy persona,this man is a godsend,best character of the show easily.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,this show is pretty enjoyable,there will be WTF moments initially but once the show gets going after their whole publicity stunt,it gets really good and will sure to bring smiles to you.If you expect a horror anime,this is not the show for you,but if you want to watch a comedy show that will help you get through tough times and bring you a smile after your busy day at work,then this is the show for you.This show,in my opinion,is a revolutionary idol anime that brings a whole new option to the idol genre,therefore,this show is also easily one of the top idol anime out there and imo,is better than even Love Live and the other top idol anime.",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga, a show about 7 girls from different time periods that are all brought back as Zombies to be a pop idol group. Probably one of the craziest ideas for an anime but none the less it works. However while I say that there are many flaws that make this show not as popular as people made it out to be while I waited for it to finish. For everything Zombieland does well there is something to counteract it. Overall it becomes a interesting watch that sometimes makes you laugh and other times make you yawn. \r\nAnimation (9/10): I loved the animation ofthe show. The detail of the zombie skin and when they had makeup on made the girls look so beautiful and gave them the ability to stand out. Side characters were also not rushed/bland and allowed for some design to make them recognizable throughout the show. Locations were very well done as well and gave a somewhat lifelike feel. As for the concerts I can\u2019t say anything else other than\u2026.Perfect.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Voice Acting (8/10): I watched the show half subbed and half dubbed. I personally liked the dub much better as I felt that the sub relied on animation for humor while the dub was able to use both dialogue and animation. However I will give major props to the Japanese cast, who most never had any major roles, for doing a great job and singing beautifully examples episode 7 and the rap scene. As a voice actor in training I love to see people put such effort into brining a character to life and it makes the show what it is. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10): The characters of this show are very hit or miss. I rather like the diversity of the girls but at the same they all seem to\u2026.nice. At the beginning I was predicting Yuugiri or Lily were going to turn out to be problems. But they just turned out to be normal girls and generally friendly. Even Saki was only a \u201cpunk\u201d for a couple of episodes. Junko and Ai fought a little but that was more a difference in time periods then in character. The characters are memorable but like the rest of this show not life changing. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: (6.5/10): While the show establishes a overarching plot to save Saga...they never really go back into it. The character development episodes while interesting often times became boring and easily skippable. While the underlying plot of Kotaro and his relation to the girls, mainly Sakura, was much more interesting and sadly never brought to the front. Something I hope they make a priority if the show gets another season. Overall the show relies to much on single episode plots and not on a overarching. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): This kinda falls into the same as plot, some episodes I loved watching and others I felt like skipping. The lily episode was a touching example of how death affects one\u2019s family while the Saki episode felt like a kinda filler episode that tried to explain Saki\u2019s past with few emotions. This doesn\u2019t make Zombieland a bad show by any standard but I can never give a great grade to a show that I felt bored watching sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10): I waited all season long for this show and after watching it all I can say is\u2026.okay. I didn\u2019t hate it but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone. It\u2019s not really a idol show but I wouldn\u2019t really call it a comedy either. The lack of a overarching plot and reliance on animation over a mix of script and animation really hurts its overall value. If you watch this show, you will probably like it, but it won\u2019t stick with you. \\n",

            "content": "Well, this was not quite the anime people expected when they started watching it... As the synopsis of this anime is quite misleading, people where expecting just another anime about zombies. This was totally not the case as the anime appeared to be a quite unique idol anime, even pulling in fans who normally do not watch idol anime.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe beginning of episode 1 would let you believe that this would be just another typical idol anime, starting out in a very stereotypical way (If you have not read the anime title), with that suddenly changing around 1,5 minutes into the episode when the maincharacter Sakura Minamoto gets run over by a truck. Then the anime makes you believe that this will be just another zombie anime, before introducing the main storyline of the anime. Episode 1 was made very well using all kinds of stereotypes about idol and zombie anime and parodying them. This made it to be quite a unique anime episode. At the end of the episode the main storyline finally gets introduced: Koutarou Tatsumi wants to make an idol group out of zombies to make the group the most popular of the Saga region and 'take over the Saga region'. The rest of the anime follows this concept making for a pretty good story, but not doing anything really exceptional anymore in the story department.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: 8/10\\n\r\nIt is pretty interesting how absurd this anime can be in its comedy. The several deaths of the characters, causing them to become zombies are an example of this, like how Sakura died in the first minutes of episode 1. Its absurdity is also seen in what happens during several of their performances. The characters themselves can also be really comedic, enhanced by the amazing performances of several of their voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation is overall pretty good, but sometimes gets ruined by CGI used in the several performances, which does not look very good. It could be argued that the bad CGI is used to parody other idol anime which constantly use CGI in the performances, for example Love Live, but that still does not make up for how it looks. However, the animation used in the opening is very well done, also making it a very unique opening.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music in the anime is pretty good with some pretty nice themes. Where the anime really stands out though is how the voice actors performed the characters. For example, you can really hear the effort and enthusiasm Mamoru Miyano put into the voice of Koutarou Tatsumi. Kotono Mitsuishi also shows this very well, with really giving that zombie vibe to Tae Yamada (as she is the most zombie-like of the idol group). The other characters are also voiced very well, with the voice actors really putting life into the characters (no pun intended). Lastly, the sound together with the animation makes for (in my opinion) one of the most unique and best openings of the fall 2018 season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nI would say the anime is too short with 12 episodes to really show all the characters with their personalities and character development, but what is shown in the anime is very well done. Several characters get a pretty detailed backstory and are also given character development through new experiences. Some of the backstories and developments could even be experienced pretty emotional for some people.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment of the anime was very good. The first 2 episodes where very enjoyable, able to give plenty of laughs by breaking stereotypical events. The third and fourth episode where somewhat worse in my opinion through less interesting events and pretty bad CGI used in these episodes. Luckily, from the fifth episode it started to become very enjoyable again, further elaborating on backstories of different characters and developing them as well. The comedy also improved in these episodes, returning with many absurd situations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (7,83/10)\\n\r\nOverall, Zombieland Saga is a very good anime with a good story and very good characters. It is also very enjoyable, as the anime uses many absurd situations in its comedy and uses stereotypical situations in idol and zombie anime to its advantage. I hope there comes a sequel, as there still seems to be much in store for a continuation.",

            "content": "Out of 100 Nobles watching...\r\n75 were impressed!\r\n10 were the same CG critics that leave every time in the modern anime era.\r\n10 Would like a more unified tone and desired more coherent explanations.\r\n5 don't like the premise.\r\nZombieland Saga is a show with an ambiguous title that makes perfect sense once you actually find out what the premise of the show is. Zombie girl pop idols in Saga prefecture Japan. Ohhhh I get it now (I don\u2019t get it). In all seriousness I don\u2019t want to give away too much of how this show starts as it has some great first episodes that serve to hook youin.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is essentially an Idol anime with a Zombie flavor, but first and foremost the show is a black comedy. It\u2019s been fairly standard practice these last few seasons as seen with Uma Musume that it\u2019s necessary to put an extra twist onto an Idol anime for it to stand out and get noticed and Zombieland has quirk in spades. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows aspiring Zombie-girl idol group Franchouchou in their quest to revitalize the prefecture of Saga, Japan with their music. The various members are all \u201cIdols\u201d of sorts from their own time period spanning decades to centuries (in the case of one member who is a feudal era Courtesan). The show uses a mix of comedic situations, dark humor, and fast paced scene transitions to present what I would have called an extremely bizarre experience as a whole if I hadn\u2019t watched Pop Team Epic already. The girl\u2019s designs are all unique and they mostly have their own qualities to spur proper best girl debates (although everyone knows Tae Yamada is best). \\n\\n\r\nWhat seemed to keep the show down was trying to deal with its own premise. Episodes never seemed to settle on exactly what kind of tone they wanted to take with characters later in the show tackling issues unique to being undead such as being a performer when you were alive, someone might recognize you as a performer now or how about dealing with the trauma of everyone you know having grown old? \\n\\n\r\nEven in the episodes where the show decides it\u2019s going to tackle these sorts of issues, we get a very Japanese payoff. \u201cMy father thought I was dead all these years and seeing me on stage yesterday is really messing with him because I look just like his dead daughter, but I can\u2019t just TELL him I\u2019m a zombie because\u2026uhh\u2026hrm\u2026Oh well he\u2019s accepted my passing.\u201d \\n\r\nNo sir I don\u2019t like it. \\n\r\nNot one bit. \\n\r\nI need closure, but maybe that\u2019s just me?\\n\\n\r\nThe songs from the performances in the show were quite good. I would say they\u2019re a solid level of enjoyment over what comes to mind when thinking of typical idol songs. The OP however is absolutely fire. Grade A stuff. It\u2019s going right into the mix list. Unfortunately, about 3/4ths of the dancing performances in the show were the same low-grade CG garbage that\u2019s typical of the genre. I get it, it\u2019s cheap, but having portions of the dances in the show be gorgeous and others flip back and forth to stiff 3d models is painfully jarring. The rest of the show was very visually appealing for the most part. The show had a very nice light palette, great stylistic choices, and certainly produced some fine memes for the anime community. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019d say Zombieland Saga was an enjoyable experience that\u2019s worth a watch and deserves a second course. I felt a genuine joy at some of the inspiring moments and empathy during the sad moments. It definitely had some loose bits that could use better stitching together, but the power of comedy and genki charm goes a long way to make a show worthy of being in someone\u2019s anime collection. \\n",

            "content": "First, let me make myself clear. I am never invested into any idol anime. Never. And for an idol anime managed to make me drowned into idol anime for the first time, it is a very great achievement for that anime and a proof of how good that anime concept to make me invest myself to this particular genre. This anime took a concept that seemed won't work but work anyway and made a fresh breath of air into the genre of idols. So, grab your light sticks and prepare a towel to wipe away your sweats after enjoying undead girls reviving your heart withtheir songs and stories. This is an original anime by MAPPA, this is Zombieland Saga.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, this anime excels in dragging many audiences by its absurd yet interesting concept that is zombies becoming idols. It might be very simple if you hear it but from that alone, we could already get very interesting back stories from each of the member particularly how they ended up die. And from there, Zombieland Saga easily built character developments from how they overcome their past and keep living (ironically). This is why every member of Franchouchou has a very great character development including the one who can't speak any word, the Legendary Tae Yamada. Yes, I think Tae-chan is the embodiment of how much Franchouchou grow overtime. The other girls were the ones who taught her how to be more human and while she still could not speak until the very end, she is shown to treasure her relationship with Franchouchou by trying her best to snap Sakura just like the others.\\n\\n\r\nThen the music, the most important component of the idols. I must say, I love the songs very much. I don't know why but every song they sang made this feeling of hype and happiness in my heart. It made me want to chant along their song and I think it is very important for any idol anime to make us feeling that way. Not just that, I love how every singer (or seiyuu in this case) have their own vibe of voices and made their songs colorful. From the high pitch girlish voice of Lily to the more adult voice of Yugiri. And to add more, I actually have a special love for the voice of Junko Konno in their songs. Her voice is very strong and I kinda have a soft spot for strong voices. So yeah, I am kinda Yon-Go stan.\\n\\n\r\nNot just the music, I probably want to make Zombieland Saga as the best opening sequence of this season. The opening sequence is very greatly animated with the song that actually very catchy. And from what we learned from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure, opening with sound effects are better and Zombieland Saga used that fact made the opening unskipable.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah, from all of that goodness, I must say that the CG section which happened in every of Franchouchou idol performance could be annoying at first. But I am giving kudos for the CG animation department as their CG sequences are getting better along with the episode counts. It might saying that they are getting used to use the 3D models more and more. Aside from CG animation, the other animation is pretty good with how beautiful their backgrounds which is taken from actual Saga prefecture and redrawed beautifully and as precise as they could. I just love those comparison photos circulating in the internet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a solid candidate for the best anime of this season (along with Bunny Girl Senpai) with its revolutionary concept in the idol anime genre. Great character developments, great musics and opening sequence, beautifully drawn backgrounds, and of course, a perfect gateaway for someone who never invested themselves into idol anime. In the end, I think Kotaro really did save Saga after all.",

            "content": "What is Zombieland Saga? A horror in a zombie apocalypse? A saga in a land full of zombies? Well, none of that. It is actually an idol anime with zombies as the idols. Why the Saga part then, you ask? Because it is set in the Saga Prefecture, Japan.\r\nThis is an anime that doesn't take itself seriously. Keep that in mind if you want to watch this show. Most of the early episodes are just comedic episodes with little story progression. You will recognize this immediately at episode 1. With the first scene that may shock you while also being a joke. However, without forgettingto be silly, the later episodes get more serious by showing the stories of each characters in turn.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a handful of characters in this anime, I won't talk about all of them in detail but will describe them to some extent. Sakura is our main protagonist. She is an enthusiastic girl who aspired to become an idol. For the others, we have Saki, Lily, Ai, Junko, Yuugiri, and Yamada Tae. Saki was a girl biker. She has a rash personality and has quirks she kept from being in a biker gang. Lily was a child actress. She is the youngest in the cast and has some story involving her father. Ai and Junko was an idol when they were alive, but in different periods of time. Ai has a trauma involving the end of her career, while Junko at first is not content with how much idols have changed. Yuugiri was from the 19th century. She retains a lot of behaviour from that period of time. And last but not least, THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE. Basically, she doesn't speak.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of those casts, we have one more character, who is the producer of this idol group. He is Tatsumi Koutarou. He has a wild and manic personality. He speaks in wittily and tends to brush off things he deems unimportant. He constitutes quite a big part of the comedy of the show. In spite all that, he knows what he should do to solve various problems and how to help the group move forward.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this anime being an idol anime, the music is something that needs to be talked about. There are quite a few songs aside from the opening and ending. Some of them are dedicated to its respective characters in their respective episodes. In my opinion, some songs are nice, but the others are just not that good, notably the insert song for Lily's episode. However, as peoples taste in music are different, you can judge the songs yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing amazing. During dance scenes, CG animation is used. I don't know if it's just the source I'm watching or it is the actual quality, but the CG animation is laggy and has just little amount of frames.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, this anime gives a good amount of enjoyment. The comedic aspects are a big part of it. The comedy is most prominent during the early episodes, but not forgotten on the later ones. The comedy might be a bit cringy at times, but it usually succeeds in making you chuckle.\\n\\n\r\nLater episodes focus more on each characters in turn. These are great stories which tell the girls' past before the became zombies and how they deal with it now. I argue that this may be a better part of the anime than the comedy. It successfully captures each characters' personalities and how they develop.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Zombieland Saga is an idol anime with zombies as their cast, that is filled with comedy, but also doesn't forget their characters. It shows about the past and present of its characters, before and after becoming a zombie. Although the songs and dances might not be spectacular, it is worth watching for the comedy and characters.",

But, one thing that makes me sad : the story is hanging. is there any second season for this anime? no information about that :'( oh man!\r\nI love all of its character's development. they have strong and different background among others. Minamoto Sakura, who always unlucky in entire her life and a fan of Mizuno Ai because she is inspiredby her. Mizuno Ai, legendary heisei idol, inspiring Sakura, and always thinks that showing mistakes is a good part -of an idol- to make us developed. Junko Konno, legendary showa idol who has an opposite thoughts through Mizuno Ai. Junko, with her conservative thoughts that \"idol is always perfect. makes mistake is strongly prohibited\" (you know that Junko and Ai is from the different era) gives a little drama for this story. I love Junko. if i am a man, i will make her as my waifu lol\\n\\n\r\nSaki Nikaido, is a legendary boss from motorcycle gang who become an Idol with Franchouchou (hey, why she is becoming an idol, tho? but i admire her character; cool!). Yugiri, a legendary courtesan who looks graceful and being onee-san of Franchouchou. Lily Hoshikawa, a cutie imouto who dead silly caused by a piece of hair grown on her chin (or cheek? or between them??). she didn't want to grow older, and that grown hair makes her afraid if she will become older. \\n\\n\r\nAnd.... the last character : Tae Yamada! an unawakened zombie who always impulsively acting. she is caring about Sakura at the end. Ah.. I love Tae's Seiyuu : Mitsuishi Kotono who is being a Senior Seiyuu among five of them. (actually, the zombie dog's seiyuu is a senior too). Oh yeah.. i'm a big fan of Mitsuishi Kotono!",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga takes two of the most popular things in Japan and mashes them together, Pop idols and Zombies.A girl inspired to be an idol has her life end and is resurrected as a zombie.And now held captive with other zombies from different eras they only have one choice:to become a pop idol sensation.Im not joking.If you think that concept alone is bizarre then you should see it in action.This pop group,known as franchoucho or something have to work their way up to be well known through gigs such as concerts, commercials, and even rap battles. \r\nOkay my opinion.I am not a big fan idolshows, at all, but would be doing a very large disservice by not recommending this because this show is really great.I gotta say I haven't laughed so much watching an anime in such a long time.\\n\r\nThe band goes through way more than I thought they would for an idol show.The show is so nicely paced;nothing feels rushed or pandering.Also since the characters are so loveable, this anime does have some very hilarious and epic moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlright, here is the down side of the show.Yes, there is CGI. In my opinion CGI in any medium is like a pimple.Everyone has at least one,some make it look better than others, and some look so bad that it becomes distracting. The thing with MAPPA is that they have been using an abundance of CGI since their inception:from that awful looking dragon from Bahamut, the 3d dancing in Yuri on ice, and that clusterfuck that was Inuyashiki.The 3D in this show is better than others but still low tier for an idol show and the frame rate, ohh man .I think MAPPA got a little blindsided with making 3D dance sequences look good with their budget.BUT DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU OFF, because you will start to get used to it after a bit.The 2D on the other hand is really good, there are some scenes that are choppy but it's used for great comedic effect and expression.Also some dance sequences  are animated in 2D and they look gorgeous. The character designs also are amazing. Each character has a distinct color palette and features.Overall the 3D could be better but it doesn't break too much immersion from this series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtr\u2026..(woo let me compose myself)\\n\r\nis straight up fire.The background music combines the zombie aspect and slice of life together and it's really catchy. The insert songs are so hype and great. The ending is really great, the VA is stellar and the opening HOLY CRAP. I am not exaggerating when I say this was my favorite anime opening of 2018.It does everything right.The song is soooo damn catchy it's ridiculous,all the idols are in the song and it's epic, the animation is well timed, goofy, and super hyperactive at the same time Everything is so colorful,THERE ARE LOTSA SOUND EFFECTS This opening was just a treat and I found myself rewinding each episode for that opening alone.\\n\r\nSo as you can tell, I enjoyed the soundtrack quite immensely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in show are done so well that it gives Devilman Crybaby a run for its money.Each character gets so much development,since there are so many characters from different periods of music.One thing that I rarely see in anime is that it deals with cons of being a pop star. It doesn't go to Perfect Blue levels but it was well done.Some characters get an episode dedicated to themselves, but one thing that is kinda disappointing is the two characters I like the most get the least amount of development.Im not complaining too much since the actual situations the idols get put into show each idols character and personality and it is pretty amazing.As amazing as it is hilarious.Speaking of which, the manager of the idol group played my Mamoru Miyano, holy crap.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show is great, this show is great, the plot is well paced, the characters are hella loveable, the 3d can be jarring but the rest of the animation is charming, and the soundtrack is out of this world anime fit into the show really well. And by the duty vested in me, I give this anime the title  of the best anime of 2018(in my opinion)WATCH IT\\n\\n\r\noverall-9\\n\r\nThis show is awesome\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tae is best girl! \r\nWith that out of the way, Zombieland Saga, despite it's name, is not a horror anime. It is a Idol Anime. That's right, cute girls dancing and singing. That's what you're getting from a show named Zombieland Saga. \r\nSo this show starts off as kind of a tear down of idol culture. The manager is a necromancer for brought former idols, child stars, a biker gang leader, an oiran, and Tae (she's really her own thing) back from the dead so they can save the town of Saga with their idol music. That's right, he can't work these girls to death,because they are already dead. There is a reason the concept of why he did this is so silly, but you'll have to watch the anime to find out. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, early on the show lampoons being in an idol band, but it quickly turns around and becomes a straight up idol show, with Zombie gags thrown in. You get to know and appreciate all the girls as the show moves along.  In fact, most of the girls get their own episode dealing with their back story. Almost monster of the week style.  Except the monsters are cute girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the girls are of course cute, but it's really funny watching these cute designs turn ugly for Zombie scare shots. My only issue is the CG dance numbers during concerts feature some jarring animation. While this is common in idol anime, it's still a problem.  Especially for a show like this which can serve as a gateway to the genre. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a fun concept, that turns into a more typical idol show. There is a little more depth to what's going on here as opposed to your average idol show, but you end up with the exact same beats you'd expect if the show was named Idol Saga instead. Still for what it is, it is for the most part executed really well, with a lot of humor. Give it a try.",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga was a huge disappointment to me. What started off as a brillant slap in japanimation clich\u00e9s quickly became a huge clich\u00e9 itself: an average idol anime.\r\nSTORY\r\nA guy who somehow can revive people decides to use dead girls to make an idol group and make his town popular. Now that's an awesome plot! They try to mix up zombie stuff with idol stuff. What could possibly go wrong?\r\nWell, here is what could go wrong:\r\n- the series could try to take itself too seriously.\r\n- Or it could simply give up on that inappropriate mix to become a classic idol series as there are plenty others.\r\n-Or it could also fall into flat comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAll that did happen. They did try to put up a serious story with a plot about ZOMBIES BECOMING IDOLS. The idea itself is stupid as hell!\\n\r\nThey did give up a lot on the zombie side to make it an average idol story.\\n\r\nAnd they did fall into dumb comedy, while it started off brillantly.\\n\\n\r\nI am no fan of idol series. I watched Zombieland Saga because the very first scene was a brillant slap into japanimation industry, as it takes a clich\u00e9 introduction and turns it upside down. Then, the story quickly became about teenage girls doing their best to become famous and doing cute stuff.\\n\r\nBasically, this series is a trap. It makes the viewer believe it will see something uncommon (mixing two genres that could not possibly go together), and then makes it an average idol series.\\n\r\nIn this series, the protagonists try to make idols famous again. Maybe that's actually what the writers try to do: make the idols popular by reaching a new public. It certainly didn't work for me...\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nI am no fan of cutesy art. It's not badly done, it's just that bright shining eyes and pinky stuff everywhere is not really my stuff.\\n\\n\r\nAs every idol series nowadays (yes, this IS an idol series, there's no denying), the dance scenes are made in CGI. And as every idol series, the CGI is horrendous and doesn't go well with the other scenes (drawn, in 2D).\\n\\n\r\nThen, there is the opening. Now, that's something to watch. It is badly drawn, it is a huge mindfuck... and all that makes it so funny! We may say it is badly drawn, but I think it is on purpose: the kind of stuff that is \"so bad it's actually good\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe music didn't really catch my ears, but at least it didn't ruin the series to me. It blends in the scenes very well. The opening is catchy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nFirst of all, Hououin Kyouma is in that series. Yes, I am talking about Stein's Gate protagonist. A character in Zombieland has his seiyuu, his character, his ways of doing stuff (shouting everywhere, giving dumb nicknames, naming stuff with \"temporary name\" in it, ...). And that was just awesome to discover, it really surprised me!\\n\\n\r\nThen, there is the LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE! I don't really like the character itself, but she is indeed legendary for no f*cking reason xD.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest, they're just average characters that can be found everywhere else: the cute MC, the rebellious rival, the lolita, the way-too-serious girl, ...\\n\\n\r\nNothing really memorable here, except YAMADA TAE!\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThis anime is a trap. It tries to catch people with zombie stuff and make them watch an idol anime. And they did catch me, well done. Sadly, it barely has anything else to offer. I really liked the first two episodes, some of their jokes are hilarious, but I didn't really spend a good time in front of the rest of the series...",

            "content": "Out of all of the shows I\u2019m watching this season plus shows that I\u2019ve heard about, none are as insane as Zombieland Saga. Like almost everyone else, I was in the dark about this show. I thought it was gonna be something completely different but it turned out to be a fun idol show with a twist. Spoiler alert: All the main characters are zombies! With a bunch of other zombie girls, The manager, Kotaro, wants to save the saga prefecture by making them all idols for no particular reason other than to save saga.  This sounded like one of those shows that wasgonna be so bad but I watched all of it and was pleasantly surprised. It\u2019s really funny, The manager, played by Mamoru Miyano, is as insane as his portrayal of Okabe, The zombie girls have great chemistry, they are all pretty interesting, and the songs sung are great. Like I said before, the comedy is great. The timing of the jokes are really funny and the situations they get themselves in because they\u2019re zombies kills me. This show doesn\u2019t have a dull moment for me either. Every episode was entertaining and even got into character development towards the second half of the show. The opening is also a huge banger. Supposedly, it\u2019s supposed to take inspiration from old anime from the 70\u2019s from the sound to the visuals. It also takes inspiration from super sentai or power rangers here in the states. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few things that bothered me though. Some of the dance sequences are in CG. I don\u2019t have a huge problem with CG but this show\u2019s CG didn\u2019t look that great. It\u2019s trying to take inspiration from other idol animes like Love Live that do the same, which is great, but it just looks worse. Another problem I had was it didn\u2019t seem like the show knew where it was going the beginning. It started out with the girls thrown into gigs that are super entertaining and got me to watch the show, especially the rap scene, but didn\u2019t really show what the purpose was. It started out with just gigs then into the character development with a dance at the end. I feel if it started with the character development in the beginning then moved forward with the random gigs, it could be a little better. I also want to see more of the progression of the girls and the struggle to become better idols. If we could see that, we could care more. I also don\u2019t like that they barely touched on the saga thing. I feel like they had one episode with real Saga things but I don\u2019t know if the auditorium that they performed in is a real place. If the whole goal is to save saga, there should have been more of a saga focus. The last thing that gave me an issue were the character designs. This was made by MAPPA and they make some pretty nice stuff but Zombieland Saga looks pretty rough with the character designs. Honestly, they just kind look weird or more unique I guess. I think it\u2019s just the faces. They look kinda jagged but they serve well for funny facial expressions which there are plenty of. There were also little things like shots in the training room with the mirror. People would move but not in the mirror but those are just minor.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019ve never seen an idol show but if this is what all idol shows are like, I\u2019ll definitely give them a shot. Extremely entertaining! If you haven\u2019t watched this yet, you might like it or not but it's definitely worth a shot. At the end of the last episode, they said franchouchou isn\u2019t done so I hope that means a second season because I\u2019ll definitely be there to watch it.    \\n",

But, if I were to be asked if this was a good anime????? Well , I'd say that it was but not that good in terms of how the story goes, so here are my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory-mediocre 5: Ok so them girls were Zombies , they died and were resurrected by some loud mouth nut case Tatsumi Kotaru or Inui since he and Sakura knew each other from before, when Sakura was still alive, since series composer,  Murakoshi, Shigeru and anime director ,  Sakai, Munehisa\\n\r\n didn't bother tell us audience how he did it, they basically they just focus on the usual drama found in any idol related anime and just bank on the usual eyecandy and the songs.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Mediocre 5: Just like any idol related anime, the art was just all about those fancy dresses or outfits that makes the characters look hot for the girls and cool for the guys.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Mediocre 5: It's just the songs guys, I just don;t get what a lotta people find anything soooo special about this and why should this category be given a high rating, in fact I pity more about those song writers and composer whose works would be downloaded by a lotta otaku freaks out there from any sites or dark web out there, leavening them song writers and composers  out of the blue with less of the profits from their works. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Mediocre 5: In any idol them anime, like the usual, there will always be the lead and the 2nd lead so on and so forth and then adds some force drama on them them you have usual stuff. Ok so them girls have a backstory and we're show how each girls died before being turn into zombies like  Junko who died tragically, Ai and Liliy both died bizarrely, Sakura died stupidly, given that she got hit by truck kun twice, Saki dies carelessly , Yuugiri and Tae's deads were unknown since this anime's director didn't even bother to include it, which is UNFORTUNATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - fair 6: I would have like this anime very much despite of the mediocre it has with the usual idol themed anime , but I kinda find it disgusting that the anime at the last few episodes decide to go back to the part of how Sakura got hit by truck kun for the 2nd time, where in my opinion the drama that she feels down should have been used in the 1st or in the mid episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall-good 7: That's for the song that I find it good, and don't even think about another season of this thing. unless we get to know the backstories of Yuugiri and Tae chan.\\n\\n\r\nTHAT'S IT FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "LA hates zombies, but these zombies can be an exception...LA needs to buy those idol glowsticks.\r\nZombieland Saga is one of those animes with a wacky, quirky premise and just runs with it, so...essentially it's Hounin Kyouma turned idol producer resurrects 7 girls through time new and old where they were famous and popular and they form to make an idol group. No seriously.\r\nZombieland Saga at first few minutes of it's first episode is made out like a scary horror anime, but then it rips it's facade in half and it turns into an incredibly playful, comedic idol anime with many of the typical cliches thatthe idol anime has and it does it well!..for the most part. Sure cliches are everywhere but it all depends on whether they do it right and Zombieland Saga does that for it's idol elements, mainly bringing us character focused episodes with those idol elements put together and developing these seven zombies and sometimes how they died as backstory and how it affects them as zombie idols now.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Minamoto voiced by Kaede Hondo is our narrative focus for the entire anime and we see her death at the start of the anime, but she at the start is a novice in the idol biz but she wants to bring back her memories before her death and through forming the idol group Franchouchou she along with her other 6 members helps. Ai Mizuno voiced by Risa Taneda and Junko Konno voiced by Maki Kawase have something of a joint character focused arc where Ai and Junko has a clash of beliefs when it comes to fan interaction, Ai saying that because of the current climate of idol groups, they need to broaden their fan reach, while Junko wants things much more private and coveted as an idol. LA favorite character becomes Ai...being a tsundere as well as her backstory massively helping. Lily Hoshikawa voiced by Minami Tanaka gets a rather heartwarming backstory that made a rather satellite character to be on the limelight and became much more noticeable after Lily's focused episode, Saki Nikaidou voiced by Asami Tano a delinquent biker leader also goes through something similar to Lily's as we learn more about her. The only three characters that doesn't really develop are Yuugiri voiced by Rika Kinugawa a courtesan who lived in the Meiji era, the legendary Tae Yamada voiced by *cough* Kotono *cough* Mitsuishi *cough* but that's kinda because she hasn't \"awakened\" yet and thus can't exactly speak and finally the producer that made all this happen Koutarou Tatsumi voiced by Mamoru Miyano who actually really doesn't need much backstory though we get some vague hints, he's just strangely focused in making Saga province thrive again by using Franchouchou as a vehicle, we don't know why let alone how he resurrects the zombies, but it's the mystery about him that makes him even more unpredictable, it's like keeping that mystery alive and not destroying Koutarou's facade as it were that makes the unknown great about him. Zombieland Saga is anything does a pretty good job in it's character development department and how they link to the typical idol cliches but doing them well in the process.\\n\\n\r\nWith Koutarou being the eccentric he is, he does drive the plot but makes it crazy and unpredictable idol rollercoaster, with lives, freakin' rap battles, death metal, rock and heartwarming songs all along the way.\\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga's animation done by MAPPA is pretty well done, with detailed and expressively quirky facial expressions, distinct character designs both in human form as well as zombies, some of which gives us clues as to how they \"might\" have died even! Zombieland Saga also incorporates something like 3D CGI in their lives though the credits tells LA that there were no 3D CGI used, so rotoscoping maybe?, well either way, the 3D CGI usage felt almost intentional with how stiff they are...well they are zombies and all, but nonetheless the CGI does clash alot with the traditional animation most of the time. MAPPA nonetheless did pretty well with the animation across the board, LA can even ignore the clashing CGI use in the lives as they even do something interesting with the CGI as well.\\n\\n\r\nVoice cast was pretty good, special props to Asami Tano and Kaede with their rap battle. But really for a ragtag bunch of zombie through the ages, they have some pretty great chemistry with one another, from Risa Taneda with Maki Kawase to Minami Tanaka and Rika Kinugawa with Asami Tano and Kaede Hondo working with most of the voice cast well but HUGE props to Mamoru Miyano just hamming it up to high heaven, his performance was like meant for him. MVP's easily goes to Mamoru Miyano, Kaede Hondo, Asami Tano and heck LA might throw in Risa Taneda as well. On the dub side of things, as LA did look into the Funimation Dub, the entire main cast just fit sooo well as their respective characters it was crazy, though LA at first had some niggling problems with Brina Palencia as Sakura but she grew on LA over time. LA was disappointed that Zombieland Saga didn't do their english rendition of the songs especially the rap battle, because seriously, hearing Caitlin Glass and Brina Palenica having a rap battle would had been freakin' amazing if they did it with the same flair as their Japanese counterparts BUT from what LA heard, the Blu-rays WILL have the english renditions in them, so LA is excited!. So is Koutarou's English version the same batshit quirky as his Japanese counterpart?...yeah he's pretty much point for point with Ricco Fajardo doing an excellent job as Koutarou on the dub side. Really whether it be the English or Japanese dub, BOTH voice casts were amazing, but as of right now as LA writes this review, watch the Japanese version for now, but once the Blu-ray version drops, both are open game with both being viable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga does have it's flaws however, the most major noticeable one becomes Sakura's character development and to be precise how it was handled, yes Sakura's development has the typical cliches shown in idol animes ALOT, the \"leaving the group\" situation but just couple that with her character backstory and to be honest it became grating and something that has been done millions of times before, yes Junko went through the same thing but not as long as Sakura went through hers and her behavior to say the least was unacceptably grating, thankfully the final episode did resolve it, whether it was worth it going through all of that annoyance...just barely for LA as Sakura finally got out of her grating depressing funk and made the finale explosive. The only other flaw is that like LA said above, Yuugiri, Tae and Koutarou never really gotten a focused episode for themselves which puts a damper if your a fan of that character in question but the only defence LA would give is to Koutarou with his mystery element intact, Yuugiri got the short end of the stick really, while Tae got ALOT of screentime with her....unawakened craziness being her charm.\\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga is the breakout anime of Fall 2018 and it being a quirky unique idol anime was just the icing on the cake for LA. Integrating idol elements to it's characters in making us be invested in them, likable characters and just being a crazy idol comedy that doesn't hold back in it's quirkiness one bit. Zombieland Saga was one of  LA's favorite original anime of Fall 2018 and it well deserved it, sure idol cliches are abound, but man does Zombieland Saga implement them well in both it's characters and it's plot and makes both the journey and destination of making Franchouchou successful idols in the rural province of Saga, dramatic, heartwarming, quirky and crazy, serious and fun as hell all the way through. \\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga brings a new spice to the idol genre and LA wants more of it like it and LA hopes Zombieland Saga just doesn't become an outlier for quirky idol shows because Zombieland Saga was such a uniquely quirky experience and LA loved it all the way through.",

            "content": "An idol show? a comedy show? an idolcom? a comidol? IDK I just know that this show is somehow bearable for people who don't necessarily like Idol anime.\r\n  Zombieland Saga follows a group of zombie girls that perform music shows with the help of their insanely reliably unreliable manager who somehow accomplishes extremely difficult tasks while failing at simple ones. The anime manages to be funny throughout the series and the story develops by letting the girls perform on bigger and better stages as the show progresses. However, the conflicts between characters seem shallow and rushed, and emotional challenges of somecharacters are a bit weak. This may work in favor of the show as it shows (pun) that it doesn't carry itself too seriously. The story gets a 7/10\\n\\n\r\n  For Art, some scenes use horribly animated CGI which only appears in the stage performances. This doesn't carry on to other parts of the anime so art gets 6/10. Sound is good as should be expected from an Idol show, the songs are better than most of whats sung in other idol shows and can even be a bit catchy. In an early episode I was surprised by some actually decent rap so sound gets 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n  For Character and enjoyment, they both get 8/10. The girls are all different from each other but their is clear development on some of them while others have yet to get that treatment as of episode 7. Why character gets 8/10 is the hilarious manager of the group who is way more dynamic than any other character; although he is still two dimensional as of episode 7, he doesn't need a backstory to bring uniqueness to himself. For Enjoyment, it gets an 8/10, and this is coming from someone who dislikes idol shows. Early on, the show is REALLY creative, but starts losing some creative luster as it progresses.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall gets an 8/10, would recommend for anyone looking for an easy laugh/watch.",

            "content": "It's late 2018, I boot up my Wif- ..I mean Computer, I open my browser, Open Canc- Youtube. My eyes are immediatly drawn to my Recommendation, there I see 'TOP 10 FUNNIEST ANIME MOMENT', Upon seeing I think to myself \"Oh fuck, I forgot to sign off my account from my brother's Computer\", OFC, I ignore such vile Uncivil bait for views and my lack of Internet Hygine. My taste in comedy can't possibly be sated by thes- I missclicked, anyway the first few minute see a girl being isekai'd by a truck and I immediatly close the video, say fuck you to my Brother,and Forget whatever happens that day. A month later I come to learn that what I've watch is the first few minute of an anime called 'Zombie land saga', and that's how I start the show. Long winded Explanation that doesn't explain anything? Fuck you this is my first review, I'm not good with starting these. Anyway, Later on I realize that the anime is EXTREMELY popular, and Immediately told myself to wait for the hype to go down. Where then I Marathon the show in 3 days and here we are! aight let's start the actual review\\n\\n\r\nStory.(8/10)\\n\r\nThe overarching plot take a back seat for most of the show, so there isn't much here. I was reluctant to give it a 5< score because of this, but I give it an 8 anyway, seeing how that anything in the story other than the Overarching plot is so good. The overarching plot is there, it's good enough to keep the rest going, but it's prob one of its biggest flaw, only second to its use of CG (more on this later). However, as I've said before, anything other than the overarching plot is really good. The character development especially is very well managed with little to no hiccup. Lore is (Insert joke about season 2 here). Also, I'll give it credit for not giving into the trope of beach Episode fan-service. Overall, if only for the fact that the whole overarching plot being very lacking, I'd give it a perfect score, unfortunately it is, so It's stuck with an eight.\\n\\n\r\nArt(5/10)\\n\r\nVery Very generic, there really isn't that much to talk about here other than a single nitpick and a single praise. Why CG? I know I'm biased here, but why bother with one when you're still capable in doing it with normal 2D animation? I don't get it. In fact The animation overall is very expressive, which makes me wonder even more why they decide to use CG. Don't get me wrong, it isn't lazy, I can see them genuinely trying to make this work,,. But there can only be so much you do with bad CG before the fact that it's bad CG Badly explode allover the Non bad CG part. Overall, I'll give it a mediocre score, I'm eager to give it a 4 but I'll at least give it credit for being very expressive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nHo boy, let me tell you this is THE best part of the show. The Character design, is both elegant and unique, for some you can even see a glimpse of what their previous life were (If you don't know what I mean, read the synopsis), and a clue of how they die. It tease your brain with Visual, rather than a blatant foreshadowing from the Character's line, it tells a story with not only animation and interaction, but also with their character design. That's not all either, every character just like I've said previously, are very expressive, they each (well, most) are very well developed in terms of personality and character. I could wrote more about this, but I don't think I will overstay my welcome here. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nDespite being an 'idol show' The sound design is very very mediocre. The Background soundtrack is 'eh'. The sound composition is fair at best, and at worse; ruin the mood. The only saving grace is the Opening (which sounds better every time I hear it!), anything else is either Mediocre or plain bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nDespite all this flaws, did I enjoy it? Of fuking course I did! I watch it after the hype is over and I complete it in 3 days, why would you think I rush an Uninteresting show and write a review about it? There's nothing better than having high expectation and seeing it not disappoint. It's doesn't take itself too seriously, it doesn't feel like a rushed job, The CG and sound composition kinda ruins the mood but I'll manage. I got so hooked into it that I almost want to continue with other Idol show! Almost. You heretic will never turn me into one of your kind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I will say it's really really amazing. Will it turn me into an Idol fan? Probably not, I think the show work not because of it being an Idol show, but because of it's good writing. This might just be because I have never watch an Idol show before, which means I don't know what make an Idol show enjoyable. In fact maybe the whole reason I enjoy the show is because it's an Idol show and I'm just a bias asshole who can't see thing for what they are. But I digest. Spectre Estate Epic is a great show last season, and nothing will change my mind. The show is over, it's finished, there's no unexplained plot points that make us want another season. It's complete.

            "content": "[If you can, please watch the show before reading this. I discuss some elements that surprised me and I wouldn't want those surprises ruined for you]\r\nStory(9/10): The concept of zombies turned into idols is absurd, and this show knows it. The craziness of everything is fully embraced, and that's the strongest part of this show in my opinion. The story is paced expertly well, with each misadventure feeling fun and outrageous while also not skipping out on some of the more heartfelt elements. Perfectly sketchy mastermind Koutarou's main goal, the revitalization of Saga, allows for a free-flowing plot that pummels the viewer with pure fun.I was pleasantly surprised by the touching plot-lines sprinkled in the 2nd half of the show. I loved the direction everything went in episodes 10-12 in particular. Overall, Zombieland Saga's story is packed with just the right amounts of mayhem and heart, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): Goddamned fantastic. Even though the show's main focus is the dead everything feels so alive. (I really hope I'm the first to say that.) I haven't seen animation this slick since Kill La Kill. The range of motion the animators painstakingly added to these characters is outstanding. From Saki's abruptly intimidating body-language to Tae's hunger-fueled frenzy, movement is an absolute joy to watch. Everything else is great, namely the vibrant backgrounds along with the constant changes in the main cast's costumes. The jarring flaw that prevented art from being a complete 10 is the distracting CGI dances. I do not know much about animation, but I have to assume that animating choreography is a pain in the ass. I understand the transition to CGI for the more complex dancing scenes, but man, does it stick out like a sore thumb. I could probably count the CGI scenes on one hand, and there are some dances that don't have it, however I wished the quality was much better than it turned out because the characters look uncomfortably close to MMD quality at times. Overall the animation is fantastic, but the CGI drags the hyped up performances equences down for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10): I can't find the words to show how much I love the voice acting. It's wonderful and everyone does a fantastic job. I really appreciated how the voice actresses did not sound like they were drowning in autotune for the songs. Either they were using some pretty damned impressive autotune tech or they have lovely singing talent equivalent to their flawless voice acting skills. The OP is catchy as hell, and the background music (especially that one badass guitar piece for Saki and the other bikers) overall was a pleasure to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10): I thought they would be shallow and I wasn't expecting anything bold, but most of them were decently fleshed out. I loved the exploration into Sakura's mentality during the final three episodes in particular. Saki's and Lily's respective episodes were both great, with appropriately touching moments. Junko's, Ai's, and Yuugiri's plotlines felt reasonably weaker in my opinion because they mainly served as foils to Sakura. These three were the less memorable of the bunch but their stories were decent at best. I also appreciated how Koutarou's source of motivation isn't actually told to you and left to be pieced together by the viewer. The back-and-forth between the characters is what shines the brightest. All the funny moments landed and never felt out of place. I particularly found Koutarou's \"good morning's\" the funniest. It's comedic when it needs to be and more somber when it needs to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10): It's a blast from start to finish. Even though I had minor gripes with characters and art, none of those took anything away from how much I enjoyed this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(10/10): Zombieland Saga has flaws, but its accomplishments in every department overpowered all the problems I had with it. It presents a powerful lesson on perseverance and is one of the funniest shows I've ever watched. It's a fantastic (wow, I've used that word a lot in my review), well-rounded show that gave me everything I wanted from it and also delivered a surprisingly heartfelt story in the end.",

            "content": "[I tried to make this as spoiler free as possible. Feel free to read before watching the anime]\r\nZombieland Saga is the most underrated anime of 2018. I'm not even exaggerating. It got written off as a generic horror/zombie or idol anime, while in actuality it's a brilliant take on the idol genre, exploring controversial themes, combining them with common idol tropes, art style and music, and packaging them all together in a masterpiece show that only anime can achieve.\r\nThis may not be immediately obvious, as Zombieland hides this under the cover of horror and satire, both of which serve to advance the show's main idea.\r\n__________________\r\nZombielandSaga starts off with our protagonist Sakura, cheerfully running outside of her house holding an interview sheet which will serve to start her idol career, when she suddenly gets hit by the infamous Truck-kun (when will his terror end?). Sakura awakens as a zombie girl in an abandoned house, surrounded by other zombie girls. Our male main character, Tatsumi Koutarou, a loud, obnoxious man, appears, and reveals he has gathered all these girls, each coming from various time periods with various personalities and revived them as zombies so he could make them into idols and save his home prefecture of Saga.\\n\\n\r\nIf this premise sounds familiar and ridiculous, that's because it should be. Zombieland is a Konosuba-like parody of the idol industry: \\n\r\nThe girls being zombies is a joke on how hard idols must work to be good at their job, the very distinct and different girls being joined by the power of plot to save something is a joke on the predictable plot of idol anime, and Tatsumi being the way he is, is a joke on how idol managers only care about using the girls as tools.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's brilliant about Zombieland is how it uses the parody, and the various comedic situations the girls find themselves in, to draw us into the show, and attaches us to the characters. It subtly changes focus from the comedy onto the girls, their development, and how they improve at being idols, until the point where it outright becomes the very type of show it was parodying at the beginning. All without us the viewers not noticing a thing.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the focus is changed, Zombieland explores the very unorthodox nature of its idol girls. Unlike the purity and strict guidelines other anime shows follow in terms of their idols, Zombieland has a trans girl, an oiran (19th century Japanese courtesans, often prostitutes), and a badass biker girl.\\n\r\nBut despite their background, the show never treats them differently from the other girls. It explores their background while affirming that they have a place in the group as they are. It's a bold move, which criticizes the lack of such characters in other idol anime while at the same time showing how to implement them, and it's highly appreciated.\\n\r\nAs the show progresses, we also see Tatsumi change his behavior, treating the girls with more respect and behaving like a proper manager.\\n\r\nIn short, it takes very unique and different characters and makes them work together without them losing their individual traits.\\n\r\n__________________\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, it is also, you guessed it, a parody of idol anime, while at the same time being used in the same manner as other idol anime. The show starts off which cheap-looking CGI, poking jokes at the bad CGI most idol anime have at the beginning, and the CGI slowly advances, until it is supplemented by hand drawn animation.\\n\r\nThe coreography is detailed and realistic, and yet at the same time anime-like and energetic, as with all idol anime. It's fun to look at, and you might even want to learn the dances.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I would like to give praise to the art style and music. It's a unique style, simplistic with lots of colors, which makes it easy to immediately differentiate the girls, and always keeps your attention.\\n\r\nThe opening is one of the best I've seen, with a brilliant song that is a homage to anime of the 60s and 70s, with upbeat music and lots of violins and trumpets.\\n\r\nThe music has variety, with both catchy and soft, bittersweet songs, as with all idol anime. It's something you'd want to listen on a regular basis.\\n\\n\r\n__________________\\n\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed this anime, for two very distinct reasons. At the beginning, I enjoyed its parody and comedy, laughing out loud multiple times, and as the show progressed, I enjoyed its music, characters, and the fact it is an idol anime, the exact thing I was laughing at being parodies.\\n\r\nZombieland is simply as entertaining as anime can get, and as fun as it can get, both a joke and serious, both happy and sad.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend watching it even to those who hate the idol genre, as it has just enough power to possibly change your opinion.",

I only watched one PV before it started airing and even from that I couldn't have even guessed what this was gonna be about. Of all things I didn't expect an idol show at that. Admittedly I've never watched an idol show and this was a pretty fun ride. \r\nThe characters in this show are probably about as tropey as it can get with anime just filling in the blanks with each of our girls and then we get the big hitters. The LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE and the groups producer KoutarouTatsumi (voiced by non other the Mamoru Miyano AKA Okabe Rintaro). Tae had a good role of always being comic relief which is weird to think about in a largely gag concept of \"zombie idols\" and I wouldn't have it any other way with the antics she gets up to. Koutarou on the other hand is largely shrouded in mystery as to who he is and why he wants to save the Saga prefecture with an idol group whilst simultaneously berating our group in the funniest ways possible with incredible delivery.\\n\\n\r\nPart of me wants to give this an 8 or possibly a 7 just because the dance sequences where done in pretty bad looking CG that made for really jarring cuts back to full animation but I have a feeling that was done intentionally as to mock its other contemporaries in an almost deconstruction nature of idol shows. Deconstruction of Idols is probably the most apt name for this show giving how it handles a lot of the things thrown at it and the cookie cutter nature of it characters. \\n\\n\r\nIf anything it having this quality probably makes this show sit comfortably at a 9 for me. It was a good time every week I tuned in for each episode had great gags, excellent chemistry between our characters and definitely showed off the better parts of idol anime while at the same time bashing it and always had me wondering what our undead girls were gonna get roped into next week.",

            "content": "When I first started Zombieland Saga, I wasn't sure what to expect. About halfway through it, I almost dropped it. But I'm glad that I finished it. And here's why:\r\nZombieland Saga is full of comedy and that's why I stuck around for as long as I did. Some of it is repetitive and abrupt but it's this which makes it even funnier (sometimes). The story itself is simple though and some may find this boring. But it's easy to get into even if idol anime isn't your thing. (Trust me, I'm one of those people.) Also, the anime's use of flashbacks near the end ofthe 12th episode made the episode more powerful that it already was.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd the characterization is good. Not great but good. You learn more about the characters and their backstories as the anime goes on. Unfortunately, some characters weren't very explored. This is kinda obvious considering that we find out more about two of them naturally and the later episodes explore a few other characters in a noticeably episodic manner. This isn't necessarily bad but, because of how the backstories are done later in the series, it's pretty obvious when some of the characters aren't covered. The timing of the main character's backstory was done well in my opinion and I really enjoy being able to notice and learn one thing at a time about a seemingly blank but funny character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good; it's bright and looks really nice. The animation is great most of the time but some may not be a big fan of the CGI. The transition between the normal animation and CGI is very noticeable and the speed of it is kinda slow. The characters themselves don't look too bad in CGI though. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. The opening is funny and catchy. The ending song is sweet and nice sounding but it's slow and lacks energy. That's normal for ending songs but it's not something I listen to every episode. The songs they sing together are really good though. It's nice being able to hear the voice actors' singing voices. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime from start to finish. It's comedic but becomes inspiring later on. The anime turned itself around and became something I didn't expect. Overall, this anime deserves a 9. I'm going to miss this series a bit.",

Everyone having somewhat of a cloud of mystery around them until they get an episode centered around themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing in the show is both funny and heartbreaking at times, I can't help but recommend ZombieLand Saga to both casual viewers and hardcore fans of the anime genre.

            "content": "This is my 3rd review! I appreciate all who take the time to read my reviews. (Please check out my other reviews!). There were a lot of surprise shows this season, and Zombieland Saga was definitely one of them. I knew kind of the deal going in, but it wasn\u2019t anything I expected!\r\nLet me say that I haven\u2019t watched any idol show (Love Live! IDOLM@STER, etc) ever because I\u2019m not too interested in the genre. This one kind of fooled me, and probably many people thinking it was a full-on parody or satire of the genre. At first, it definitely felt like it was. Iknew a few viewers who were intrigued by it, however as the show went on, some of them felt disappointed as it did turn out to be an \u2018idol\u2019 show.\\n\r\nBut I stayed, simply because I liked the characters and wanted to know more about them! I guess I can say I was fooled into watching an idol show, but don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not just about to go watch Love Live! Or another idol show because of this though. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA girl named Sakura suddenly dies and is revived as a zombie, along with other girls. They all seem to be affiliated with idol or some important culture/background. You find out the man behind all of this is Koutarou Tasumi. His goal is to revive the city of Saga with an idol group. At face value the plot does seem a little dull, however as the story goes on each character\u2019s history expands on the main plot. This is what made me appreciate the show a lot. All the girls are dead, and they are revived for a reason. Some stories made me smile, laugh, and even tear up. That\u2019s enough to say it\u2019s a great story. It wasn\u2019t breathtaking but definitely enjoyable. Each episode or two had a little variety which made me curious as to what was coming next week (obviously besides from the ending credit previews).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character was distinctive from the beginning. Their looks and their personality. I really didn\u2019t have a favorite though as all the girls weren\u2019t super interesting to me. What I really took from them was their story and how they became zombies in the first place. I think that history is what made me like each character more in the end. I think they all meshed well together even with how distinct each character is. They all work together, which makes a good group. There were some quality of life side/support characters that reappeared which I thought was neat.\\n\r\nHowever, I think the sole character that carried the show was definitely Kotarou-san. He himself made this show push the extra mile. He is what made this show interesting and hilarious. Mamoru did an excellent job and I feel like the voice director just told him to go wild. He\u2019s one of my favorite voice actors. Steins;Gate is my favorite show so just the craziness and wackiness of his voice really upped the game for me. His funny English and random outbursts made me laugh too many times watching this. He actually gets a whole point for his performance. This ties in with the sound which I\u2019ll cover later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m actually not a big fan of CG, even if it is an \u2018idol\u2019 show which has CG, it really just doesn\u2019t vibe with me at all. It\u2019s just so eerie to me so having to watch it was a pretty big turn off. However, I do like each character\u2019s designs, and the art style and techniques I actually liked quite a bit. Each character was distinct and they wore different outfits here and there. Just going back between CG and non-CG was just too much of a juxtaposition. In the end it was a really colorful show and I enjoyed that. But what really kept this score in tact was the opening cinematic. Holy cow! It\u2019s so different I love it. The song is okay, but just what they are doing is awesome!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was amazing. You already know how much I praised Mamoru for his performance with Kotarou. Even with how stupid Tae and the police officer sounded, it just went along with the silly tone. Saki with her slang, Yuugiri with her old era tone, each voice was unique. And to be honest, I thought some of the performance songs were catchy. Like I\u2019ve heard Love Live! songs and with how many there are\u2026I think I like one or two, so it\u2019s hard to get my attention with idol songs. I didn\u2019t add them to a playlist or my music library or anything, but they good enough for me to enjoy the performance. Especially Junko\u2019s singing, jeez, that\u2019s a singing voice that I like. As mentioned, the opening and ending songs are forgettable. I think the rap battle in the second episode was definitely one of my favorite episodes that I\u2019ve seen in a while. Sick bars. This episode solidified that I should keep watching. However I was a little disappointed that nothing really got up to this caliber, but it wasn't bad by far.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhenever we got history on a character or when Koutarou was talking, I really loved it. When there was CG or some drama between the girls, it was definitely a turn off. But it wasn\u2019t enough for me to really dislike the show a lot. I got so caught up wondering how each girl died, and when it\u2019s enough to make me tear up or be surprised, it carries the enjoyment score up. Especially the glimpse of something in the last episode. It literally made me stand up and look wide-eyed to my girlfriend who watches this show with me. I think it was very entertaining and I had a good time watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor my final thoughts I think it\u2019s a very good show. It\u2019s not bad for what it is. It\u2019s definitely an idol show, but with what I like, it was good enough for me to enjoy it. I\u2019d say give it a shot. I had no experience with an idol show so this was a good first one for me. It\u2019s silly, dramatic, and heartwarming. Adding the score total up it comes to 40.5 out of 50, which is an 8/10 really in the end!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! I\u2019ll try to put some more out when I can. I appreciate it!\\n",

            "content": "Idol series, a genre that certainly has had its peak in the past years but has also known some steep decrease in popularity in recent years. We really don't see a lot of \u201cgood\u201d takes on the genre if hardly any. One could always say it's gotten old or way too repetitive, a bunch of ambitions individuals form up an idol group and strive for fame and success, yeah, I could form the same an assumption if you put it in similar words, but zombies forming an idol group sounds a lot funnier and exciting.\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nIt takes a lot to maintain a good and consistentplot, and to be honest, \u201cZombieland Saga\u201d while not of a mature or serious setup and doesn't have a long run to it either is still doing just about decent handling itself in term of consistent writing and story progression.\\n\r\nA bunch of mysterious \u201cidols\u201d from different periods of time gets resurrected somehow into mildly-sane zombies and put in a quest of saving this town called Saga. Don't even ask me how can simply being an idol save anything either.\\n\r\nAs we start at the first episode from a blank starting point, we basically know nothing about their world or the main character cast, but just the idea of seeing everybody open up to one another and strengthening their bonds is one quirk of Zombieland Saga that does right, it's nothing to take lightly as to wake up one day and be told that you're dead and are now a zombie, and seeing these girls not only getting over that, but still have a strong spirit to even dare grow as individuals on a greater scale is astonishing, and the sense of achievement that comes throughout the series is just that inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7.5/10):\\n\r\nFor me at least, Zombieland Saga nailed its own art style, I'm confident enough that I could distinguish it from tones of other similar shows, it's just how they play with colors here. So you get theri zombie form that has all of those could and lame colors, and as soon as they put up some makeup to cover that up, you could swear their flesh is now more lively and vibrant, as the colors get stronger and outline them even better.\\n\r\nI feel that it was a shame for a great art style as that to fall short on animation on some of the big moments.\\n\r\nThis is a show about idols, so you know it's going to involve some intense performances on the high scale, and they better have some clean shots in store for that, unfortunately, the use of cheap CG really kills the mood sometimes, you'd be having a great close up on a character's face in mid-performance and then it suddenly becomes a really zombie-fest of a visual with those ps2 graphics. Relying on pure 2D would have saved this show a lot of hassle.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\\n\r\nMusic takes a huge cut from this show, so the vocals better be rocking it alright. And that's where I was right.\\n\r\nUnlike the sometimes horrifying visuals, the featured songs were spot on, you could almost get the same excitement of their live audience as if the voice acting cast were some sort of real world band that know what they are doing. Speaking of which, not only their singing sequences were great but also the rest of voice acting, the sad and fun moments were equally emotionally strong, and probably the star there would be Miyano Mamoru that voices the manager Tatsumi (Also famous for voicing Okabe from Steins;Gate).\\n\r\nI really enjoyed both the opening and ending theme songs, the opening was a bit questionable for me as a first exposure, it had that strange mecha-power-rangers feel to it, but it really does stick to the mind and the ending had a really strong nostalgic feel to it, it almost makes you feel bad the show will have to end one day, and it did for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nProbably what this show nails to the bone the most. Every. Single. Character. Man, that's a lot of favorites, I just can't pick one, they are all superb and similarily fleshed out.\\n\r\nFirst of all, their design, they do look like a group of idols for starters, and yes, they have that special main character aura to them as well. I really like their attire, and even reflects the period each one of them belonged.\\n\r\nMy favorite part was their impactful backstories, I thought I signed up for a fun and goofy show, and I ended up pulling on my third tissue box by the end, man, those were some depressing and reflecting backstories that explained a lot of their individual treats, something I never expected from a show like this, but still appreciated to the core.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\\n\r\nI'm not big on moe, nor am I that huge on idols shows, I probably only wanted to watch this because I had some extra free time and I needed to fill, I had already picked up more interesting shows and I needed another one just to make it an even number, but I never expected it to rank even higher than other picks, I really had my fair share of laughs, I spared some tears as well, I even got as far as changing opinions I had on a lot of other things prior to watching Zombieland Saga.\\n\r\nThis is something I'm likely to get back to later, mostly for the fleshed out and lovable characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.8/10):\\n\r\nZombieland Saga proved to be something unlike the generic musical idol series, some would say it's another hit or miss entry, but it really not.\\n\r\nHowever I try to look at it, its emphasis on well-written characters really is something you rarely see in a lot of good shows, and its plot, in general, is something of a great rewatch-ability value, I myself I'm planning to get into the dubbed version as soon as I'm finished writing this review, because apparently, I need more managers screaming of good mornings and shaving squids up my face for no apparent reason.",

            "content": "Studio Mappa will never cease to astound me with the absurd level of ambition it pours into each and every project it creates. Ever since Zankyou no Terror put them on the map back in 2014 (and even before then, with their debut Kids on the Slope), they have always struck me as a studio willing to go above and beyond, to take on unconventional stories with demanding production requirements, never settling for just being good enough when they had the potential to be so much more. In some ways, that can be to their detriment; while I\u2019ve enjoyed all of their work I\u2019ve seenthus far immensely, I also feel like their ambition almost always outstrips their ability to pull it off at 100% capacity. Yuri on Ice, Zankyou no Terror, and now Zombie Land Saga were all incredibly complex, risky undertakings, and I always get the feeling that the scripts could have used maybe one more pass at the writing table to truly match the challenge they set for themselves. That said, I will always respect a project that shoots for the stars and maybe doesn\u2019t quite stick the landing over a project that plays it too safe to leave any sort of impact. The kind of ambition Mappa exemplifies is the kind of ambition I\u2019d love to see from every other studio out there, the kind of unique and exciting storytelling that makes this medium so valuable. And if Zombie Land Saga isn\u2019t quite the masterpiece it could be, that still shouldn\u2019t take away from just what a fantastically fun, exciting show it is, bursting with imagination and creativity that makes its weaker aspects much more forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, for those of you who haven\u2019t been keeping abreast of the seasonal discourse and thus haven\u2019t seen this show plastered around every corner, follows young Sakura Minamoto, a high school girl with dreams of being an idol that are promptly dashed when she\u2019s killed by a runaway truck in the first minute of the show. And as she flies in slow-motion through the air, raucous death metal playing over the opening credits, you begin to realize the ingenious bait-and-switch Mappa has caught you in. This isn\u2019t just an idol anime: this is a zombie idol anime. Sakura is resurrected as a zombie, along with six other idols (and idol-adjacents) from various points in Japan\u2019s history, by the mysterious motormouth Kotaro Tatsumi, who plans to turn them into a functioning idol group to serve as a tourism boost for the dilapidated Saga prefecture. And thus, tongue firmly in cheek, the show takes you on a rollicking tour of idol anime\u2019s greatest hits as filtered through the Troma school of schlock horror, and the result is as hectic and inspired as that description might lead you to believe.\\n\\n\r\nYes, in a word, this show is fun. It\u2019s ridiculously fun. It has such a firm grasp on the mechanics of its own absurd situation that it\u2019s able to start cranking out killer body horror gags and slapstick scenarios straight out of Evil Dead\u2019s slightly peppier cousin right from the word go. The contrast between the usually sterile, pure image of idols and these cute zombie girls with their limbs popping off every odd second is such a refreshing burst of laughing gas, never failing to catch me off guard in the best ways. There\u2019s something kind of lightly transgressive about the whole affair, about letting these focus-group-managed starlets be this wacky and unexpected and weird and outsized and occasionally gross. It grants the entire show an air of unpredictability; for once, I wasn\u2019t really sure how this story was going to play out, even as it starts seguing into more conventional idol trappings in the back half. And when I\u2019m having this much fun not knowing what\u2019s coming next, that speaks volumes about how damn committed this show is to the beat of its own offbeat drum.\\n\\n\r\nThe real secret weapon behind Zombie Land Saga\u2019s success, though, is its characters. Franchouchou, as it\u2019s eventually named, is composed of some of the best, most immediately memorable eclectic personalities I\u2019ve seen in quite some time. Sakura is the straight man who\u2019s not afraid to match the intensity of her fellow group members, there\u2019s a pair of more conventional idols who ground the mechanics of the story in their expertise, an expressive little girl with her heart literally beating out of her chest, an actual courtesan with a killer right hook, a badass biker chick who instantly steals every single scene she\u2019s in, and The Legendary Tae Yamada, who might just actually be a conventional mindless zombie, but god dammit, it\u2019s Sailor Moon\u2019s legendary voice actor wrangling an entire character performance out of nothing but growls and grunts, and that\u2019s just plain incredible. But even she\u2019s nothing compared to the sonic wall of explosive mouth diarrhea that is Kotaro Tatsumi. Good. Fucking. God. I have heard Mamoru Miyano\u2019s unhinged vocal stylings before, but this performance just takes it to a whole new level. He is operating at 200% the entire show, rattling out barely coherent orders and inspirational platitudes like a human gattling gun in a voice that swings between \u201csentient shit-eating grin\u201d and \u201csloshed drill sergeant\u201d at the drop of a hat. You\u2019d think that would very quickly get annoying, but somehow, Miyano hits the perfect sweet spot between sincerity and self-parody every time, and result will have you bowled over laughing every time he opens his mouth. It\u2019s this cast that endears you to Zombie Land Saga\u2019s unorthodox wavelength, a wacky band of misfits that capture a spirit of camaraderie you can\u2019t help but get swept up in.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is good, because while the time we spend just hanging out with these lunatics and watching them do idol stuff is oodles and oodles of fun, I feel that the show isn\u2019t quite as strong in the more emotional moments. Their struggles just feels a little too conventional and perfunctory, especially when compared to how daring and expressive the lighter moments are. To me, Zombie Land Saga doesn\u2019t feel like a show where a subplot as simple as \u201ctwo group members don\u2019t get along and have to resolve their philosophical argument!\u201d really fits, or where the janky CG used for many of the performance scenes matches the usually expressive-as-hell animation. It\u2019s the faces that really make all the difference: compared to how lively and exaggerated the girls\u2019 expressions are at their best, such as during a gut-busting rap battle in the second episode (yes, you read that right), the stiff, limited movement of their CG models keeps you at far more of a distance at what are supposed to be the climactic emotional high points. And you can really feel that difference, because the few times where the performances are done in traditional animation are easily the best, most evocative moments of the entire show. Especially when, without spoiling too much, one of those performances ends up being the lynchpin of one of the best goddamn coming-out subplots I\u2019ve experienced. If the rest of the emotional storytelling were on that level, then I would feel confident calling this show an outright masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAs is, though, I can\u2019t feel too disappointed in the show we got, even if it\u2019s maybe a couple of rewrites away from true transcendence. Zombie Land Saga is still absurdly fun, endlessly creative, and bursting with energy, a roller coaster ride of imagination and light subversion that I would definitely love to ride again should a second season be greenlit. Chances are you\u2019ve already checked it out for yourself, but for those of you still on the fence, now\u2019s the time to watch it. I promise you, you won\u2019t regret it.",

            "content": "Although I\u2019ve never watched any idol shows before, Zombieland Saga managed to grab my attention with it\u2019s weird premise and got me hooked with the very first episode.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story centres around a group of zombie girls being forced into becoming an idol group by an overzealous manager. Does it sound crazy? Yes. Does it work? Absolutely.\r\nThe crazy premise of the show lends itself well in several aspects in regards to the story. The fact that the group is made up of zombie girls is the main source of comedy in the show and can often lead to some funny hijinks. The backstories of thegirls and how they died can deliver some real emotional moments, besides these there are also moments of drama within the group, but these can be either hit or miss. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nFor the most part the anime has a nice and vibrant look to it, with smooth animation. However the animation doesn\u2019t really stand out when compared to other shows. The only time it does stand out is in the use of bad CGI, although it could be argued this is used to parody other shows it comes up too often to excuse.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music the group makes in the show is absolutely amazing and every time I hear it, it gets stuck in my head for several days. The sound design doesn\u2019t particularly stand out either which is often a good sign. Lastly the voice actors do a good job conveying their lines and especially the manager is absolutely amazing at his role.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in the show all have their own personalities and mannerisms. Most of the main girls get their own arc resulting in some character growth. Of the main cast, the manager is the absolute highlight, stealing any scene he stars in. The side characters feel fun too, but most of them get very little screentime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nZombieland Saga is an absolute joy to watch and a great watch if you\u2019re looking for a fun show that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. Even though there are moments where the show lost some steam it remains firm on track and manages to deliver a good series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n",

Will they be able to sing as idols without people finding out their zombies..... From what I've no there really bad at hiding it but that's part of the fun. \r\nArt \r\nThe art does its job well enough when it needs fast pace comedie it worksreally well and when the show needs slow moments it gives us time to breath. The only problem I do have with it is the cgi on the dancing and singing it feels out of place though it's not to bad the girls move fine enough. \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nThe music and voicing acting in this show is great Tatsumi, Koutaror Played by Miyano, Mamor Is so funny and you can tell is having a blast voicing this guy and the other girls do a great job as well. I'm shocked I liked the music from this some of them are stuck in my head. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe Character that steals the show is Tatsumi, Koutarou it's hard to describe him now since I saw the last ep I can only describe him as Happy, insane, charming and a very bad driver. The rest of the girls are great as well when we get to see there back stories and how they died the only ones we don't really learn about is  Yuugiri and Tae which I hope theres a season 2 so we can see there backstories \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show I found it pretty funny at parts, the Characters I love and hope to see more in a season 2 if we get one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nI recommend this show a lot to people who don't like idol shows it's a good watch and brings some life this the genre which is so odd since there dead........ \\n\\n\\n\\n",

My shock wasn't because of the weirdness of the show, I like weirdness I embrace it, it was more because I wasn't really expecting this at all but I'm glad I stuck around till the end.\r\nThis show hassome of the best characters this season starting with the manager Koutaro Tatsumi his voice actor (Mamoru Miyano) is excellent and every time he talked he made me laugh,*spoiler ahead* btw many people theorized that he was the one that ran over Sakura I actually always thought that he used to know her or had a crush on her when she was alive the way they show it in the show I could have been right *spoiler end*\\n\\n\r\nAs for the girls we have everyone with their special little quirk Sakura being main girl as main as can be, Saki a badass, Lily with her heart poking out and being cute af, Junko being the quiet, gentle soul, Ai being litteraly an idol, Yuugiri slapping people left and right, and Tae doing Tae things, overall it is a group that I would like to see a lot more from them.\\n\\n\r\nMy main issue with this show is the cg used on the performances, I know that it is kinda of a parody of idol shows and I know that animating a whole performance with dance moves costs a lot of paper, but i thought that at least for the final performance wouldn't be in cg, but nonetheless it wasn't really too bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe end left room for a second season and for what i've been seeing apparently this is big in Japan so I'm 90% sure that there will be a second season and I'm hoping for it.\\n\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\\n\\n",

Yet here I am, writing a review for what's now unironically my favorite anime of all time, despite being an idol anime. Why is that? Well, because Zombieland Saga deserves it.\r\nTo quickly go over what the show's all about, since the official synopsis doesn't tell you much, six legendary girls (and Sakura Minamoto) are all dead, and have been brought back to life as zombies with one simple goal. Under the guidance of Kotaro Tatsumi, these seven girls are going to save the Saga Prefecture... asan idol group. I don't quite get it either, but them's the breaks. And now that we've covered that, let's talk about the show.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna sit here and say it's a flawless masterpiece, because masterpiece though I may call it, it ain't perfect. I've got some gripes with the seventh and final episodes in particular that I can't get into for spoiler reasons, but aside from a few eyebrow-raisers here and there, the plot's pretty great. Everything progresses at just the right pace, in just the right way, for just the right reasons. The looks of the show are great (I thought so anyway), I'm no sound design expert but I'm a big fan of the sound in this show, and I'd have to write an entire essay to go over how great the cast is. This is gonna be my new show that I just recommend to absolutely everyone looking for something to watch.\\n\\n\r\n10/10, I'd be totally fine with losing my memories just to experience the whole thing over again.",

I have no idea why dose this anime have a 7.45 reating hear cuz its trully a great anime. Jokes always work and the paceing of them is good to, the anime knows when to be sirious and when to be just comedy gold that we needed in a while. The animation is great for the most part ecept for the dance scenes becouse thay used CGbut it wont bother u to much i guess. The charicters have such good bonds of friendship and love that its just perfect. For now the episode 8 is my favorite of them all it really caught me of guard how emocional it was and sad.

            "content": "Comical, engaging and very easy to get into.\r\nZLS starts from the personal story of Sakura Minamoto who dreamt to be an idol, but meets a rather unfortunate event. It then delves into the fantasy of having the second life as walking corpse with somehow full consciousness and capability to fulfill the said unachieved dream.\r\nThe most fascinating is that this show deals with infamous pop culture like death metal and rap but maintain its contrast element. Cute anime girls band together in death metal event. Cute anime girls spitting bars, what more could we want ?!\r\nThe only down setter for this show is the CGI. I'mnot sure if its intended to be a parody of other idol show, or just to make the production easier. Yeah its bad, but not bad enough to kill the show. Also the CGI are only in the small percentile of the show (less than 10% so just bear with it already D:).\\n\\n\r\nWe can also feels the love of the production staff towards this show. The passion from the animator and voice actors/actresses truly shape this shows into a beautiful piece of art as proved by the two first episode and the episode 5, it feels they have unlimited budget and go all out with the animation and production quality. It is indeed a candy for mine eyes.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Gorgeous art style , vibrant voice acting, terrific build-up that lead to an satisfying ending, and the most important is lots of hilarious gags that actually cracks me up real hard xD.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 would rewatch multiple times.",

            "content": "This anime has, hands down, the best opening in anime history. \r\nSeriously the way this starts it's IMPOSSIBLE not to get your attention. So, now the show has your attention, what does it do with it? \r\nStory :-\r\nSix lovely ladies are turned into zombies. Their goal is to be teen idles and inject some much needed life into the Saga prefecture in Japan. The irony is very much intended. \r\nWith their fast talking fake it till you make it manager they have to over-come the growing pains of their current predicament, Act as a group, the different personalities and levels of professionalism, their insane manager.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't realized already this show is parody of girl idol AND horror anime with a little social commentary packaged in regarding how the industry treats teen idols.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters :- \\n\\n\\n\r\nEach of the six girls has her own unique personality that sets her apart and is influenced in part by who she was in life. Sakura Minamoto gets the majority of the screen time as she is the more typical MC in anime... aka Ms. normal but cheerful and pleasant. The manager taking second place though 5 seconds of screen time with him is more than the average mind could handle. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt :- \\n\\n\r\ncolourful and upbeat usually though the girls nature allow for some unusual angles. There is a play on the horror genre when needed and the art style shifts to match. CGI pops up after episode two. It's a bit distracting but not horrendous. Just cheap looking... which is how you know they will recycle this particular scene over and over to cut costs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:- \\n\\n\r\nA mixed bag. The opening tones in episode one as well as the over the top ones used in that same episode have been the best so far. The rest however are either forgettable or full below average depending on the music genre the show is mocking in that particular episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFun Factor:- \\n\\n\r\nThis show is hilarious. You often have no idea what's going on or what the devil you just watched BUT you always laugh and have a good time. Be it the personality clashes, the sudden zombie attacks (by or on, always a coin toss) or the manager showing up. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSummery:- \\n\\n\r\nZombieland is the definition of an oddball. It effortlessly plays with your expectations and then doesn't go in a different directions so much as through a wall like the cool aid guy. It's weird, it's funny and it's fun. You will easily find at least one of the six girls to root for and your eyes directly go to her in any group setting (Yes I'm talking about the legendary Tae Yamada. GO TAE!) \\n\\n\r\nIt's questionable if the show can keep it's momentum however as the pacing and quirkiness goes down significantly after the second episode...",

            "content": "Just personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nA majority of the art was traditional style while the dance sequences later on were cgi. Outside of the cgi elements, I thought the art quality was nice, clean, and crisp. The few nature showcases looked fine. Not many panoramics or expanses but the generic backgrounds and supporting details looked pretty good though. Interiors were nicely populated and detailed as well. Anatomy and proportions checked out. The zombie version details looked fine. Lots of varied facial expressions that looked fine. Not many impact shots to note. Cgi could look a bit \"eh\" most of the time, but Iwould have rather had full-framed cgi dance sequences in mediocre quality than nice-looking dance sequences heavy on the selective framing. I admit, there were a few decently nice instances of cgi such as Lily's song, but overall I wasn't too impressed with the cgi work in this show. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation was solid aside from the cgi work. The non-cgi animation looked really good: the headbanging, the dance moves, the facial expression changes, etc. Natural movements such as walking looked good. Motions and gestures looked believable. Supporting effects such as stage lights affecting hue, for example, were nice. My only personal complaint was the stiff cgi: body language looked unnatural and movements looked forced at times. Overall, aside from the cgi which was only a small portion of the show, I thought the animation was solid. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThis show was saved by the its character developments. Despite missing the opportunity to develop Yuugiri and the Legendary Yamada Tae, I was pretty happy with how this show chose to focus on the character developments starting halfway through. Although I found the first one or two episodes interesting enough, my interest began to waver in the early quarter of the show. However, the direction shift to focus on the backgrounds of each of the girls was what changed my initial assumptions about this show. Introducing some sort of baggage to their previous lives and actually resolving it to an acceptable point for most of the girls was excellent. I would have liked a bit more intra-character interactions to strengthen their friendships but I don't know if there would have been enough time for that, so it's fine; I'd like to see it in a sequel if that's ever a thing. What I mean though is that some of the character's stories were a bit isolated to me. For example, Saki's story was resolved through her own guts and that's totally fine, but once her personal story episode was finished the characters that were relevant to it were relegated to simple background cameos. I wanted more of how Junko and Ai formed a deeper friendship than the rest of the cast because their personal stories and resolutions intermingled. I personally would have liked to see Yuugiri's background and I would have killed to see Yamada Tae developed. Overall, I thought that the character designs were well thought out and made each of the characters very distinct and unique. I thought the character dynamics were a bit on the short side, but that was made up for with the focus on  the characters individually. My personal gripe is that I wanted to see more of Tae. \\n\\n\r\nPlot & Development: 5/10\\n\r\nThe initial few episodes were nice and got me interested, but some of the questions that were raised during those times were mostly brushed over by the end. I accepted the explanation for as to how the girls were resurrected into zombies, but I sort of wanted to know how Tatsumi got a hold of the corpses, why they were all in relatively the same condition considering that some were over 100 years old, and how each of the girls were able to stay in relatively the same decomposition state. I accepted the whole \"To save Saga\" thing, but I was expecting some deeper motivations to be touched upon; the 2 second flashback of Tatsumi's interaction with Sakura implies romance, but that's just it. It was 2 seconds and that's all we got for any explanation of his potential true motivations. It could have been romance, it could have been repaying a debt, pity, etc. Why did Tatsumi have to go about whatever he wanted to do for Sakura by resurrected several other girls? Could Sakura have just attempted to blend into a regular idol group or was it so that Sakura could have something in common with her peers? Plenty of ways to go about explaining everything and they could all be perfectly fine, I'm just pointing some things out. The bar meeting with the mysterious bearded man raised some questions that I had some theories to, but I honestly would have just preferred some clarification or unveiling to that meeting. Overall, I thought the culmination of everything was fine: the girls reached a point closer to their \"goal,\" but I felt like their goal was just stated by Tatsumi. I felt that they sort of just accepted Tatsumi's proposal way too easily, especially for Saki. Moreover, I was left with a lot of \"why\" and \"how\" by the end of the show and the way the show wanted to explain (or lack of) everything felt pretty lazy at times to me. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music was pretty good. I don't normally listen to idol-like or pop-like music, but I was surprised by how catchy I thought the tunes were. I usually don't look for slow-type music too, but I thought Lily's song was nice. I thought it was neat how during the Saga-Rock episode and where the girls were struck by lightning that their song became a different version through changing the vocals to use voice-synthesizer. The reason I gave the music a 7 was because of the neat ways this show handled the music and music style. I liked how it explored different styles. For example, I liked how the first and second episodes, although the girls were ill-prepared, their performances weren't terrible: they used death-rock and freestyle rap which was totally awesome. Overall, I think this show did an excellent job with the way it handled its music and sound. The music was catchy. The soundboard was nice. No sound design to note. OP and ED were fine, not my taste though.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10\\n\r\nThe conclusion was fine. It was pretty obvious that they were going to somehow make it in time for their big event and likewise that it would be a hit somehow. The rising up outta a critical situation was also expected. The generic happy ending was fine with me though. At least the show attempted to answer one of the biggest questions during the final episode which was Tatsumi's motivations for \"helping?\" the girls. I still felt a bit let down that some of the other big plot points weren't addressed fully, but looking at the conclusion through a lighthearted lens, it was good for what it was. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThis show did a good job at introducing and developing a plot encompassing second chances and overcoming personal walls. It was lovely how the story was basically a bunch of girls were given a second chance to overcome their weaknesses or accidents and live lives that they wouldn't have been able to with those weaknesses or accidents. Overall, the art, animation, and music were on point. I personally felt the plot development let me down, but that was overshadowed by the thoughtful character growths. My personal gripe is that I would have liked to see more of the Legendary Yamada Tae. This show is worth considering if you're into idol shows.",

            "content": "I think the first few episodes, which focus on the weird bland of horror and black comedy, are better than the latter ones that's focused on their idol activities, as the idol aspect of the anime is kinda procedural even though it is a lot funnier than in your average idol animes. It picks up when it delves into the backstories of Saki and Lily, which for me is the highlight of the story, but then the ending kinda tapers out again since the conflict at the end feels a little forced. Overall I feel it's a  decent anime and a good change ofpace from all the dark fantasy and harem comedy of late. My thoughts about Lily in particular is on my blog: https://transfelinism.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/transpotlight-the-real-tragedy-of-lily-hoshikawa/",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga is a pretty entertaining mid-tier anime effort that doesn't quite hit any notable marks, but is a solid time throughout. The kind of show that, if you know enough Japanese, is a really good anime to half-pay-attention to while you're doing the dishes or something.\r\nThe whole thing veers pretty wildly between a ridiculous satire of idol culture, literally resurrecting dead people to churn out a new idol group for some publicity, and then a legitimately emotional and sappy idol zero-to-hero series. The two sides don't mesh that well and the whole show ends up being a bit schizophrenic as a result, but there'llbe something for you to latch on no matter your sensibilities, unless your sensibilities include realistic characters with good character arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very strong, though only about half of them get much of a story arc and none of them change personality much through the series (besides some spoiler elements). You'll probably end up really liking one or two of them, but overall it's a pretty standard lineup of quirky characters. \\n\\n\r\nLots of funny moments throughout the series, even if the plot sticks to exactly what you'd expect out of a series featuring an idol group starting in the middle of the boonies. The zombie element allows for a lot more brutal violence against already-undead people, and the hijinks of hiding their zombie nature creates some really good moments. The comedy is by far the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the idol stuff is pretty middling. All of the idol performances, except for one, are rendered in terrible CGI. I thought that was part of the joke at first, but by the end it was pretty clear it was a cost-saving measure and a really ugly one at that. None of the songs were memorable either, definitely not compared to the very good OP and ED. There aren't that many performances in the show, maybe six or seven, but you'll usually be spacing out when they happen because they take away from the comedic elements.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there's also some drama and sappy teambuilding efforts. The drama, ramped up in a couple key episodes in the second half, is generally very good, dealing with some sensitive topics and delving deep into a couple of these undead characters in ways that hit hard-- one specific episode actually got me tearing up and it was a bit embarrassing. But the drama is always undercut by the formulaic \"Let's Ganbatte!\" stuff with the idol group working together as a team to pass the obstacles before them. Because of the parody elements, and because of the legitimate dramatic elements, the idol teamwork stuff is really boring and takes away from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nSo Zombieland Saga is a real mixed bag. Chances are, there's something in there for you to enjoy, no matter your taste. However, there'll also be plenty of things for you to dislike as well. It won't stand the test of time, but it was a good enough show that I'd say I enjoyed watching it. Which is good enough for me.",

            "content": "First off, I want to say that I really wanted to enjoy this show. I really did. But when I found it a chore to watch the next episode, I just couldn't\r\nLet's start with the premise of the story. 6 girls that died in different periods of time are revived by Tatsumi Kotaro to become idols and save the town of Saga. Sounds interesting enough right? That's what I thought in the first episode. I was thinking \"alright this is gonna be pretty good and funny.\" Instead I got a boring show with boring characters whom I all despise besides the manager, Kotaro. \r\nSpeaking moreon the characters, I didn't like any of them besides Kotaro, but most of his punchlines were HAHAHAHA I'm being mean and yelling at the zombie girls!!!!! All of the idol characters annoyed me and none of them were that interesting to me\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get to the comedy part. Now I understand that comedy wasn't really the main goal of the show but it was pretty obvious that they were trying to land jokes and just failed miserably. I spoke about Kotaro's jokes but \"The Legendary Yamada Tae's\" jokes through some of the show were just her making noises and OMG ZOMBIE GIRL ISNT AWAKE YET AHAHAHAHAHAHA and it just really got on my nerves that they would sink to such low levels of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the infamous episode 3 where they used atrocious CG to \"make fun of\" other idol shows but it just came across as them using horrible CG. It made it look worse than the stuff they were trying to make fun of.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I gave it a 4 just because I wanted to get it done but it felt like such a chore watching the next episode, purely because of how much I didn't enjoy it.",

            "content": "Zombieland Saga (ZLS), a show that poses as a zombie horror show, which is revealed to be an absurdist comedy, which is ultimately revealed to be idol show propaganda. The show is hilarious at times, sad at others and a bit hard to look at, at other times.\r\nThe story\u2019s quality fluctuates, starting with a bang, there are numerous laugh out loud jokes that just keep on giving. Even if you don\u2019t care for the direction the show takes later on, the first 2 episodes are most definitely worth a watch for their laughs. ZLS begins with fantastic humour, yet by episode 3, it fades away,reducing what was once laugh out loud jokes, to slight exhalation of air from one\u2019s nose jokes, the hilarity not to reappear until episode 5. In its place is a generic friendship and teamwork plot line that\u2019s been seen countless times before in the likes of generic school club room shows. It\u2019s serviceable, but leaves a lot to be desired. But! Do not be mistaken, the series doesn\u2019t deteriorate any further, it\u2019s absurd hilarity from the beginning (and episode 5) is toned down for the rest of the series, yet in its place a handful of well crafted episodic adventures surrounding individual characters from the group, that make it very hard to pick a favourite character... if it weren\u2019t for a certain individual I\u2019ll discuss later.. These character episodes fluctuate in quality too, and they make up the bulk of the story, one being my favourite, and another leaving a lot to be desired. The drama presented in each episode is usually familiar, repackaged in a zombie theme, competently made, but not incredible. It is where the story explores new unique drama that the story excels (ie. episode 8). Overall, the story is a mixed bag, and a little messy.\\n\\n\r\nEach and every idol and a very special producer could all be a different persons favourite character in ZLS. They are all highly likeable, and range from purely comedic to respectable characters. As a fan of ZLS\u2019s comedic elements the most, the Producer; Koutarou and Tae the mindless zombie we\u2019re my favourite characters. Koutarou\u2019s manic rants, pep talks and complete confidence in his and the girls success make him a spectacle to watch, whilst Tae keeps the brain (or squid) hungry, droning, chomping zombie spirit of the original zombie premise alive, always inserting herself into the story at the worst (and in the context of a comedy show; best) times. Protagonist Sakura is fun to root for, passionate and a little awkward, developing and learning along the way. The other characters are once again - a mixed bag. Most received an individual episode that explored their character, and their deaths, (a large source of trauma for zombies) which elevated their characters from the generic stereotypes seen in hundreds of other shows, like the cutesy, squeaky young girl, the esteemed senpai or the brash sporty (or in this case - bikie) girl to engaging and multifaceted characters. The degree of which this occurred differed between the girls however. One received no development, others remained stagnant, unchanged by death. Yet a few changed, and developed post death, creating characters that I will remember for some time. Overall, all had their comedic and their dramatic moments, but they ranged from generic to unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe production, of course, is a mixed bag. Character designs were good, each character was unique and distinguished from one another, but nothing too incredible. The art style, backgrounds and animation were all fairly generic, with little to comment on. Serviceable. The idol performances were animated in 3D like most other idol shows, yet unfortunately, ZLS\u2019s 3D was very poorly integrated, jarring and detracted from the performances. The voice acting saved the day however, as the VA\u2019s put their all into it, and Mamoru Miyano had the time of his life as Koutarou the producer, enthusiastically screaming and whimpering in the best way possible. The idol performances were good to listen to, the cutesy pop music is not something I am personally into, but I could appreciate it. The death metal and rap battle however, I most certainly was into, and they were both highlights of the series, the rap in particular flowed very well, and the translators even ensured that the rhyming remained in the subtitles, which was very much appreciated. \\n\\n\r\nZombieland Saga, whilst at times left me disappointed, ultimately left me thankful. Thankful for the incredible humour dispersed throughout, for the eternally fantastic Koutarou, and for a pretty decent tale of teamwork, friendship and self confidence, no matter how done to death the message is.\\n",

But as the show goes on you learn more about each of the characters before they became undead. The characters and their past become the more interesting feature of the show and is usually interrupted byidol nonsense. By the end, the show has told a wonderful story about failure and overcoming it.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say that I Highly recommend the show if you're not into idol stuff, but I will say it was definitely one of the sleeper hits of 2018 and I'm glad I went back and finished it. \\n\\n\r\n-oh it also has one of the best OPs of the year.",

The zombie concept left a lot of room for unique comedy, and the cast of odball characters from different eras (most of whom didn't even want to become idols) really set the show apart! Deathmetal and rap battles, weird promotions and oddjobs to get the group's name out there, it was all very promising in it's creativity and stark difference from other idol shows.\r\nUnfortunately, the show started to get into formulaic and predictable stuff mid-season. The episodesregarding the character's backgounds, the horrendous 3D concerts, it was all pretty bland. Even the later episodes about the group dynamic and the main character were less and less unique. Even if we take all the objectively bad things out, it's still just wishy-washy idol stuff you can watch anywhere else, probably better. Where are the different music genres from the earlier episodes? Where is that crazy energy that carried the show?\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Zombieland Saga ended up as another trend-follower instead of the trend-setter I wanted it to be. It's still a quirky show about zombie idols, and I think it's still worth watching, but the show didn't deliver on the promise of it's great early episodes.",

            "content": "I really toiled with the rating for this show. I've been in a slump with work, and so I only was able to watch about 4 shows at a time rather than my usual 8 that I whittle down. As a result, I dropped less shows but kept with ones that I would have dropped otherwise. Overall, I'm not sure if it was a show I would have dropped or not, and I'm torn enough I wish I could give it a 6.5.\r\nOff the bat I have to admit my bias. I've never watched an idol show before this. I've been aware of them andtheir effect on merchandising, but I've never participated in them. For me, that's the strength in this show. It's the first idol show that's grasped me and kept me interested, even if only as a minor participant. I'll just organize this into story, animation, character, and sound.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is pretty simplistic in itself. Not many answers are given as to why they're brought back, but I have a heavy feeling that this is because it's a \"go read the manga\" type of show. This isn't bad in itself (I'm waiting with baited breath for the Kaguya anime, but I'm expecting the same treatment), however, the story then had to revolve around a minor arc for each of the starts of the show. I'll be honest, this was the strongest part of the show. A lot of these girls arcs are heartfelt and honest, and give a great insight to who they were before they died and who they are now. Almost everyone dies with regrets, and they were some of the lucky few who got to try and rectify these regrets on their own. There is obviously and overarching story related to the manager, however it's unclear if a S2 will come to carry this along.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I'll be blunt, the animation/art will get a fair rating from me due to the use of CGI. Honestly, if this anime just had the story going for it, it would be a non-issue. However the non-CGI animations of this show were absolutely phenomenal. I could only top it this year with the animations I saw from Slow Start for a fairly mundane show about \"cute girls doing cute things\". These crisp animations were then brought down by most of the performances they did when CGI was brought into the picture. It's sad too, because in and idol show I feel the actual performances are a crucial part to nail. If they do a S2 and remove that portion, it could easily be a 7 or 8 overall ranking for me. The CGI was the biggest turn off for me in the show, because once you reach these crucial crux's of each characters arc you have to deal with these lumbering and unnatural movements of animation that completely takes you out of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This intertwines with story, but, I really enjoyed most of the characters of this show. I don't want to go into too much detail due to spoilers, however each character has a fleshed out personality, voice, and even time period from which they hail. Some seem there for comic relief, but then show they are very dedicated to the group as a whole. Others are consistently the \"rocks\" of the group that many go to for support. Even the accents and dialogue they put forth are related to their identity as idols.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This will be the part where I'm the least knowledgeable. I thought the songs were decent (from what I can tell from subtitles), yet I am also not an idol follower. The songs might have also been tainted for me from the CGI animations (another gripe at it), which brings what could have been very emotional scenes down for me. Still, I did find them somewhat catchy, and I enjoyed when they delved into other styles that weren't really \"pop\" music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is probably worth the time for someone who does watch idol shows. However, I'm not confident in all aspects I've put forth. As far as character development and animation, I can confidently say the majority is great and worth your time. To say the entire show is perfect though, would overlook many issues I had with the CGI and the pretty shoestring story which seems like an obvious manga advertisement.",

            "content": "This is, and will probably ever be, the only moe idol show that I'm okay with watching.\r\nLike many others who started watching this during the time it started airing, I had no idea what this anime would be about. Despite all that, my curiosity drove me to watch the first episode, and I'm so glad that it did. If you don't want to read an indepth review that objectively analyses this anime, just to find out whether it's worth watching or not, then here's your answer.\r\nWatch it. Like, right now..... GO GO GO GO GO GO GO!!!\r\n*Non-spoiler review*\r\nNow if you're still here despite that, here'sthe full length review. The story of Zombieland Saga isn't a complex one, but it does leave many gray areas for you to explore. Several aspects about the events that led to the story told within the anime are left out, but it doesn't feel empty and forgotten. Over the course of the series, small hints are given through the revelations or flashbacks of certain characters, that do serve to clear up some mysteries, yet still add more questions to the mix. It certainly isn't a story-driven anime, but it is definitely not one that completely ignores the fundamentals of story-telling. You don't feel like any of the episodes are fillers, because they all are important to either the story or character development. Now as for the ending, it is certainly an open-ended one that suggests a season 2 of this series, so if you end up enjoying the anime, don't fret over it not getting a season 2. The comedy however, was top tier. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for Zombieland Saga is rather stylistic. Since a big part of this show is the comedy as well, I believe this art style fits well with the violent, fluid motions of slap-stick comedy, made possible due to the fact that they're all zombies. I personally thought that it was great, and have no problem with it. However, the majority of performance scenes were done using CGI, which is quite noticeable. It does break the immersion a little, but it isn't done badly. Just the fact that the change from 2D to 3D is far too apparent within this anime. I do have to add though that the choreography was done rather well, and I enjoyed seeing the girls perform. Apart from that, the character designs are all unique. You'll definitely be able to recognize all the characters, despite what they're wearing or doing. I believe each character design is a very accurate representation of their personalities, so it all ends up being a fitting match.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for probably the most important part of the show, the sound. I think that the voice acting was absolutely great in this anime, but the songs were a bit lack luster for me. I'm not saying that they were bad. Rather, they were all quite enjoyable to listen to. However, I can't remember a single one of them after finishing the anime, which could mean that I have really bad memory, or the tracks just weren't unique in anyway to your standard run of the mill J-Pop. I can assure you that it isn't low-quality, but I personally didn't find it amazing. Whether or not you'll enjoy it though, is only for you to decide.\\n\\n\r\nEach character within the group, and the manager, were all very interesting and played an important role in either progressing the story, or developing other characters. You don't feel like there is a single main character to the story, because they all seem to be a very active part of the anime, plus the show doesn't focus on only one member of the group, but switches between all of them depending on the current arc. There is a lot of character development in both a positive and negative way, that all makes sense within the current part of the story being told. They each have strengths and weaknesses, but they all learn to overcome it by relying on each other and moving forward together. I might not be able to remember all of them as time goes on, but I will certainly remember the legendary Yamada Tae for all eternity. Why? Well, you'll just have to watch to find out...\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review, I would have to say that this series was extremely fun to watch. It was like a breath of fresh air, adding even greater enjoyment to an already incredible season. I will certainly remember the first episode, and this series as being the one and only moe idol show that I will have ever watched, and enjoyed immensely. Please, I urge you to watch this show immediately. It doesn't matter if you like idol shows or not. I can guarantee that you'll find atleast one thing from this anime that you'll enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review! I hope you enjoy watching Zombieland Saga as much as I did.",

            "content": "When I first saw this anime, I thought it was something like cute girls surviving a Zombie apocalypse. Heck even the trailer and description made it look like a Zombie Apocalypse. I thought cool, sounds like a nice anime. How wrong was I. Instead of guns and explosions, we get Zombie idolru and truck-kun. It was still a somewhat decent anime and I really laughed through the whole anime, and at the same time shedding some tears through the way.\r\nStory:\r\nWell, first episode in, and the main character already died in Truck-kun's hands. 10/10 best opening for an anime ever. And Sakura revives as a Zombieand ends up with other Zombies becoming idolrus in order to save Saga. The story was enjoyable and at the same time laughable with all the meme scenes :v. I really liked how they showcased each and every character's backstory so that we can understand the characters better and fall in love with them. And I also like how Kotarou is always pushing and encouraging the MCs to persevere and become great idolrus, despite using unconventional methods to do so. And in the end, they did it, and the story continues, as there'll most probably be a 2nd season to Zombieland Saga.\\n\r\nRating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\r\nFor the first time ever, even though Zombieland Saga used CGI for the idol performances, it was actually quite good and not cancerous like other animes. I have to give credit to MAPPA for producing great CGI animation quality. Other than that, the character and background animations were great.\\n\r\nRating: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: \\n\r\nOpening was so memey heck I loved the opening. The songs for the idol performances were also good I liked it. \\n\r\nRating: 7.8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe character development for Zombieland Saga was good I feel that every character had enough development to appeal to the viewers. Almost one episode per character, and for Sakura's case, 2-3 episodes for her. Kotarou himself had a quite a thorough development where we see that beneath his rude appearance, he has a soft side. Also, I must give a shout out to the best character of the series, TRUCK-KUN!\\n\r\nRating: 8.6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an anime I enjoyed more than I originally thought. Can't wait for the 2nd season of Zombieland Saga!\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 8/10",

For so long idol anime have all been a cookie cutter format of getting a bunch of highschool age, or somehow younger for whatever reason, girls to form a group of misfit idols that somehow takes the world by storm with their 3D animated dancing segments. Zombieland saga just threw that template out the window in the first episode. Not gonna spoil anything, but the first 2 episodes of this series really make a statement about not being like other idol anime.\r\nThe casting choice of Miyano Mamoru was top notch, having just come off aSteins Gate binge I'm fairly biased towards his characters. His energy just brings a whole new level of entertainment to the show that would be difficult for any other voice actor to match. \\n\r\nWhile most of the characters do share common characteristics with other idol anime, just the fact that they're zombies makes them infinitely better.\\n\r\nOverall, expectations completely blown away.

            "content": "Story:\r\n     Zombieland Saga.. as a comedy it's pretty good with the start our starting MC Sakura wanted to fulfill her dreams of becoming an idol. So at the start my interest was getting pretty low because I have seen a lot of similar anime, but as soon as it starts they queue the happy music and then out of nowhere shes hit by a truck which was pretty funny honestly. After that incident I was going to give this anime the benefit of the doubt. I just finished episode 4 and the story has a good flow and so far noplot holes. With that I give the story an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n     The art in my opinion is well done for the tone of the anime, but when it comes to the CGI usage it isn't very characteristic to the show it almost seems forced. When I first saw the CGI in episode 3 I was laughing because of how poor it was but I've also taken the fact it is a comedy so I accepted as part of the show. The CGI in episode 4 was better but still had some way to go, but other than the CGI the art is well done not lazy nor looks hastily drawn in most scenes there is a detailed well drawn background which don't see in a lot of anime. With that I give the art a 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n     The sound is a strong point in the show but of course without the great sound quality this wouldn't be much of a music genre show; the voice tracking with the characters are on point and the singing is great. The background sounds which not many really appreciate or notice is excellent. I know that was short but my rating for the sound is a 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n     The characters are well done each seem to have their backgrounds and have their own diverse personalities, and I know that this is only on episode 4 but hopefully there will be further character development. Without the character development the audience will end up losing care for the characters leaving the ending just another empty ending. If they get good character development then I will edit my score but for now I'm leaving it with an 8 out of 10 due with the fact the anime still has another 8 more episodes and with the diversity of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n     I really did enjoy watching this and I plan to finish this ZLS in the future and right now I have had a great impression from the show, it's funny and the songs are great to listen to. The characters are relatable with daily life problems which I enjoy and all in all its fun light hearted show of few I don't always watch. With that I give the enjoyment a 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n     Overall the show has a good mostly original story, with great art of exception to its CGI, beautiful sound and voice tracking, and diverse and interesting characters. With that being said I give the Overall Score of this anime Zombieland Saga a 8 out of 10. The score will change based on what happens in the future just keep working on developing the characters and art and I'll gladly move this to a 9 or 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\n     With that thanks for reading my review on Zombieland Saga this is my first review I've ever done so far and I plan to continue to make more reviews in the future have a great day.",
