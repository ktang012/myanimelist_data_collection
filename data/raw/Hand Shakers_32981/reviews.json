            "content": "Let us shake hands\u2026 with the future. The future of anime, and the future of society.\r\nFriends, welcome. On the third season, The Order has risen once again to free us from our eternal struggle. In an industry that rarely takes risks, Hand Shakers stands above all others to become the most daring, most challenging, and most breathtaking anime ever created.\r\nWhen Gen Urobuchi broke out in the 90\u2019s with the release of Neon Genesis Evangeliation, the anime community was both equally fascinated and outraged at its unique story and characters. Hand Shakers pushes the envelope much further, challenging the community, the industry, and the entire world.\r\nThemere concept of Hand Shakers is the most gruesome, most outrageous, most difficult scenario of all time: A young boy must constantly hold hands with a girl who looks to be half his age. SCANDALOUS! \\n\\n\r\nSex is often a highly taboo and controversial subject. Today, society holds intense debates over the censorship of breasts and buttocks and shoulder blades day in and day out. Hand Shakers puts the most graphic and intimate of sexual actions, hand holding, on full display for the world to gaze their nervous eyes upon. And with a minor, no less! Indeed, the young Inori Yuzuriha, despite her young appearance, is at the forefront of this gratifying imagery. I\u2019m actually amazed she wasn\u2019t impregnated at any point, given that she and Tarzan held hands for almost every minute of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOh, but don\u2019t think that\u2019s all. Hand Shakers brings about many more dazzling images of sexuality. In fact, the entire anime is a commentary about different sexual tendencies that are widely controversial, but it irrefutably proves how they are beneficial to our society and should be more widely accepted. Let\u2019s look in detail about each pair of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe first pair of Hand Shakers (the names granted to these brave warriors) are none other than the studio Silver Link, as the acts of bondage portrayed are a callback to the greatest Twilight movie of all time, Fifty Shades of Gray. As silver is a shade of gray and chains are also known as links, it was a cleverly well-placed casting by Mr. GoHands. Furthermore, the actors representing these characters are both high-level veterans respected by many peers and fans alike, showing how serious this anime is on its views. People might look at bondage with fear and disgust, as it does look rather intimidating on the surface. However, as this anime pleasantly shows, pain can also bring about pleasure when delivered properly, and both characters in this couple take great delight in this act. They set a great example for BDSM relationships and should be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe second pair is where Hand Shakers announces its strongest, most passionate stance on the legalization of pedophilia. This couple is nothing more than a grown man with a young girl. Although I disagree with the anime\u2019s opinion, I must respect that it is very brave of them to portray this kind of sexual relationship, especially one as realistic as it is. The young girl often remarks about how mature and grown-up she is because she\u2019s a Hand Shaker; she has a life partner and a good job and even dresses in a professional manner. But this setup often comes off as a joke to people because they don\u2019t take it seriously. It\u2019s unfortunate that the clear message of children being capable of acting as mature and responsible individuals has fallen on deaf ears, but once again I respect Hand Shakers for not only addressing this issue, but tying in the response to its controversial nature into the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe third pair of Hand Shakers represent another highly controversial and heavily debated topic: incest. This pair is with a brother and a sister, the sister designed with a luscious, curvy body to entice viewers and persuade them to join this movement to decriminalize sex between family members. After all, incest is wincest. This relationship is even sponsored by the popular trading card game, Weiss Schwartz, further proving that even big names are willing to make a much-needed change to our society. It also helps that this is the most realistic, mature, and down-to-earth pair of characters since the brother and sister of the hit 2016 anime, Big Order. But again, the community is too immature to see these characters for who they really are. Instead, they want to complain about completely trivial matters, such as the sister\u2019s breasts moving \u201cunnaturally\u201d, as if they haven\u2019t seem someone\u2019s chest wobble like it\u2019s getting sucked into a fucking tornado whenever they listen to twenty one pilots on their iPhones. You\u2019re all dumbasses. \\n\\n\r\n...whoops, pardon my language. I am only frustrated. I just want to tell the world how incredible this anime is, and all of the themes it represents. Anyway, let\u2019s move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth pair of Hand Shakers is actually rather difficult to figure out, as the themes are just too complex for the average person to understand. Fortunately, having seen over 20 animes, I am of superior intelligence, which is why I\u2019m presenting this post to counteract the negativity surrounding this amazing title, and it is my duty to decipher it.\\n\\n\r\nHere we have an older, unattractive man holding hands with a young woman who happens to be an aspiring idol. Instead of focusing on one theme, I believe this pair represents many ideas. First, the appearance of the man contrasting with the beautiful idol girl signify that even the most unassuming of people can find the partner that is right for them, or that appearance has no factor in love. It could merely be a good representation of two people not sexually attracted to one another, but are willing to hold hands because they see something in them that can\u2019t be seen in their physical appearance. Number second, this relationship is particularly business-like, as the older man represents the idol as her manager. It shows how sex can tie into the workplace and be beneficial for at least one of them, and that\u2019s all that matters. Furthermore, the mainstream pop industry has been notorious for displaying many singers and performers in a sexual manner, such as Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, and Death Grips. However, the idol industry in Japan is much more repressed, which makes this relationship in Hand Shakers a very big deal. We must join hands and break these invisible walls that bound society in its currently soulless state. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the last pair of Hand Shakers is the most fascinating, but be warned, this is a spoiler. \\n\\n\r\nThis final pair is none other than a copy of our main characters, Tarzan and Inori. Granted, the two people are different, and only the girl looks similar to Inori, but the theme of this relationship is the same. It\u2019s also portraying ephebophilia, which is very different from pedophilia, and the confusion of these terms has caused many problems in our society. For further information, please see the thoughtful analytical piece of B Kata H Kei by Mumkey Jones. \\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t spoken about the main pair of Hand Shakers, because it all speaks for itself. The two meet each other and start holding hands for fun, but they do it so often that they become inseparable lovers, proving that sex is a truly beautiful thing that brings friends and family together and makes the world a better place. It\u2019s a touching and emotional narrative that squeezed many tears from my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIn Hand Shakers, the intimate act of hand holding grants both partners a great power, with which they use to fight with other Hand Shakers to show whose sexual desire is stronger. While I wish the world to be a calm place where everyone can hold hands in peace, this is a piece of entertainment after all, so I must admit that I love a good fight. And what good fights this series holds! Every power is tremendously creative and unique and allows for the users to activate different techniques as their intelligence may command. While Niconico Araki, known for his work in the classic series Stand Alone Complex, has often been regarded as a genius for his creative shounen battles, Hand Shakers might have outdone him once and for all, for the clashes in this anime are breathtaking, such as the clashes between chains and a big fuck-off sword, card games and a big fuck-off sword, and an idol girl and a big fuck-off sword. The possibilities are endless!\\n\\n\r\nAnd what meshes all thisl together is the immaculate presentation of the anime. GoHands have truly crafted a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Last year brought in multiple anime that sought out the promises of CG; anime such as Bubuki Buranki, Ajin, and Berserk 2016. Hand Shakers surpasses these titles--no, it surpasses all anime for its visual prowess. Every surface in the world is a mirror, reflecting the clouds in the sky that move at breakneck speed because this anime takes place in a very windy city, which is precisely why Lily\u2019s large bamboozlers wiggle and shake rapidly, even indoors. Characters have hair made out of stained glass, allowing a unique color pallet with a diverse level of shading, and the designs of each character perfectly match the theme they represent.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing short of stellar; the 2D and 3D animation come together so well that they move at two entirely different framerates, creating two unique and interesting flavors that satisfy fans of both traditional and CG animation. The backgrounds, objects, and effects generated from computer animation are so realistic and lifelike that I have a hard time deciding whether they were actually animated, or if the chains and flames, for example, were literally placed above the recorded frames to give a full sense of realism. It looks so natural! I\u2019ve never seen CG used in more brilliant ways before, although I\u2019m greatly anticipating the upcoming Berserk 2016 2017 to break new ground with a clang. Either way, the ambition displayed in Hand Shakers cannot be ignored nor disrespected, especially when considering the messages of the narrative it represents.\\n\\n\r\nThe hand-drawn animation holds its own to that of Bones, Trigger, and Funimation. Even with incredible camera movement that twists and turns smoothly and miraculously, the highly-stylized characters manage to stay on model at every single moment. Every frame of movement is perfect and lifelike, as if you\u2019re watching real people act through the motions. And, fret not, the hand holding itself is drawn perfectly. My heart goes out to all the animators working slave wages and not getting enough sleep for all their hard work.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we must talk about the intricate soundscapes that bring about the atmosphere of each scene, as they were good enough to distract me from the voices in my head that tell me to do questionable things to people with spoons and strawberry jam. Hand Shakers continues to innovate, as each piece of the soundtrack is a different tune taken from the top elevator music composers around the world. Not only that, but each track loops over and over again, creating a tone found in visual novels, blending Hand Shakers with even more genres. The opening theme is sung by Masayoshi Oishi, and bless his heart for singing as well as he did despite having a cold, which is why you can hear him cough at the beginning of the song. Many singers should aspire to work as hard as him. The ending theme is sung by Akino Arai, and its soothing composition can lull anyone into a sleep, so that they may dream of a better world of hand-holding. \\n\\n\r\nThe speakings are consistent with every other part of the anime: absolutely perfect. Inori\u2019s two lines of dialogue and her 815 lines of \u201chm\u201d are delivered with aplomb. No other actress could possibly have fulfilled the role better than Sumire Morohoshi. Likewise, Bind\u2019s 59 instances of \u201cahhhh!\u201d are handled excellently by Mio Akiyama. There\u2019s nothing else to say other than that every actor and actress was phenomenal and I would like them to read me a bedtime story, because the voices in my head don\u2019t know how to read, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nWith this review, I hope you have learned the valuable narrative aspects that are explored within the anime Hand Shakers, as many people have misunderstood the intentions of this amazing series and have given it an unfairly low score. While it may appear to be a simple anime featuring beautiful characters, incredible artwork, and great action pieces, it carries many mature and interesting themes of sexuality that must be heard. Hand Shakers is nothing short of a breakthrough for the anime industry, and therefore the entire world, a breakthrough that will likely bring a great change in how laws affect censorship and restrictions on sexual activities.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, my friends, I must go. Do tell your friends and family the good word of Hand Shakers. Spread it across your school, your church, your swamp, your office! Follow the example set by this anime: spread the word loud and clear! It\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s wonderful, and it must be seen by all! You, too, can make America great again. I cannot write any further, for I must do my part and travel the seven seas and sing to humanity the praises of this glorious anime. If you need me\u2026 simply reach out your hand, and I shall come to hold it.",

            "content": "What's the ultimate sign of a \"bad anime?\" For some, it's a poorly written script, for others, it's a lack of effort on the audiovisual front. It could even be something trivial, like a personal gripe against certain cliches or tropes. Whatever the reasoning may be, we all have ways of coming to our own conclusion. \r\nAs for me, the ultimate sign of a lousy anime is not what that particular work does by itself, but how it forces me to retroactively reexamine other terrible works in the process. When the show in question is so bad that I have to commend the efforts ofbottom-tier shows that, at the very least, \"tried,\" to me, that's the ultimate sign of a piss poor project. \\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers is that kind of anime. A show so baffling in its inception that calamities of years past\u2014such as the infamous Absolute Duo or Terra Formars\u2014manages to appear \"decent\" by virtue of comparison. The degree to which this show fails is actually pretty impressive. In a way, it's a masterpiece at fucking up. From fundamental production issues that could have easily been fixed to writing butchered beyond the point of repair; what we have here is a perfect swan dive into brain-dead content.  \\n\\n\r\nWhatever the lowest score you've ever given a title may be, proceed to raise it a point higher so that you have a level solely dedicated for this gem. It has earned the right to reign unchallenged on its shit-tier podium. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that would jump out at you is the overall presentation. It's been a while since I saw a show where the issue wasn't it being under-produced but actually the exact opposite. Hand Shakers is overwrought with so many art-style, animation, and filmmaking techniques that it's nauseating trying to process it all. I'm sure you've seen people mockingly say that something is \"headache-inducing\" before but with Hand Shakers, it isn't just a snide remark to make in passing, it's the actual truth. There are certain parts of the show where you feel like you're on the verge of getting a migraine. And this goes beyond the obvious issues you'd expect from a poorly put-together anime. The issues here have almost taken on a life of its own due to its aggressive application of everything occurring all at once.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, let's run over the obvious one that immediately sticks out to most people, the presentation: \\n\\n\r\nEverything is constantly bathed in an oily opacity filter. Random 360 camera panning with fisheye lens distortion at a moment's notice. 3D rendered landscapes with 2D constructed characters with no spatial awareness given for any of it to breathe. A complete disregard for blocking, leading to a whirlwind of poorly thought-out motion and distracting object placement. Unmoving plaid animation technique (best featured in cartoons like Chowder and anime like Gankutsuou) that are randomly used with no true purpose. Enough lens flare to make even J.J. Abrams blush. Digitally rendered clothing layered with a feathering sheen effect. Random micro sparkles fluttering around everywhere. Shots riddled with dead space while simultaneously being cluttered throughout other parts of the scene. Jarring post-production CGI blended with cel-shaded animation that moves at a completely different frame rate from everything else. Lighting and shadow casting that doesn't account for its light source. Layered in live-action dust and flame effects placed on top 2D drawn objects. Random Dutch angles, top-down view shots, dollying shots, dolly zooms that transitions into handheld camera point-of-view scenes; all this plus more that could occur back-to-back at a moments notice\u2014none of which used with any purposeful intent. Spliced-in insert shots that highlight pointless information. Multiple occasions where the 180-degree rule is broken. A complete disregard for motion vectors, resulting in discombobulated action scenes. And the list goes on and on. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this was just a conservative list of what I've spotted. If someone were to actually sit down and dissect it all, I'm sure there are more structural and presentation problems just waiting to be unearthed. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a dizzying vaudevillian display of one terrible idea after another, with each aspect desperately vying for your attention.\\n\\n\r\nIt's one thing to apply bold presentation choices to make your project stand out, and it's a complete other to compound it to the point where it becomes the equivalency of throwing shit at the wall. Not only does this show run the gamut of every possible shortcoming on a presentation standpoint but it fails at utilizing any of it in an effective manner. And perhaps even worse is the flippant disregard for basic editing and filmmaking techniques, despite the creators' desire to overuse it.\\n\\n\r\nHere are just a few simple examples. Establishing shots are used to give the viewer a sense of location, time, and space as it relates to the destination of the story or the scene being brought to one's attention. In Hand Shakers, establishing shots are reduced to cobbled-together reused scenes or random point of views done merely for a \"cool\" shot, defeating the purpose of giving the viewer any sense of placement. If you use the same cutscenes or go bat-shit crazy with camera angles to establish a multitude of things, it's no longer serving its purpose. All that does is leave your audience disoriented, giving them no chance to find their footing in your world. On top of that, spatial awareness is lost here as well. Rooms and locations can get bigger or smaller from scene to scene. Characters appear and relocate in their positions within any given shot, something that occurs every time the show attempts to show a relation between the environment and people's positions in them\u2014and no, this wasn't a purposeful artistic choice like it is in the Monogatari franchise. The director and creators of this show are either inexperienced or overcompensating for material that doesn't deserve the excessive theatrics being allotted to it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many movies and TV shows where the intent is to create a feeling of disorientation, as is the case with Satoshi Kon's Paprika, where it created a visually augmented existence between dream and reality or with live-action movies like Natural Born Killers and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, where they wanted to simulate a drunken fever-dream-like experience to heighten the adrenaline-fueled intoxication that the characters found themselves reveling in. If done with proper care, this kind of visual inebriation can be a fun experience, but the dizzying effect that Hand Shakers has throughout its run isn't of that pedigree. It's creators seeing \"cool\" things and then converting it into parlor tricks in a piss poor attempt to emulate it. It's the unholy matrimony between improperly used filmmaking techniques and lousy art-style decisions. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, the truly mindblowing thing about this entire production is that it's an ANIME, NOT a live-action film. No really, think about it for a moment. You don't have to puppeteer between makeup artists, lighting crews, prop departments, stunt performers, movie extras, cinematographers, actors, construction crews, auditors, modeling supervisors, food catering services etc. The advantage that anime has over live-action is that the daunting tasks associated with live-action have been diminished to a degree where the creative technicians involved are usually significantly less, making it far more manageable as a result. In layman's terms, there's less joggling required. Just compare the staffing of any live-action blockbuster film against that of any anime project. 2015's One Punch Man vs. Age of Ultron for example. The amount of people involved speaks for itself. Ultron's staffing is practically 50x larger than that of One Punch Man's. So how Hand Shakers manages to have the frantic feel of an overworked production cycle, while not having to worry about most of the issues associated with an overworked production cycle, is beyond hilarious. And honestly, pretty fascinating, if only for how bad the finished product ended up being.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about the production, if I were to discuss all the issues found, we'd be here all day. Instead, let's try to comb over the show's screenplay without dying of embarrassment.\\n\\n\r\nYou really can't expect much content-wise from a show whose premise and name sounds like an awful pun gone too far, but let's try to find something worth discussing anyway. Produced by studio GoHands\u2014HAND Shakers, Go HANDS, GET IT!?\u2014the story follows a limp-dick, pussy protagonist named Tazuna Takatsuki, who, through a series of events, find himself coming into contact with Koyori Akutagawa, a fair porcelain-skinned complexioned girl who's been in a coma for a long time. In her dainty state, Koyori reminds Tazuna of the little sister he once had, and through the miracle of \"da chosen one,\" she awakens to his presence, grabbing his hand as they start their journey together as newly formed Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nWhen he isn't busy being an ideal self-insert beta-male, Tazuna uses his Shirou Emiya ability to fix mechanical devices of any kind, being something that's both a passionate hobby of his and means to test his acquired skills. But after becoming a Hand Shaker, all that changes, as he's pitted against multiple opponents who have accepted the call, each coming with their own unique fetish to meet the expected checklist of your routine fantasy empowerment show. From sadomasochism and pop-idol worship to vanilla incestual love and lolita complex; this anime is your one-stop shop for all your harmless fanservice needs. Using powers they could summon called \"nimrods,\" the duo fights off their attackers one by one, with each conquest becoming friends in the end because \"reasons.\" And really, that's the extent of what you need to know about this show, trying to give you a more detailed description of it would only lead to numerous contradictions later on, as the show doesn't follow any of its pre-established rules whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nWhether the issues spotted as the story goes along was just a case of excessive retconning mid-production or just a shitty draft treatment that was turned into a screenplay without any sort of revision, honestly, it's hard to tell the difference with this show. Just be prepared for several inconsistencies and accept it for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nAccepting things as is also extended to specific scenarios and plot details as well. This is a show that cannot exist without treating most the characters involved like dimensionless NPC stand-ins, because the moment it does bother to make its inhabitants fully functioning human beings, is the moment that the show's logic begins to collapse in on itself. Take the following scenario, for example:\\n\\n\r\nBecause of Koyori's health condition, she cannot let go of Tazuna's hand, in fear of her life being lost in the process \"because reasons.\" But since Tazuna is still a high school student, he needs to find a way to attend classes with this dilemma, as well as a means to go about his daily life. So how does the show accomplish that? By just turning his classmates and parents into unquestioning oafs! Tazuna bringing a Rei Ayanami knock-off into his parents' household is treated with no confrontation at all, in fact, it's greeted with a celebratory welcome home. Even if we ignore the fact that he's not letting go of her hand the entire time he brings this stranger into their household, he then proceeds to take this strange girl into the shower and bedroom with him. All of which happens with his parents' complete acknowledgment of these events. With a flimsy off-screen explanation given to explain this, we're just supposed to accept that these are the world's most accepting parents, in a culture like Japan that's built on strict decorum, where shit like this will never fly. This is the level of nonsense we're dealing with here.\\n\r\nAnd how do they solve the issue of him attending school with a girl continually holding his hand? Well, same shit. No one bothers to question it. The show quite literally turns an entire population into brain-dead idiots just to sell its cutesy fantasy empowerment concept. You could just feel the power of the scriptwriter's pen dictating every aspect of this show's logic, making the entire thing unbelievably stupid. At no point can you buy into any scenario presented, as it's all incredibly forced. I could only imagine the conversation for this show's plotting going along the lines of: \\n\\n\r\nStudio head: \"We need to get to point A to point B, I don't care how you do it, just make it happen.\"\\n\r\nScriptwriter: \"Don't worry my nigga, I'll just write some bullshit and make everyone accept it.\"\\n\r\nStudio head: \"That works for me.\"\\n\r\n-throws up gang signs, crip walks out of studio office-\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that's all this show is, an excuse to have a self-insert pussy protagonist hold the hand of a cute, dainty girl, from what came into existence from a dumb word pun. At least that's what I'm hoping the joke floating around in the studio office was, because if this was seriously pitched like a legitimate idea, then may God have mercy on us all. Thankfully, the gimmicky scenario was mirrored throughout the conversations had by the characters, leading to my first conclusion being acceptable enough to stomach. The dialogue scenes, for the most part, were composed of 40% information dumps, 50% \"OMG, they're such an adorable couple!\" and 10% \"I like to fix things, hurr durr!\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's one of the most blatant fantasy empowerment/escapism shows, not only in the 2010s but also in the past decade. Hell, maybe even an all-time contender.\\n\\n\r\nTo help sell this experience, we're given what could best be described as cheap elevator music for a soundtrack, xerox copy character designs, and a demo-quality opening theme that's chopped together with scenes of all of the occurring events seen throughout the series. And before we go on any further, can we just quickly acknowledge how funny the naming choice of \"nimrod\" is in this series? \\n\r\nGiven that the other dimension that the Hand Shakers battle against each other was referred to as the Ziggurat, it's safe to say that the show was using the old biblical text definition of nimrod; a person who was known as a skilled hunter in the old testament. Which, by itself, isn't a bad idea to use as the basis for a classification of weaponry... except for one problem. In modern-day semantics, most people define the word \"nimrod\" as a dumb person. So keeping that in mind, every time the characters' weapons are brought up in the show, what was intended to be a badass moment where two opposing Hand Shakers clashes just ended up becoming a comedic one. If you view it with the understanding of how this word is primarily identified by most people, head-to-head battles can almost be seen as a fight between who the bigger idiot is. The last anime I recall watching with such unfortunate naming choices was Tomino's Brain Powerd. And if you haven't seen Brain Powerd as yet, consider this an endorsement to check it out. It's basically the autistic version of Neon Genesis Evangelion. \\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, back to Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers is a title I found value in, although, that value had nothing to do with any successes it may have had. As for what message this anime may be trying to sell the audience, the only thing I could come up with was some tacky moral statement of \"separated we are weak, but together we are strong.\" Other than that, I'm drawing blanks here. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite all my negative comments towards this project, it may surprise you to know that I love this anime, or rather, I love titles that are this bad. Shows that everyone, regardless of viewing habits or taste, can collectively acknowledge how terrible it is. These are the kind of shows that bring people together. Where we can all join hands spewing out diatribes like a kumbayah cleansing ritual, declaring in one voice that this anime \"is shit.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you're aspiring to do anything with editing or the process of filmmaking, Hand Shakers could be seen as the best visual example of what not to do, serving as a sort of warning sign on how doing too much could be just as bad as doing very little. Other than that, if you just wish to have a good ass time laughing or being baffled for a few hours as you watch something fail at everything it attempts, Hand Shakers is a great drinking game entry to view with a few friends. \\n\\n\r\nAs for me, this anime is a marvel. A new defining point of a particular kind of pathetic. A spectacular failure that has redefined my idea of what cancerous presentation looks like. Weirdly enough, I'm thankful for Hand Shakers's existence. Through it, I have a newfound appreciation for other shows I once quickly disregarded, softening my stringent criteria of what I consider \"acceptable\" in the process. There's always something worse out there, and Hand Shakers became a martyr to prove that point.",

            "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, greetings!\r\nTwo questions first:\r\nDid you think Big Order or Glasslip were the worst series you've ever seen?\r\nDid you think Berserk 2016 and Ajin had the worst animations with CGI you've ever seen?\r\nNegative! Hand Shakers is here to show you the opposite and... believe me, it does it well. Let's look at this together!\r\n- Use of pretentious terms like \"Nimrod(o)\" or \"Ziggurat(o)\"?\r\n- Action with lots of explosions and unimaginable powers?\r\n- Main character without goal?\r\n- Main character nice, and weak at first?\r\n- One of the girls is a loli kuudere?\r\n- One of the girls is a loli idol like Nico Yazawa?\r\n- One of the girlsis a loli tsundere?\\n\r\n- Fan service ecchi?\\n\r\n- S & M?\\n\r\n- Brother complex?\\n\\n\r\nDo you see what I mean? This series contains a list of clich\u00e9s in order to attract the most people, without taking the trouble to think about the pertinence of all these points. \\n\\n\r\nStory: (2/10)\\n\r\nRoughly, the story takes place in Osaka where there is a parallel dimension of the name Ziggurat. The Hand Shakers, people who have received the Revelation of Babel, engage in a tenacious battle between them to challenge God...\\n\r\nSo I can understand that it makes you want to watch but believe me, there is a big difference between what I read and what I saw. (Careful, I'm not talking about the novel that I didn't read.)\\n\r\nThe series alternates between the annoying slice of life and the action, equally bad. The thing that bothered me most is that the scenes don't follow each other in a logical way. For example, we can easily change from a slice of life scene where two characters quietly chat to another scene where these two characters will face an opponent. \\n\r\nConcerning the explanations of the powers of the characters, don't expect anything clear or precise but nevertheless, even if nobody understands anything (including the characters), everyone uses them as simply. To make it simpler, the Hand Shakers uses the power of friendship, like lots of popular mangas you already know. The Ziggurat is the practical way for the writer to stage explosive fights in a city without trying to explain why this barrier exists. For the last 3 points of the list, I don't prefer to tell you and let you discover it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (1/10)\\n\r\nThey are all uninteresting. How often have I been able to predict their sentences during dialogues so they are clich\u00e9s? I do not know, but as many times as I can no longer count them.\\n\r\nMost of them are copy and paste from popular characters, without these new characters having a developed or deep personality. There is absolutely no subtlety, no slightly dubious character trait that would make them more complex. No, they are either kind or wicked who have become friendly and allied to the MC after fighting them. Doesn't this aspect remind you of a famous shonen manga?\\n\\n\r\nArt: (1/10)\\n\r\nWhat can I tell you? Even the most fervent defenders of the CGI won't be able to tolerate a CGI of such bad quality. The movements aren't natural (I think Riri's breasts) and are jerky, although there is slightly improving on some specific action scenes.\\n\r\nThe colors are garish and unpleasant. The staging is painful to the eyes.\\n\r\nWhat else can I tell you? The characters have a bad chara design. I have the impression that Koyori and Tazuna are primary school children while they are supposed to be high school (?) students. Good joke, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nSound: (5/10)\\n\r\nProbably the best point of the series, and yet don't expect Sawano's OST here. For most of the soundtrack, these are nice piano music to listen to although they become repetitive.\\n\r\nThe OP isn't awful and the ED is ... correct after listening to it at least 5 times.\\n\r\nThe seiyuus: Makihara has a seiyuu whose voice I don't like here. For the others, it is passable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (between 5 and 9/10)\\n\r\nStill, I doubled-up with laughter, watching this series. So the mediocrity of this series beats records, it doesn't become unpleasant or embarrassing to look at. Once you have accepted it, you can fully enjoy and laugh heartily. For example, characters' reactions are often very stereotyped and... stupid that it made me laugh, especially with Tazuna (\"I have to protect Koyori at the risk of my life!\"). \\n\r\nMoreover, Nagaoka Daichi is probably the most entertaining character so he's wide of the mark.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I think Hand(o) Shakers is an excellent series to understand just how bad a series can be. BUT if you are looking for a good show on Winter 2017, choose what you want except... Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -> Piece of shit. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "**DISCLAIMER: This version is outdated, however I will keep it up here as a mark of how I felt a year prior when constructing this review (I spent 50 days). Since then, I have created a superior version of this review that I sadly can't link (it's in my blogs section). Regardless, enjoy!**\r\n\u201cHOLY FUCK; this show has got to be the worst anime I\u2019ve seen in my whole life! I mean, I've seen some dog shit like Big Order, Pupa, Mahouka, Mars of Destruction, and Skelter+Heaven, but this takes the fucking cake, and GoHands will pay with their now abysmal reputation!\u201d -me, now and hopefullyforever...\\n\\n\r\nMy friends...thank you for waiting for this day; for this review..for sticking with me, and suffering through this abomination like I did; you are all brave souls. Now, for the usual preamble about why this show is absolute garbage and why you shouldn't watch it...EVER!\\n\\n\r\nThanks to all the time I spent splurging the forums of this crazed and fascinating enigma of a forum site and the equally crazy and passionate community that spawned it, as well as the time I spent rummaging through the narrative and production of studios like Ufotable, Production I.G, Sunrise, and Tatsunoko Production, I've come to the conclusion that every season of anime has to have \u201cthat one show\u201d. You know the one; the one show that happens to be so spectacularly bad that 90% of the vocal parts of the Internet slam it as one of the worst anime of the year, even if there are ones with lower scores, since those are just ignored by the masses. Some are lost in the aether once the new season of anime kicks off, but others stay as legends. Last year had some examples of the former, namely \u201cEnride\u201d and \u201cSeisen Cerberus\u201d, but it had even more examples of the latter, namely \u201cBig Order\u201d and \u201cMayoiga\u201d and while I'm not 100% sure where this show will end up, my money is on the latter. Now, I'm not gonna whore out views by making a sarcastic review that was meant to give fake and ironic praises to this show that will emphasize how lame it is. I'm gonna tell it to you straight: Hand Shakers sucks! It sucks really bad. I mean, you shouldn't be watching this, it sucks that fucking bad, and expect that word a lot because this show is just that goddamn awful; it's abominable; 1 out of 10 bad. That's right, we're going there...\\n\\n\r\n*While there are spoilers for Hand Shakers, don't bother watching this abomination; it's not worth your time. TL;DR at the bottom, and apologies for the length and apologies if I come off as a psychologically broken rambler just hating on a low hanging revolting pile of shit that calls itself a \"fruit\", but if you hate this show anywhere near as much as I do, or even if you don't hate it that much, please stick around? I'm sure it'll be more worth your time than the actual show could ever be. If you hate my tone here, I promise you it won't get any better since this show is apocalyptically bad! I just...really fucking hate this show...*\\n\\n\r\nOnce upon a time, there was a man who watched an anime, and once he finished it, he described it as the anime equivalent to a 5 car pile-up; something so disastrous yet fascinating; you can't look away. It was the beginning of Summer 2016 when this occurred. Half a year later, and this show was allowed to air in Japanese television and on Crunchyroll, with Funimation (for some weird reason) jumping into this shit pile of a show only a few weeks later. In my demented head-cannon, I am willing to believe that the people behind this show saw this and decided to one-up the anime that received the aforementioned statement (though, I must be fair and cast that twisted imagination aside), for Hand Shakers is the anime equivalent of Hiroshima. It is an event so disastrous, that it caused intense pain and suffering to everyone who watched and experienced it. It was something so fucked up and disastrous, that would be forever marked as a tremendous tragedy in the history of mankind. It is sickening to have looked at, and many people talk of it in disdain for all the suffering attached to it,and even joke about it for that same reason. However, in the case of the Hiroshima bombing, at least it ended something much worse. This, on the other hand, didn't serve to impact anything other than our sanities and Studio GoHands\u2019 reputation.\\n\\n\r\nNow, premise aside (since we'll get to it), what exactly...is Hand Shakers? It is something that can only be described in one of two ways, one of which I already mentioned. The other way for it to be described is: a masterpiece of fail that deserves to be talked about in the same vain as Mars of Destruction, Pupa, or Skelter+Heaven. It is something that either causes you to watch in awe or in despair. To some, it is an enigma of bullshit that will make some stare in awe, wondering just how something like this came to be, and how spectacularly this pile of dung was made without resort to alcohol and drugs for its script, while laughing their (possibly drunk) assess off while watching this piece of shit. To others, it is a travesty that forced them to watch in agony, either at how everything about this anime manages to be so bad, or at how the horrendous visuals manage to cause physical pain to their eyes. This anime is not for the visually-challenged, nor is it for the easily nauseous, or the easily angered, such as myself (for the latter adjective exclusively). This kind of shit leaves you bitter, especially if you actually care about storytelling and visual presentation.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I jumped into this anime, I already expected it to be bad thanks to the reception it has received, but it ended up being so...SO much worse than I anticipated; it was shocking as to how awful it all was, from writing, to direction, to audio, to characterization, to visual presentation. This \"anime\", if you can even call it that, violates the 8th amendment, and makes no qualms about it, for this was an attempt to make Studio GoHands a household name...and you can all guess how that worked out. To be honest, I'm 100% surprised that THIS was supposed to be their breakout anime. Just\u2026 why? Do you people honestly expect me to believe that THIS was supposed to be Studio GoHands' claim to fame; the anime that makes the studio a household name; something that opens our eyes and makes us see that Studio GoHands should be heralded as a legendary studio on par with the likes of Production I.G., Bones, Kyoto Animation, or Ufotable?!\\n\\n\r\nI truly mean it. This is something that warrants explanation. Why was this...FILTH, the studio\u2019s attempt at glory?! After all, it's nothing but a generic, shitty Fate/Stay Night clone with a ridiculous premise attached to give as excuse as to why all of the powers are so lame. If it wasn't for the obnoxiously bad visuals that were supposed to be seen as \"visionary\" or \"innovative\", almost nobody would be talking about it. It would just be a trite cow pie that didn't even try. We would have a little laugh at its expense and move on, putting this as a lazily created and forgettable schlock-fest. Instead, we are left to watch in suspense as the shit-shields (aka, the critics, such as myself; you're welcome) dissect this shimmering ball of fuckshit for creatively (and more often than not, uncreatively) murdering our brains, sanities, and eyesights with this blend of lazy, broken, and generic writing, accompanied by the most baffling of visual diarrhea. \\n\\n\r\nStill, how did it all go so wrong? How and why was this anime such an endless cycle of bullshit that only spiraled more and more into innovatively awful territory with each passing episode? Now that I took my anti-breakdown pills, it's time to press on. As we enter the fray, sacrifice our much-needed brain cells on this abomination from hell, and finally finish this painfully long and meticulously crafted preamble of visceral hate porn, let's sing kumbaya and find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the concept of the show; the premise, if you will. The premise is stupid as hell. If for one second, the MC duo lets go of one another, the girl dies, except apparently not because she can go a few seconds without contact and still survive. In fact, by episode 3, she become capable of surviving this for 15 minutes despite the fact that they give NO reasoning or decent time-lapse to tie into why we should buy this bullshit. Then, she can suddenly go two hours in episode 5 (the events surrounding that throwaway line bring up its own plethora of plot holes), and none of it has any sense of progression since we don't now what influences that progression. Back to the previous point. With the way the antagonists of episode 1 hold hands, you would assume that each group of Hand Shakers must hold hands, but then episode 3 comes around with a duo named Blade and Dagger (Talk about on the nose for their powers. Also, more on them later) and has it so that they never once hold hands. So, what the hell was the point of that stupid ass premise?! If it was advertised as a stupid gimmick for only the main duo, that would be fine; you would just have to explain it. However, when you battle, you're automatically in the Ziggurat (which I'll get back to) where you're not allowed to lose your grip otherwise you get kicked out, until the whole episode 3 example I mentioned above, except now it's when both parties don't wanna fight at all (then what about how the fight in episode 4 ended, when one side clearly wanted to keep at it a little longer and easily could've?) So, what the hell, anime?! \\n\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, not only is that established rule broken in episodes 4 and 6, but by episode 8, we can confirm that this rule is nonexistent bullshit and a lie since NO ONE DOES IT ASIDE FROM THE PROTAGONISTS!!! Wasn't it supposed to be that if you lose your grip, you lose? Apparently not because in episode 8, the more active Hand Shaker (Kodawa) never even holds hand with her partner and is separated from him all the fuckin\u2019 time, and in episode 4, neither do Blade and Dagger, so fuck me for being a logical human being that expects a show to follow its own rules. For fuck\u2019s sake, don't violate your own rules so constantly; it ruins everything.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, no wonder the powers blow! If you were to use exciting or creative powers, you would have to ditch the retarded fucking premise, which the show somewhat does, so what the fuck, you lazy piece of shit of an anime?! If you wanna make a Fate/Stay Night clone, at least have some decent powers. Then again, if the powers are called FUCKING NIMRODES (forgive the spelling, that's how they decided to spell it; I know the original meaning, but that doesn't really help given the modern definition of the term \u201dnimrod\u201d), then how the flying fuck do you expect them to be good in the first place? Well, here\u2019s how the death game works, random duos are chosen (for seemingly no reason) to participate in a game in which they need to hold hands and \u201ckill\u201d all other Hand Shaker duos, in order to meet God...who here wants to watch Mirai Nikki and Fate/Zero instead right about now?\\n\\n\\n\r\nJokes about better anime aside, there are fundamental things about these kinds of death games that aren't explained here (unlike the aforementioned better anime). For starters, nobody knows how long this whole game has been going on. Nobody knows if there have been winners before or if this was just an ongoing game (no matter what, either route will bring its own set of issues).\\n\\n\r\nNobody knows how many pairs there can be at a time. In fact, the game seems to be extremely vague and off about its rules and mechanics. Hell, holding hands in front of a duo of Hand Shakers is a trigger for battle, meaning that there is a very strong possibility that innocent couples have been mistakenly threatened due to them holding hands in front of Hand Shakers by accident, which really sells how stupid these rules are. This is the absolute worst constructed \u201cdeath game\u201d I've ever seen. In fact, I shouldn't even call it that because no one dies. Even if you have fatal injuries, as soon as you leave the Ziggurat, they're no longer fatal, and you can simply lose from getting beaten and rendered \u201cimmobilized\u201d (not really, but the anime doesn't bother with letting that particular duo that lost that way continue for unknown reasons). Aka, this isn't even a death game or proper battle royal. It can't even bother going through with its hook (not including the hand holding but, which it doesn't go through with either). Have I mentioned that you should have been watching the Fate/Stay Night anime titles instead?\\n\\n\r\nThe Ziggurat...well, I don't know what it is. Given context, it seems like a space that appears not only when two Hand Shaker pairs meet, but specifically, they meet while no one else is around, which is already convenient in and of itself. The whole Ziggurat thing is so poorly defined, and this is effectively where the \u201cbattles\u201d of this \u201cdeath game\u201d take place. Also, the Hand Shakers\u2019 hands don't even shake, they hold. This title lies. The title is stupid sounding, regardless, but still. Then again, if they wanted to be truthful, it would be \u201cHand Holders\u201d and that sounds like a cheesy ass shoujo romcom, and I\u2019ve heard that we\u2019ve had enough of those this season already. I guess they had their hands tied (get it?). \\n\\n\r\nAlso, this anime constantly pushes the incest angle between our MC duo for some weird reason. I dunno. Maybe for a generic, hollow attempt at grabbing attention? Probably, knowing this show. I mean, they aren't actually blood-related siblings but they not only don't care about that, but the first 4 episodes (when they thought they were siblings) really give the incest vibe (like the shower scene in episode 2). Also, remember the whole \u201cactual sister\u201d plot line that is occasionally addressed, well, prepare to her no closure. I mean, we already know that the randomly slapped in \u201cbackstory\u201d scene in episode 1 is a pathetically bad attempt at making us care for Tazuna before he actually gets to do anything, which is emotionally manipulative as hell, but it's not like that plot point went anywhere aside from creating bad plot twists. At least it has the decency not to try to slip in another bullshit plot twist that could've brought her back while proceeding to ramp up the incestuous undertones; that would've been the absolute worst. I mean, even evil has standards.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go back to the battle royal/potential death game for a second; I\u2019m not done ripping that sorry excuse for a battle royal apart. Remember when I said that fatal injuries stop being fatal as soon as you leave the Ziggurat? Well, that wasn't a joke or a misunderstanding. Take this, for instance; when our MCs stab the first villain (Break, who can honestly rot in hell), with their gear sword, not only does it go right through him, but the area he\u2019s in, fuckin\u2019 EXPLODES, and you mean to tell me that he only suffered injuries?! The fucker should be dead, Ziggurat abilities or not! Then again, this same shit would later happen to Kodama in episode 9, so that\u2019s just par for the course, which already consists of 14 full dishes of fresh, heaping bullshit. In episode 8, Tazuna gets his ass kicked and says that he lost a match against a group of Hand Shakers. According to the anime, if you lose, you lose permanently and can't come back. However, he is still in the game, despite losing in similar ways to how Break lost (incapacitated) and how Hayato lost (lost the will to fight while the other group did so as well but he was in the losing position anyway). If you somehow didn't catch that, that's a gigantic contradiction that is not patched up, since this game fucks it's own rules in the ass every episode.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about this battle royal/potential death game and its physics is stupid, and they don't even try to give reasonable explanations for any of it. In fact, it doesn't even feel like a battle royale; it feels more like a linear video game, where each duo is simply a stepping stone boss for the MC to overcome before moving on to the next until they reach the end. Battle royal my ass! I'd talk more about the story of this series, but this is basically all it amounts to: a high school student and his sister being haphazardly thrown into this horribly conceived death game, taking down one enemy group at a time before meeting God, except almost nothing makes any sense as they somehow meet him despite the fact that the only way to meet him is for your Nimrod to infect the Ziggurat and beat another opponent, which Kazuna and Koyori haven't done at all. Well, back to the final two episodes after this next side tangent.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is it with the first scenes of every episode and being completely disconnected from everything? Episode 1\u2019s first scene is just a shitty and poorly rendered advertisement of what's to come, episode 5\u2019s and 6\u2019s is just some terrible \u201cad\u201d for the rest of the episode without the scene being brought up again. What is the point of these? Just play the episodes and insert the scenes when necessary. It makes the episodes feel disjointed. That doesn\u2019t even take into account the really bad scene in episode 6 in which a random new duo shoots an impaling projectile at Lily, only for it to be disconnected from everything else and completely retconned entirely, making me ask what the point of it was. All of this truly highlights how horrendous the directing and scene placement of this show is.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even going to try to go through this pile of schlock scene-by-scene because that's a death sentence for my sanity due to all that\u2019s wrong here (which really sells just how broken the writing is since I've pulled so much wrong out of it already) and the horrible physics, asspulls, and other things I haven't talked about don't help whatsoever. Even if both myself and a friend of mine, who introduced this show to me in a fit of disgust at the product, end up finding brand new faults with it (some of which appear here), at least narrative-wise, I still wouldn't be able to break them all down, and that's only from a narrative standpoint, not even from a character or technical standpoint (though here is a distressing amount of faults in both of those areas as well). Plus, this review is long enough as it is. Expect some of them to pop up in the characters section, though. Maybe someone can make a blog or thread listing everything that's wrong here in the writing department. Tazuna and Koyori kick other Hand Shaker duos\u2019 asses one by one, before each battle, there is a twist regarding said duo (after the first pair), they lose and are spared, and Tazuna and Koyori finally challenge God after facing a bunch of idiots, asspull by asspull. Get fucked by a cactus, Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, obviously, we need to talk about the finale, or rather, the lead up to it. Remember this one guy from episode 5 that told Tazuna that Koyori wasn't his real sister and did so in a way that made him so obviously evil, you know, Daichi? You don't? Neither did I until I remembered that this show had a plot and until episode 10 rolled around. Well, he brought Koyori\u2019s sister (so,Tazuna\u2019s is still dead?) and he is her Hand Shaker partner, and they delve into this big dumb backstory about how Makihara and Daichi were Hand Shakers and this backstory about Koyori\u2019s and her sister\u2019s (Mayumi) past. As you\u2019d expect, it was dumb, especially since this was near the end of the show and there was no remote confirmation that there would be a season 2 (and it still doesn't have one, and I hope it dies here and with the prequel ova since that exists now). The plotholes about the hand holding and the fact that Hand Shakers can be born (so how does that explain how Tazuna became one, and does this mean that each Hand Shaker is born? Does this mean that they technically don't have to have motivations to fight in this? Then why do people partake in this to fulfill a wish that could easily be achieved normally?), as well as the one about the two sisters randomly collapsing (due to an unknown organ failing for unknown reasons that also makes us ask how a simple organ failure can destroy your memories and your communication skills) all culminate with the poor presentation and bad writing (even excluding plot holes) to make a lame ass backstory.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we getting the finale: Tazuna & Koyori vs Daichi & Mayumi. It's about as retarded as you'd expect by now, and the Tazuna and Koyori meet God and Koyori is no longer afflicted with the curse because bla bla bla! I'm not even gonna rip this pathetic finale to shreds like I did ever single episode this far, because fuck it! You don't give a shit and neither do I, so let's move on from this flaming plane crash that calls itself a plot; it has killed enough of my brain cells with its sheer idiocy and convolution already and I can feel my sanity dripping by the second. After all, it can't do battle royales, backstories, or frankly anything right and it's appalling that I managed to pull so much bullshit out of a 12 episode series. After this, I'm gonna go apologize to The Asterisk War and Psycho-Pass 2...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAs any vigilant viewer who is decently well-versed in anime can tell by watching this series, the characters here are all worthless, comprised of mostly caricatures of actual characters; templates, if you will. That would be bad enough on its own, but each of these individuals is beyond terrible, due to sheer stupidity, asspulls, pretentious quoting, general annoyance, or what have you. As such, we have no reason to care about these idiots. With that said, let\u2019s jump right in.\\n\\n\r\nShirou-wannabe (or Tazuna, as he shall be referred to since that's his real name) is an annoying and generic \u201caverage everyday highschool boy that gets into supernatural business\u201d who looks like he\u2019s in his first year of Middle School instead of high school. I mean, do we really need another generic high school guy who simply whines about his circumstances for reasons that vary from reasonable to ridiculous? Every time he wins, it's due to a Deus ex Machina new power that he pulls out of his ass (like randomly summoning his Nimrod in the first place). Plus, he got aroused to the point of nosebleeding when he rubbed his sister in the shower. Gross...except it's ok because,\u201dplot twist\u201d, she\u2019s not really his sister, except no it fucking doesn't! Also, his shtick about things \u201cmeshing\u201d got really irritating after episode 1, especially since it sounds lame as it is. Plus, in episode 9, he even has the audacity to do the whole edgy \u201cfuck you, I'm fighting for someone who is obviously not happy about how much I'm hurting myself for her\u201d bullshit to her parents, which really ruined any chance of him not being a pathetic MC template. For a main character, he\u2019s a pretty bad and annoying one, but he is TAME compared to some of these other individuals, believe me! He may be poorly written and not have any real motivations but at least he isn't as asinine as some of the other asshats you'll be seeing later down the line.\\n\\n\r\nKoyori, particularly at the start of the series, is the human equivalent to a pet, except with less personality. She\u2019s a human vegetable that can understand communication and human needs. Hell, the ED gives her more personality than the first 4 episodes of the anime do! What the hell?! What is it with these MCs and having little to no personality?! I mean, as I said, she gets personality traits EVENTUALLY, but she is the second half of the main character duo, and it should not take 4 episodes just to give one of the two most important characters in the series a single personality trait! It's not like she\u2019s a remotely good character anyway. Hell, she doesn't actually do anything (like fighting or trying to help in non-combative ways) in any fights except for the fight in episode 6, where she leads Tazuna to figure out what she figured out in order to win (and even then, he only won by new power ex machina). At least show shows some semblance of a personality by the end of episode 4, and is marginally more realized as a character than the rest of the twats in this show. Still, that's not saying much, as her personality is still vaguely defined and uninteresting. Also, her escalations are horse shit. She can gain more time away from holding hands...for some reason. Her subplot about trying to talk is only referenced for plot convenience and is never developed properly (not that I would expect such talent from anyone involved with this show), and she randomly gets a mahou shoujo costume and nimrod in episode 9 for asspull plot convenience as well, right after finally talking. Just...she either has no personality, a bland personality, or grows via plot convenience, depending on the episode. That's just sad. Sure, she gets a \u201csad\u201d backstory about how she and Mayumi had a right childhood as Hand Shakers, but again, still doesn't help her much as the backstory is terribly executed. She had the most potential to be a good deuteragonist (secondary protagonist) but, as per usual with this atrocity, they squandered it.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, their parents are more tolerable, simply being lovey-dovey parents who tease and stuff like that. Harmless, but harmless doesn't help much given the cast. They only appear for like...two episodes anyway, so I guess that's to be expected. Whatever, I\u2019m stalling; back to the shit show that is this show\u2019s important \u201ccharacters\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the scientist guy (Makihara), shall we? He\u2019s basically what's used to justify all of the nonsense present here with \u201cnot enough data\u201d or just by explaining some of the broken basics of the \u201cdeath game\u201d and is incredibly annoying, not to mention forgetful of critical information they somehow adds more problems to the show\u2019s narrative. Sure, his past comes in handy in terms of providing a little bit of info to Tazuna, but that\u2019s about it. His voice in the sub is really irritating when you combine that with his mannerisms. The dub doesn\u2019t win him any points either.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about these other Hand Shaker duos, shall we? Break is a generic mofo antagonist thrust within the first episode just for the sake of a stepping stone into the protagonists\u2019 journey through this battle royale. Bind is his masochistic weapons bitch who gets off on him stomping her goddamn VAGINA and wrapping chains around her that move fast enough that she might get rope burn. Could our premiere antagonists be any more one note and boring than these two? Plus, their power is summoning chains to hit people with (hence the names that are really on the nose). The powers are as bland and boring as the wielders themselves. It's somewhat cute seeing them get a school festival cameo in episode 7 (as convenient as that is for the anime), but that doesn't help them at all. Besides, unlike the other roadblocks/Hand Shaker duos, these two don't even have motivations! I mean, the motivations of the character that have one are rather lame and disproportionate to what they're doing to achieve them, but these guys are or introduction to this whole deal, so...what the fuck?!\\n\\n\r\nBlade (actual name, Hayate) is a bumbling dork who apologizes more than any character I've seen to date, and is relatively ok. He just wants to prove himself to his boss(which doesn't work when you apply that as a motivation to why you participate in a battle royale in which you can potentially kill people).His partner/boss, Dagger (adult who looks like she\u2019s 6, actual name, Chizuru), is more annoying, particularly around him. She\u2019s also a bit contradictory in fact in terms of her instructions about him correcting people. Even with a more social and playful attitude towards the main duo, she isn't a good character. Her backstory is that she was bullied for her height by her cohorts and wants to prove herself to them and make everyone equal by winning and becoming powerful (as her wish, which, again, doesn't work when you apply that as a motivation to why you participate in a battle royale in which you can potentially kill people), and that could've been an interesting thing to touch upon to really make her more complex, but, of course this show wouldn't bother. It isn't capable of pulling it off, nor does it try in any other narrative regard. Still, this duo is better than the first one, especially since they actually have backstory and motivations, as poorly placed and poorly presented as they were.\\n\\n\r\nLily is aggravating, juggles two annoying personality gags that are all that define her, she's incestuous with her (not really her brother, but that doesn't make it ok) little brother, Masaru (who is also a twerp who instigated the fight in episode 6 due to his own arrogant stupidity, piling it onto Lily, and is also a pathetic excuse for an already generic male-tsundere), and she has nothing going for her, not even the F-cups they are way too big for her body in terms of proportions. Besides, the backstory for her and Masaru is half-hearted and dull, not even making any sense as a backstory for why they are fighting in this game, with their reasoning being their love for each other, which shouldn't factor into this game at all, even less so than the previous duo\u2019s reasoning. Every scene with her after episode 4 is aggravation incarnate, and she is quite possible the most irritating character in this show, which is saying a lot.\\n\\n\r\nKodama, while beautiful, is also pretty annoying. She constantly quotes famous figures in pretentious manner for even the most simplest of shit that can count as a belief, as if she was some terrible fortune cookie, and it quickly gets on my nerves. Sad thing is, she isn't ever trying to be pretentious but she does this enough to make Shougo Makishima proud. Her only other gimmick in terms of personality is being all about her performances and \u201cfans\u201d and nothing else. What a waste. She has the more upbeat, thoughtful, and dedicated personality to make me really wanna like her, but her stupid gimmicks ruin it all. Her manager, Hibiki, is even more annoying, being this unbearably hyperactive and stereotypical brown-nose manager, and that's his only personality trait. Needless to say, I wanted him gone by the halfway mark of the episode that introduces him. Though, the two do have a semi-interesting backstory. They were friends since they were a bit younger, and Hibiki sacrificed his job to let Kodama succeed, even if they were still underground people. Even still, this isn't even used as a motivation for why they bothered acting as Hand Shakers, they had no motivation whatsoever. Even still, out of all the duos, they're the least bad.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we have this guy, Daichi, who came in at episode 5 to be all like \u201cshe\u2019s not the real sister; stop being Makihara\u2019s slave\u201d in the most obviously evil way possible, and lo and behold, he\u2019s a stone cold prick who actually is a Hand Shaker partner with the real sister, whose backstories raise even more problems that I actually went over in the story segment. He\u2019s as dull as the rest of the characters, and his backstory makes him much more emotional and moral in the past than now (so, why has he changed so drastically?). As for the sister, Mayumi, her backstory gave us nothing to go off of aside from her having a rough childhood, fighting in something de doesn't understand, but she doesn't even have a personality. She is what Koyori was at the start of the series, and she's part of the final boss. Shame, really. Then, she speaks and becomes another Koyori because...fuck it; I quit!\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only work in which I can, with 100% certainty say: \u201cI don't care what happens to these people.\u201d Even in works like Gundam 00 Season 2, Mahouka, Gundam SEED Destiny, and Fate/Grand Order: First Order, there was at least one character that I can like and remotely root for, even if, at least with the 2nd and 4th examples, almost everyone is horribly generic and unlikeable. Here, there is not a single person that I care about or can get invested in, even if it's just to see their asses get kicked. Worse yet, there are characters that I still WANT to get invested in, but can't due to their bullshit ruining everything. Every single character in this show can fuck off and die for all I care, and I would actually be happy, because almost every character is an idiotic asshole who only makes things worse, with the few exceptions still being pathetically flat and with almost no personality whatsoever. Their personalities are flatter than the show\u2019s resident loli, and that's sad for an original show that was supposed to put this studio on the map. Seriously, fuck these characters. I desperately wanna know how ANYONE can root for these people and get invested in their stories. Even in the few cases where they try to give us a reason to care, the presentation is so bad that we give no shits about those characters, partially due to the fact that they are completely one-dimensional. When a decision made by the show or the characters wasn't offensively or annoyingly bad, I was beyond bored, and it's thanks to these assholes. Congrats, assholes (the characters, not you guys; you guys are cool for making it this far), I hate all of you (minus a few, still one-dimensional exceptions) and you can all go to hell. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nART: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWoooooooo boy! Now onto the section we really wanna talk about; the elephant in this room so big that the room had to be the size of a skyscraper for it to fit: the visuals! Lemme put it like this. You know the phrase \u201cWork smarter, not harder\u201d? Well, the people behind this show, aka Studio GoHands, really need to learn that after what they did here. There\u2019s a lot to talk about in terms of what went wrong here, possibly more so than the writing, which is an achievement given how I contorted the abysmal writing in so many ways that no chiropractor on the planet can fix it. Oh boy, here we go...\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI in this anime is some of the most poorly integrated and some of the worst CGI that I've ever seen, and no amount of decent CG backgrounds can remedy that notion. I mean, there are moments where it can look good, only to be followed up by a moment where it looks hideous, excluding the ok CGI background buildings. Plus, it's not above using fugly ass CGI pedestrians for no good reason, as if this show wasn't enough of a nightmare to look at already. There's one moment in which this flame emperor hand is summoned, and it is revolting to look at, like it was a 1996 CGI effect for a Direct to Video DVD. Don't even get me started on the nimrodes and how hideous they look or how had the frame rate is for them. In fact, let's delve into that right now!\\n\\n\r\nThe frame rate in this series is all over the place! Within the first two scenes, THE FIRST TWO FUCKING SCENES, the frame rate crashes and it is a sight to behold. Get used to that. Whenever the camera moves in a long shot of a scene filled with people walking in an attempt at world building (which it sucks at), expect that to happen. In fact, the 2D characters have vastly lower frame rates than the CGI Nimrods. Notably, the chains in episode 1 all look like they have different frame rates, and if you see them moving while the characters are moving while the camera is moving, all at the same time, it becomes a nightmare to look at, even more so than before. Why does this show have to tread the frame rate like the Germans treated the Jews? Just...why?\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, when the characters\u2019 clothes are flapping in the wind or when the camera is slowly showing off it's CGI landscape, the frame rate shits the bed so hard, for seconds on end, and it's the absolute worst. I've never seen a show have so much or blend with frame rate before, and I've seen Phantasy Star Online 2 The Animation! Also, there are 2D first clouds drawn when a character is rolling back after an attack, and it doesn't fit well with ANYTHING in this series, whether it's the CGI backgrounds or the GoHands style character models. Now that I'm done sidetracking, let's get back to the other major gripes I have with these visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe camera, notably in episode 1 and the fight scenes, is the worst thing ever. It is highly capable of inducing vertigo, and I'm willing to bet you that it has. It moves around at the most unnecessary of times, especially in static moments, and when it does that in some of the aforementioned scenes or any scene like that, your eyes try their damndest to curl up and die just so they won't have to process all of this crap at once. Even in scenes that would otherwise look potentially good (like the opening scene in episode 8) are, at best, hindered by the obnoxious camera, and I dare not say what happens to them at worst, but episode 1 is the ultimate indicator of that. The \u201cambition\u201d behold all of these aforementioned visuals really came at a detriment to this already pointless disasterpiece. Let's not even touch on the revoltingly bad choreography, otherwise I'd be relying myself in terms of the effects, especially since the camera plays a large role in the action scenes and the way they are shot. There\u2019s also the fact that it often feels like the battles skip a gigantic chunk of frames while the frame rate dips, like in episode 4 and 8, making the action scenes unbearable to look at, and everything I mentioned previously (aside from repeated animation) are on full display in each and every one. Let\u2019s just move on to the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs range from mediocre to horrible (due to the body types and their proportions to their characters\u2019 ages), even with the decent hair detail (especially since Koyori\u2019s hair is awful to look at at times and changes colorway too much with no reason aside from \u201clight filter change\u201d, more so than Donald Trump\u2019s hair). I mean, all of the high school students look like they're almost half their age, especially due to the small heads and bodies. Adults look like older teenagers (except for Chizuru/Dagger, who looks like she\u2019s 6) for somewhat similar reasons. It simply doesn't work well. It's like making a semi-chibi version of K\u2019s visuals, and mixing it in with horrendous hair designs (particularly for Koyori, as I already mentioned), and everything else mentioned above, makes every second painful to look at. Nothing feels or looks right. Nothing blends well with each other, and that's a crying shame because if it did, and if they removed all the camera, CGI, and frame rate bullshit, this show would've actually looked good, really freakin\u2019 good. Yet, they went with this anyway, and they clearly weren't skilled enough for it, because they somehow got every conceivable thing about this process wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is not even mentioning the terrible lighting filters that make everything look off-kilter, the fugly ass fire and explosion effects that look more like an amateur freshman college student\u2019s attempt at pasta sauce (not to mention the times where it's just stock fire footage in a TV ANIME FOR FUCK\u2019S SAKE) that somehow manages to fuck the living shit out of episode 6\u2019s frame rate for about \u2153 of the episode (aka, the entire time fire appeared), the horrible school clothing designs, the occasionally awful walk animations (especially the one with Daichi\u2019s \u201cominous\u201d CGI walk in episode 10), or the fact that scenes are often reused. I'm not kidding. By the time you reach episode 3, it becomes disgustingly common for them to reuse actual, few-second clips, for no particular reason, and with no regard as to whether or not it fits. It's as if they had some trippy and \u201cambitious\u201d angle for how they wanted everything to be done, but they still decided to be lazy with it in occasion. I mean, it would've been a visual nightmare regardless, but they still cut corners, like having a menu that wasn't even drawn but was instead photoshopped from real life, or, as increasingly common it becomes as you move along, a variety of objects being stock; ripped from real life. Again, FUCK YOU, HAND SHAKERS!!\\n\\n\r\nI swear. This anime deserves to be in college courses on how NOT to integrate CGI and 2D animation together, as well as how not to use a camera or use a filter. The visuals do virtually nothing right, and that's astounding. It's like if a girl out every single lipstick and piece of makeup in existence and then adding all colors of glitter; it's a visual mess that's really hard to look at. As if the story and characters weren't abysmal enough, the visuals make this show actively unwatchable! It's a shame that people actually have to work overtime in order to make this, partially die to how awful the product looks but also due to how none of that effort paid off in the slightest. Before I lose my sanity in this void of hell known as Hand Shakers\u2019 visuals (or anywhere else in the review for this nauseating travesty), let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, \u201cOne Hand Message\u201d by OxT, is a very generic OP with obnoxious vocals that sound somewhat like auto tune, and give off a grand feeling of obnoxious genericness; a perfect fit for this show. The ED, \u201cYume Miru Ame\u201d by Akino Arai, is a melody that unfortunately fails to elicit its emotion of calming and heartwarming. Sure, it gives Koyori some actual personality, but the singer sounds like she\u2019s out of breath, and not in a good way that it makes the song more emotion-filled and somehow just as great. Then again, that's partially a product of the awfulness of the show because if it was involving well-written characters that we have been made to care about, it might've been more effective. At least it has better visuals than the show does, showing the potential the visuals had, but it doesn't matter at this point.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual OST is lame and not memorable (within its own strengths, not in terms of how much it was drilled into my head by the show). There are ok pieces there, but they're as bland and forgettable as everything else that doesn't even sound remotely interesting. There's also the fact that the OST doesn't ever fit well with the anime, whether it be due to the backgrounds or situations, it always sounds out of place since it all sounds like scenes that fit better in a generic slice of life series than in a show full of combat and destruction, especially when they pop in during the action scenes. The piece in episode 6 when Lily is hugging Masaru, happens to be especially generic, making that scene even more hamfidted than it already was. If the OST felt memorable and really good to me, I might be able to excuse that (somewhat), but it isn't so no curving the score for this section either. Not to mention that some songs that start off promising turn out really bad (like the one at the end of episode 7). I know, some people actually like this OST, but it just doesn't work for me, nor does it work for the anime. Plus, the repetitive usage of the same few mediocre and ill-fitting tracks over and over was not good. At least when Aldnoah.Zero did it, it was at least replaying GOOD music. Also, the idol songs are merely ok. They don't really help much of this poor OST. Even the idol songs are both brief and mediocre, not to mention completely out of sync to the point where it's either hilarious or maddening, depending on who you talk to. In episode 9, it's constantly interrupted by what sounds like Hibiki, and it even gets cut off for the OP, and all of that is maddening. They didn't even bother treating the idol songs from Kodama with any respect, and they're better than the rest of the OST (not by much, but still). Just...wow.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, let me be fair: no one could've made this work, thanks to the character designs, or rather, the proportions of their bodies. Even still, some of these performances feel distressingly flat or over-acted, with miscasts all over the place, but, again, it's not like the best casting choices would've been able to work well with any of this. It doesn't \u201cmesh\u201d, as Tazuna would say. Even Monica Rial can't give her character anything good. Some of the other voices are annoying as well. Then again, the sub was pretty awful too, possibly more so than the dub. Still, this proves that Hand Shakers really is unlistenable as well as unwatchable. I mean, even as a cheesecake dub (by that I mean, a corny and unintentionally or even intentional hilarious dub full of camp), this is rather boring, as I and many there can point to you at least a few that do a much better job at being a cheesecake dub, like Garzey's Wing. Just skip the dub, as well as the show itself. Also, I know that the sound effects can be pretty bad in this anime sometimes, but there\u2019s this one moment in episode 10 in which Makihara moves back, but ever sound effect in that moment begins literally an entire second before he actually moves, you know, because this show can't do sound effects right either.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you somehow couldn't already tell, I hate this show. I really fucking hate it. The visuals are infuriatingly bad in almost every conceivable way, the battle royale \u201cdeath game\u201d is so poorly constructed and explained that it alone killed the script for this show beyond redemption (only for everything else to add a million gallons of fuel to the fire), the dialogue is Mahouka levels of robotic, the action is revoltingly bad and incoherent, the characters are flatter than a loli, the comedy is awkward and terrible (often reusing the same gag over and over), the voices are awful, and everything about this show just pisses me off! In fact, it finds new ways to make me suffer with every passing episode, which is crazy considering that episode 1 broke my spirit and made me hate it more than any anime within the span of 22 minutes. Ah, Hand Shakers: the gift that just keeps on FUCKING giving!\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that when it's not doing that, it flat out bores me to death, and that happens surprisingly often. Then again, this show never tried to be remotely interesting, anyway. If anything, episode 1 alone made me grow an obsessive hatred with this show, and it only got worse the more the show progressed, culminating in this bleak review devoid of any positivity. I know that some people look at all of that and laugh, for it does nothing right and would make a great template on how not to write these kinds of shows, but I just couldn't stand it for the life of me, not even for an instant. Hell, as I was taking notes on this series, that task ended up being much more entertaining and fulfilling than ANYTHING this show had to offer, which really speaks volumes of how much I hate this series, especially since each of the notes I wrote down made it to this review. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that someone can enjoy this schlock ironically. I understand that there are people out there who unironically LIKE the show and have probably given up on this review for being nothing but unbridled hate on a show that they somehow managed to enjoy, but I almost never had a moment that made me smile (aside from one moment where I laughed and got incompetently done Masaru's rolling was), and that's not even an exaggeration. The only episode I DIDN\u2019T hate with a passion is episode 7, but despite having some semblance of charm at points, it's still as dull as the rest of the dull moments of this series, albeit it's not offensively bad, unlike the rest of the series. All in all, my hatred of this show became obsessive, and now I can lay it to rest.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 1/10    RAW SCORE: 0/100\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show was a disaster from the word \u201cgo\u201d. The moment it aired, it received a humongous backlash, and for damn good reason. This show had around 10 producers, so the results probably shouldn't has been so surprising, since that just practically screams \u201clack of communication\u201d and \u201cclusterfuck\u201d right there. Either way, this abomination a masterpiece of failure, with all sorts of mistakes around every corner, and it never once gets better; it's a canvas of vomit that someone decided to call art, as if we are supposed to accept something that is this apocalyptically bad! Worse yet, it was pathetically generic and without an attempt to be interesting, aside from its visuals, and even then, only somewhat. In every sense of the word, this show is BROKEN; nay, FUBAR! This shit went Fucked Up Beyond All Repair from the moment it fucking started! THAT'S PERFECT WAY TO SURMISE THIS PIECE OF FUCKING HORSE SHIT!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThen again, you're probably thinking \u201cWe already knew all that; it's obvious. Why\u2019d you waste your time with this 9,400+ word novel of a review on a low hanging fruit like this show?\u201d Well, aside from sharing what this anime did to me, I wanted to solve this anime\u2019s hatedom forever, making sure that there is no way to reasonably defend this show and that any non believers can be sent this review to read in order to accept that this show is an abomination. Interestingly enough, there has been quite a number of people trying to pass this off as simply middling and not awful, which this review and the writer in question disagree with wholeheartedly. With that, we come to the final nail in the coffin I prepared.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've played it or heard of it, think back to Sonic \u201806. It was a broken mess, with glitches up the ass, horrible gameplay elements, poor worlds and visual aesthetics (aside from some of the cutscenes), and a bizarre mess of a story to boot. Even still, it had ambition. It has great music, and an attempt at a complex and interesting story. It over-reached in all the necessary places, and rushed itself in others, leading to its downfall, but at least it tried something interesting and potentially unique. Hand Shakers didn't do any of that. It played around with camera and CGI, but was so damn lazy in every other regard, that it's insulting to call this show ambitious. It didn't even try, and it suffered horribly for it. WE, or at least I suffered horribly for it, and, if the Internet is how we think it is, Studio GoHands is suffering for this as well. After all, even if this was how they intended it to be, in the end, this was an abomination from hell that will damn their reputation; that's what they get for making the Ride to Hell Retribution of anime. All we need now are some awful motorcycles and those fucking cowbells\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnime is an interesting category for certain animated series, and is a sink of ideas, plenty of which are ingenious and creative, and are capable of captivating us, invigorating us, and making us think, while also being capable of teaching us something new and interesting, warning us of what we don't want to become, and even reminding us about amazing things we desperately needed to remember. It allows for kinds of shows you will never see in any other outlet of television. However, shit like this is filled with a dearth of creative and interesting ideas, and is simply a product meant to suck our money and give the studio (not the workers) some profits, like with plenty of Light Novel adaptations (whether the LNs were good or not) like Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei and The Asterisk War. The sooner we realize how these cheap products dupe us, the more we can demand shows that more people in the production will take seriously in terms of actually entertaining us and making us want to watch more of their stuff. Plenty of us in the west have been doing that for the past decade, and more people in the east need to start adopting this mindset. Stuff like this is unacceptable, especially when the generic and poorly written product anime are also poorly produced, like this show. I hope to never come across something like this again, and I hope Studio GoHands learns from this and tries to recover with an interesting anime that many will want to see and will actually get invested in, for this anime has done a lot of harm to their reputation. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, Hand Shakers is such a cheesy name. Couldn't have been something cool like \u201cHands of Fate\u201d? I mean, give me a cool name to hate a show, something to make it feel like it is \u201cthe dreaded\u201d. Then again, that title I proposed would make the fact that this is a shoddy Fate/ ripoff even more apparent. It's the modern day equivalent to what De:Vadasy was to Evangelion. For those not in the know, De:Va was considered by oldtaku (old anime fans) to be the worst Eva ripoff of all time, with awful directing, awful scene structure and composition, poor production values, retarded concept, and so much more, hence the comparison. Whatever, fuck it. This shit gets my \u201cGo to hell; You Didn't Even Try\u201d award (aka the 1/10 award). With all that said, FUCK HAND SHAKERS!! Can't wait for the god-awful prequel OVA coming out this summer with the purposes of turning shis fuckfest into a franchise, that way I can rip on that, too! Well, assuming that my next target doesn't ruin me, see you next time, everybody! I'm the meantime, I\u2019m getting chemo for this bullshit!\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFor you, January 11, 2017 was the day that your worst nightmare arrived and began ravaging everything you and your tastes stood for, but for me, IT WAS TUESDAY!!!\u201d -Me, Tuesday, when this travesty of an anime came on every week.",

            "content": "Really funny anime - in the wrong way. I watched the first 30 seconds and already knew I would be watching it just for laughs. \r\nStory 1/10\r\nThis was like an attempt at a combo of No Game no Life, K Project, and Mirai Nikki, of course, just horribly. Half of every episode was full of irrelevant things that had no importance whatsoever. All the useless things that pop up just make you wonder, \"but why?\" :-) The story mostly goes: \"Wow, they're holding hands! They must be hand shakers! Let's fight! Now that we've fought, let's stay friends!\". I love how the two main charactersare supposed to hold hands at all times and they do... in the first 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite line is from episode 1 around 19:20 the MC says \"How many are there?\" - I seriously couldn't stop laughing, did this boy just ask how many, and not why? Dear god.\\n\\n\r\nArt 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThose camera angles were really something else. I loved when they flipped the camera angle in any direction possible so that you couldn't tell what was happening, it didn't look trippy at all - trust me. The OP looked way better than the actual anime to me, they tried to do the art kind of like K project. The FPS was only about 15-16.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWant to listen to a moaning girl chained up that sounds like hentai? Well now you can! In just the first episode-- with more in later episodes as well, of course! Honestly only the OP was decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWHO ARE ALL THESE RANDOM CHARACTERS THAT COME OUT OF NOWHERE? \\n\\n\r\nLiterally, some scenes a character would just pop up. Then, they'll be talking to  the characters as if you know them and won't be introduced until later. Koyori - why is she even a character? Haha who knows, she hasn't done anything. There's no backstory to the characters, you don't know the MC except that he has a name, sister, and fights. They say irrelevant things of no importance. \"That's a nice bike\" to \"Okay. bye\" What a conversation.\\n\\n\r\nAlso you can't forget about the girl in the first episode listening to music, apparently her chest likes to dance with her.\\n\\n\r\nI can't watch this anymore- It's heading in the incest direction. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nFunny. Hilarious even. I laughed at random things a character said or the camera angles that look like someone just dropped their camera and it flipped everywhere. The irrelevant scenes were great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I would say watch it if you like to laugh at how horribly appalling something is. Other than that - the opening. Um, yeah, that's it. You hardly know anything about the characters to say you like them.\\n\\n\r\nUnforchunetly, I theenk I have wost all my bwain cells fwom thes aneme. (Safe to say my IQ dropped this low)",

            "content": "Hand Shakers is the worst thing I\u00b4ve ever seen.\r\nNow this show exceeded my expectations quite a lot. When I first saw it, I thought it was bad, but holy molly. This show is quite the good thing to dig into. I mean there is so much wrong with it, you could write for hours about what trash you can find in this. So, I decided, screw it. This is not some throw away material to write 500 words or less about. This is the real jackpot. So, I decided to do something more in the style of YourMovieSucks, who is like one of my favoriteYouTubers ever and you should subscribe to him right now.\\n\r\nAs of writing this review, it is the 17th of january, after I watched episode 1, so I will write this review along the next months until this show is over, to create the perfect review. I will structure this review in multiple parts, ordered kinda chronologically, each part centering around one object of failure. I don\u00b4t even care if this doesn\u00b4t get popular. I missed my chance to destroy Big Order. This is my slice of cake, idiot.\\n\\n\r\nPart 1: The first impression\\n\\n\r\nSo, after hearing first about this anime, I immediatly go to its MAL page. Take away the bad score, which I don\u00b4t care about as I\u00b4ve already seen anime, which had a less than stellar score, which were better than expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe picture shown includes the two main characters, alongside other pairs of two. Assuming by the picture alone, it is easy to say that the show includes a aspect in which multiple couples are involved with each other. By the setting, the story plays in a big japanese city, if it is fictional or not is not possible to assume, as it is pretty much a generic backdrop of a shopping mall or a similar building complex. Considering the modern design of it, you can say that it plays in a rather big and a rather modern city. The two main characters are shown in the middle of the picture to get the focus of the viewer onto these two, a boy and a girl. The boy is taller than the girl, has brown hair and his clothes make him look like a student. Even if none of the story takes place in school, we can conclude that he is somewhere between 12 to 17 years old. Besides him stands the girl, which is rather short and has white hair. This design is easy to link to her personality being the quiet Kuudere of the story. Considering her clothes in the picture, you could assume that she is pretty young, which means that the two should belong in the younger part of the 12 \u2013 17 spectrum.\\n\\n\r\nThe next step to my first impressions should be the description. My conclusion of the picture, regarding the place and time of the story and the pair aspect was right. The story is apparently about multiple couples fighting against each other to fight god. If there isn\u00b4t a set number of couples, that compete in this, the entire concept would not make sense in the least. Besides that, through the picture alone you can conclude that one of the couples is indeed the main focus on the story. To make a battle royale situation work, there cannot be a main character, because then you\u00b4d know that this character cannot die in the story, which has already been shown in Mirai Nikki, which was pretty terrible as well. A example of a show that did this right was Fate/Zero, which didn\u00b4t necessarily focused on the battle royale itself, but rather the characters and their relations, which worked, because there was no legitemate main character. The rest of the description is some quote, that is probably taken from the anime. The only interesting thing about it is that \u201eZiggurat where the fighting shall ensue\u201c, which implies that the battle royale situation takes place in a specific tournament.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2: The animation and artstyle\\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers is the worst looking anime I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe first entire minute is a montage of the protagonist and the girl jumping around at high speed with directing, that is completely disorienting. I absolutely hate this technique, in which the shot moves towards the center and then out, over and over, to give a sense of motion, while animating nothing and destroying every sense of direction or orientation. The movement is not fluid, it feels disjointed. I know none of this was from the same sequence of events, but considering the \u201cepicness\u201d, this show tries to convey, it should have at least a sense of fluid movement to carry it. I\u00b4m talking about this for so long, because that\u00b4s all the directing in this show. It looks horrendeus.\\n\\n\r\nThe next thing I noticed were 3D effects. You could make better special effects on Windows Movie Maker. The chains look like they\u00b4re glitching and also they look fake as hell. Their placement in each shot doesn\u00b4t even make sense. At times, they should hit someone, but they don\u00b4t, because it looks \u201cepic\u201d. Yeah, fuck off. These chains are supposed to look like an obstacle, not to be one. This brings me to random 3D shots. They are the worst thing I\u00b4ve seen. They just show them, so that the viewer knows, that the show looks \u201cgood\u201d, and for no other reason. Hand Shakers does this cancerous thing, where they take realistic looking backgrounds and put anime characters in it. You don\u00b4t do that, that looks fake. There are lens flares, that should not exist. They are only there, so that the show might look more high-quality. Here\u00b4s the thing, if you have a good artstyle or high-quality animation, do something with it. Look at Evangelion and how well animated its fighting scenes are, look at Gankutsuou and everything creative or magical that is done with it artstyle, LOOK AT KILL LA KILL!\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs look absolutely terrible. You can see that no thought has been put into them, AT ALL! The boy has the school-uniform outfit. The girl has the \u201cI\u00b4m the cute girl\u201d-outfit. None of the characters have a design, that sticks out. Everything looks generic and bland. The design of backgrounds or surroundings look ungodly bland too. So, you\u00b4re trying to make some modern, futuristic look, right? They\u00b4re obviously trying to go for that, because it\u00b4s a special and interesting look, but why is the only indication, that everything is shiny. Why not do something interesting? It all looks the same to me, at this point. You should at least try to make everything look interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main criticisms I\u00b4ve seen for Hand Shakers is its fanservice, to which I say, noes. No, because the fanservice, for once, isn\u00b4t the most irritating thing. Yes, because of the way the anime is animating such scenes, with ridicolous boob physics and panty shots, which don\u00b4t even work. There is a scene, where the dude steps on the grill and her boobs fly 90 degrees in the other direction. How are breasts supposed to behave this way? It doesn\u00b4t make any physical sense. It\u00b4s my main course in school, I know what I\u00b4m talking about.\\n\\n\r\nPart 3: The first episode\\n\\n\r\nConsider, that I\u00b4m writing this part months before you\u00b4re reading it, as this is right after I watched episode 1 on the 17th of january 2017. So, I decided to write down my thoughts on the episode completely independent from any other episode, even the second one.\\n\\n\r\nRight of the bat, we get to see this this one minute scene of horrible action which serves no purpose other than to fail at looking cool with monologue, which does not make sense, even a bit. It\u00b4s like a monologue in a fanfiction, where the protagonist is supposed to look deep, but that\u00b4s actually dumb, because the protagonist is dumb. But wait, I would rather read Sonic fanfiction than watch Hand Shakers. Right after that is a scene with fish eye visuals, which serves no purpose except to look good, which it doesn\u00b4t, because there is nothing going on. Then there is a fighting scene between the protagonist with the white haired girl and another couple with the chains. I don\u00b4t know their names and I\u00b4m supposed to know what is going on. You didn\u00b4t even introduce anything of what I\u00b4m seeing.\\n\r\n\u201eBut Boris, this is smart, because you know what is going on after you\u00b4ve seen the entire episode.\u201c\\n\r\nLain was smart, when it did that, because you understand the message and idea behind it after watching it again completely, but on your first watch through, you still understood what was going on. What Hand Shakers does is dumb.\\n\\n\r\nThere are characters literally popping in and out of existence. When I first saw that I laughed for like 5 minutes. Then we get introduced to our main character and oh look, a school, just like I predicted. There is also the red haired girl. You might notice I cannot remember the characters name. That\u00b4s because I only make the attempt to remember the name of a character or a person in real life, if I know I might need the information or find the character interesting. I don\u00b4t remember the name of half of the teachers I have in school and no one actually knows. The red haired girl is like \u201edo you have the thing I wanted to get repaired\u201c and the boy is like \u201esure thing, Red haired McOppai\u201c. Then the rest of the scene goes about useless dialogue and obvious foreshadowing. A tarot card, really? That\u00b4s the most subtle foreshadowing that you could bring? Who came up with the idea of adding a freaking tarot card to foreshadow something?\\n\\n\r\nThen the protagonist goes somewhere else and fixes that persons car. His only personality trait is apparently that he is good at fixing stuff. But you have to question why. I mean I can understand if he is good at fixing McOppais aPod or some clocks, but a car engine. Are you kidding me? These are not the same things. This guy could work at NASA, he\u00b4s so good. You could give this kid two lollipops and a DVD of Breaking Bad and he could build a nuke out of it. Take that, McGyver.\\n\\n\r\nThen the protagonist is at the university of a professor, who he wants to fix something for. The following scene legitemately ticked me off. I sat in front of my laptop and cursed at it for two whole minutes, because of this. So, he looks into this other room, which is a hospital room, which doesn\u00b4t even make sense, why would there be such a room to begin with. He gets a cheap flashback that his little sister died in that same room. WHAT!? So, either the anime did a trash job at showing that the protagonist forgot some things and he remembers his sister, which was a thing in Big Order, or he\u00b4s just retarded. This is so all of the sudden, even Big Order did the dumb \u201eI forgot this thing, but now I remember it\u201c twist better. The foreshadowing in this anime is so bad, that it is 13 PM. But it gets worse. He gets in, there is the white haired girl, he gets reminded of his little sister. This is cheap, this is just cheap. Essentially, this is only there to make sure the audience has some tragic backstory about the protagonist, so that they know they are supposed to feel something for him. He has two personality traits, he can fix literally anything and his little sister died. Doesn\u00b4t sound like an anime character, sounds more like a piece of paper to me.\\n\\n\r\nThen in the next scene the professor comes back and he gives exposition, but the anime screws that up, by not letting him tell the exposition, that we need to know, just giving away some words, like Nimodes or Ziggurat. Can I eat that? Then he disappears. Oh, also, if he lets go of the girl she dies and he doesn\u00b4t want that, because it\u00b4s like his little sister. Oh no. Then they get attacked by the pair from the beginning. Considering the positioning of the chains, the two should\u00b4ve tripped at least once. There is really not much to say. So, apparently the enemy couple is a guy with no personality and a girl with no personality. How interesting. The girl is completely chained up. It\u00b4s obvious the creator of this had a bondage fetish, I mean I don\u00b4t blame him. Also, it\u00b4s the scene from the beginning again. Also, he\u00b4s giving away words like Nimrodes again. Also, the voice acting legit sounds like Hentai. It\u00b4s essentially the scene from the beginning, except now our protagonist can magically use his Nimrodes, even though he has never used it. Also, in most shots it is shown that they stand like 50 meters away from each other max, but there is a scene of the main character running at him for like a minute. This is the most amazing continuity error I\u00b4ve ever seen. I thought Guilty Crown should\u00b4ve gotten an Oscar for this, but Hand Shakers should get like 10 Oscars for that. I hope someone gives them the \u201eBest continuity error\u201c Oscar.\\n\\n\r\nThen the MC tries to attack him. The End.\\n\\n\r\nNow, once I was done with episode 1 I already knew what this was. This was the worst thing I\u00b4ve ever seen. Before I move on, congratulations. You\u00b4re actually still reading this insanely long review. You apparently don\u00b4t have the memory span of a goldfish, so you can deem yourself smarter than a goldfish. It\u00b4s funny, because the goldfish thing isn\u00b4t actually true. The reason I decided to write about episode 1 as a special part is just to share how bad this show felt once I watched just this one episode. I mean, it was bad. So now that you know how bad episode one just was and how horribly written it is, I can move on to making the rest of the review.\\n\\n\r\nPart 4: The rest\\n\\n\r\nSo, after realizing that my review was full with words like \u201cprotagonist\u201d and \u201cwhite haired girl\u201d, I decided to insert names for them, in order to remember them. McOppai is still McOppai. The protagonist is McGyver and the white haired girl is Not-Rei. Now this should be easier to write.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2:\\n\r\nEpisode 2 starts off with 6 or so minutes of dialogue between professor guy and McGyver. The entire scene is stretched to an unneeded length and contributes next to no exposition. There is no way, he could know any of the things, but he does, for some reason. Because this is episode 2 after the first episode with an insanely fast pacing, this is the slower episode in which nothing happens, except the actual introduction to the story. And guess what, it\u00b4s nothing more than fanservice and a \u201ccomedy\u201d cringefest. It\u00b4s funny, because McGyver thinks he\u00b4s going to jail.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 3:\\n\r\nEpisode 3 is 75% the same stuff as episode 2, in which nothing of importance happens and the anime tries to be funny, while being absolutely cringeworthy. There\u00b4s also this character, who is apparently an adult, but she looks like a loli. Not only that, but her only character trait is that she\u00b4s a Tsundere. I mean why do people like Haruhi, Kurisu or Asuka again? Was it because of character development or that they were extremly lovable. Naah, I think it was just because they were bitchy. Also, she and her partner are Hand Shakers. Also, their tragic backstory is that they have been discriminated. Also, the fight scene is disorientating and comes out of nowhere. The background is moving in a different way than the effects and characters, which makes it look obviously fake. Then the episode ends.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 4:\\n\r\nNothing of any substance or worthwhile development happens, it\u00b4s just cancerous CGI-porn. Watching real porn feels more enjoyable. Hell, why should I watch this, if I could watch porn? Exposition a shit in this series, yet again, nothing anyone says makes any sense. This episode feels like a filler.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5:\\n\r\nThis entire episode proves that not one writer on this show gives a flying fuck about sticking to the rules they set up. McGayverToo loses Not-Rei and she should probably die, but oh wait, then the show might end. Stupid me, let\u00b4s break the rules, we set up, in order to establish a melodramatic setup to the next useless fight. Nothing of substance happens. Also, no one makes any sense. McOppai is like \u201cI see you don\u00b4t wanna fight\u201d and her brother is like \u201cHe wants to fight\u201d and she\u00b4s like \u201cYou want to fight.\u201d What? I\u00b4ve never seen a character that stupid and I\u00b4ve had the displeasure of watching the entirity of Fairy Tail and Guilty Crown and Big Order and Code Geass. It\u00b4s the same shit as Ep.3, where it spends the majority of the episode doing fuck all, to set up the next episode, which is going to be SoOoOoOoooOO \u00e4\u00e4\u00e4pppiiiIiiIccCC!!!??\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6:\\n\r\nYou know, I actually had high hopes, that this show might pull some Hunter X Hunter or One Piece-ish stuff, where the battles are pretty strategic and center around one character trying to break through the other ones defense, oh wait, it\u00b4s just useless bullshit. The entire fight is a huge bowl of plot armor spilled out to write \u201cYou\u00b4re supposed to like this.\u201d I asked myself, why did Tsundere-Baka and her boyfriend have a sword and shit and everyone else has specialiced weapons? Probably because the writers didn\u00b4t know how to write characters.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7:\\n\r\nOH BOY; YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THE FILLER IN CODE GEASS!!?? THIS IS EVEN MORE RETARDED!!!! :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D\\n\r\nNothing happens. It\u00b4s all just supposed to be one pile of drama and comedy, that doesn\u00b4t fit into the story. After this episode, I was convinced that Not-Rei has absolutely no personality and only exists as a loli, for people to find cute. Also, there\u00b4s a plot twist, which has no build-up and still manages to be obvious from the start. How is this even possible? Probably because things only exist to look cool to their idiotic target audience.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8:\\n\r\nSo, after episode 7 being nothing more than filler in a sea of no plot progression, we get another episode of characters appearing out of nowhere and fighting out of nowhere. The ability of the couple, that I nicknamed Singy & Guyi, was actually quite interesting, but yet again no one deemed it interesting enough to make it into a interesting battle or even use good directing. There is also this scene, where Not-Rei talks about McGyver, but it just ends up looking like a desperate attempt at character devlopment. Oh man, I love empty females, reminds me of myself.\\n\\n\r\nPart 5: The summary\\n\\n\r\nAfter letting 8 episodes pass by, I decided that this should be the final part, before summarizing the main flaws in the anime. I will watch Hand Shakers until its end, thanks to my \u201cNo-Drop policy\u201d, but I decided that updating my review shouldn\u00b4t be a priority for me, especially if my exams started about two weeks ago. Therefore, I decided to summarize every point I have to get out to show how idiotic and dumb this series actually is.\\n\\n\r\n-Repetitive structure\\n\\n\r\nI already ranted on how entire episodes repeat themselves. As you might\u00b4ve noticed in my episode summaries, the show is beyond repetitive. Entire episodes are there for the sole purpose of having a fight scene in it and I can appreciate that in other shows. Some of my favorite anime have episodes full of over-the top, fast-paced action. Anime, like Jojos Bizarre Adventure, Hunter X Hunter or Gurren Lagann are this kind of anime. The problem with Hand Shakers is that it packs them with so few episodes in between, that the anime cannot \u201cbreathe\u201d. The entire plot comes off as boring, if every second episode is the same trash, with another dumb episode in between, that serves no purpose to the second one. There is no variety in either episode. On one hand, there is Slice-of-Life, while there is a fighting scene, which play out the exact same. How can one be entertained by this?\\n\\n\r\n-No plot progression\\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers starts as a story of two characters fighting against others. Now, tell me, where is it now? If you said \u201cIt\u00b4s still a story on how two characters are fighting against others\u201d, you\u00b4re goddamn right! You might say \u201cBut anime X didn\u00b4t progress and you liked it.\u201d Actually, it did. People might argue about One Piece having no progression, but consider the fact, that the structure in it is every so slightly changing. Then there is stuff like Serial Experiments Lain, where events are happening and affect the plot to move forward. Then there is Hand Shakers. Ask yourself this, if you would cut out everything that happened from episode 1, where the story really started, to episode 8, would anything change? If I would do that with One Piece or Lain or many other anime, this would affect the plot. If I would do the same with Hand Shakers, the entire story would be indifferent.\\n\\n\r\n-Ziggurat has no rules and the ones it has are broken\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reason the plot doesn\u00b4t progress is because there is no sign of progressing in the Ziggurat. Mirai Nikki told the viewer the amount of competetors beforehand, that\u00b4s at least something. That way, you would know whether there are 5 or 5 million people left to kill. There isn\u00b4t a time window either or a way to join the Ziggurat. So, what if someone becomes a Hand Shaker, when there is only one left? When does Ziggurat end? Does it end or is it a endless tournament of fighter, trying to eliminate each other? That would be awesome in a way, but you would still have to set rules. There are no rules, it\u00b4s just \u201cIf you met another Hand Shaker, you will fight.\u201d. That\u00b4s stupid. And what about the weapons? McGyver has a clock sword and shield and McOppai has cards, but the Tsundere couple has giant shuriken, if I recall so. How are weapons chosen for people? If I would join the Ziggurat, is my weapon of choice a rare Pepe? How is giving one couple a shield and a sword and another a giant shuriken or a power to change reality itself fair? Who came up with this?\\n\\n\r\n-Kirito & Yuno Syndrom\\n\\n\r\nSomething I notice a lot since having sat through SAO is \u201cKirito Syndrom\u201d. It\u00b4s when members of a character cast only exist for the sake of admiring another character. The exact opposite would probably be \u201cYuno Syndrom\u201d, where characters only exist to oppose a character or be an enemy to that character. Hand Shakers is the ultimate example of both flowing together into one, basically a giant sewer, if you want. Many characters, like McOppai or Not-Rei only talk about McGyver, in order to admire him or tell the viewer how big his dick is, but I don\u00b4t care about that. These characters only talk about him all the time. Do they get any development of their own? No, not really. Do they serve another role in the story? No, actually nah. What is even worse is characters existing as pawns to defeat. Couples appear without build-up, just to be defeated at the end of the day. These characters have no personality, no real backstory, no traits, they are just there to be defeated, so that we know how \u201cgreat\u201d our main character is. That is really dumb.\\n\\n\r\n-Horrendeus directing\\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned this earlier, but Hand Shakers directing is worthless. Actually, it has the worst directing I have ever seen, worse than Transformers, worse than Suicide Squad, worse than any terrible high school student film. I usually notice good directing a lot, but I also notice a lot of horrible directing too, mostly because I already did some editing myself.\\n\r\nThe first problem with Hand Shakers' directing is its rapid movement. Whenever something happens in a action sequence, the shot moves around really fast and all over the place, in order to emphasis as much as possible how fast the scene is. You might\u00b4ve seen some Hollywood movies, where they do the same, mainly to hide parts of a scene. In Hand Shakers, this is put to a new level, because the rapid movement of a shot makes it feel disjointed and overanimated. The place in one space, where things are, can get confusing, which makes it hard to follow such scenes.\\n\r\nEven worse are scenes, where nothing is happening. If you\u00b4ve ever watched a Quentin Tarantino movie, you know that they are full of action, but also have countless still shots, which are there to convey atmossphere or let a scene rest. Hand Shakers doesn\u00b4t do that. Every shot has to be animated as much as possible. There are shots, where nothing is happening and nothing of importance is said, which have moving camera shots, just to jerk off more animation into your face. There are barely shots, which are resting for a long enough time to let a place or atmossphere sink in, before it moves to the next shot. That is what makes the anime feel empty. There is literally no time for the anime to breathe, before it moves on.\\n\\n\r\n-Poorly handled exposition\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part about writing a story for me, besides making dialogue sound natural, is exposition. If you\u00b4ve never tried to write a story on your own, you don\u00b4t know how hard it is to make exposition feel natural. You can\u00b4t go around and explain the laws of your story by counting down everything your reader needs to know, because at that point it\u00b4s just a glorified school book. And, I have to say, the way Hand Shakers does it is beyond me.\\n\r\nEntire points of exposition aren\u00b4t conveyed like in usual media. There are characters, that act like they know a certain thing and build-up everything until they give it away, only to withhold that information. If you want to make a story, that makes sense, you have to give at least a minimal amount of exposition, but that doesn\u00b4t include giving away random Buzzwords, to sound smart. This is kindof exclusive to the start, but that doesn\u00b4t excuse it, because by that time, your viewers should know what a Ziggurat or a Nimrod is. After that, entire plot points are told in info dumps by the professor. Why not do that by the first episode? The anime was even leading up to it, but just didn\u00b4t. Who wrote this?\\n\\n\r\n-School as a catalysator\\n\\n\r\nYou might notice that many stories have a catalysator through which events can be created or bound together into one plot. This catalysator can be a character, a event, a place, it doesn\u00b4t matter. As long as it ties the story together or kicks it off, it works. The school in Hand Shakers works as that, a catalysator. The problem is that it isn\u00b4t the only catalysator, that is used in Hand Shakers. Can you name the other one? That\u00b4s right, it\u00b4s the Ziggurat. The Ziggurat is there to tie the characters into one narrative, which would work, if it wasn\u00b4t for the school. Characters appear there, just for the purpose of tying the story together twice, one time a couple appears at school and another time at Ziggurat. This is unnatural. Imagine, if all of the sudden Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Zombie Karl Marx and Hillary Clinton are at your school, for some reason. Sounds dumb and nonsensical? Well, so is this anime!\\n\\n\r\n-The music\\n\\n\r\nMusic as a asset can be a very important thing in your story. Whether or not a scene contains music can change it and whether or not it is good can change it too. Too bad the Hand Shakers soundtrack is absolute garbage.\\n\r\nWhen I think of the FLCL soundtrack, I think about how energetic and creative it sounded. It always fits the mood for FLCL. Whenever I think about the Hand Shakers soundtrack, I feel bored. There is no variety in the OST whatsoever. It\u00b4s all a mix of piano songs. Everything on the OST sounds the exact same. As a mood setter in the story, it doesn\u00b4t function. Every scene feels the exact same, boring. It is extremly unmemorable. Every piece of music is there to play safe. If the viewer hears something new, they might not like it, so we\u00b4ll tuudle the same thing over and over. They\u00b4re so dumb, they won\u00b4t even notice.\\n\\n\r\n-Disjointed flow and pacing\\n\\n\r\nThere is no pacing in Hand Shakers. Through the beforementioned repetitive structure, there is not time to breathe. With every episode of nothing happening, the story gets interrupted, before it picks up way too fast the episode later. The transition between these two states of hot and cold cause the story to feel even more unnatural. Imagine going from lifeless Slice-of-Life to a full-on fighting scene in the timespan of 3 minutes. There is no build-up between these two states. It\u00b4s just like \u201cHere\u00b4s a fighting scene\u201d and that\u00b4s that. There isn\u00b4t any time to given to build this up. Do you even know how unnatural this feels like?\\n\\n\r\n-Horrible character cast\\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers doesn\u00b4t have the worst character cast. That is because they can barely be defined as characters, rather they can be seen as random pixels on the screen of your computer.\\n\r\nThe main problem I have with the cast is Tazuna, which I dubbed as McGyver. The problem I have with him is his shallow personality. I expected, that he would get at least some development aside of being the 21st Century McGyver Reboot and having a little sister, that died. I was disappointed. There is nothing I can say about him, aside of that, because he\u00b4s that much of a empty shell, perhaps a GHOST in the SHELL and after he lost his sister, he should have a STAND ALONE COMPLEX!\\n\r\nAside of him, I already discussed the Kirito & Yuno Syndrom of this show, so mentioning enemy couples again wouldn\u00b4t make sense.\\n\r\nMcOppai and Not-Rei are only there to admire McGyver and have fanservice scenes.\\n\r\nThe professor is supposed to be smart, but also kindof silly for no reason other than lulz? Wut\\n\\n\r\n-Empty world\\n\\n\r\nA world can be something, that can create entire anime or stories overall by itself. If you do worldbuilding just right, you got yourself an entire story. However, if you do the exact opposite and neglect worldbuilding as a whole, you got yourself a empty story. Hand Shakers has none. There is, in fact, one place that plays a role in the story, that is the school and even that is of no use. There isn \u00b4t any development done. I couldn\u00b4t tell you, if a place is there or not, because the anime does such a poor job at conveying the location of something. Many other places are only there to serve a purpose in the story and be forgotten about.\\n\r\nEvery place in Hand Shakers looks generic. As predicted, the show takes place in a big, modern city in Japan. Thanks to this wonderful design choice, everything looks the exact same. Places in the Ziggurat battles are just giant, unmemorable fields in the middle of central. Every location looks the same and has nothing to it. After finishing a episode, you just forget about it anyway.\\n\\n\r\n-Fanservice\\n\\n\r\nNow, I don\u00b4t have anything against fanservice in itself. I mean, I look boobs, I\u00b4m just a simple dude. My problems start, when fanservice is done in a dumb way or is straight-up distracting. The thing with this anime and fanservice is that it puts it in, whenever it can. You know, having a character with tits, bigger than her head, jiggling them around by doing absolutely fucking nothing, that sounds like normal and useful fanservice. Whenever McOppai is on screen, her entire presence can be summarized by two words. That is not how you do fanservice. You don\u00b4t just put it in, because fanservice. That is stupid!\\n\\n\r\nPart 6: The conclusion\\n\\n\r\nAfter summarizing my thoughts about this anime, I feel like I am able to give a conclusion to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFuck Hand Shakers. In my entire lifetime, I have never seen a anime or a show in general, that was so incompetent and couldn\u00b4t do a single thing right in its entire runtime. It is the worst anime that has ever been produced, worse than Akame Ga Kill!, worse than Mars of Destruction, worse than Big Order. Hand Shakers is the final point, that shows that MAL needs to implement a 0/10 rating, because giving it a 1/10 is too much of a compliment for something, that has no redeeming qualities. There is nothing good about this anime. It is truly the biggest of all trainwrecks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thought: Make Anime Great Again",

            "content": "Hey there you filthy weeb! Do you enjoy watching boring fights with absolutely no narrative stakes or tension? Do you like watching completely dull and downright unbearably bland characters with no personality whatsoever? Do you enjoy a completely nonsensical plot that makes no sense and goes nowhere? Well, then, you'll love this amazing show! For just \u00a319.99, you'll get this amazing package sent straight to your door, along with an apology letter from the studio who made such an awful piece of trash and a couple of cyanide pills, just in case, like many people, you feel like vacating this shitty world since you can'teven bear to go on for another moment knowing this atrocious trash exists! Why delay? Order today!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is terrible. Like holy hell is it bad! In every aspect and category this anime falls flat on its face  and there isn't an ounce of talent in this entire production. I would make a comment about it being a terrible light novel adaptation, in the same vein as something like Black Bullet, but this show is completely original! It has no light novel to blame; no manga to trash. The blame for this unholy piece of trash falls solely on the creators at studio GoHands, who, at this point, really need to GoAway (laugh track and applause at my completely funny and original joke). Last year, there were three anime, which I dub as the \"unholy trinity\" that being Divine Gate, Mayoiga and Big Order, but even these shows are nowhere near as bad as Hand Shakers because, at the very least, those shows were entertainingly bad. Hand Shakers is not that. It's like a boxing match that has lasted for thirteen rounds, dealing abuse after abuse to one person who refuses to give up. It's just pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has everything that I dislike in lazy writing and storytelling from the characters to the actual narrative itself. Nothing in the show was handled with any care and it seems the team was more concerned with pretty colours than making something worthwhile. It honestly staggers me that the score for this show if a five out of ten; it deserves much less. The story is about a young, boring man named Tazuna, who has one of the worst catchphrases ever. He constantly repeats the phrase \"It meshes!\" over and over again, and is just so annoying. He says the phrase in response to something that is going his way, or something that doesn't make sense since Tazuna here is someone who is great at fixing stuff...and the anime believes that a quirky personality is enough to make a character, neglecting development and themes. It's laziness at its finest and all of the characters are like this. Anyway, Tazuna becomes something known as a \"hand-shaker\", an ability in which he has to hold hands with a voiceless girl named Koyori, who awakens from a coma after he touches her hand, and after touching hands, they can activate their powers.  After this, they're told that they have to fight against other Hand shakers until one person remains to be granted a wish from God himself...for some reason. They explain that this power is a gift bestowed by God himself but there is no basis for this and instead feels tacked on instead. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's main problem is that there is no investment or intrigue in the narrative at all. The audience has no reason to care for anything that is going on since the show never gave us any reason to care. Who cares if Tazuna gets his wish granted and survives? Who cares what the other hand shakers want to do, or the reason why they fight? Aside from very brief, cliche backstories and exposition, the show hardly delves into why these characters want to fight and it feels disjointed and clunky. Not only that, the show has so much melodrama and all of it is so damn forced. From the very first episode, I knew the entire backstory surrounding the main character and his little sister that when they do try and present it as a twist in the series, later on, there is no effect since this has been replicated so many times before. Call me genre savvy, and perhaps I am, but that is still no excuse for lazy, forced drama and backstories; something that Hand Shakers can't even replicate when it's the most cliche route to go in an anime of this nature. Aside from that, the entire show feels like an empowerment fantasy, with the main character suddenly gaining a bunch of random new powers which he pulls out of his ass to conveniently defeat the enemy, and the show even has incest sub tones with a sister character called Riri, whose tits bounce up and down every time she so much as moves her eyeballs. Every terrible anime has some kind of strange incest vibe going on, made even worse by the lolification of one the of characters who is supposed to be in her twenties but she looks like she is twelve. There's also this stupid gimmick in which the two main characters have to be holding hands constantly, otherwise the girl will die or something, thus they have to sleep together and also bathe together, leading into a lot of moments in which Tazuna feels embarrassed, just for the sake of putting a naked loli into this show somehow. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has so many drawn out friendship speeches in which the main character goes off on tangents about how much he loves Koyori and how much you have to \"mesh\" with your partner, that it comes across as completely cliche, especially for shows of this nature. The final fight in the show was also pretty anti-climatic despite the build-up and despite these characters being hyped up as the strongest in the show, Tazuna defeats them even easier than the previous opponents he fought. The pacing for this show is also pretty bad and moves at such an erratic flip-flop pace that it feels like a chore to watch (aside from all the other things that make this show a chore to watch anyway. One moment they're fighting for an entire episode and the next they spend the entire episode cooking some food in a restaurant. Now, downtime in shows is a good thing, and I wouldn't mind so much if the characters and the pacing weren't so boring!\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but the show has so much cheap shock factor that it feels laughably pathetic. I addressed this also in my Black Bullet review but shock factor is perhaps the cheapest way to make the audience feel sorry for a character who is as interesting as a wall since it requires no effort. Just throw cute, adorable girls on the screen with some hardships and the Otaku will eat that trash up. In terms of the narrative, there isn't a single element, or idea, that I felt was well executed or interesting. Not a single one. And I tried really hard, REAL hard to think of one thing, just ONE thing that this show did right in terms of story, but, try as I might, I failed since there isn't a single thing in the entire narrative that is good. It's a mess and by far, one of the biggest train wrecks I have ever seen before. This show is a masterclass of how NOT to write a show and if you want to get into script writing then this show is highly recommended to get a taste of how not to mess up your story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't fare much better either. Not a single one is interesting in terms of design or personality while receiving minimal development and growth. Hell, half of the characters in the show are completely forgotten about after their introduction and never referred to ever again. Tazuna is your boring typical, self-insert bull for all the ten-year-olds watching this fecale matter and Kayori is mostly loli-bait for all of the filthy weebs. They do attempt to develop her character through a backstory at the end, but this is far too little, far too late and leaves no impact, especially since the story was executed so poorly. The sister and brother character does receive some development but is mostly forgettable but their love feels off-putting and strange. I understand they rely on each other since their parents split up but they seem a little TOO close for my liking. Other characters include the final opponent, who tries to be intimidating but fails, and an idol, who at the very least has a purpose and goal, but she is just as dull as the rest of them. The twenty-year-old loli and her partner are perhaps the only two characters with some kind of development but it's hardly anything, and definitely nothing substantial enough to raise the bar. Each one has got some strange personality or quirk, such as the idol manager who speaks and moves really quickly, but the writers believe that just making a character eccentric is enough to warrant the creation of a three-dimensional character, which is as far away from the truth as possible.\\n\\n\r\nEven just the basics of shot composition and cinematography, this show messes iit up. The camera is constantly pacing around in strange directions with strange and experimental shots, which are more distracting than visually appealing. The Monogatari series also has random and unconventional shots, but in that show, the dialogue between the characters was interesting and always had my interest, and the shot composition matched the strange allure of the show and worked in its favour. Not here, however. The general look of the city makes me want to puke with all of the sparkly silver, which looks mostly computer generated. The character designs have this strange, bright glow to them, which I dislike looking at. When the characters are standing still, there can be some nice looking colour artwork in the background, which I can find somewhat appealing, but when they're in motion, dear God, it's like watching two Barbie dolls fight. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the characters fight, the camera pans around them in strange ways, constantly moving. This makes most of the fights feel so disorientating and confusing to watch since it's hard to gain an understanding of the relative positions of the characters in reference to each other. Combine that with some horrible CGI, makes for not only a terrible script but an awful aesthetic as well. Trust me, if your eyes could puke, they would. The only half decent thing is the music, which is decently composed but is not very memorable. The opening was alright, but it reeks of laziness in the visual department since they don't even bother to try and create new visuals for the show; just splice in some actual scenes from the episodes and call it a day. Who needs effort when people will like this trash anyway?  As previously stated, the show also likes to throw boobs in our faces any chance we get with Riri, and Jesus Christ, these are some of the worst boob physics in anime. Not only do they constantly shoot this character from low angles but every time they bounce, I swear I can feel the Earth shifting on its axis towards the Sun, coming ever closer to that sweet embrace known as death from this shitty show.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, stay away from this show, at all costs. It's so lazy, so mundane and so incoherent that it makes me want to throw up just thinking about it, and I swear this show made me lose about five-hundred brain cells. Anime deserves better than this, and GoHands can GoFuck themselves for producing this asinine piece of garbage, to add on to their other asinine pieces of garbage.",

            "content": "I feel like this anime is getting far less than it actually deserves. Yes, it isn't a great anime, but that doesn't mean it's so horrible to get 1's and 2's so frequently. I guess it might be people's personal grading systems. In my own way of grading, this anime deserves far more than a 1.\r\nThe art is great (in my opinion), but they take it too far that it ruins the framerate. The camera is also being moved around too much. Even a life-action movie doesn't have a camera that spazzes out THIS much. The bad moments are watchable, and the good moments areACTUALLY good. \\n\r\na 7/10 from me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts interesting.  The concept of getting together to gain power is way overused. This anime does exactly the opposite. Staying away from eachother becomes dangerous.\\n\r\nI wish they'd add more to this rather than making it pointless. This concept might aswell be dropped completely because it brings nothing actually important to the story in the end. It could've been something entirely different and it wouldn't have changed anything. I wish they put more meaning into it.\\n\r\n(Honestly, I wish they didn't incorporate generic shounen concepts. I believe it would've been better if it focussed on romance, but whatever, what it COULD've been is of no matter now.)\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a simple pattern: the protagonists meet other couples and fight them, (and for obvious shounen reasons win without any former experience, and if not, survive without any repercussions.)\\n\r\nThus it is easy to predict what's going to happen next. There are no mindblowing plot-twists, there aren't any in the first place.\\n\r\nHowever, it's not like there are any plotholes, rather, there is hardly any plot to begin with, so it isn't really hard to watch (since you won't get frustrated by stupid mistakes), but it's not something you'd want to put effort into watching either. It's bad, but not horrible.   3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character are, and many people will probably disagree with me, original.\\n\r\nBesides the MC, the characters all have something unique that hasn't been used often. \\n\r\nOr maybe it's because I haven't seen over 300 anime to know that it actually HAS been used often?\\n\r\nHowever, in some cases this aspect of them gets overused and seems rather forced. \\n\r\nThere is zero to none character development, but character development is really overrated. There is a reason that there is a term called 'flat character'.\\n\r\nYou shouldn't expect much character development from a 12 episode anime that focusses mostly on action and the connections between people, it doesn't need any! The characters are interesting enough to last for 12 episodes..\\n\r\nOn another note, they're pretty cute as well, so if you're a fan of fluff, there's plenty of it in this anime.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nI like the opening theme and the sound never seemed off to me. I never really paid attention to it but I'd notice if it was bad.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo far I enjoyed watching this anime, but it's not like I'm looking forward to the next episode every week.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's a very meh anime.\\n\r\nIt's not horrible, it's not great. A good pick for people just starting out with watching anime, but not a great watch if you've been spoiled by amazing anime...\\n\r\njust... meh...",

He entered his office and noticed a sheet of paper on his desk.  He recalled his secretary saying that an intern left it for him to consider.\r\nThe director read the sheet in front of him:\r\n\u2013 Title: Hand Shakers\r\n\u2013 Synopsis: In modern times, Tazuna, a young boy who enjoys fixing and learning mechanical equipment, encounters Koyori, a very beautiful mute girl.  Upon this \u2018fated\u2019 encountered, Tazuna and Koyori are immediately paired as Hand Shakers, i.e.partners, chosen by \u2018God\u2019, who can summon magical weapons called Nimrodes.  With this new power, they must fight other Hand Shakers in a world called Ziggurat.  Only one Hand Shaker can win.  And only then can \u2018God\u2019 grant their wish.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, many questions lingered in the his mind, such as \u2018why name the series Hand Shakers\u2019, \u2018why are the magical weapons called Nimrodes\u2019, \u2018what is this place called Ziggurat', \u2018why did God chose the main characters as Hand Shakers', etc.  But, he digressed and assumed everything will answered (P.S: it doesn\u2019t).  Plus, it was an interesting synopsis.\\n\\n\r\nThe committees and production companies approved the new show and, soon, production began.  The director started with the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nHe knew it was simple.  Just hire veteran voice actors, such as Tomokazu Sugita, Yoko Hikasa, Jun Fukuyama, etc, and good musicians, and they will sell the show for you.  Everyone wants great voice actors and music, so it made sense to get the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe director, then, focused on the art, script, and character departments.\\n\\n\r\nHe said, \u201cThose in the art and character departments must follow their director\u2019s orders down to the last detail, and as for the script department\u2026do everything to help the script writer compose a great script.  That\u2019s all.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd with those last remarks, everyone began to hustle to their departments.\\n\r\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\\n\\n\r\n[Brilliant!]\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWe need more artist visuals, while possessing the same art style as \u2018K'!\u201d yelled the art director, looking at the intern.  \u201cDo you have any suggestions?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe intern said, \u201cUh\u2026how about using CGI and photorealism?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe art director thought about it and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea. No, that\u2019s a brilliant idea!  Get a pen and write down everything that I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he replied, getting a pen and notepad from his desk.\\n\\n\r\nThe art director began to speak.  He said, \u201cThings to Include in Hand Shakers.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 A grayish, metallic-looking font will display the opening credits and will roll across the screen in big letters.\\n\r\n\u2013 Things that need to be in cheap CGI: fire, chains, cars, gears, swords, claws, dragons, buildings, some backgrounds like grass and trees, etc\\n\r\n\u2013 Things that need to be photo realistic: buildings and its interiors, the sky, grass, menus, books, paintings, phones, etc.\\n\r\n\u2013 Have regular character animations with fine details and rich in quality, and have them \u2018mesh' with the CGI and photo realistic images.\\n\r\n\u2013 Add some outline traces to emphasis the characters with CGI or photo realistic images.\\n\r\n\u2013 Add tons of color filters.\\n\r\n\u2013 Add lots of random pedestrians moving around, while the camera pans around.\\n\r\n\u2013 Include multiple random still shots of people standing around, or pan the camera to the glorious blue sky.\\n\r\n\u2013 Include many random panning movements towards the sky, the ground, or away from buildings or other objects. \\n\r\n\u2013 Have slow and low frame-rate animations for certain scenes, while the action scenes are fast and inconsistent.\\n\r\n\u2013 \"Boobs have random jiggle movements\u201d.\\n\r\n\u2013 Characters must appear younger than they seem.\\n\r\n\u2013 Have lots of awkward camera movements.\\n\\n\r\nThe intern said, \u201cThis list is perfect!  If we include everything here, then I\u2019m sure the audience will be thoroughly impressed!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art director replied, \u201cI know, it\u2019s absolutely brilliant!\u201d\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[\"Development\"]\\n\\n\r\nThe character director, returning from a meeting, entered his office, and noticed an assistant in the guest chair.  He walked to his desk, sat in the chair across from him, and asked, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAh\u2026yes.  We had just finalized our characters by adding distinct personalities, appearances, and other minor details.  We wanted you to review it, and see if some characters needed some personality or appearance adjustments,\u201d the assistant said, giving the piece of paper to the character director.\\n\\n\r\nHe received it, stared at the characters list on the sheet, and was surprised that there were many in the show.  He viewed the descriptions and appearances for the main characters:\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Tazuna: a generic protagonist, who is kind, caring, and boring.  Likes fixing and learning about mechanical equipment.  Appears like a shotacon.  Nimrod name is Single Gear.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Koyori: a pretty and cute, young girl, who is mute (until episode 9) and expresses very little facial expressions.  Resembles Tazuna\u2019s deceased younger sister.  Clueless, and very helpless, she depends on Tazuna for every little task (until later in the series).\\n\\n\r\nThe character director, then, viewed the remaining characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Break/Bind: first Hand Shaker couple.  Break is an aggressive and dominating male (possible sadist), who uses flame chains as weapons.  Bind is a docile and caring woman (possible masochist), who enhances Break\u2019s chain ability.  Both characters don\u2019t have any character development.  Potential S&M couple.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Makihara: a weird and outgoing \u2018scientist\u2019 and researcher, who likes to make conversation and provide key details about Hand Shakers, Ziggurat, God, and wishes.  Was previously a Hand Shaker.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Tazuna\u2019s Parents: their real names aren\u2019t given in the show.  They have no distinct personality, nor any character development.  They make food, clean the house, and comment on mundane stuff.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Tomoki: a classmate of Tazuna and Riri.  He has blond hair, and has no distinctive personality nor any character growth, other than to ask the main characters for assistances and to comment on his hobbies.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Chizuru/Hayate: second Hand Shaker couple.  Chizuru is a short woman, who appears like an elementary student, despite being the manager of a restaurant.  She has a sharp tongue, yet is caring and nice (possible Tsundere).  Hayate is the subordinate of Chizuru, and the tallest character in the anime.  He has a relaxed and easygoing personality, though sometimes apologetic.  Both work at restaurant called Cocktail Corn.  Their Nimrods are shadows.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Riri (Lily)/Masaru: third Hand Shaker couple.  Riri, who is kind, caring, and very bubbly, is the student council president and the older sister of Masaru.  She is sometimes an air head and whines occasionally.  Masaru is the younger brother of Riri and is in middle school.  He is very protective of his sister and cares deeply about her.  Their Nimrods are cards.  An incest relationship is implied.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Hibiki/Kodama: fourth Hand Shaker couple.  Kodama is a wannabe idol with black pigtails, who likes to spout random quotes.  She has a cheerful and confident personality.  Hibiki, the manager for Kodama, is dedicated by nature and acts very professional.  It\u2019s possible that Hibiki is a Lolicon.  Their Nimrods are swords.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Mayumi/Nagaoka: final Hand Shaker couple.  Mayumi is similar to Koyori (i.e. they are twins).  She is cute and mute.  Nagaoka is socially awkward, and has a hard time making conversation.  They both don\u2019t talk very much.  Both characters don\u2019t have any character development.  Their Nimrods are Cocoons.\\n\\n\r\nThe character director placed the paper down, and said, \u201cI like the character designs and their personalities, but most of these characters don\u2019t have any character development.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s quite unfortunate, but\u2026you can\u2019t have character development if you never had a set of personalities to begin with.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWait, are you implying that most of these characters never had a personality to begin with?\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWell, yeah.  Because, if they did the viewer wouldn\u2019t be able to relate to them.  Having a complex character would only confuse and frustrate the viewer.  This is a simple show, and simple shows need simple and relatable characters.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026,\u201d the character director said, making a perplex expression.  \u201cOn a side note, there are quite a number of archetypes in this show.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThat is true, but it\u2019s expected.  I mean, we have the typical archetypes like the non-developed main characters, the useless classmate and parents, the tsundere, the idol, and the incest siblings.  All of these archetypes make the show more enjoyable.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI see\u2026,\u201d  the character director said, thinking whether to adjust the characters or not.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, he shrugged, and said, \u201cAfter thinking about what you said, it seems all the characters are fine.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe assistant thanked the director and left the office, while the director smiled knowing that the show will succeed.\\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Filler Content]\\n\\n\r\nA box of DVDs given to him by the producer.  A deadline approaching in one month.  An incomplete script.  The script write knew the deadline was coming, but he ran out of ideas.  He asked the producer for some advice, instead he received a box of DVDs and was told to watch them.  He did as he was told.\\n\\n\r\nThe script writer was becoming weary, but after several days, he finally finished the last DVD.  He noticed that every show he watched had two things in common: filler content and a simple structure.\\n\\n\r\nHe realized he needed those elements.  With his mind full of ideas, he began to write.  He wrote the script for Episode 3, then 4, then 5, and so on.  Satisfied with his work, he handed it to the producer to review.\\n\\n\r\nThe script writer said, \u201cThe DVDs helped a lot.  I realized that I needed more filler content, and a simple structure.  The structure being: fight episode, then slice of life stuff introducing the next Hand Shakers, then fight episode, then slice of life stuff introducing the next Hand Shakers, and so on.  It\u2019s simple and predictable.  And that\u2019s what the audience is looking for.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe producer read the script and asked, \u201cSo Tazuna always wins?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d the script writer said.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAnd there will always be a slice of life stuff like boring, meaningless conversations, and cliche events that add no character development?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\"And there is barely any plot development?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYeah.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d the producer said, looking at the script again.  \u201cOkay.  I approve this script.  It\u2019s simple and effective.  Just what we needed.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe script writer smiled, knowing that his work is finally being recognized as great.\\n\r\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\\n\\n\r\nThe director reviewed the works from the three departments.  After a few minutes, he glanced at the producer, then the two directors, then back down at their works.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cGentleman, I have looked over each of your works, and I have to say\u2026you guys did a damn fine job!\u201d the director said, smiling.  \u201cIt has everything.  Great art style with distinctly new visuals, great sound design, a simple and \u2018coherent\u2019 story, and engaging characters.  And the best part is\u2026we have a high budget, so we can render those new visuals both in photorealism and CGI.  It\u2019s going to look amazing.  It\u2019s going to sound amazing.  Hell, this show will probably be contender for best anime of the year!  I can feel it.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe director thanked the producer and the two other directors for their hard work.  He dismissed them, and they left his office room, until only he remained.  Getting up from his seat, he went to the window, gazed at the blue and white sky, and hoped what he had said would come true.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that it did.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter the show\u2019s season had ended, people around the world praised it and hailed it as an artistic breakthrough in animation visuals and plot.  Studios began incorporating CGI and photorealism in every frame and slide, and moreover, made their plots simple by adding more filler content and useless dialogue.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, ends the tale of Hand Shakers, and how it became the Best Anime of the Year!\\n\\n\r\nThe End",

            "content": "In 2010, Cartoon Network greenlit a show called \"The Problem Solverz\". It attempted to compensate for its boring/obnoxious characters, choppy movement and horribly inconsistent writing by having bright, flashing, seizure inducing visuals and a high concept that was made to disguise the fact that the story in actuality went nowhere. It was hated by everyone pretty much immediately and taken off the air very quickly.\r\nIt seems history repeats itself. \r\nAs an attempt by Japanese Studio GoHands (best known for the painfully average K Project), they created Hand Shakers for the Winter 2017 anime season. It attempted to compensate for its boring/obnoxious characters, choppy movement andhorribly inconsistent writing by having bright, flashing, seizure inducing visuals and a high concept that was made to disguise the fact that the story in actuality went nowhere. This time however, it manages to set the bar so low, that it could possibly be the worst anime series to be released in this entire decade.\\n\\n\r\nThe first aspect any keen viewer will be able to notice is the art and animation. It fails in so, so many ways, and it only gets worse the further into the show's trench you go. Every color is made out to be as bright as possible, like the entire show was waxed with a car bumper. Color contrast doesn't exist, shadowing to make darker moments serious doesn't exist, nor any common sense on the production team. Actual color placement can be impossible to see. Like, whose idea was it to give a character with white hair the palest face and body imaginable? Distinguishing body details? A thing of the past and the future is Hand Shakers! Then there's the movement. The first episode has CGI chains moving like CGI that in no way fits with flat character models, and everywhere else has CGI backgrounds that our flat (both figuratively and literally) characters literally SLIDE through instead of being animated. If something is animated, expect it to move at like, 15 frames per second. In some cases stylistic artwork can compensate for lack of movement, but not here, when they try to make the backgrounds look as realistic as possible with flat characters models lazily pasted on. Or with an aquarium CGI effect that comes off as nothing but disorienting. ESPECIALLY in the OP. The show gets your eyes's attention, but not in any pleasant way.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode, you see how overeager the director is to tilt, and pan and zoom the camera all over the place. He wants to make a style, but combined with the overly bright and shiny color palette, it only results in the audience wanting to head to the nearest sink to puke. Even an emotional scene isn't free of the distracting camera tilts. A scene involving an idol character is shot to never actually show her lips while singing. It makes an already terrible looking show come off as outright nauseating.\\n\\n\r\nAll this and I haven't even discussed the frustrating dearth of plot yet! Similar to how K Project attempted to cash in on the Durarara craze two years late, Hand Shakers wants to cash in on the popular survival game craze (Deadman Wonderland, Mirai Nikki, Fate/Zero, Btooom) over five years late.  A game called the \"Ziggurat\" causes pairs of people known as Hand Shakers to challenge each other with the hopes of meeting God and making their wishes come true....:.and that's it. No more plot than that! Character relationships exist but until the 11th episode's massive plot reveal, don't mean jack crap. Most episodes exist for two purposes, make a fight scene or have an overly long, boring string of filler and exposition back to back to reintroduce us to characters we saw two episodes ago. It's like every time they add a new Hand Shakers they have to remind us characters exist! As far as the games themselves go, you'll find more logical rules in No Game No Life, a show which did a lot of this stuff right but had problems when it came to making its rules consistent. There's no real specific setup for any fight and when there is setup, it's handled in the laziest, most last minute way possible. The fight between the protagonists against President Big Boobs and Card Kid is a shining example of how NOT to establish a fight scene. It's somehow made worse later by an exclamation that might've made the two episode long fight obsolete entirely! \\n\r\nSee my colleague CodeBlazeFate's review for more on why the Ziggurat game is COMPLETE bullcrap, but there's issues outside of just that.\\n\\n\r\nJust about every single fight scene takes place in the wide open streets of their city, and yet somehow, aside from the people directly fighting, literally NO ONE ELSE notices the massive fight going on. It's not like Yu Gi Oh where fights take place in a separate dimension, all of them are in the REAL WORLD, and no one does anything to interrupt a fight. Or even peek out a window. It makes the scenes look more empty than the Market City in FoodFight. And you NEVER want to be compared to that horrific disaster. Even Mirai Nikki, terrible as it was, crafted its survival game in specific spots so that it would go unnoticed by the public, or even possibly reported as news enough to get cops on the case. Hand Shakers is so one tracked that this isn't even possible.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with all of the time devoted to either fight scenes that lack much in purpose or at least 3-4 completely pointless filler episodes in 12 episodes, how does the show resolve? [b]HORRIBLY![/b] Not only are the final revelations about backstory completely rushed and out of nowhere in the penultimate episode, but the final one ends with instant redemption and an FU teaser. Even if you wanted some reward for the heroes for all the crap you've waded through, too bad! Nothing to see here. I thought it was problematic when Angel Beats rushed its final revelations and padded itself with filler  but that is NOTHING compared to this unfulfilling slog with no ounce of heart or good animation that show contained. What you're left with is dead air with no payoff whatsoever, the worst kind of writing I haven't seen since Gunslinger Stratos The Animation.\\n\\n\r\nEven the sound mixing is totally bunk. Little to no music exists in the non-action scenes, and when it appears in action, it's often soft piano pieces or the joyful music type you'd see in a Spyro game. It works in that context but the lack of actual ACTION music removes all tension that could be in the fights to make them EVEN MORE boring. The final episode uses a vocal theme sound in dubstep, WHILE whispering, so it's impossible to even hear the song. Oh, and the OP and ED are completely generic. Nothing to say here except, the sound designer was probably as high as everyone else when crafting this show, its world and its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters....oh boy. Much like The Problem Solverz, the cast is either entirely bland or annoyingly obnoxious, with incredibly phoned-in performances. Starting with our main character Tazuma, we find out from the first episode that he's a schoolboy who's a really good mechanic for his age. And that's it. Throughout the entire series, the main character remains just an ordinary schoolboy who wouldn't look out of place in a toy commercial show, only with a sister to hold hands with. Hell, he honestly gets WORSE because the mechanic trait is pretty much entirely dropped when he gets involved in the game, save for having a plot device clock weapon. Meaning his character got worse for not doing one of two possible things. \\n\\n\r\nHis \"sister\" Koyori is even worse. For most of the show she remains silent, possibly so the audience can bask in how cute she is. Unfortunately that's all to her. Any chemistry she has with Tazuma feels off-putting, and unlike say, Gangsta, her lack of speaking isn't circumventing in any way when put in a scene. Besides, of course, talking later. Don't worry, nothing comes of it and speaking gives her even LESS personality.\\n\\n\r\nEvery enemy pair can be summed up in just a few words a piece for how little character you get. There's hardcore biker & bondage masochist, Tsundere & Baka, Idol & Star Wars kid with choppier animation than usual, scientist twin & sister twin and last but not least President Big Boobs Chan and Card junkie.\\n\\n\r\n These last two are special because this show tries to tackle a serious topic with them. You see, President Big Boobs chan has a massive, massive obsessive crush on her little brother. Related brother. Her wish when appearing towards God is basically to be with him forever. Despite them....fighting together, holding hands to win the incredibly vague crown? The incest soon becomes her only character trait, she constantly obsesses over her little brother and the show barely resolves this. It's pushed so so much and never seen as directly wrong in any way that it gives ANY other incest-related anime look better by comparison. Not freaking kidding. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, there's the scientist guy. Basically GoHands's attempt at one of my personal favorite characters Okabe Rintarou. He's quirky, is keen on giving exposition, acts weird when there's barely anything to hide besides history with another scientist, and appears as a mentor to the main character Tazuma. There's nothing more to him than that though I suppose those few character traits make him the best character by default. Still doesn't do ANYTHING for the plot besides introducing the main idea\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, if you're a character in this show, you either are one note, become worse than one note, or barely do anything for the plot. At the end of the day you're left with a horrible cast that brings nothing new to the table, barely contribute, and make this  miserable excuse for a show into flat out irredeemable annoyance and boredom.  \\n\\n\r\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\n\r\nThe final episode is called Shake the Hands, which is exactly what I felt like doing to the makers of this series. With extra shocking joy buzzers to whoever thought this was a competent finished product. I'm sorry but this show was just flat out asinine in every way. Awful animation, awful directing, awful writing, awfully bad music choices, awful characters and most of all some of the worst art directing you'll ever see. Unless you want your eyes to suffer, STAY the HELL away from Hand Shakers. \\n",

I thought I'd do something a little different in this review, and start off with a few haikus that accurately illustrate Hand Shaker\u2019s impact on my well being and emotions.\r\nMy eyes are bleeding\r\nMaybe possessed by demons?\r\nNo, just Hand Shakers\r\nIf a bus hit me\r\nI would be a vegetable\r\nAt least no more pain\r\nHand Shakers is like\r\nCancer was personified\r\nAnd is your roommate \r\nThere you have it. Sometimes an anime comes along and creates so much buzz amongst the community that you can't help but check it out. The phrase, \u201chowbad can it be?\u201d constantly surfaced from my vocabulary prior to watching Hand Shakers, and after 12 episodes I can say with confidence that I survived the impossible. It goes far beyond the \u201cso bad it's good\u201d realm and into the \u201cso bad it\u2019s a precursor to suicide\u201d side. This is truly the worst series I have ever watched, and it isn't even close.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers at Studio GoHands (K) have a hard on for sadism. It's as though their anime pitch went something like, \u201cI\u2019ve got this great fucking idea about people that hold hands to randomly use badass weapons, and there\u2019s some unfappable fan service in there too\u201d. And to think that some masochistic prick actually gave it the green light. Hand Shakers is the result of no one having a single fuck left to give when it came time to write a show up for the season. On top of it, they had the nerve to tarnish the legacy of my favorite gaming franchise, Mega Man, with the synopsis\u2026. \u201cIn the year 20XX\u2026\u201d Are you fucking kidding me? It's not paying homage, it's like putting dog poo in a paper bag and lighting it on fire on Keiji Inafune\u2019s doorstep.\\n\\n\r\nIf someone told me that by holding hands with a complete stranger could cause me to harness the power of something called \u201cnimrodes\u201d, and make everyone in the world want to blow my ass to smithereens\u2026 well I would've let that bitch die in a heartbeat. Who comes up with these names? Nimrodes is one letter away from effectively summarizing the personality of everyone on Hand Shakers staffing bill. And what takes the cake is that they're trying to fight against God himself. As if holding hands with a coma-struck lolli is going to get you further with that insurmountable task. The plot is nothing short of atrocious. A monkey obediently pointing at objects on a screen could piece together a more coherent storyline than this.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the story unfolds into an even bigger, chaotic mess. Tazuna and Koyori, our hand shaker extraordinaires, go from dueling a fucked up bondage couple to some kids that love card games, making light of the fact they're attempting to overthrow the man upstairs the whole time. Hand Shakers fails at almost every turn to impress, and it isn't even the slightest bit believable within its own inconsistent jargon. It's reminiscent of watching a homeless drunkard trail off in one of his timeless tales, only to end up wetting himself in front of you and forgetting who he was. Nothing seems to follow in a digestible plot line, and believe me, I tried to look for something\u2026 anything that could salvage this anime. It just isn't there.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing, as expected, is nothing short of a disaster. The dialogue reminds me of watching two middle schoolers arguing over a Yugioh card battle. The lines \u201cYou'll never defeat me!\u201d and \u201cI'll get you next time!\u201d were just some of the Pulitzer Prize-winning excerpts from the anime\u2019s script. The comedy is as humorous as oral surgery, only without the laughing gas to put you under. It almost comes across as unintentionally deadpan, an inscrutable attempt at making us laugh. Originality was left at the door, as all your basic tropes are present: the cute lolli damsel in distress, the awkward Chibi main protagonist and tons of stereotypical side characters with as much development as Koyori\u2019s chest. And the fanservice\u2026 oh the fanservice. It's definitely there, but the manner in which it's presented (i.e., through its choppy visuals) made me want to chop my dick off. Most generic anime often rely on cheap fanservice to grab as many views as possible, but in Hand Shakers\u2019 case, I think it does more harm than good.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of us who've experimented with LSD or various types of acid/shrooms, the visuals in Hand Shakers can be summed up as a bad trip. I was intrigued by the \u201cunique\u201d art style for all of two minutes, until I realized I wasn't watching a PS2 cutscene. I assumed anime in 2017 had at least some minimum standard or acceptability criteria for animation, in which Hand Shakers would clearly fail the quality assurance inspection. It's like watching someone play a video game with continuous lag. The main character models are creepy as hell, providing an ominous juxtaposition to the childish demeanor Koyori and Tazuna exhibit throughout the series. The environments are rather plain, which only cause the jutting visuals to stand out even more. I thought when I saw how nauseating the chain scenes were in the first episode, things could only get better\u2026 but I was sadly mistaken as I began to trudge through the series, growing more weary with each passing second.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sea of the ghastly and unacceptable, I'd have to say the sound in Hand Shakers, though uninspiring by itself, was the only decent aspect of the anime. The sound effects were believable and the voice acting showed some promise, most specifically with Ai Kayano\u2019s role of Riri. The OP was quite lackluster, as the anime world seems to shovel these JPop titles out ad nauseum. Vibrant yet generic colors stifle your senses as the cliched vocals pierce your eardrums. Same old, same old. The ED was possibly my favorite track of all, the only saving grace for a monotonous soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I did it. I cannot stress enough the level of effort on my part to actually make it through a series of this \u201cquality\u201d without dropping it. This may be something used for torture viewing in the future (right up there with Baby Geniuses 2), and I applaud my fellow reviewers for sticking it out the whole length of the show with me. If I could compare it to anything, it would be Mars of Destruction\u2026 only not funny. I recommend this to absolutely no one, and as you can see by my overall reaction, neither should you. Hand Shakers should be taken down from every streaming site on the internet, and every hard copy buried in the desert (much like ET on the Atari 2600). Lock it up and throw away the proverbial key.

            "content": "So I watched Hand Shakers because I heard it's the worst thing ever. Of course, this same thing is being declared about every series ever by people who have not seen every series ever. For this reason I approached it with the same skepticism I approach the \"best series ever\" claims. And once again the exaggeration was real, and Hand Shakers was more or less like the \"best series ever\". \r\nSure this series doesn't have many good things in it. It has lots of bad, but none of the bad in it impressed me in any way. It's not advanced awfulness, terribad clusterfuckery, not evennauseating shit. In fact, it just offers a mediocre view on bad. Series such as Code Geass and Clannad did an impressive job building all the depth and factors that made these series garbage in almost every possible way. Hand Shakers seems more like a parody of those. Instead of offering its own unique take on unwatchable trash, it rather seems to be made for ironic viewing without any seriousness \\n\\n\r\nOne important thing to note about this series is how it challenges the viewer's intelligent. The concept of holding hands is a direct middle finger towards all those \"deep\" and complex anime series where instead of the characters holding each others hands - the anime itself is holding the viewer's hand. This one doesn't do it. It couldn't care less if you fucking like it or not. This series is also a reverse-ripoff of Franxx with more subtle. I can totally dig into that. #not a pun\\n\\n\r\nFor a borderline softcore hentai, Hand Shakers does quite an impressive job with the boob wiggles and tentacle-like chain movements. The scenery is colorful, detailed, and the animation is nearly as glorious as in series like Kemono Friends, Houseki no Kuni, and Kingdom season 01, so it passes. The story on the other hand is definitely better written than Code Geass R2, and I highly enjoyed it despite it being a mixture of vomit and piss, so I can't complain.",

There is some promise within the general idea behind it and the two main characters, but the barfy animation, nausea-inducing perspective and laughably bad CGI already tells you that you're in for some bad time, straight from the first few minutes of the first episode. The randomly-inserted fanservice and absurd BDSM themes also stand as a clear warning of what's to come. \r\nWhat's maybe most laughable here is the unironic use of all the most annoying anime tropes. We have brother/sister incest, a 30-years old lolilooking like a primary schooler, a Japanese idol whose dance animation felt as if they were ripped straight out of Stephen King's \"It\". We have nonsense, cryptic intrigue using random historical/mythological words, absurd motivations for the villain... It is, essentially, a kind of \"everything we don't like about anime\" compilation or a guide on how not to make a decent series.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's outlandish enough to have a bit of the \"so bad it's good\" quality.

Don't get this wrong, I really like the colorful and splashing animation style, but the CGI style doesn't match the anime at all and makes me feel really uncomfortable.\r\nThis feeling lead me to the \"poor\" plot( of the first 4 episodes).

I have to say that the music did a great job as supporter and makes the action scenes really enjoyable to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important point to talk about are the character designs and development. To be honest; The Animation style of the main characters is beautiful, but the personalities itself are unappealing and \"lame\", there isn't any development so far, but I'm hoping for a worth seeing rise in the following episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end \"Hand Shakers\" may become an enjoyable show, which focus lies on the beautiful animation. The CGI style is still  a disrupting factor, but if you try to focalize on the animation it doesn't matter at all.

Creating original anime has the crippling fault of being the source in existence, meaning, if the anime doesn't fulfill everything it needs to do in order to complete a story by its own merits, it can and will fail stupendously.  So, with a name as ridiculous as 'Hand Shakers', it's not hard to see how GoHand's (how fitting) original show flopped so hard.\r\nStory:  Takatsuki Tazuna is a boy in high school who acts as a handyman to anyone who needs help.  Any device that's broken, he can fix in a jiffy.  One day, while arriving in a placeto help someone named Makihara on a job, he finds a sleeping bedridden girl who's hooked up to life support.  Reaching down to grab her hand, the girl suddenly awakens and the two are then thrusted into a battle with a weird S/M couple without any word or warning.  \\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers according to the show, are a pair of individuals who 'charge' their power by holding hands.  When two pairs of Hand Shakers are within a 1 km radius within each other, the two pairs are forced into battle in a place known as the 'Ziggurat', where they use powers and weapons known as 'Nimrods' to fight each other.  The pair who wins gets to keep being Hand Shakers while the pair who lost loses their power entirely and are out of the game.  It's said that the last remaining pair of Hand Shakers will be able to meet God and fulfill whatever wish that the pair so desires.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite having a tournament style plot that to some extent, has potential, the idea of having holding hands be a key aspect of the whole series is personally, a laughable way of trying to be unique.  Though it may be ridiculous, that is not the thing that makes this show a laughingstock and a crying shame.  The biggest problem with Hand Shakers is the overindulgence of style over substance.  The show primarily focuses on our two main characters fighting various pairs of Hand Shakers (5 to be exact) and inching their way closer to meeting/challenging god in order to fulfill their wish.  The problem is, the two don't really have a wish.  In fact, our pair of protagonists only have any form of motivation to continue forward once more than half of the episodes are over.  As such, the story is stuck in this loop of characters just dealing with problems as they go along without any character motivation moving them along aside from just getting to the end.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature of how the Hand Shakers work, each pair has their own reason for fighting.  The problem is, the show reveals the motivations for each pair so late in each respective mini-arc that by the time it's over and done, there's no reason to care for them.  In fact, the show doesn't even give you a hint as to what each respective pairs' problems are until after their defeated, then dump all of the info via backstory and monologue onto you expecting to care for them after they've been defeated and their struggle no longer matters in the series.  This kind of writing is what kills the series, and it persists through every pair of opponents that our main characters meet.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as positives go, Episode 11 stands as the series's high point.  The episode gives us much needed backstory to the whole situation of the series, and actually gives the audience a reason to care about what's going on.  But yet again, the flaw of \"too little, too late\" rears its ugly head, as by the time the show makes it to this point, the audience has little reason to give a damn because everything thus far has gone so picture perfect and the end result is extremely predictable.  The ending also has a confusing set of circumstances that honestly don't even make any sense.  I feel like GoHands just threw whatever they wanted at the end because the ending does not make any sense at all.  There's no definitive conclusion, there're things in there that were never shown before, and we don't even get to meet God.  You bastards.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hand Shakers' story is an example of wasted potential, as the idea of reaching God had a variety of directions that the show could go.  But because Hand Shakers was too focused on style over substance, the story became a bland piece of work that only served to move the characters from one fight to another.  The show doesn't try to do anything new, and the characters all having skin-deep motivations gave the audience no reason to care for anything in this show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Episode 11 arguably the best episode (though that's not saying much)\\n\r\n- Show gives no reason to care about anything\\n\r\n- Style over substance\\n\r\n- Forced character motivations\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As the show gives almost no reason to care about the characters and their stories, the cast is filled with characters that in sense, feel like either they don't want to be there, or that do only care to do so for about an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nTakatsuki Tazuna is the main protagonist in Hand Shakers, and his character is about as colorful as the white his hair becomes when he's fighting.  It's difficult to describe his character because Tazuna virtually doesn't have a personality to call his own.  The show makes it feel like the only thing he's good for is protecting the girl he finds named Koyori.  When he does finally get some semblance of reason to fight in the series, the end reason becomes \"We're together\", which is one of the laziest reasons to ever tack onto a character.  If you separate him from his little girlfriend, there's almost nothing to say about him.  \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Akutagawa Koyori, Hand Shakers's little doll.  As expected of the partner of our bland protagonist, Koyori does...actually nothing.  The majority of the series has her be this stiff, emotionless figure that only at the end, does something useful.  In cases like these, the caretaker (Tazuna) is supposed to make up for the character that does nothing (Koyori) by fulfilling a both roles and making up for both of them by having character traits and a personality that can encompass both of them so they don't feel like a hindrance to the overall story.  But when your protagonists both have nothing to them, the end result ends up becoming nothing as well.  (0 + 0 doesn't equal anything other than 0)  I don't blame Koyori for having nothing to do with the story, as it makes sense in the show's context, but her being a natural hindrance while her partner is an unintentional failure in the same sense of contributing nothing only furthers why the story's content is bad.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the rest of the cast, made entirely up of other Hand Shakers that our pair of protagonists encounter (and one tutorial guy who basically does all of the info dumping).  As mentioned before, all of these Hand Shakers have forced character motivations that are only told at the end of their arc, which by then, we have no reason to care for them because it's already painfully obvious what's going to happen if the first two episodes are any indication.  Not only that, but each pair has their own unique dynamic which seems to be the only character trait they have.  This 'character trait' of theirs gets repeated over and over and over and over again throughout each of their arcs, and persists even after their time in the spotlight is over.  This gave me less of a reason to give a damn about them because their repeated behaviors irritated me to the point of not caring even more than I already didn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n- Bland main protagonists\\n\r\n- Annoying and equally bland side characters\\n\\n\r\nArt: Despite how poorly GoHands managed to screw up on Hand Shaker's story and characters, thankfully, the concept of 'style over substance' was consistent throughout all parts of the show.  Made with a strange combination of CG done in a handdrawn artstyle, Hand Shakers bears a unique style where everything is fluid like handdrawn animation, yet is done in a way that can only be executed by computer graphics.  This artstyle has its ups and downs, but largely gives the series a very unique look.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is split into two different aspects.  Fights, and normal everyday scenes.  For both of these styles, the colors that're used are blindingly bright to the point that it becomes a little hard to discern colors, yet still plays to the series's strengths.  The everyday scenes are detailed and actually quite nice to look at, though these scenes are the less intensive parts of the show.  The actual kicker to all of this are the fight scenes.  Due to the nature of devoting almost solely on computer graphics, the show has a lot of effects during the battle, a great deal of fluidity, and manages to use its bright and vibrant artstyle to its advantage to make everything look like a moving palette.  The problem is, the fights are a little too fluid sometimes.  During fights, the show likes to use a variety of nauseating camera angles while the characters are moving which make it both hard for the audience to see and understand what's going on.  I personally felt a little sick watching my screen with some of the fights with just how much was going on.  Despite that, the art is still a genuinely good aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Aesthetically pleasing\\n\r\n+ Managed to make CG look good\\n\r\n+/- Bright colors (sometimes too bright)\\n\r\n+/- Fluid fight scenes (Warning: May cause nausea)\\n\\n\r\nSound: In terms of sound, Hand Shakers also has a surprisingly good OST.  \"One Hand Message\", its opening, has an energetic rock beat that, while isn't the most memorable song to exist, has positive merits that compliment the wild action that the show exhibits.  Its \"Yume Miru Ame\" on the other hand is a more somber piece that personally I wasn't a fan of.  The notes are far too screechy for a supposedly somber piece, and I couldn't stand listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, Hand Shakers also has a notable array of BGM that's worth noting.  Battle music like \"Dust Trail\", more emotional pieces like \"Aism\", and others utilize a lot of piano and synthesized piano to create music that not only fits with the show, but puts weight on the fight scenes and other moments that they're used in.  They give the illusion that the characters are actually doing something meaningful, and while they may not have been too effective as I still didn't care for anyone by the end, these tracks are genuinely good and actually nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great tracks\\n\r\n-  ED is less than stellar\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: I went into Hand Shakers not knowing what to expect.  Sure the title was ridiculous, but I've watched more ridiculous things before.  But when I started, I realized that this show was going to end up being a mistake.  By the end, I just did not care.  Hand Shakers was so devoid of meaningful content or anything for me to give a damn.  It's not bad enough for me to loathe this show and spit on it for everything that it stands for, but the show gave me so little reason to care about ANYTHING that was happening on-screen that the overall experience just felt like a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI actually really like some of the Nimrod designs; especially the intricacy of Tazuna's gear sword.  The use of CG was well done and gave the show a layer of detail that I greatly appreciated.  The show's aesthetics and soundtrack are by far the best parts of the show and create a good amount of nice-looking still images and nice music to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I was truly irritated by was the character 'quirks'.  Each of the Hand Shakers have their own quirk (be it fawning over your younger brother, yes that's in here, or reciting off quotes of famous people like you're a goddamn scholar every other line) that made me care about them even less than I already did.  Not only that, but the show repeats these various quirks, and it gets quite annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is honestly not worth your time.  Despite its good art and decent soundtrack, the lack of story and proper characters makes this show an experience not worth having.  If anything, I'd suggest just googling images of Hand Shakers so you can appreciate GoHands's work on the show's look, and finding the tracks of the show so you can listen to how good the music is.  Beyond that, Hand Shakers isn't worth the investment.",

This show has nauseating graphics and camera effects with badly integrated 3D (coming from a guy who enjoyed the new season of Berserk so it's not the concept I don't like), the characters are empty, the story makes no sense and I would fear that a newcomer watching this show as a first anime because the opening looks fine and the synopsis sounds cool would then be discouraged to watch any more. \r\nIf the concept presented by this anime interested you, I would recommend No Game No Life, that hasa similar concept but that was realized way better, and if it was an example of fluid graphics and cool visual effects that got you wanting to try this, please first consider both seasons of Zestiria the X for the VFX or Berserk (2016) for the 3D. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the music/sound, pretty much the only part of this show that is decent, I would still recommend Hunter X Hunter over this, or alternatively Kill la Kill if HxH seems like too long of a time investment for you. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this comment helped at least one person avoid this show, or at least make them realize that this isn't what anime is about and that there is way better out there. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, for anyone watching this of their own will and enjoying this anime, good for you. Seriously, there is nothing wrong with liking any anime, regardless of its objective value, anything you enjoy watching is what you should be watching. However, I would like you to consider the points I made earlier about newcomers before giving this a high note or complaining about bad reviews. It's ok to disagree with the majority, but this kind of site has reviews to help people who can't decide whether to watch the show or not and I think that there are enough shows out there for you to find better than this whatever your tastes are.",

            "content": "Let us shake hands\u2026 with the future. The future of anime, and the future of society.\r\nFriends, welcome. On the third season, The Order has risen once again to free us from our eternal struggle. In an industry that rarely takes risks, Hand Shakers stands above all others to become the most daring, most challenging, and most breathtaking anime ever created.\r\nWhen Gen Urobuchi broke out in the 90\u2019s with the release of Neon Genesis Evangeliation, the anime community was both equally fascinated and outraged at its unique story and characters. Hand Shakers pushes the envelope much further, challenging the community, the industry, and the entire world.\r\nThemere concept of Hand Shakers is the most gruesome, most outrageous, most difficult scenario of all time: A young boy must constantly hold hands with a girl who looks to be half his age. SCANDALOUS! \\n\\n\r\nSex is often a highly taboo and controversial subject. Today, society holds intense debates over the censorship of breasts and buttocks and shoulder blades day in and day out. Hand Shakers puts the most graphic and intimate of sexual actions, hand holding, on full display for the world to gaze their nervous eyes upon. And with a minor, no less! Indeed, the young Inori Yuzuriha, despite her young appearance, is at the forefront of this gratifying imagery. I\u2019m actually amazed she wasn\u2019t impregnated at any point, given that she and Tarzan held hands for almost every minute of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOh, but don\u2019t think that\u2019s all. Hand Shakers brings about many more dazzling images of sexuality. In fact, the entire anime is a commentary about different sexual tendencies that are widely controversial, but it irrefutably proves how they are beneficial to our society and should be more widely accepted. Let\u2019s look in detail about each pair of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe first pair of Hand Shakers (the names granted to these brave warriors) are none other than the studio Silver Link, as the acts of bondage portrayed are a callback to the greatest Twilight movie of all time, Fifty Shades of Gray. As silver is a shade of gray and chains are also known as links, it was a cleverly well-placed casting by Mr. GoHands. Furthermore, the actors representing these characters are both high-level veterans respected by many peers and fans alike, showing how serious this anime is on its views. People might look at bondage with fear and disgust, as it does look rather intimidating on the surface. However, as this anime pleasantly shows, pain can also bring about pleasure when delivered properly, and both characters in this couple take great delight in this act. They set a great example for BDSM relationships and should be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe second pair is where Hand Shakers announces its strongest, most passionate stance on the legalization of pedophilia. This couple is nothing more than a grown man with a young girl. Although I disagree with the anime\u2019s opinion, I must respect that it is very brave of them to portray this kind of sexual relationship, especially one as realistic as it is. The young girl often remarks about how mature and grown-up she is because she\u2019s a Hand Shaker; she has a life partner and a good job and even dresses in a professional manner. But this setup often comes off as a joke to people because they don\u2019t take it seriously. It\u2019s unfortunate that the clear message of children being capable of acting as mature and responsible individuals has fallen on deaf ears, but once again I respect Hand Shakers for not only addressing this issue, but tying in the response to its controversial nature into the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe third pair of Hand Shakers represent another highly controversial and heavily debated topic: incest. This pair is with a brother and a sister, the sister designed with a luscious, curvy body to entice viewers and persuade them to join this movement to decriminalize sex between family members. After all, incest is wincest. This relationship is even sponsored by the popular trading card game, Weiss Schwartz, further proving that even big names are willing to make a much-needed change to our society. It also helps that this is the most realistic, mature, and down-to-earth pair of characters since the brother and sister of the hit 2016 anime, Big Order. But again, the community is too immature to see these characters for who they really are. Instead, they want to complain about completely trivial matters, such as the sister\u2019s breasts moving \u201cunnaturally\u201d, as if they haven\u2019t seem someone\u2019s chest wobble like it\u2019s getting sucked into a fucking tornado whenever they listen to twenty one pilots on their iPhones. You\u2019re all dumbasses. \\n\\n\r\n...whoops, pardon my language. I am only frustrated. I just want to tell the world how incredible this anime is, and all of the themes it represents. Anyway, let\u2019s move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth pair of Hand Shakers is actually rather difficult to figure out, as the themes are just too complex for the average person to understand. Fortunately, having seen over 20 animes, I am of superior intelligence, which is why I\u2019m presenting this post to counteract the negativity surrounding this amazing title, and it is my duty to decipher it.\\n\\n\r\nHere we have an older, unattractive man holding hands with a young woman who happens to be an aspiring idol. Instead of focusing on one theme, I believe this pair represents many ideas. First, the appearance of the man contrasting with the beautiful idol girl signify that even the most unassuming of people can find the partner that is right for them, or that appearance has no factor in love. It could merely be a good representation of two people not sexually attracted to one another, but are willing to hold hands because they see something in them that can\u2019t be seen in their physical appearance. Number second, this relationship is particularly business-like, as the older man represents the idol as her manager. It shows how sex can tie into the workplace and be beneficial for at least one of them, and that\u2019s all that matters. Furthermore, the mainstream pop industry has been notorious for displaying many singers and performers in a sexual manner, such as Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, and Death Grips. However, the idol industry in Japan is much more repressed, which makes this relationship in Hand Shakers a very big deal. We must join hands and break these invisible walls that bound society in its currently soulless state. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the last pair of Hand Shakers is the most fascinating, but be warned, this is a spoiler. \\n\\n\r\nThis final pair is none other than a copy of our main characters, Tarzan and Inori. Granted, the two people are different, and only the girl looks similar to Inori, but the theme of this relationship is the same. It\u2019s also portraying ephebophilia, which is very different from pedophilia, and the confusion of these terms has caused many problems in our society. For further information, please see the thoughtful analytical piece of B Kata H Kei by Mumkey Jones. \\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t spoken about the main pair of Hand Shakers, because it all speaks for itself. The two meet each other and start holding hands for fun, but they do it so often that they become inseparable lovers, proving that sex is a truly beautiful thing that brings friends and family together and makes the world a better place. It\u2019s a touching and emotional narrative that squeezed many tears from my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIn Hand Shakers, the intimate act of hand holding grants both partners a great power, with which they use to fight with other Hand Shakers to show whose sexual desire is stronger. While I wish the world to be a calm place where everyone can hold hands in peace, this is a piece of entertainment after all, so I must admit that I love a good fight. And what good fights this series holds! Every power is tremendously creative and unique and allows for the users to activate different techniques as their intelligence may command. While Niconico Araki, known for his work in the classic series Stand Alone Complex, has often been regarded as a genius for his creative shounen battles, Hand Shakers might have outdone him once and for all, for the clashes in this anime are breathtaking, such as the clashes between chains and a big fuck-off sword, card games and a big fuck-off sword, and an idol girl and a big fuck-off sword. The possibilities are endless!\\n\\n\r\nAnd what meshes all thisl together is the immaculate presentation of the anime. GoHands have truly crafted a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Last year brought in multiple anime that sought out the promises of CG; anime such as Bubuki Buranki, Ajin, and Berserk 2016. Hand Shakers surpasses these titles--no, it surpasses all anime for its visual prowess. Every surface in the world is a mirror, reflecting the clouds in the sky that move at breakneck speed because this anime takes place in a very windy city, which is precisely why Lily\u2019s large bamboozlers wiggle and shake rapidly, even indoors. Characters have hair made out of stained glass, allowing a unique color pallet with a diverse level of shading, and the designs of each character perfectly match the theme they represent.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing short of stellar; the 2D and 3D animation come together so well that they move at two entirely different framerates, creating two unique and interesting flavors that satisfy fans of both traditional and CG animation. The backgrounds, objects, and effects generated from computer animation are so realistic and lifelike that I have a hard time deciding whether they were actually animated, or if the chains and flames, for example, were literally placed above the recorded frames to give a full sense of realism. It looks so natural! I\u2019ve never seen CG used in more brilliant ways before, although I\u2019m greatly anticipating the upcoming Berserk 2016 2017 to break new ground with a clang. Either way, the ambition displayed in Hand Shakers cannot be ignored nor disrespected, especially when considering the messages of the narrative it represents.\\n\\n\r\nThe hand-drawn animation holds its own to that of Bones, Trigger, and Funimation. Even with incredible camera movement that twists and turns smoothly and miraculously, the highly-stylized characters manage to stay on model at every single moment. Every frame of movement is perfect and lifelike, as if you\u2019re watching real people act through the motions. And, fret not, the hand holding itself is drawn perfectly. My heart goes out to all the animators working slave wages and not getting enough sleep for all their hard work.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we must talk about the intricate soundscapes that bring about the atmosphere of each scene, as they were good enough to distract me from the voices in my head that tell me to do questionable things to people with spoons and strawberry jam. Hand Shakers continues to innovate, as each piece of the soundtrack is a different tune taken from the top elevator music composers around the world. Not only that, but each track loops over and over again, creating a tone found in visual novels, blending Hand Shakers with even more genres. The opening theme is sung by Masayoshi Oishi, and bless his heart for singing as well as he did despite having a cold, which is why you can hear him cough at the beginning of the song. Many singers should aspire to work as hard as him. The ending theme is sung by Akino Arai, and its soothing composition can lull anyone into a sleep, so that they may dream of a better world of hand-holding. \\n\\n\r\nThe speakings are consistent with every other part of the anime: absolutely perfect. Inori\u2019s two lines of dialogue and her 815 lines of \u201chm\u201d are delivered with aplomb. No other actress could possibly have fulfilled the role better than Sumire Morohoshi. Likewise, Bind\u2019s 59 instances of \u201cahhhh!\u201d are handled excellently by Mio Akiyama. There\u2019s nothing else to say other than that every actor and actress was phenomenal and I would like them to read me a bedtime story, because the voices in my head don\u2019t know how to read, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nWith this review, I hope you have learned the valuable narrative aspects that are explored within the anime Hand Shakers, as many people have misunderstood the intentions of this amazing series and have given it an unfairly low score. While it may appear to be a simple anime featuring beautiful characters, incredible artwork, and great action pieces, it carries many mature and interesting themes of sexuality that must be heard. Hand Shakers is nothing short of a breakthrough for the anime industry, and therefore the entire world, a breakthrough that will likely bring a great change in how laws affect censorship and restrictions on sexual activities.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, my friends, I must go. Do tell your friends and family the good word of Hand Shakers. Spread it across your school, your church, your swamp, your office! Follow the example set by this anime: spread the word loud and clear! It\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s wonderful, and it must be seen by all! You, too, can make America great again. I cannot write any further, for I must do my part and travel the seven seas and sing to humanity the praises of this glorious anime. If you need me\u2026 simply reach out your hand, and I shall come to hold it.",

            "content": "What's the ultimate sign of a \"bad anime?\" For some, it's a poorly written script, for others, it's a lack of effort on the audiovisual front. It could even be something trivial, like a personal gripe against certain cliches or tropes. Whatever the reasoning may be, we all have ways of coming to our own conclusion. \r\nAs for me, the ultimate sign of a lousy anime is not what that particular work does by itself, but how it forces me to retroactively reexamine other terrible works in the process. When the show in question is so bad that I have to commend the efforts ofbottom-tier shows that, at the very least, \"tried,\" to me, that's the ultimate sign of a piss poor project. \\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers is that kind of anime. A show so baffling in its inception that calamities of years past\u2014such as the infamous Absolute Duo or Terra Formars\u2014manages to appear \"decent\" by virtue of comparison. The degree to which this show fails is actually pretty impressive. In a way, it's a masterpiece at fucking up. From fundamental production issues that could have easily been fixed to writing butchered beyond the point of repair; what we have here is a perfect swan dive into brain-dead content.  \\n\\n\r\nWhatever the lowest score you've ever given a title may be, proceed to raise it a point higher so that you have a level solely dedicated for this gem. It has earned the right to reign unchallenged on its shit-tier podium. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that would jump out at you is the overall presentation. It's been a while since I saw a show where the issue wasn't it being under-produced but actually the exact opposite. Hand Shakers is overwrought with so many art-style, animation, and filmmaking techniques that it's nauseating trying to process it all. I'm sure you've seen people mockingly say that something is \"headache-inducing\" before but with Hand Shakers, it isn't just a snide remark to make in passing, it's the actual truth. There are certain parts of the show where you feel like you're on the verge of getting a migraine. And this goes beyond the obvious issues you'd expect from a poorly put-together anime. The issues here have almost taken on a life of its own due to its aggressive application of everything occurring all at once.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, let's run over the obvious one that immediately sticks out to most people, the presentation: \\n\\n\r\nEverything is constantly bathed in an oily opacity filter. Random 360 camera panning with fisheye lens distortion at a moment's notice. 3D rendered landscapes with 2D constructed characters with no spatial awareness given for any of it to breathe. A complete disregard for blocking, leading to a whirlwind of poorly thought-out motion and distracting object placement. Unmoving plaid animation technique (best featured in cartoons like Chowder and anime like Gankutsuou) that are randomly used with no true purpose. Enough lens flare to make even J.J. Abrams blush. Digitally rendered clothing layered with a feathering sheen effect. Random micro sparkles fluttering around everywhere. Shots riddled with dead space while simultaneously being cluttered throughout other parts of the scene. Jarring post-production CGI blended with cel-shaded animation that moves at a completely different frame rate from everything else. Lighting and shadow casting that doesn't account for its light source. Layered in live-action dust and flame effects placed on top 2D drawn objects. Random Dutch angles, top-down view shots, dollying shots, dolly zooms that transitions into handheld camera point-of-view scenes; all this plus more that could occur back-to-back at a moments notice\u2014none of which used with any purposeful intent. Spliced-in insert shots that highlight pointless information. Multiple occasions where the 180-degree rule is broken. A complete disregard for motion vectors, resulting in discombobulated action scenes. And the list goes on and on. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this was just a conservative list of what I've spotted. If someone were to actually sit down and dissect it all, I'm sure there are more structural and presentation problems just waiting to be unearthed. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a dizzying vaudevillian display of one terrible idea after another, with each aspect desperately vying for your attention.\\n\\n\r\nIt's one thing to apply bold presentation choices to make your project stand out, and it's a complete other to compound it to the point where it becomes the equivalency of throwing shit at the wall. Not only does this show run the gamut of every possible shortcoming on a presentation standpoint but it fails at utilizing any of it in an effective manner. And perhaps even worse is the flippant disregard for basic editing and filmmaking techniques, despite the creators' desire to overuse it.\\n\\n\r\nHere are just a few simple examples. Establishing shots are used to give the viewer a sense of location, time, and space as it relates to the destination of the story or the scene being brought to one's attention. In Hand Shakers, establishing shots are reduced to cobbled-together reused scenes or random point of views done merely for a \"cool\" shot, defeating the purpose of giving the viewer any sense of placement. If you use the same cutscenes or go bat-shit crazy with camera angles to establish a multitude of things, it's no longer serving its purpose. All that does is leave your audience disoriented, giving them no chance to find their footing in your world. On top of that, spatial awareness is lost here as well. Rooms and locations can get bigger or smaller from scene to scene. Characters appear and relocate in their positions within any given shot, something that occurs every time the show attempts to show a relation between the environment and people's positions in them\u2014and no, this wasn't a purposeful artistic choice like it is in the Monogatari franchise. The director and creators of this show are either inexperienced or overcompensating for material that doesn't deserve the excessive theatrics being allotted to it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many movies and TV shows where the intent is to create a feeling of disorientation, as is the case with Satoshi Kon's Paprika, where it created a visually augmented existence between dream and reality or with live-action movies like Natural Born Killers and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, where they wanted to simulate a drunken fever-dream-like experience to heighten the adrenaline-fueled intoxication that the characters found themselves reveling in. If done with proper care, this kind of visual inebriation can be a fun experience, but the dizzying effect that Hand Shakers has throughout its run isn't of that pedigree. It's creators seeing \"cool\" things and then converting it into parlor tricks in a piss poor attempt to emulate it. It's the unholy matrimony between improperly used filmmaking techniques and lousy art-style decisions. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, the truly mindblowing thing about this entire production is that it's an ANIME, NOT a live-action film. No really, think about it for a moment. You don't have to puppeteer between makeup artists, lighting crews, prop departments, stunt performers, movie extras, cinematographers, actors, construction crews, auditors, modeling supervisors, food catering services etc. The advantage that anime has over live-action is that the daunting tasks associated with live-action have been diminished to a degree where the creative technicians involved are usually significantly less, making it far more manageable as a result. In layman's terms, there's less joggling required. Just compare the staffing of any live-action blockbuster film against that of any anime project. 2015's One Punch Man vs. Age of Ultron for example. The amount of people involved speaks for itself. Ultron's staffing is practically 50x larger than that of One Punch Man's. So how Hand Shakers manages to have the frantic feel of an overworked production cycle, while not having to worry about most of the issues associated with an overworked production cycle, is beyond hilarious. And honestly, pretty fascinating, if only for how bad the finished product ended up being.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about the production, if I were to discuss all the issues found, we'd be here all day. Instead, let's try to comb over the show's screenplay without dying of embarrassment.\\n\\n\r\nYou really can't expect much content-wise from a show whose premise and name sounds like an awful pun gone too far, but let's try to find something worth discussing anyway. Produced by studio GoHands\u2014HAND Shakers, Go HANDS, GET IT!?\u2014the story follows a limp-dick, pussy protagonist named Tazuna Takatsuki, who, through a series of events, find himself coming into contact with Koyori Akutagawa, a fair porcelain-skinned complexioned girl who's been in a coma for a long time. In her dainty state, Koyori reminds Tazuna of the little sister he once had, and through the miracle of \"da chosen one,\" she awakens to his presence, grabbing his hand as they start their journey together as newly formed Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nWhen he isn't busy being an ideal self-insert beta-male, Tazuna uses his Shirou Emiya ability to fix mechanical devices of any kind, being something that's both a passionate hobby of his and means to test his acquired skills. But after becoming a Hand Shaker, all that changes, as he's pitted against multiple opponents who have accepted the call, each coming with their own unique fetish to meet the expected checklist of your routine fantasy empowerment show. From sadomasochism and pop-idol worship to vanilla incestual love and lolita complex; this anime is your one-stop shop for all your harmless fanservice needs. Using powers they could summon called \"nimrods,\" the duo fights off their attackers one by one, with each conquest becoming friends in the end because \"reasons.\" And really, that's the extent of what you need to know about this show, trying to give you a more detailed description of it would only lead to numerous contradictions later on, as the show doesn't follow any of its pre-established rules whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nWhether the issues spotted as the story goes along was just a case of excessive retconning mid-production or just a shitty draft treatment that was turned into a screenplay without any sort of revision, honestly, it's hard to tell the difference with this show. Just be prepared for several inconsistencies and accept it for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nAccepting things as is also extended to specific scenarios and plot details as well. This is a show that cannot exist without treating most the characters involved like dimensionless NPC stand-ins, because the moment it does bother to make its inhabitants fully functioning human beings, is the moment that the show's logic begins to collapse in on itself. Take the following scenario, for example:\\n\\n\r\nBecause of Koyori's health condition, she cannot let go of Tazuna's hand, in fear of her life being lost in the process \"because reasons.\" But since Tazuna is still a high school student, he needs to find a way to attend classes with this dilemma, as well as a means to go about his daily life. So how does the show accomplish that? By just turning his classmates and parents into unquestioning oafs! Tazuna bringing a Rei Ayanami knock-off into his parents' household is treated with no confrontation at all, in fact, it's greeted with a celebratory welcome home. Even if we ignore the fact that he's not letting go of her hand the entire time he brings this stranger into their household, he then proceeds to take this strange girl into the shower and bedroom with him. All of which happens with his parents' complete acknowledgment of these events. With a flimsy off-screen explanation given to explain this, we're just supposed to accept that these are the world's most accepting parents, in a culture like Japan that's built on strict decorum, where shit like this will never fly. This is the level of nonsense we're dealing with here.\\n\r\nAnd how do they solve the issue of him attending school with a girl continually holding his hand? Well, same shit. No one bothers to question it. The show quite literally turns an entire population into brain-dead idiots just to sell its cutesy fantasy empowerment concept. You could just feel the power of the scriptwriter's pen dictating every aspect of this show's logic, making the entire thing unbelievably stupid. At no point can you buy into any scenario presented, as it's all incredibly forced. I could only imagine the conversation for this show's plotting going along the lines of: \\n\\n\r\nStudio head: \"We need to get to point A to point B, I don't care how you do it, just make it happen.\"\\n\r\nScriptwriter: \"Don't worry my nigga, I'll just write some bullshit and make everyone accept it.\"\\n\r\nStudio head: \"That works for me.\"\\n\r\n-throws up gang signs, crip walks out of studio office-\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that's all this show is, an excuse to have a self-insert pussy protagonist hold the hand of a cute, dainty girl, from what came into existence from a dumb word pun. At least that's what I'm hoping the joke floating around in the studio office was, because if this was seriously pitched like a legitimate idea, then may God have mercy on us all. Thankfully, the gimmicky scenario was mirrored throughout the conversations had by the characters, leading to my first conclusion being acceptable enough to stomach. The dialogue scenes, for the most part, were composed of 40% information dumps, 50% \"OMG, they're such an adorable couple!\" and 10% \"I like to fix things, hurr durr!\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's one of the most blatant fantasy empowerment/escapism shows, not only in the 2010s but also in the past decade. Hell, maybe even an all-time contender.\\n\\n\r\nTo help sell this experience, we're given what could best be described as cheap elevator music for a soundtrack, xerox copy character designs, and a demo-quality opening theme that's chopped together with scenes of all of the occurring events seen throughout the series. And before we go on any further, can we just quickly acknowledge how funny the naming choice of \"nimrod\" is in this series? \\n\r\nGiven that the other dimension that the Hand Shakers battle against each other was referred to as the Ziggurat, it's safe to say that the show was using the old biblical text definition of nimrod; a person who was known as a skilled hunter in the old testament. Which, by itself, isn't a bad idea to use as the basis for a classification of weaponry... except for one problem. In modern-day semantics, most people define the word \"nimrod\" as a dumb person. So keeping that in mind, every time the characters' weapons are brought up in the show, what was intended to be a badass moment where two opposing Hand Shakers clashes just ended up becoming a comedic one. If you view it with the understanding of how this word is primarily identified by most people, head-to-head battles can almost be seen as a fight between who the bigger idiot is. The last anime I recall watching with such unfortunate naming choices was Tomino's Brain Powerd. And if you haven't seen Brain Powerd as yet, consider this an endorsement to check it out. It's basically the autistic version of Neon Genesis Evangelion. \\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, back to Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers is a title I found value in, although, that value had nothing to do with any successes it may have had. As for what message this anime may be trying to sell the audience, the only thing I could come up with was some tacky moral statement of \"separated we are weak, but together we are strong.\" Other than that, I'm drawing blanks here. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite all my negative comments towards this project, it may surprise you to know that I love this anime, or rather, I love titles that are this bad. Shows that everyone, regardless of viewing habits or taste, can collectively acknowledge how terrible it is. These are the kind of shows that bring people together. Where we can all join hands spewing out diatribes like a kumbayah cleansing ritual, declaring in one voice that this anime \"is shit.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you're aspiring to do anything with editing or the process of filmmaking, Hand Shakers could be seen as the best visual example of what not to do, serving as a sort of warning sign on how doing too much could be just as bad as doing very little. Other than that, if you just wish to have a good ass time laughing or being baffled for a few hours as you watch something fail at everything it attempts, Hand Shakers is a great drinking game entry to view with a few friends. \\n\\n\r\nAs for me, this anime is a marvel. A new defining point of a particular kind of pathetic. A spectacular failure that has redefined my idea of what cancerous presentation looks like. Weirdly enough, I'm thankful for Hand Shakers's existence. Through it, I have a newfound appreciation for other shows I once quickly disregarded, softening my stringent criteria of what I consider \"acceptable\" in the process. There's always something worse out there, and Hand Shakers became a martyr to prove that point.",

            "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, greetings!\r\nTwo questions first:\r\nDid you think Big Order or Glasslip were the worst series you've ever seen?\r\nDid you think Berserk 2016 and Ajin had the worst animations with CGI you've ever seen?\r\nNegative! Hand Shakers is here to show you the opposite and... believe me, it does it well. Let's look at this together!\r\n- Use of pretentious terms like \"Nimrod(o)\" or \"Ziggurat(o)\"?\r\n- Action with lots of explosions and unimaginable powers?\r\n- Main character without goal?\r\n- Main character nice, and weak at first?\r\n- One of the girls is a loli kuudere?\r\n- One of the girls is a loli idol like Nico Yazawa?\r\n- One of the girlsis a loli tsundere?\\n\r\n- Fan service ecchi?\\n\r\n- S & M?\\n\r\n- Brother complex?\\n\\n\r\nDo you see what I mean? This series contains a list of clich\u00e9s in order to attract the most people, without taking the trouble to think about the pertinence of all these points. \\n\\n\r\nStory: (2/10)\\n\r\nRoughly, the story takes place in Osaka where there is a parallel dimension of the name Ziggurat. The Hand Shakers, people who have received the Revelation of Babel, engage in a tenacious battle between them to challenge God...\\n\r\nSo I can understand that it makes you want to watch but believe me, there is a big difference between what I read and what I saw. (Careful, I'm not talking about the novel that I didn't read.)\\n\r\nThe series alternates between the annoying slice of life and the action, equally bad. The thing that bothered me most is that the scenes don't follow each other in a logical way. For example, we can easily change from a slice of life scene where two characters quietly chat to another scene where these two characters will face an opponent. \\n\r\nConcerning the explanations of the powers of the characters, don't expect anything clear or precise but nevertheless, even if nobody understands anything (including the characters), everyone uses them as simply. To make it simpler, the Hand Shakers uses the power of friendship, like lots of popular mangas you already know. The Ziggurat is the practical way for the writer to stage explosive fights in a city without trying to explain why this barrier exists. For the last 3 points of the list, I don't prefer to tell you and let you discover it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (1/10)\\n\r\nThey are all uninteresting. How often have I been able to predict their sentences during dialogues so they are clich\u00e9s? I do not know, but as many times as I can no longer count them.\\n\r\nMost of them are copy and paste from popular characters, without these new characters having a developed or deep personality. There is absolutely no subtlety, no slightly dubious character trait that would make them more complex. No, they are either kind or wicked who have become friendly and allied to the MC after fighting them. Doesn't this aspect remind you of a famous shonen manga?\\n\\n\r\nArt: (1/10)\\n\r\nWhat can I tell you? Even the most fervent defenders of the CGI won't be able to tolerate a CGI of such bad quality. The movements aren't natural (I think Riri's breasts) and are jerky, although there is slightly improving on some specific action scenes.\\n\r\nThe colors are garish and unpleasant. The staging is painful to the eyes.\\n\r\nWhat else can I tell you? The characters have a bad chara design. I have the impression that Koyori and Tazuna are primary school children while they are supposed to be high school (?) students. Good joke, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nSound: (5/10)\\n\r\nProbably the best point of the series, and yet don't expect Sawano's OST here. For most of the soundtrack, these are nice piano music to listen to although they become repetitive.\\n\r\nThe OP isn't awful and the ED is ... correct after listening to it at least 5 times.\\n\r\nThe seiyuus: Makihara has a seiyuu whose voice I don't like here. For the others, it is passable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (between 5 and 9/10)\\n\r\nStill, I doubled-up with laughter, watching this series. So the mediocrity of this series beats records, it doesn't become unpleasant or embarrassing to look at. Once you have accepted it, you can fully enjoy and laugh heartily. For example, characters' reactions are often very stereotyped and... stupid that it made me laugh, especially with Tazuna (\"I have to protect Koyori at the risk of my life!\"). \\n\r\nMoreover, Nagaoka Daichi is probably the most entertaining character so he's wide of the mark.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I think Hand(o) Shakers is an excellent series to understand just how bad a series can be. BUT if you are looking for a good show on Winter 2017, choose what you want except... Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -> Piece of shit. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "**DISCLAIMER: This version is outdated, however I will keep it up here as a mark of how I felt a year prior when constructing this review (I spent 50 days). Since then, I have created a superior version of this review that I sadly can't link (it's in my blogs section). Regardless, enjoy!**\r\n\u201cHOLY FUCK; this show has got to be the worst anime I\u2019ve seen in my whole life! I mean, I've seen some dog shit like Big Order, Pupa, Mahouka, Mars of Destruction, and Skelter+Heaven, but this takes the fucking cake, and GoHands will pay with their now abysmal reputation!\u201d -me, now and hopefullyforever...\\n\\n\r\nMy friends...thank you for waiting for this day; for this review..for sticking with me, and suffering through this abomination like I did; you are all brave souls. Now, for the usual preamble about why this show is absolute garbage and why you shouldn't watch it...EVER!\\n\\n\r\nThanks to all the time I spent splurging the forums of this crazed and fascinating enigma of a forum site and the equally crazy and passionate community that spawned it, as well as the time I spent rummaging through the narrative and production of studios like Ufotable, Production I.G, Sunrise, and Tatsunoko Production, I've come to the conclusion that every season of anime has to have \u201cthat one show\u201d. You know the one; the one show that happens to be so spectacularly bad that 90% of the vocal parts of the Internet slam it as one of the worst anime of the year, even if there are ones with lower scores, since those are just ignored by the masses. Some are lost in the aether once the new season of anime kicks off, but others stay as legends. Last year had some examples of the former, namely \u201cEnride\u201d and \u201cSeisen Cerberus\u201d, but it had even more examples of the latter, namely \u201cBig Order\u201d and \u201cMayoiga\u201d and while I'm not 100% sure where this show will end up, my money is on the latter. Now, I'm not gonna whore out views by making a sarcastic review that was meant to give fake and ironic praises to this show that will emphasize how lame it is. I'm gonna tell it to you straight: Hand Shakers sucks! It sucks really bad. I mean, you shouldn't be watching this, it sucks that fucking bad, and expect that word a lot because this show is just that goddamn awful; it's abominable; 1 out of 10 bad. That's right, we're going there...\\n\\n\r\n*While there are spoilers for Hand Shakers, don't bother watching this abomination; it's not worth your time. TL;DR at the bottom, and apologies for the length and apologies if I come off as a psychologically broken rambler just hating on a low hanging revolting pile of shit that calls itself a \"fruit\", but if you hate this show anywhere near as much as I do, or even if you don't hate it that much, please stick around? I'm sure it'll be more worth your time than the actual show could ever be. If you hate my tone here, I promise you it won't get any better since this show is apocalyptically bad! I just...really fucking hate this show...*\\n\\n\r\nOnce upon a time, there was a man who watched an anime, and once he finished it, he described it as the anime equivalent to a 5 car pile-up; something so disastrous yet fascinating; you can't look away. It was the beginning of Summer 2016 when this occurred. Half a year later, and this show was allowed to air in Japanese television and on Crunchyroll, with Funimation (for some weird reason) jumping into this shit pile of a show only a few weeks later. In my demented head-cannon, I am willing to believe that the people behind this show saw this and decided to one-up the anime that received the aforementioned statement (though, I must be fair and cast that twisted imagination aside), for Hand Shakers is the anime equivalent of Hiroshima. It is an event so disastrous, that it caused intense pain and suffering to everyone who watched and experienced it. It was something so fucked up and disastrous, that would be forever marked as a tremendous tragedy in the history of mankind. It is sickening to have looked at, and many people talk of it in disdain for all the suffering attached to it,and even joke about it for that same reason. However, in the case of the Hiroshima bombing, at least it ended something much worse. This, on the other hand, didn't serve to impact anything other than our sanities and Studio GoHands\u2019 reputation.\\n\\n\r\nNow, premise aside (since we'll get to it), what exactly...is Hand Shakers? It is something that can only be described in one of two ways, one of which I already mentioned. The other way for it to be described is: a masterpiece of fail that deserves to be talked about in the same vain as Mars of Destruction, Pupa, or Skelter+Heaven. It is something that either causes you to watch in awe or in despair. To some, it is an enigma of bullshit that will make some stare in awe, wondering just how something like this came to be, and how spectacularly this pile of dung was made without resort to alcohol and drugs for its script, while laughing their (possibly drunk) assess off while watching this piece of shit. To others, it is a travesty that forced them to watch in agony, either at how everything about this anime manages to be so bad, or at how the horrendous visuals manage to cause physical pain to their eyes. This anime is not for the visually-challenged, nor is it for the easily nauseous, or the easily angered, such as myself (for the latter adjective exclusively). This kind of shit leaves you bitter, especially if you actually care about storytelling and visual presentation.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I jumped into this anime, I already expected it to be bad thanks to the reception it has received, but it ended up being so...SO much worse than I anticipated; it was shocking as to how awful it all was, from writing, to direction, to audio, to characterization, to visual presentation. This \"anime\", if you can even call it that, violates the 8th amendment, and makes no qualms about it, for this was an attempt to make Studio GoHands a household name...and you can all guess how that worked out. To be honest, I'm 100% surprised that THIS was supposed to be their breakout anime. Just\u2026 why? Do you people honestly expect me to believe that THIS was supposed to be Studio GoHands' claim to fame; the anime that makes the studio a household name; something that opens our eyes and makes us see that Studio GoHands should be heralded as a legendary studio on par with the likes of Production I.G., Bones, Kyoto Animation, or Ufotable?!\\n\\n\r\nI truly mean it. This is something that warrants explanation. Why was this...FILTH, the studio\u2019s attempt at glory?! After all, it's nothing but a generic, shitty Fate/Stay Night clone with a ridiculous premise attached to give as excuse as to why all of the powers are so lame. If it wasn't for the obnoxiously bad visuals that were supposed to be seen as \"visionary\" or \"innovative\", almost nobody would be talking about it. It would just be a trite cow pie that didn't even try. We would have a little laugh at its expense and move on, putting this as a lazily created and forgettable schlock-fest. Instead, we are left to watch in suspense as the shit-shields (aka, the critics, such as myself; you're welcome) dissect this shimmering ball of fuckshit for creatively (and more often than not, uncreatively) murdering our brains, sanities, and eyesights with this blend of lazy, broken, and generic writing, accompanied by the most baffling of visual diarrhea. \\n\\n\r\nStill, how did it all go so wrong? How and why was this anime such an endless cycle of bullshit that only spiraled more and more into innovatively awful territory with each passing episode? Now that I took my anti-breakdown pills, it's time to press on. As we enter the fray, sacrifice our much-needed brain cells on this abomination from hell, and finally finish this painfully long and meticulously crafted preamble of visceral hate porn, let's sing kumbaya and find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the concept of the show; the premise, if you will. The premise is stupid as hell. If for one second, the MC duo lets go of one another, the girl dies, except apparently not because she can go a few seconds without contact and still survive. In fact, by episode 3, she become capable of surviving this for 15 minutes despite the fact that they give NO reasoning or decent time-lapse to tie into why we should buy this bullshit. Then, she can suddenly go two hours in episode 5 (the events surrounding that throwaway line bring up its own plethora of plot holes), and none of it has any sense of progression since we don't now what influences that progression. Back to the previous point. With the way the antagonists of episode 1 hold hands, you would assume that each group of Hand Shakers must hold hands, but then episode 3 comes around with a duo named Blade and Dagger (Talk about on the nose for their powers. Also, more on them later) and has it so that they never once hold hands. So, what the hell was the point of that stupid ass premise?! If it was advertised as a stupid gimmick for only the main duo, that would be fine; you would just have to explain it. However, when you battle, you're automatically in the Ziggurat (which I'll get back to) where you're not allowed to lose your grip otherwise you get kicked out, until the whole episode 3 example I mentioned above, except now it's when both parties don't wanna fight at all (then what about how the fight in episode 4 ended, when one side clearly wanted to keep at it a little longer and easily could've?) So, what the hell, anime?! \\n\\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, not only is that established rule broken in episodes 4 and 6, but by episode 8, we can confirm that this rule is nonexistent bullshit and a lie since NO ONE DOES IT ASIDE FROM THE PROTAGONISTS!!! Wasn't it supposed to be that if you lose your grip, you lose? Apparently not because in episode 8, the more active Hand Shaker (Kodawa) never even holds hand with her partner and is separated from him all the fuckin\u2019 time, and in episode 4, neither do Blade and Dagger, so fuck me for being a logical human being that expects a show to follow its own rules. For fuck\u2019s sake, don't violate your own rules so constantly; it ruins everything.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, no wonder the powers blow! If you were to use exciting or creative powers, you would have to ditch the retarded fucking premise, which the show somewhat does, so what the fuck, you lazy piece of shit of an anime?! If you wanna make a Fate/Stay Night clone, at least have some decent powers. Then again, if the powers are called FUCKING NIMRODES (forgive the spelling, that's how they decided to spell it; I know the original meaning, but that doesn't really help given the modern definition of the term \u201dnimrod\u201d), then how the flying fuck do you expect them to be good in the first place? Well, here\u2019s how the death game works, random duos are chosen (for seemingly no reason) to participate in a game in which they need to hold hands and \u201ckill\u201d all other Hand Shaker duos, in order to meet God...who here wants to watch Mirai Nikki and Fate/Zero instead right about now?\\n\\n\\n\r\nJokes about better anime aside, there are fundamental things about these kinds of death games that aren't explained here (unlike the aforementioned better anime). For starters, nobody knows how long this whole game has been going on. Nobody knows if there have been winners before or if this was just an ongoing game (no matter what, either route will bring its own set of issues).\\n\\n\r\nNobody knows how many pairs there can be at a time. In fact, the game seems to be extremely vague and off about its rules and mechanics. Hell, holding hands in front of a duo of Hand Shakers is a trigger for battle, meaning that there is a very strong possibility that innocent couples have been mistakenly threatened due to them holding hands in front of Hand Shakers by accident, which really sells how stupid these rules are. This is the absolute worst constructed \u201cdeath game\u201d I've ever seen. In fact, I shouldn't even call it that because no one dies. Even if you have fatal injuries, as soon as you leave the Ziggurat, they're no longer fatal, and you can simply lose from getting beaten and rendered \u201cimmobilized\u201d (not really, but the anime doesn't bother with letting that particular duo that lost that way continue for unknown reasons). Aka, this isn't even a death game or proper battle royal. It can't even bother going through with its hook (not including the hand holding but, which it doesn't go through with either). Have I mentioned that you should have been watching the Fate/Stay Night anime titles instead?\\n\\n\r\nThe Ziggurat...well, I don't know what it is. Given context, it seems like a space that appears not only when two Hand Shaker pairs meet, but specifically, they meet while no one else is around, which is already convenient in and of itself. The whole Ziggurat thing is so poorly defined, and this is effectively where the \u201cbattles\u201d of this \u201cdeath game\u201d take place. Also, the Hand Shakers\u2019 hands don't even shake, they hold. This title lies. The title is stupid sounding, regardless, but still. Then again, if they wanted to be truthful, it would be \u201cHand Holders\u201d and that sounds like a cheesy ass shoujo romcom, and I\u2019ve heard that we\u2019ve had enough of those this season already. I guess they had their hands tied (get it?). \\n\\n\r\nAlso, this anime constantly pushes the incest angle between our MC duo for some weird reason. I dunno. Maybe for a generic, hollow attempt at grabbing attention? Probably, knowing this show. I mean, they aren't actually blood-related siblings but they not only don't care about that, but the first 4 episodes (when they thought they were siblings) really give the incest vibe (like the shower scene in episode 2). Also, remember the whole \u201cactual sister\u201d plot line that is occasionally addressed, well, prepare to her no closure. I mean, we already know that the randomly slapped in \u201cbackstory\u201d scene in episode 1 is a pathetically bad attempt at making us care for Tazuna before he actually gets to do anything, which is emotionally manipulative as hell, but it's not like that plot point went anywhere aside from creating bad plot twists. At least it has the decency not to try to slip in another bullshit plot twist that could've brought her back while proceeding to ramp up the incestuous undertones; that would've been the absolute worst. I mean, even evil has standards.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go back to the battle royal/potential death game for a second; I\u2019m not done ripping that sorry excuse for a battle royal apart. Remember when I said that fatal injuries stop being fatal as soon as you leave the Ziggurat? Well, that wasn't a joke or a misunderstanding. Take this, for instance; when our MCs stab the first villain (Break, who can honestly rot in hell), with their gear sword, not only does it go right through him, but the area he\u2019s in, fuckin\u2019 EXPLODES, and you mean to tell me that he only suffered injuries?! The fucker should be dead, Ziggurat abilities or not! Then again, this same shit would later happen to Kodama in episode 9, so that\u2019s just par for the course, which already consists of 14 full dishes of fresh, heaping bullshit. In episode 8, Tazuna gets his ass kicked and says that he lost a match against a group of Hand Shakers. According to the anime, if you lose, you lose permanently and can't come back. However, he is still in the game, despite losing in similar ways to how Break lost (incapacitated) and how Hayato lost (lost the will to fight while the other group did so as well but he was in the losing position anyway). If you somehow didn't catch that, that's a gigantic contradiction that is not patched up, since this game fucks it's own rules in the ass every episode.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about this battle royal/potential death game and its physics is stupid, and they don't even try to give reasonable explanations for any of it. In fact, it doesn't even feel like a battle royale; it feels more like a linear video game, where each duo is simply a stepping stone boss for the MC to overcome before moving on to the next until they reach the end. Battle royal my ass! I'd talk more about the story of this series, but this is basically all it amounts to: a high school student and his sister being haphazardly thrown into this horribly conceived death game, taking down one enemy group at a time before meeting God, except almost nothing makes any sense as they somehow meet him despite the fact that the only way to meet him is for your Nimrod to infect the Ziggurat and beat another opponent, which Kazuna and Koyori haven't done at all. Well, back to the final two episodes after this next side tangent.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is it with the first scenes of every episode and being completely disconnected from everything? Episode 1\u2019s first scene is just a shitty and poorly rendered advertisement of what's to come, episode 5\u2019s and 6\u2019s is just some terrible \u201cad\u201d for the rest of the episode without the scene being brought up again. What is the point of these? Just play the episodes and insert the scenes when necessary. It makes the episodes feel disjointed. That doesn\u2019t even take into account the really bad scene in episode 6 in which a random new duo shoots an impaling projectile at Lily, only for it to be disconnected from everything else and completely retconned entirely, making me ask what the point of it was. All of this truly highlights how horrendous the directing and scene placement of this show is.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even going to try to go through this pile of schlock scene-by-scene because that's a death sentence for my sanity due to all that\u2019s wrong here (which really sells just how broken the writing is since I've pulled so much wrong out of it already) and the horrible physics, asspulls, and other things I haven't talked about don't help whatsoever. Even if both myself and a friend of mine, who introduced this show to me in a fit of disgust at the product, end up finding brand new faults with it (some of which appear here), at least narrative-wise, I still wouldn't be able to break them all down, and that's only from a narrative standpoint, not even from a character or technical standpoint (though here is a distressing amount of faults in both of those areas as well). Plus, this review is long enough as it is. Expect some of them to pop up in the characters section, though. Maybe someone can make a blog or thread listing everything that's wrong here in the writing department. Tazuna and Koyori kick other Hand Shaker duos\u2019 asses one by one, before each battle, there is a twist regarding said duo (after the first pair), they lose and are spared, and Tazuna and Koyori finally challenge God after facing a bunch of idiots, asspull by asspull. Get fucked by a cactus, Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, obviously, we need to talk about the finale, or rather, the lead up to it. Remember this one guy from episode 5 that told Tazuna that Koyori wasn't his real sister and did so in a way that made him so obviously evil, you know, Daichi? You don't? Neither did I until I remembered that this show had a plot and until episode 10 rolled around. Well, he brought Koyori\u2019s sister (so,Tazuna\u2019s is still dead?) and he is her Hand Shaker partner, and they delve into this big dumb backstory about how Makihara and Daichi were Hand Shakers and this backstory about Koyori\u2019s and her sister\u2019s (Mayumi) past. As you\u2019d expect, it was dumb, especially since this was near the end of the show and there was no remote confirmation that there would be a season 2 (and it still doesn't have one, and I hope it dies here and with the prequel ova since that exists now). The plotholes about the hand holding and the fact that Hand Shakers can be born (so how does that explain how Tazuna became one, and does this mean that each Hand Shaker is born? Does this mean that they technically don't have to have motivations to fight in this? Then why do people partake in this to fulfill a wish that could easily be achieved normally?), as well as the one about the two sisters randomly collapsing (due to an unknown organ failing for unknown reasons that also makes us ask how a simple organ failure can destroy your memories and your communication skills) all culminate with the poor presentation and bad writing (even excluding plot holes) to make a lame ass backstory.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we getting the finale: Tazuna & Koyori vs Daichi & Mayumi. It's about as retarded as you'd expect by now, and the Tazuna and Koyori meet God and Koyori is no longer afflicted with the curse because bla bla bla! I'm not even gonna rip this pathetic finale to shreds like I did ever single episode this far, because fuck it! You don't give a shit and neither do I, so let's move on from this flaming plane crash that calls itself a plot; it has killed enough of my brain cells with its sheer idiocy and convolution already and I can feel my sanity dripping by the second. After all, it can't do battle royales, backstories, or frankly anything right and it's appalling that I managed to pull so much bullshit out of a 12 episode series. After this, I'm gonna go apologize to The Asterisk War and Psycho-Pass 2...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAs any vigilant viewer who is decently well-versed in anime can tell by watching this series, the characters here are all worthless, comprised of mostly caricatures of actual characters; templates, if you will. That would be bad enough on its own, but each of these individuals is beyond terrible, due to sheer stupidity, asspulls, pretentious quoting, general annoyance, or what have you. As such, we have no reason to care about these idiots. With that said, let\u2019s jump right in.\\n\\n\r\nShirou-wannabe (or Tazuna, as he shall be referred to since that's his real name) is an annoying and generic \u201caverage everyday highschool boy that gets into supernatural business\u201d who looks like he\u2019s in his first year of Middle School instead of high school. I mean, do we really need another generic high school guy who simply whines about his circumstances for reasons that vary from reasonable to ridiculous? Every time he wins, it's due to a Deus ex Machina new power that he pulls out of his ass (like randomly summoning his Nimrod in the first place). Plus, he got aroused to the point of nosebleeding when he rubbed his sister in the shower. Gross...except it's ok because,\u201dplot twist\u201d, she\u2019s not really his sister, except no it fucking doesn't! Also, his shtick about things \u201cmeshing\u201d got really irritating after episode 1, especially since it sounds lame as it is. Plus, in episode 9, he even has the audacity to do the whole edgy \u201cfuck you, I'm fighting for someone who is obviously not happy about how much I'm hurting myself for her\u201d bullshit to her parents, which really ruined any chance of him not being a pathetic MC template. For a main character, he\u2019s a pretty bad and annoying one, but he is TAME compared to some of these other individuals, believe me! He may be poorly written and not have any real motivations but at least he isn't as asinine as some of the other asshats you'll be seeing later down the line.\\n\\n\r\nKoyori, particularly at the start of the series, is the human equivalent to a pet, except with less personality. She\u2019s a human vegetable that can understand communication and human needs. Hell, the ED gives her more personality than the first 4 episodes of the anime do! What the hell?! What is it with these MCs and having little to no personality?! I mean, as I said, she gets personality traits EVENTUALLY, but she is the second half of the main character duo, and it should not take 4 episodes just to give one of the two most important characters in the series a single personality trait! It's not like she\u2019s a remotely good character anyway. Hell, she doesn't actually do anything (like fighting or trying to help in non-combative ways) in any fights except for the fight in episode 6, where she leads Tazuna to figure out what she figured out in order to win (and even then, he only won by new power ex machina). At least show shows some semblance of a personality by the end of episode 4, and is marginally more realized as a character than the rest of the twats in this show. Still, that's not saying much, as her personality is still vaguely defined and uninteresting. Also, her escalations are horse shit. She can gain more time away from holding hands...for some reason. Her subplot about trying to talk is only referenced for plot convenience and is never developed properly (not that I would expect such talent from anyone involved with this show), and she randomly gets a mahou shoujo costume and nimrod in episode 9 for asspull plot convenience as well, right after finally talking. Just...she either has no personality, a bland personality, or grows via plot convenience, depending on the episode. That's just sad. Sure, she gets a \u201csad\u201d backstory about how she and Mayumi had a right childhood as Hand Shakers, but again, still doesn't help her much as the backstory is terribly executed. She had the most potential to be a good deuteragonist (secondary protagonist) but, as per usual with this atrocity, they squandered it.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, their parents are more tolerable, simply being lovey-dovey parents who tease and stuff like that. Harmless, but harmless doesn't help much given the cast. They only appear for like...two episodes anyway, so I guess that's to be expected. Whatever, I\u2019m stalling; back to the shit show that is this show\u2019s important \u201ccharacters\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the scientist guy (Makihara), shall we? He\u2019s basically what's used to justify all of the nonsense present here with \u201cnot enough data\u201d or just by explaining some of the broken basics of the \u201cdeath game\u201d and is incredibly annoying, not to mention forgetful of critical information they somehow adds more problems to the show\u2019s narrative. Sure, his past comes in handy in terms of providing a little bit of info to Tazuna, but that\u2019s about it. His voice in the sub is really irritating when you combine that with his mannerisms. The dub doesn\u2019t win him any points either.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about these other Hand Shaker duos, shall we? Break is a generic mofo antagonist thrust within the first episode just for the sake of a stepping stone into the protagonists\u2019 journey through this battle royale. Bind is his masochistic weapons bitch who gets off on him stomping her goddamn VAGINA and wrapping chains around her that move fast enough that she might get rope burn. Could our premiere antagonists be any more one note and boring than these two? Plus, their power is summoning chains to hit people with (hence the names that are really on the nose). The powers are as bland and boring as the wielders themselves. It's somewhat cute seeing them get a school festival cameo in episode 7 (as convenient as that is for the anime), but that doesn't help them at all. Besides, unlike the other roadblocks/Hand Shaker duos, these two don't even have motivations! I mean, the motivations of the character that have one are rather lame and disproportionate to what they're doing to achieve them, but these guys are or introduction to this whole deal, so...what the fuck?!\\n\\n\r\nBlade (actual name, Hayate) is a bumbling dork who apologizes more than any character I've seen to date, and is relatively ok. He just wants to prove himself to his boss(which doesn't work when you apply that as a motivation to why you participate in a battle royale in which you can potentially kill people).His partner/boss, Dagger (adult who looks like she\u2019s 6, actual name, Chizuru), is more annoying, particularly around him. She\u2019s also a bit contradictory in fact in terms of her instructions about him correcting people. Even with a more social and playful attitude towards the main duo, she isn't a good character. Her backstory is that she was bullied for her height by her cohorts and wants to prove herself to them and make everyone equal by winning and becoming powerful (as her wish, which, again, doesn't work when you apply that as a motivation to why you participate in a battle royale in which you can potentially kill people), and that could've been an interesting thing to touch upon to really make her more complex, but, of course this show wouldn't bother. It isn't capable of pulling it off, nor does it try in any other narrative regard. Still, this duo is better than the first one, especially since they actually have backstory and motivations, as poorly placed and poorly presented as they were.\\n\\n\r\nLily is aggravating, juggles two annoying personality gags that are all that define her, she's incestuous with her (not really her brother, but that doesn't make it ok) little brother, Masaru (who is also a twerp who instigated the fight in episode 6 due to his own arrogant stupidity, piling it onto Lily, and is also a pathetic excuse for an already generic male-tsundere), and she has nothing going for her, not even the F-cups they are way too big for her body in terms of proportions. Besides, the backstory for her and Masaru is half-hearted and dull, not even making any sense as a backstory for why they are fighting in this game, with their reasoning being their love for each other, which shouldn't factor into this game at all, even less so than the previous duo\u2019s reasoning. Every scene with her after episode 4 is aggravation incarnate, and she is quite possible the most irritating character in this show, which is saying a lot.\\n\\n\r\nKodama, while beautiful, is also pretty annoying. She constantly quotes famous figures in pretentious manner for even the most simplest of shit that can count as a belief, as if she was some terrible fortune cookie, and it quickly gets on my nerves. Sad thing is, she isn't ever trying to be pretentious but she does this enough to make Shougo Makishima proud. Her only other gimmick in terms of personality is being all about her performances and \u201cfans\u201d and nothing else. What a waste. She has the more upbeat, thoughtful, and dedicated personality to make me really wanna like her, but her stupid gimmicks ruin it all. Her manager, Hibiki, is even more annoying, being this unbearably hyperactive and stereotypical brown-nose manager, and that's his only personality trait. Needless to say, I wanted him gone by the halfway mark of the episode that introduces him. Though, the two do have a semi-interesting backstory. They were friends since they were a bit younger, and Hibiki sacrificed his job to let Kodama succeed, even if they were still underground people. Even still, this isn't even used as a motivation for why they bothered acting as Hand Shakers, they had no motivation whatsoever. Even still, out of all the duos, they're the least bad.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we have this guy, Daichi, who came in at episode 5 to be all like \u201cshe\u2019s not the real sister; stop being Makihara\u2019s slave\u201d in the most obviously evil way possible, and lo and behold, he\u2019s a stone cold prick who actually is a Hand Shaker partner with the real sister, whose backstories raise even more problems that I actually went over in the story segment. He\u2019s as dull as the rest of the characters, and his backstory makes him much more emotional and moral in the past than now (so, why has he changed so drastically?). As for the sister, Mayumi, her backstory gave us nothing to go off of aside from her having a rough childhood, fighting in something de doesn't understand, but she doesn't even have a personality. She is what Koyori was at the start of the series, and she's part of the final boss. Shame, really. Then, she speaks and becomes another Koyori because...fuck it; I quit!\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only work in which I can, with 100% certainty say: \u201cI don't care what happens to these people.\u201d Even in works like Gundam 00 Season 2, Mahouka, Gundam SEED Destiny, and Fate/Grand Order: First Order, there was at least one character that I can like and remotely root for, even if, at least with the 2nd and 4th examples, almost everyone is horribly generic and unlikeable. Here, there is not a single person that I care about or can get invested in, even if it's just to see their asses get kicked. Worse yet, there are characters that I still WANT to get invested in, but can't due to their bullshit ruining everything. Every single character in this show can fuck off and die for all I care, and I would actually be happy, because almost every character is an idiotic asshole who only makes things worse, with the few exceptions still being pathetically flat and with almost no personality whatsoever. Their personalities are flatter than the show\u2019s resident loli, and that's sad for an original show that was supposed to put this studio on the map. Seriously, fuck these characters. I desperately wanna know how ANYONE can root for these people and get invested in their stories. Even in the few cases where they try to give us a reason to care, the presentation is so bad that we give no shits about those characters, partially due to the fact that they are completely one-dimensional. When a decision made by the show or the characters wasn't offensively or annoyingly bad, I was beyond bored, and it's thanks to these assholes. Congrats, assholes (the characters, not you guys; you guys are cool for making it this far), I hate all of you (minus a few, still one-dimensional exceptions) and you can all go to hell. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nART: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWoooooooo boy! Now onto the section we really wanna talk about; the elephant in this room so big that the room had to be the size of a skyscraper for it to fit: the visuals! Lemme put it like this. You know the phrase \u201cWork smarter, not harder\u201d? Well, the people behind this show, aka Studio GoHands, really need to learn that after what they did here. There\u2019s a lot to talk about in terms of what went wrong here, possibly more so than the writing, which is an achievement given how I contorted the abysmal writing in so many ways that no chiropractor on the planet can fix it. Oh boy, here we go...\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI in this anime is some of the most poorly integrated and some of the worst CGI that I've ever seen, and no amount of decent CG backgrounds can remedy that notion. I mean, there are moments where it can look good, only to be followed up by a moment where it looks hideous, excluding the ok CGI background buildings. Plus, it's not above using fugly ass CGI pedestrians for no good reason, as if this show wasn't enough of a nightmare to look at already. There's one moment in which this flame emperor hand is summoned, and it is revolting to look at, like it was a 1996 CGI effect for a Direct to Video DVD. Don't even get me started on the nimrodes and how hideous they look or how had the frame rate is for them. In fact, let's delve into that right now!\\n\\n\r\nThe frame rate in this series is all over the place! Within the first two scenes, THE FIRST TWO FUCKING SCENES, the frame rate crashes and it is a sight to behold. Get used to that. Whenever the camera moves in a long shot of a scene filled with people walking in an attempt at world building (which it sucks at), expect that to happen. In fact, the 2D characters have vastly lower frame rates than the CGI Nimrods. Notably, the chains in episode 1 all look like they have different frame rates, and if you see them moving while the characters are moving while the camera is moving, all at the same time, it becomes a nightmare to look at, even more so than before. Why does this show have to tread the frame rate like the Germans treated the Jews? Just...why?\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, when the characters\u2019 clothes are flapping in the wind or when the camera is slowly showing off it's CGI landscape, the frame rate shits the bed so hard, for seconds on end, and it's the absolute worst. I've never seen a show have so much or blend with frame rate before, and I've seen Phantasy Star Online 2 The Animation! Also, there are 2D first clouds drawn when a character is rolling back after an attack, and it doesn't fit well with ANYTHING in this series, whether it's the CGI backgrounds or the GoHands style character models. Now that I'm done sidetracking, let's get back to the other major gripes I have with these visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe camera, notably in episode 1 and the fight scenes, is the worst thing ever. It is highly capable of inducing vertigo, and I'm willing to bet you that it has. It moves around at the most unnecessary of times, especially in static moments, and when it does that in some of the aforementioned scenes or any scene like that, your eyes try their damndest to curl up and die just so they won't have to process all of this crap at once. Even in scenes that would otherwise look potentially good (like the opening scene in episode 8) are, at best, hindered by the obnoxious camera, and I dare not say what happens to them at worst, but episode 1 is the ultimate indicator of that. The \u201cambition\u201d behold all of these aforementioned visuals really came at a detriment to this already pointless disasterpiece. Let's not even touch on the revoltingly bad choreography, otherwise I'd be relying myself in terms of the effects, especially since the camera plays a large role in the action scenes and the way they are shot. There\u2019s also the fact that it often feels like the battles skip a gigantic chunk of frames while the frame rate dips, like in episode 4 and 8, making the action scenes unbearable to look at, and everything I mentioned previously (aside from repeated animation) are on full display in each and every one. Let\u2019s just move on to the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs range from mediocre to horrible (due to the body types and their proportions to their characters\u2019 ages), even with the decent hair detail (especially since Koyori\u2019s hair is awful to look at at times and changes colorway too much with no reason aside from \u201clight filter change\u201d, more so than Donald Trump\u2019s hair). I mean, all of the high school students look like they're almost half their age, especially due to the small heads and bodies. Adults look like older teenagers (except for Chizuru/Dagger, who looks like she\u2019s 6) for somewhat similar reasons. It simply doesn't work well. It's like making a semi-chibi version of K\u2019s visuals, and mixing it in with horrendous hair designs (particularly for Koyori, as I already mentioned), and everything else mentioned above, makes every second painful to look at. Nothing feels or looks right. Nothing blends well with each other, and that's a crying shame because if it did, and if they removed all the camera, CGI, and frame rate bullshit, this show would've actually looked good, really freakin\u2019 good. Yet, they went with this anyway, and they clearly weren't skilled enough for it, because they somehow got every conceivable thing about this process wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is not even mentioning the terrible lighting filters that make everything look off-kilter, the fugly ass fire and explosion effects that look more like an amateur freshman college student\u2019s attempt at pasta sauce (not to mention the times where it's just stock fire footage in a TV ANIME FOR FUCK\u2019S SAKE) that somehow manages to fuck the living shit out of episode 6\u2019s frame rate for about \u2153 of the episode (aka, the entire time fire appeared), the horrible school clothing designs, the occasionally awful walk animations (especially the one with Daichi\u2019s \u201cominous\u201d CGI walk in episode 10), or the fact that scenes are often reused. I'm not kidding. By the time you reach episode 3, it becomes disgustingly common for them to reuse actual, few-second clips, for no particular reason, and with no regard as to whether or not it fits. It's as if they had some trippy and \u201cambitious\u201d angle for how they wanted everything to be done, but they still decided to be lazy with it in occasion. I mean, it would've been a visual nightmare regardless, but they still cut corners, like having a menu that wasn't even drawn but was instead photoshopped from real life, or, as increasingly common it becomes as you move along, a variety of objects being stock; ripped from real life. Again, FUCK YOU, HAND SHAKERS!!\\n\\n\r\nI swear. This anime deserves to be in college courses on how NOT to integrate CGI and 2D animation together, as well as how not to use a camera or use a filter. The visuals do virtually nothing right, and that's astounding. It's like if a girl out every single lipstick and piece of makeup in existence and then adding all colors of glitter; it's a visual mess that's really hard to look at. As if the story and characters weren't abysmal enough, the visuals make this show actively unwatchable! It's a shame that people actually have to work overtime in order to make this, partially die to how awful the product looks but also due to how none of that effort paid off in the slightest. Before I lose my sanity in this void of hell known as Hand Shakers\u2019 visuals (or anywhere else in the review for this nauseating travesty), let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, \u201cOne Hand Message\u201d by OxT, is a very generic OP with obnoxious vocals that sound somewhat like auto tune, and give off a grand feeling of obnoxious genericness; a perfect fit for this show. The ED, \u201cYume Miru Ame\u201d by Akino Arai, is a melody that unfortunately fails to elicit its emotion of calming and heartwarming. Sure, it gives Koyori some actual personality, but the singer sounds like she\u2019s out of breath, and not in a good way that it makes the song more emotion-filled and somehow just as great. Then again, that's partially a product of the awfulness of the show because if it was involving well-written characters that we have been made to care about, it might've been more effective. At least it has better visuals than the show does, showing the potential the visuals had, but it doesn't matter at this point.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual OST is lame and not memorable (within its own strengths, not in terms of how much it was drilled into my head by the show). There are ok pieces there, but they're as bland and forgettable as everything else that doesn't even sound remotely interesting. There's also the fact that the OST doesn't ever fit well with the anime, whether it be due to the backgrounds or situations, it always sounds out of place since it all sounds like scenes that fit better in a generic slice of life series than in a show full of combat and destruction, especially when they pop in during the action scenes. The piece in episode 6 when Lily is hugging Masaru, happens to be especially generic, making that scene even more hamfidted than it already was. If the OST felt memorable and really good to me, I might be able to excuse that (somewhat), but it isn't so no curving the score for this section either. Not to mention that some songs that start off promising turn out really bad (like the one at the end of episode 7). I know, some people actually like this OST, but it just doesn't work for me, nor does it work for the anime. Plus, the repetitive usage of the same few mediocre and ill-fitting tracks over and over was not good. At least when Aldnoah.Zero did it, it was at least replaying GOOD music. Also, the idol songs are merely ok. They don't really help much of this poor OST. Even the idol songs are both brief and mediocre, not to mention completely out of sync to the point where it's either hilarious or maddening, depending on who you talk to. In episode 9, it's constantly interrupted by what sounds like Hibiki, and it even gets cut off for the OP, and all of that is maddening. They didn't even bother treating the idol songs from Kodama with any respect, and they're better than the rest of the OST (not by much, but still). Just...wow.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, let me be fair: no one could've made this work, thanks to the character designs, or rather, the proportions of their bodies. Even still, some of these performances feel distressingly flat or over-acted, with miscasts all over the place, but, again, it's not like the best casting choices would've been able to work well with any of this. It doesn't \u201cmesh\u201d, as Tazuna would say. Even Monica Rial can't give her character anything good. Some of the other voices are annoying as well. Then again, the sub was pretty awful too, possibly more so than the dub. Still, this proves that Hand Shakers really is unlistenable as well as unwatchable. I mean, even as a cheesecake dub (by that I mean, a corny and unintentionally or even intentional hilarious dub full of camp), this is rather boring, as I and many there can point to you at least a few that do a much better job at being a cheesecake dub, like Garzey's Wing. Just skip the dub, as well as the show itself. Also, I know that the sound effects can be pretty bad in this anime sometimes, but there\u2019s this one moment in episode 10 in which Makihara moves back, but ever sound effect in that moment begins literally an entire second before he actually moves, you know, because this show can't do sound effects right either.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you somehow couldn't already tell, I hate this show. I really fucking hate it. The visuals are infuriatingly bad in almost every conceivable way, the battle royale \u201cdeath game\u201d is so poorly constructed and explained that it alone killed the script for this show beyond redemption (only for everything else to add a million gallons of fuel to the fire), the dialogue is Mahouka levels of robotic, the action is revoltingly bad and incoherent, the characters are flatter than a loli, the comedy is awkward and terrible (often reusing the same gag over and over), the voices are awful, and everything about this show just pisses me off! In fact, it finds new ways to make me suffer with every passing episode, which is crazy considering that episode 1 broke my spirit and made me hate it more than any anime within the span of 22 minutes. Ah, Hand Shakers: the gift that just keeps on FUCKING giving!\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that when it's not doing that, it flat out bores me to death, and that happens surprisingly often. Then again, this show never tried to be remotely interesting, anyway. If anything, episode 1 alone made me grow an obsessive hatred with this show, and it only got worse the more the show progressed, culminating in this bleak review devoid of any positivity. I know that some people look at all of that and laugh, for it does nothing right and would make a great template on how not to write these kinds of shows, but I just couldn't stand it for the life of me, not even for an instant. Hell, as I was taking notes on this series, that task ended up being much more entertaining and fulfilling than ANYTHING this show had to offer, which really speaks volumes of how much I hate this series, especially since each of the notes I wrote down made it to this review. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that someone can enjoy this schlock ironically. I understand that there are people out there who unironically LIKE the show and have probably given up on this review for being nothing but unbridled hate on a show that they somehow managed to enjoy, but I almost never had a moment that made me smile (aside from one moment where I laughed and got incompetently done Masaru's rolling was), and that's not even an exaggeration. The only episode I DIDN\u2019T hate with a passion is episode 7, but despite having some semblance of charm at points, it's still as dull as the rest of the dull moments of this series, albeit it's not offensively bad, unlike the rest of the series. All in all, my hatred of this show became obsessive, and now I can lay it to rest.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 1/10    RAW SCORE: 0/100\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show was a disaster from the word \u201cgo\u201d. The moment it aired, it received a humongous backlash, and for damn good reason. This show had around 10 producers, so the results probably shouldn't has been so surprising, since that just practically screams \u201clack of communication\u201d and \u201cclusterfuck\u201d right there. Either way, this abomination a masterpiece of failure, with all sorts of mistakes around every corner, and it never once gets better; it's a canvas of vomit that someone decided to call art, as if we are supposed to accept something that is this apocalyptically bad! Worse yet, it was pathetically generic and without an attempt to be interesting, aside from its visuals, and even then, only somewhat. In every sense of the word, this show is BROKEN; nay, FUBAR! This shit went Fucked Up Beyond All Repair from the moment it fucking started! THAT'S PERFECT WAY TO SURMISE THIS PIECE OF FUCKING HORSE SHIT!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThen again, you're probably thinking \u201cWe already knew all that; it's obvious. Why\u2019d you waste your time with this 9,400+ word novel of a review on a low hanging fruit like this show?\u201d Well, aside from sharing what this anime did to me, I wanted to solve this anime\u2019s hatedom forever, making sure that there is no way to reasonably defend this show and that any non believers can be sent this review to read in order to accept that this show is an abomination. Interestingly enough, there has been quite a number of people trying to pass this off as simply middling and not awful, which this review and the writer in question disagree with wholeheartedly. With that, we come to the final nail in the coffin I prepared.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've played it or heard of it, think back to Sonic \u201806. It was a broken mess, with glitches up the ass, horrible gameplay elements, poor worlds and visual aesthetics (aside from some of the cutscenes), and a bizarre mess of a story to boot. Even still, it had ambition. It has great music, and an attempt at a complex and interesting story. It over-reached in all the necessary places, and rushed itself in others, leading to its downfall, but at least it tried something interesting and potentially unique. Hand Shakers didn't do any of that. It played around with camera and CGI, but was so damn lazy in every other regard, that it's insulting to call this show ambitious. It didn't even try, and it suffered horribly for it. WE, or at least I suffered horribly for it, and, if the Internet is how we think it is, Studio GoHands is suffering for this as well. After all, even if this was how they intended it to be, in the end, this was an abomination from hell that will damn their reputation; that's what they get for making the Ride to Hell Retribution of anime. All we need now are some awful motorcycles and those fucking cowbells\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnime is an interesting category for certain animated series, and is a sink of ideas, plenty of which are ingenious and creative, and are capable of captivating us, invigorating us, and making us think, while also being capable of teaching us something new and interesting, warning us of what we don't want to become, and even reminding us about amazing things we desperately needed to remember. It allows for kinds of shows you will never see in any other outlet of television. However, shit like this is filled with a dearth of creative and interesting ideas, and is simply a product meant to suck our money and give the studio (not the workers) some profits, like with plenty of Light Novel adaptations (whether the LNs were good or not) like Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei and The Asterisk War. The sooner we realize how these cheap products dupe us, the more we can demand shows that more people in the production will take seriously in terms of actually entertaining us and making us want to watch more of their stuff. Plenty of us in the west have been doing that for the past decade, and more people in the east need to start adopting this mindset. Stuff like this is unacceptable, especially when the generic and poorly written product anime are also poorly produced, like this show. I hope to never come across something like this again, and I hope Studio GoHands learns from this and tries to recover with an interesting anime that many will want to see and will actually get invested in, for this anime has done a lot of harm to their reputation. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, Hand Shakers is such a cheesy name. Couldn't have been something cool like \u201cHands of Fate\u201d? I mean, give me a cool name to hate a show, something to make it feel like it is \u201cthe dreaded\u201d. Then again, that title I proposed would make the fact that this is a shoddy Fate/ ripoff even more apparent. It's the modern day equivalent to what De:Vadasy was to Evangelion. For those not in the know, De:Va was considered by oldtaku (old anime fans) to be the worst Eva ripoff of all time, with awful directing, awful scene structure and composition, poor production values, retarded concept, and so much more, hence the comparison. Whatever, fuck it. This shit gets my \u201cGo to hell; You Didn't Even Try\u201d award (aka the 1/10 award). With all that said, FUCK HAND SHAKERS!! Can't wait for the god-awful prequel OVA coming out this summer with the purposes of turning shis fuckfest into a franchise, that way I can rip on that, too! Well, assuming that my next target doesn't ruin me, see you next time, everybody! I'm the meantime, I\u2019m getting chemo for this bullshit!\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFor you, January 11, 2017 was the day that your worst nightmare arrived and began ravaging everything you and your tastes stood for, but for me, IT WAS TUESDAY!!!\u201d -Me, Tuesday, when this travesty of an anime came on every week.",

            "content": "Really funny anime - in the wrong way. I watched the first 30 seconds and already knew I would be watching it just for laughs. \r\nStory 1/10\r\nThis was like an attempt at a combo of No Game no Life, K Project, and Mirai Nikki, of course, just horribly. Half of every episode was full of irrelevant things that had no importance whatsoever. All the useless things that pop up just make you wonder, \"but why?\" :-) The story mostly goes: \"Wow, they're holding hands! They must be hand shakers! Let's fight! Now that we've fought, let's stay friends!\". I love how the two main charactersare supposed to hold hands at all times and they do... in the first 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite line is from episode 1 around 19:20 the MC says \"How many are there?\" - I seriously couldn't stop laughing, did this boy just ask how many, and not why? Dear god.\\n\\n\r\nArt 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThose camera angles were really something else. I loved when they flipped the camera angle in any direction possible so that you couldn't tell what was happening, it didn't look trippy at all - trust me. The OP looked way better than the actual anime to me, they tried to do the art kind of like K project. The FPS was only about 15-16.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWant to listen to a moaning girl chained up that sounds like hentai? Well now you can! In just the first episode-- with more in later episodes as well, of course! Honestly only the OP was decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWHO ARE ALL THESE RANDOM CHARACTERS THAT COME OUT OF NOWHERE? \\n\\n\r\nLiterally, some scenes a character would just pop up. Then, they'll be talking to  the characters as if you know them and won't be introduced until later. Koyori - why is she even a character? Haha who knows, she hasn't done anything. There's no backstory to the characters, you don't know the MC except that he has a name, sister, and fights. They say irrelevant things of no importance. \"That's a nice bike\" to \"Okay. bye\" What a conversation.\\n\\n\r\nAlso you can't forget about the girl in the first episode listening to music, apparently her chest likes to dance with her.\\n\\n\r\nI can't watch this anymore- It's heading in the incest direction. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nFunny. Hilarious even. I laughed at random things a character said or the camera angles that look like someone just dropped their camera and it flipped everywhere. The irrelevant scenes were great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I would say watch it if you like to laugh at how horribly appalling something is. Other than that - the opening. Um, yeah, that's it. You hardly know anything about the characters to say you like them.\\n\\n\r\nUnforchunetly, I theenk I have wost all my bwain cells fwom thes aneme.

            "content": "Hand Shakers is the worst thing I\u00b4ve ever seen.\r\nNow this show exceeded my expectations quite a lot. When I first saw it, I thought it was bad, but holy molly. This show is quite the good thing to dig into. I mean there is so much wrong with it, you could write for hours about what trash you can find in this. So, I decided, screw it. This is not some throw away material to write 500 words or less about. This is the real jackpot. So, I decided to do something more in the style of YourMovieSucks, who is like one of my favoriteYouTubers ever and you should subscribe to him right now.\\n\r\nAs of writing this review, it is the 17th of january, after I watched episode 1, so I will write this review along the next months until this show is over, to create the perfect review. I will structure this review in multiple parts, ordered kinda chronologically, each part centering around one object of failure. I don\u00b4t even care if this doesn\u00b4t get popular. I missed my chance to destroy Big Order. This is my slice of cake, idiot.\\n\\n\r\nPart 1: The first impression\\n\\n\r\nSo, after hearing first about this anime, I immediatly go to its MAL page. Take away the bad score, which I don\u00b4t care about as I\u00b4ve already seen anime, which had a less than stellar score, which were better than expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe picture shown includes the two main characters, alongside other pairs of two. Assuming by the picture alone, it is easy to say that the show includes a aspect in which multiple couples are involved with each other. By the setting, the story plays in a big japanese city, if it is fictional or not is not possible to assume, as it is pretty much a generic backdrop of a shopping mall or a similar building complex. Considering the modern design of it, you can say that it plays in a rather big and a rather modern city. The two main characters are shown in the middle of the picture to get the focus of the viewer onto these two, a boy and a girl. The boy is taller than the girl, has brown hair and his clothes make him look like a student. Even if none of the story takes place in school, we can conclude that he is somewhere between 12 to 17 years old. Besides him stands the girl, which is rather short and has white hair. This design is easy to link to her personality being the quiet Kuudere of the story. Considering her clothes in the picture, you could assume that she is pretty young, which means that the two should belong in the younger part of the 12 \u2013 17 spectrum.\\n\\n\r\nThe next step to my first impressions should be the description. My conclusion of the picture, regarding the place and time of the story and the pair aspect was right. The story is apparently about multiple couples fighting against each other to fight god. If there isn\u00b4t a set number of couples, that compete in this, the entire concept would not make sense in the least. Besides that, through the picture alone you can conclude that one of the couples is indeed the main focus on the story. To make a battle royale situation work, there cannot be a main character, because then you\u00b4d know that this character cannot die in the story, which has already been shown in Mirai Nikki, which was pretty terrible as well. A example of a show that did this right was Fate/Zero, which didn\u00b4t necessarily focused on the battle royale itself, but rather the characters and their relations, which worked, because there was no legitemate main character. The rest of the description is some quote, that is probably taken from the anime. The only interesting thing about it is that \u201eZiggurat where the fighting shall ensue\u201c, which implies that the battle royale situation takes place in a specific tournament.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2: The animation and artstyle\\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers is the worst looking anime I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe first entire minute is a montage of the protagonist and the girl jumping around at high speed with directing, that is completely disorienting. I absolutely hate this technique, in which the shot moves towards the center and then out, over and over, to give a sense of motion, while animating nothing and destroying every sense of direction or orientation. The movement is not fluid, it feels disjointed. I know none of this was from the same sequence of events, but considering the \u201cepicness\u201d, this show tries to convey, it should have at least a sense of fluid movement to carry it. I\u00b4m talking about this for so long, because that\u00b4s all the directing in this show. It looks horrendeus.\\n\\n\r\nThe next thing I noticed were 3D effects. You could make better special effects on Windows Movie Maker. The chains look like they\u00b4re glitching and also they look fake as hell. Their placement in each shot doesn\u00b4t even make sense. At times, they should hit someone, but they don\u00b4t, because it looks \u201cepic\u201d. Yeah, fuck off. These chains are supposed to look like an obstacle, not to be one. This brings me to random 3D shots. They are the worst thing I\u00b4ve seen. They just show them, so that the viewer knows, that the show looks \u201cgood\u201d, and for no other reason. Hand Shakers does this cancerous thing, where they take realistic looking backgrounds and put anime characters in it. You don\u00b4t do that, that looks fake. There are lens flares, that should not exist. They are only there, so that the show might look more high-quality. Here\u00b4s the thing, if you have a good artstyle or high-quality animation, do something with it. Look at Evangelion and how well animated its fighting scenes are, look at Gankutsuou and everything creative or magical that is done with it artstyle, LOOK AT KILL LA KILL!\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs look absolutely terrible. You can see that no thought has been put into them, AT ALL! The boy has the school-uniform outfit. The girl has the \u201cI\u00b4m the cute girl\u201d-outfit. None of the characters have a design, that sticks out. Everything looks generic and bland. The design of backgrounds or surroundings look ungodly bland too. So, you\u00b4re trying to make some modern, futuristic look, right? They\u00b4re obviously trying to go for that, because it\u00b4s a special and interesting look, but why is the only indication, that everything is shiny. Why not do something interesting? It all looks the same to me, at this point. You should at least try to make everything look interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main criticisms I\u00b4ve seen for Hand Shakers is its fanservice, to which I say, noes. No, because the fanservice, for once, isn\u00b4t the most irritating thing. Yes, because of the way the anime is animating such scenes, with ridicolous boob physics and panty shots, which don\u00b4t even work. There is a scene, where the dude steps on the grill and her boobs fly 90 degrees in the other direction. How are breasts supposed to behave this way? It doesn\u00b4t make any physical sense. It\u00b4s my main course in school, I know what I\u00b4m talking about.\\n\\n\r\nPart 3: The first episode\\n\\n\r\nConsider, that I\u00b4m writing this part months before you\u00b4re reading it, as this is right after I watched episode 1 on the 17th of january 2017. So, I decided to write down my thoughts on the episode completely independent from any other episode, even the second one.\\n\\n\r\nRight of the bat, we get to see this this one minute scene of horrible action which serves no purpose other than to fail at looking cool with monologue, which does not make sense, even a bit. It\u00b4s like a monologue in a fanfiction, where the protagonist is supposed to look deep, but that\u00b4s actually dumb, because the protagonist is dumb. But wait, I would rather read Sonic fanfiction than watch Hand Shakers. Right after that is a scene with fish eye visuals, which serves no purpose except to look good, which it doesn\u00b4t, because there is nothing going on. Then there is a fighting scene between the protagonist with the white haired girl and another couple with the chains. I don\u00b4t know their names and I\u00b4m supposed to know what is going on. You didn\u00b4t even introduce anything of what I\u00b4m seeing.\\n\r\n\u201eBut Boris, this is smart, because you know what is going on after you\u00b4ve seen the entire episode.\u201c\\n\r\nLain was smart, when it did that, because you understand the message and idea behind it after watching it again completely, but on your first watch through, you still understood what was going on. What Hand Shakers does is dumb.\\n\\n\r\nThere are characters literally popping in and out of existence. When I first saw that I laughed for like 5 minutes. Then we get introduced to our main character and oh look, a school, just like I predicted. There is also the red haired girl. You might notice I cannot remember the characters name. That\u00b4s because I only make the attempt to remember the name of a character or a person in real life, if I know I might need the information or find the character interesting. I don\u00b4t remember the name of half of the teachers I have in school and no one actually knows. The red haired girl is like \u201edo you have the thing I wanted to get repaired\u201c and the boy is like \u201esure thing, Red haired McOppai\u201c. Then the rest of the scene goes about useless dialogue and obvious foreshadowing. A tarot card, really? That\u00b4s the most subtle foreshadowing that you could bring? Who came up with the idea of adding a freaking tarot card to foreshadow something?\\n\\n\r\nThen the protagonist goes somewhere else and fixes that persons car. His only personality trait is apparently that he is good at fixing stuff. But you have to question why. I mean I can understand if he is good at fixing McOppais aPod or some clocks, but a car engine. Are you kidding me? These are not the same things. This guy could work at NASA, he\u00b4s so good. You could give this kid two lollipops and a DVD of Breaking Bad and he could build a nuke out of it. Take that, McGyver.\\n\\n\r\nThen the protagonist is at the university of a professor, who he wants to fix something for. The following scene legitemately ticked me off. I sat in front of my laptop and cursed at it for two whole minutes, because of this. So, he looks into this other room, which is a hospital room, which doesn\u00b4t even make sense, why would there be such a room to begin with. He gets a cheap flashback that his little sister died in that same room. WHAT!? So, either the anime did a trash job at showing that the protagonist forgot some things and he remembers his sister, which was a thing in Big Order, or he\u00b4s just retarded. This is so all of the sudden, even Big Order did the dumb \u201eI forgot this thing, but now I remember it\u201c twist better. The foreshadowing in this anime is so bad, that it is 13 PM. But it gets worse. He gets in, there is the white haired girl, he gets reminded of his little sister. This is cheap, this is just cheap. Essentially, this is only there to make sure the audience has some tragic backstory about the protagonist, so that they know they are supposed to feel something for him. He has two personality traits, he can fix literally anything and his little sister died. Doesn\u00b4t sound like an anime character, sounds more like a piece of paper to me.\\n\\n\r\nThen in the next scene the professor comes back and he gives exposition, but the anime screws that up, by not letting him tell the exposition, that we need to know, just giving away some words, like Nimodes or Ziggurat. Can I eat that? Then he disappears. Oh, also, if he lets go of the girl she dies and he doesn\u00b4t want that, because it\u00b4s like his little sister. Oh no. Then they get attacked by the pair from the beginning. Considering the positioning of the chains, the two should\u00b4ve tripped at least once. There is really not much to say. So, apparently the enemy couple is a guy with no personality and a girl with no personality. How interesting. The girl is completely chained up. It\u00b4s obvious the creator of this had a bondage fetish, I mean I don\u00b4t blame him. Also, it\u00b4s the scene from the beginning again. Also, he\u00b4s giving away words like Nimrodes again. Also, the voice acting legit sounds like Hentai. It\u00b4s essentially the scene from the beginning, except now our protagonist can magically use his Nimrodes, even though he has never used it. Also, in most shots it is shown that they stand like 50 meters away from each other max, but there is a scene of the main character running at him for like a minute. This is the most amazing continuity error I\u00b4ve ever seen. I thought Guilty Crown should\u00b4ve gotten an Oscar for this, but Hand Shakers should get like 10 Oscars for that. I hope someone gives them the \u201eBest continuity error\u201c Oscar.\\n\\n\r\nThen the MC tries to attack him. The End.\\n\\n\r\nNow, once I was done with episode 1 I already knew what this was. This was the worst thing I\u00b4ve ever seen. Before I move on, congratulations. You\u00b4re actually still reading this insanely long review. You apparently don\u00b4t have the memory span of a goldfish, so you can deem yourself smarter than a goldfish. It\u00b4s funny, because the goldfish thing isn\u00b4t actually true. The reason I decided to write about episode 1 as a special part is just to share how bad this show felt once I watched just this one episode. I mean, it was bad. So now that you know how bad episode one just was and how horribly written it is, I can move on to making the rest of the review.\\n\\n\r\nPart 4: The rest\\n\\n\r\nSo, after realizing that my review was full with words like \u201cprotagonist\u201d and \u201cwhite haired girl\u201d, I decided to insert names for them, in order to remember them. McOppai is still McOppai. The protagonist is McGyver and the white haired girl is Not-Rei. Now this should be easier to write.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2:\\n\r\nEpisode 2 starts off with 6 or so minutes of dialogue between professor guy and McGyver. The entire scene is stretched to an unneeded length and contributes next to no exposition. There is no way, he could know any of the things, but he does, for some reason. Because this is episode 2 after the first episode with an insanely fast pacing, this is the slower episode in which nothing happens, except the actual introduction to the story. And guess what, it\u00b4s nothing more than fanservice and a \u201ccomedy\u201d cringefest. It\u00b4s funny, because McGyver thinks he\u00b4s going to jail.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 3:\\n\r\nEpisode 3 is 75% the same stuff as episode 2, in which nothing of importance happens and the anime tries to be funny, while being absolutely cringeworthy. There\u00b4s also this character, who is apparently an adult, but she looks like a loli. Not only that, but her only character trait is that she\u00b4s a Tsundere. I mean why do people like Haruhi, Kurisu or Asuka again? Was it because of character development or that they were extremly lovable. Naah, I think it was just because they were bitchy. Also, she and her partner are Hand Shakers. Also, their tragic backstory is that they have been discriminated. Also, the fight scene is disorientating and comes out of nowhere. The background is moving in a different way than the effects and characters, which makes it look obviously fake. Then the episode ends.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 4:\\n\r\nNothing of any substance or worthwhile development happens, it\u00b4s just cancerous CGI-porn. Watching real porn feels more enjoyable. Hell, why should I watch this, if I could watch porn? Exposition a shit in this series, yet again, nothing anyone says makes any sense. This episode feels like a filler.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5:\\n\r\nThis entire episode proves that not one writer on this show gives a flying fuck about sticking to the rules they set up. McGayverToo loses Not-Rei and she should probably die, but oh wait, then the show might end. Stupid me, let\u00b4s break the rules, we set up, in order to establish a melodramatic setup to the next useless fight. Nothing of substance happens. Also, no one makes any sense. McOppai is like \u201cI see you don\u00b4t wanna fight\u201d and her brother is like \u201cHe wants to fight\u201d and she\u00b4s like \u201cYou want to fight.\u201d What? I\u00b4ve never seen a character that stupid and I\u00b4ve had the displeasure of watching the entirity of Fairy Tail and Guilty Crown and Big Order and Code Geass. It\u00b4s the same shit as Ep.3, where it spends the majority of the episode doing fuck all, to set up the next episode, which is going to be SoOoOoOoooOO \u00e4\u00e4\u00e4pppiiiIiiIccCC!!!??\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6:\\n\r\nYou know, I actually had high hopes, that this show might pull some Hunter X Hunter or One Piece-ish stuff, where the battles are pretty strategic and center around one character trying to break through the other ones defense, oh wait, it\u00b4s just useless bullshit. The entire fight is a huge bowl of plot armor spilled out to write \u201cYou\u00b4re supposed to like this.\u201d I asked myself, why did Tsundere-Baka and her boyfriend have a sword and shit and everyone else has specialiced weapons? Probably because the writers didn\u00b4t know how to write characters.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7:\\n\r\nOH BOY; YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THE FILLER IN CODE GEASS!!?? THIS IS EVEN MORE RETARDED!!!! :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D\\n\r\nNothing happens. It\u00b4s all just supposed to be one pile of drama and comedy, that doesn\u00b4t fit into the story. After this episode, I was convinced that Not-Rei has absolutely no personality and only exists as a loli, for people to find cute. Also, there\u00b4s a plot twist, which has no build-up and still manages to be obvious from the start. How is this even possible? Probably because things only exist to look cool to their idiotic target audience.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8:\\n\r\nSo, after episode 7 being nothing more than filler in a sea of no plot progression, we get another episode of characters appearing out of nowhere and fighting out of nowhere. The ability of the couple, that I nicknamed Singy & Guyi, was actually quite interesting, but yet again no one deemed it interesting enough to make it into a interesting battle or even use good directing. There is also this scene, where Not-Rei talks about McGyver, but it just ends up looking like a desperate attempt at character devlopment. Oh man, I love empty females, reminds me of myself.\\n\\n\r\nPart 5: The summary\\n\\n\r\nAfter letting 8 episodes pass by, I decided that this should be the final part, before summarizing the main flaws in the anime. I will watch Hand Shakers until its end, thanks to my \u201cNo-Drop policy\u201d, but I decided that updating my review shouldn\u00b4t be a priority for me, especially if my exams started about two weeks ago. Therefore, I decided to summarize every point I have to get out to show how idiotic and dumb this series actually is.\\n\\n\r\n-Repetitive structure\\n\\n\r\nI already ranted on how entire episodes repeat themselves. As you might\u00b4ve noticed in my episode summaries, the show is beyond repetitive. Entire episodes are there for the sole purpose of having a fight scene in it and I can appreciate that in other shows. Some of my favorite anime have episodes full of over-the top, fast-paced action. Anime, like Jojos Bizarre Adventure, Hunter X Hunter or Gurren Lagann are this kind of anime. The problem with Hand Shakers is that it packs them with so few episodes in between, that the anime cannot \u201cbreathe\u201d. The entire plot comes off as boring, if every second episode is the same trash, with another dumb episode in between, that serves no purpose to the second one. There is no variety in either episode. On one hand, there is Slice-of-Life, while there is a fighting scene, which play out the exact same. How can one be entertained by this?\\n\\n\r\n-No plot progression\\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers starts as a story of two characters fighting against others. Now, tell me, where is it now? If you said \u201cIt\u00b4s still a story on how two characters are fighting against others\u201d, you\u00b4re goddamn right! You might say \u201cBut anime X didn\u00b4t progress and you liked it.\u201d Actually, it did. People might argue about One Piece having no progression, but consider the fact, that the structure in it is every so slightly changing. Then there is stuff like Serial Experiments Lain, where events are happening and affect the plot to move forward. Then there is Hand Shakers. Ask yourself this, if you would cut out everything that happened from episode 1, where the story really started, to episode 8, would anything change? If I would do that with One Piece or Lain or many other anime, this would affect the plot. If I would do the same with Hand Shakers, the entire story would be indifferent.\\n\\n\r\n-Ziggurat has no rules and the ones it has are broken\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reason the plot doesn\u00b4t progress is because there is no sign of progressing in the Ziggurat. Mirai Nikki told the viewer the amount of competetors beforehand, that\u00b4s at least something. That way, you would know whether there are 5 or 5 million people left to kill. There isn\u00b4t a time window either or a way to join the Ziggurat. So, what if someone becomes a Hand Shaker, when there is only one left? When does Ziggurat end? Does it end or is it a endless tournament of fighter, trying to eliminate each other? That would be awesome in a way, but you would still have to set rules. There are no rules, it\u00b4s just \u201cIf you met another Hand Shaker, you will fight.\u201d. That\u00b4s stupid. And what about the weapons? McGyver has a clock sword and shield and McOppai has cards, but the Tsundere couple has giant shuriken, if I recall so. How are weapons chosen for people? If I would join the Ziggurat, is my weapon of choice a rare Pepe? How is giving one couple a shield and a sword and another a giant shuriken or a power to change reality itself fair? Who came up with this?\\n\\n\r\n-Kirito & Yuno Syndrom\\n\\n\r\nSomething I notice a lot since having sat through SAO is \u201cKirito Syndrom\u201d. It\u00b4s when members of a character cast only exist for the sake of admiring another character. The exact opposite would probably be \u201cYuno Syndrom\u201d, where characters only exist to oppose a character or be an enemy to that character. Hand Shakers is the ultimate example of both flowing together into one, basically a giant sewer, if you want. Many characters, like McOppai or Not-Rei only talk about McGyver, in order to admire him or tell the viewer how big his dick is, but I don\u00b4t care about that. These characters only talk about him all the time. Do they get any development of their own? No, not really. Do they serve another role in the story? No, actually nah. What is even worse is characters existing as pawns to defeat. Couples appear without build-up, just to be defeated at the end of the day. These characters have no personality, no real backstory, no traits, they are just there to be defeated, so that we know how \u201cgreat\u201d our main character is. That is really dumb.\\n\\n\r\n-Horrendeus directing\\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned this earlier, but Hand Shakers directing is worthless. Actually, it has the worst directing I have ever seen, worse than Transformers, worse than Suicide Squad, worse than any terrible high school student film. I usually notice good directing a lot, but I also notice a lot of horrible directing too, mostly because I already did some editing myself.\\n\r\nThe first problem with Hand Shakers' directing is its rapid movement. Whenever something happens in a action sequence, the shot moves around really fast and all over the place, in order to emphasis as much as possible how fast the scene is. You might\u00b4ve seen some Hollywood movies, where they do the same, mainly to hide parts of a scene. In Hand Shakers, this is put to a new level, because the rapid movement of a shot makes it feel disjointed and overanimated. The place in one space, where things are, can get confusing, which makes it hard to follow such scenes.\\n\r\nEven worse are scenes, where nothing is happening. If you\u00b4ve ever watched a Quentin Tarantino movie, you know that they are full of action, but also have countless still shots, which are there to convey atmossphere or let a scene rest. Hand Shakers doesn\u00b4t do that. Every shot has to be animated as much as possible. There are shots, where nothing is happening and nothing of importance is said, which have moving camera shots, just to jerk off more animation into your face. There are barely shots, which are resting for a long enough time to let a place or atmossphere sink in, before it moves to the next shot. That is what makes the anime feel empty. There is literally no time for the anime to breathe, before it moves on.\\n\\n\r\n-Poorly handled exposition\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part about writing a story for me, besides making dialogue sound natural, is exposition. If you\u00b4ve never tried to write a story on your own, you don\u00b4t know how hard it is to make exposition feel natural. You can\u00b4t go around and explain the laws of your story by counting down everything your reader needs to know, because at that point it\u00b4s just a glorified school book. And, I have to say, the way Hand Shakers does it is beyond me.\\n\r\nEntire points of exposition aren\u00b4t conveyed like in usual media. There are characters, that act like they know a certain thing and build-up everything until they give it away, only to withhold that information. If you want to make a story, that makes sense, you have to give at least a minimal amount of exposition, but that doesn\u00b4t include giving away random Buzzwords, to sound smart. This is kindof exclusive to the start, but that doesn\u00b4t excuse it, because by that time, your viewers should know what a Ziggurat or a Nimrod is. After that, entire plot points are told in info dumps by the professor. Why not do that by the first episode? The anime was even leading up to it, but just didn\u00b4t. Who wrote this?\\n\\n\r\n-School as a catalysator\\n\\n\r\nYou might notice that many stories have a catalysator through which events can be created or bound together into one plot. This catalysator can be a character, a event, a place, it doesn\u00b4t matter. As long as it ties the story together or kicks it off, it works. The school in Hand Shakers works as that, a catalysator. The problem is that it isn\u00b4t the only catalysator, that is used in Hand Shakers. Can you name the other one? That\u00b4s right, it\u00b4s the Ziggurat. The Ziggurat is there to tie the characters into one narrative, which would work, if it wasn\u00b4t for the school. Characters appear there, just for the purpose of tying the story together twice, one time a couple appears at school and another time at Ziggurat. This is unnatural. Imagine, if all of the sudden Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Zombie Karl Marx and Hillary Clinton are at your school, for some reason. Sounds dumb and nonsensical? Well, so is this anime!\\n\\n\r\n-The music\\n\\n\r\nMusic as a asset can be a very important thing in your story. Whether or not a scene contains music can change it and whether or not it is good can change it too. Too bad the Hand Shakers soundtrack is absolute garbage.\\n\r\nWhen I think of the FLCL soundtrack, I think about how energetic and creative it sounded. It always fits the mood for FLCL. Whenever I think about the Hand Shakers soundtrack, I feel bored. There is no variety in the OST whatsoever. It\u00b4s all a mix of piano songs. Everything on the OST sounds the exact same. As a mood setter in the story, it doesn\u00b4t function. Every scene feels the exact same, boring. It is extremly unmemorable. Every piece of music is there to play safe. If the viewer hears something new, they might not like it, so we\u00b4ll tuudle the same thing over and over. They\u00b4re so dumb, they won\u00b4t even notice.\\n\\n\r\n-Disjointed flow and pacing\\n\\n\r\nThere is no pacing in Hand Shakers. Through the beforementioned repetitive structure, there is not time to breathe. With every episode of nothing happening, the story gets interrupted, before it picks up way too fast the episode later. The transition between these two states of hot and cold cause the story to feel even more unnatural. Imagine going from lifeless Slice-of-Life to a full-on fighting scene in the timespan of 3 minutes. There is no build-up between these two states. It\u00b4s just like \u201cHere\u00b4s a fighting scene\u201d and that\u00b4s that. There isn\u00b4t any time to given to build this up. Do you even know how unnatural this feels like?\\n\\n\r\n-Horrible character cast\\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers doesn\u00b4t have the worst character cast. That is because they can barely be defined as characters, rather they can be seen as random pixels on the screen of your computer.\\n\r\nThe main problem I have with the cast is Tazuna, which I dubbed as McGyver. The problem I have with him is his shallow personality. I expected, that he would get at least some development aside of being the 21st Century McGyver Reboot and having a little sister, that died. I was disappointed. There is nothing I can say about him, aside of that, because he\u00b4s that much of a empty shell, perhaps a GHOST in the SHELL and after he lost his sister, he should have a STAND ALONE COMPLEX!\\n\r\nAside of him, I already discussed the Kirito & Yuno Syndrom of this show, so mentioning enemy couples again wouldn\u00b4t make sense.\\n\r\nMcOppai and Not-Rei are only there to admire McGyver and have fanservice scenes.\\n\r\nThe professor is supposed to be smart, but also kindof silly for no reason other than lulz? Wut\\n\\n\r\n-Empty world\\n\\n\r\nA world can be something, that can create entire anime or stories overall by itself. If you do worldbuilding just right, you got yourself an entire story. However, if you do the exact opposite and neglect worldbuilding as a whole, you got yourself a empty story. Hand Shakers has none. There is, in fact, one place that plays a role in the story, that is the school and even that is of no use. There isn \u00b4t any development done. I couldn\u00b4t tell you, if a place is there or not, because the anime does such a poor job at conveying the location of something. Many other places are only there to serve a purpose in the story and be forgotten about.\\n\r\nEvery place in Hand Shakers looks generic. As predicted, the show takes place in a big, modern city in Japan. Thanks to this wonderful design choice, everything looks the exact same. Places in the Ziggurat battles are just giant, unmemorable fields in the middle of central. Every location looks the same and has nothing to it. After finishing a episode, you just forget about it anyway.\\n\\n\r\n-Fanservice\\n\\n\r\nNow, I don\u00b4t have anything against fanservice in itself. I mean, I look boobs, I\u00b4m just a simple dude. My problems start, when fanservice is done in a dumb way or is straight-up distracting. The thing with this anime and fanservice is that it puts it in, whenever it can. You know, having a character with tits, bigger than her head, jiggling them around by doing absolutely fucking nothing, that sounds like normal and useful fanservice. Whenever McOppai is on screen, her entire presence can be summarized by two words. That is not how you do fanservice. You don\u00b4t just put it in, because fanservice. That is stupid!\\n\\n\r\nPart 6: The conclusion\\n\\n\r\nAfter summarizing my thoughts about this anime, I feel like I am able to give a conclusion to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFuck Hand Shakers. In my entire lifetime, I have never seen a anime or a show in general, that was so incompetent and couldn\u00b4t do a single thing right in its entire runtime. It is the worst anime that has ever been produced, worse than Akame Ga Kill!, worse than Mars of Destruction, worse than Big Order. Hand Shakers is the final point, that shows that MAL needs to implement a 0/10 rating, because giving it a 1/10 is too much of a compliment for something, that has no redeeming qualities. There is nothing good about this anime. It is truly the biggest of all trainwrecks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thought: Make Anime Great Again",

For just \u00a319.99, you'll get this amazing package sent straight to your door, along with an apology letter from the studio who made such an awful piece of trash and a couple of cyanide pills, just in case, like many people, you feel like vacating this shitty world since you can'teven bear to go on for another moment knowing this atrocious trash exists! Why delay? Order today!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is terrible. Like holy hell is it bad! In every aspect and category this anime falls flat on its face  and there isn't an ounce of talent in this entire production. I would make a comment about it being a terrible light novel adaptation, in the same vein as something like Black Bullet, but this show is completely original! It has no light novel to blame; no manga to trash. The blame for this unholy piece of trash falls solely on the creators at studio GoHands, who, at this point, really need to GoAway (laugh track and applause at my completely funny and original joke). Last year, there were three anime, which I dub as the \"unholy trinity\" that being Divine Gate, Mayoiga and Big Order, but even these shows are nowhere near as bad as Hand Shakers because, at the very least, those shows were entertainingly bad. Hand Shakers is not that. It's like a boxing match that has lasted for thirteen rounds, dealing abuse after abuse to one person who refuses to give up. It's just pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has everything that I dislike in lazy writing and storytelling from the characters to the actual narrative itself. Nothing in the show was handled with any care and it seems the team was more concerned with pretty colours than making something worthwhile. It honestly staggers me that the score for this show if a five out of ten; it deserves much less. The story is about a young, boring man named Tazuna, who has one of the worst catchphrases ever. He constantly repeats the phrase \"It meshes!\" over and over again, and is just so annoying. He says the phrase in response to something that is going his way, or something that doesn't make sense since Tazuna here is someone who is great at fixing stuff...and the anime believes that a quirky personality is enough to make a character, neglecting development and themes. It's laziness at its finest and all of the characters are like this. Anyway, Tazuna becomes something known as a \"hand-shaker\", an ability in which he has to hold hands with a voiceless girl named Koyori, who awakens from a coma after he touches her hand, and after touching hands, they can activate their powers.  After this, they're told that they have to fight against other Hand shakers until one person remains to be granted a wish from God himself...for some reason. They explain that this power is a gift bestowed by God himself but there is no basis for this and instead feels tacked on instead. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's main problem is that there is no investment or intrigue in the narrative at all. The audience has no reason to care for anything that is going on since the show never gave us any reason to care. Who cares if Tazuna gets his wish granted and survives? Who cares what the other hand shakers want to do, or the reason why they fight? Aside from very brief, cliche backstories and exposition, the show hardly delves into why these characters want to fight and it feels disjointed and clunky. Not only that, the show has so much melodrama and all of it is so damn forced. From the very first episode, I knew the entire backstory surrounding the main character and his little sister that when they do try and present it as a twist in the series, later on, there is no effect since this has been replicated so many times before. Call me genre savvy, and perhaps I am, but that is still no excuse for lazy, forced drama and backstories; something that Hand Shakers can't even replicate when it's the most cliche route to go in an anime of this nature. Aside from that, the entire show feels like an empowerment fantasy, with the main character suddenly gaining a bunch of random new powers which he pulls out of his ass to conveniently defeat the enemy, and the show even has incest sub tones with a sister character called Riri, whose tits bounce up and down every time she so much as moves her eyeballs. Every terrible anime has some kind of strange incest vibe going on, made even worse by the lolification of one the of characters who is supposed to be in her twenties but she looks like she is twelve. There's also this stupid gimmick in which the two main characters have to be holding hands constantly, otherwise the girl will die or something, thus they have to sleep together and also bathe together, leading into a lot of moments in which Tazuna feels embarrassed, just for the sake of putting a naked loli into this show somehow. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has so many drawn out friendship speeches in which the main character goes off on tangents about how much he loves Koyori and how much you have to \"mesh\" with your partner, that it comes across as completely cliche, especially for shows of this nature. The final fight in the show was also pretty anti-climatic despite the build-up and despite these characters being hyped up as the strongest in the show, Tazuna defeats them even easier than the previous opponents he fought. The pacing for this show is also pretty bad and moves at such an erratic flip-flop pace that it feels like a chore to watch (aside from all the other things that make this show a chore to watch anyway. One moment they're fighting for an entire episode and the next they spend the entire episode cooking some food in a restaurant. Now, downtime in shows is a good thing, and I wouldn't mind so much if the characters and the pacing weren't so boring!\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but the show has so much cheap shock factor that it feels laughably pathetic. I addressed this also in my Black Bullet review but shock factor is perhaps the cheapest way to make the audience feel sorry for a character who is as interesting as a wall since it requires no effort. Just throw cute, adorable girls on the screen with some hardships and the Otaku will eat that trash up. In terms of the narrative, there isn't a single element, or idea, that I felt was well executed or interesting. Not a single one. And I tried really hard, REAL hard to think of one thing, just ONE thing that this show did right in terms of story, but, try as I might, I failed since there isn't a single thing in the entire narrative that is good. It's a mess and by far, one of the biggest train wrecks I have ever seen before. This show is a masterclass of how NOT to write a show and if you want to get into script writing then this show is highly recommended to get a taste of how not to mess up your story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't fare much better either. Not a single one is interesting in terms of design or personality while receiving minimal development and growth. Hell, half of the characters in the show are completely forgotten about after their introduction and never referred to ever again. Tazuna is your boring typical, self-insert bull for all the ten-year-olds watching this fecale matter and Kayori is mostly loli-bait for all of the filthy weebs. They do attempt to develop her character through a backstory at the end, but this is far too little, far too late and leaves no impact, especially since the story was executed so poorly. The sister and brother character does receive some development but is mostly forgettable but their love feels off-putting and strange. I understand they rely on each other since their parents split up but they seem a little TOO close for my liking. Other characters include the final opponent, who tries to be intimidating but fails, and an idol, who at the very least has a purpose and goal, but she is just as dull as the rest of them. The twenty-year-old loli and her partner are perhaps the only two characters with some kind of development but it's hardly anything, and definitely nothing substantial enough to raise the bar. Each one has got some strange personality or quirk, such as the idol manager who speaks and moves really quickly, but the writers believe that just making a character eccentric is enough to warrant the creation of a three-dimensional character, which is as far away from the truth as possible.\\n\\n\r\nEven just the basics of shot composition and cinematography, this show messes iit up. The camera is constantly pacing around in strange directions with strange and experimental shots, which are more distracting than visually appealing. The Monogatari series also has random and unconventional shots, but in that show, the dialogue between the characters was interesting and always had my interest, and the shot composition matched the strange allure of the show and worked in its favour. Not here, however. The general look of the city makes me want to puke with all of the sparkly silver, which looks mostly computer generated. The character designs have this strange, bright glow to them, which I dislike looking at. When the characters are standing still, there can be some nice looking colour artwork in the background, which I can find somewhat appealing, but when they're in motion, dear God, it's like watching two Barbie dolls fight. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the characters fight, the camera pans around them in strange ways, constantly moving. This makes most of the fights feel so disorientating and confusing to watch since it's hard to gain an understanding of the relative positions of the characters in reference to each other. Combine that with some horrible CGI, makes for not only a terrible script but an awful aesthetic as well. Trust me, if your eyes could puke, they would. The only half decent thing is the music, which is decently composed but is not very memorable. The opening was alright, but it reeks of laziness in the visual department since they don't even bother to try and create new visuals for the show; just splice in some actual scenes from the episodes and call it a day. Who needs effort when people will like this trash anyway?  As previously stated, the show also likes to throw boobs in our faces any chance we get with Riri, and Jesus Christ, these are some of the worst boob physics in anime. Not only do they constantly shoot this character from low angles but every time they bounce, I swear I can feel the Earth shifting on its axis towards the Sun, coming ever closer to that sweet embrace known as death from this shitty show.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, stay away from this show, at all costs. It's so lazy, so mundane and so incoherent that it makes me want to throw up just thinking about it, and I swear this show made me lose about five-hundred brain cells. Anime deserves better than this, and GoHands can GoFuck themselves for producing this asinine piece of garbage, to add on to their other asinine pieces of garbage.",

            "content": "I feel like this anime is getting far less than it actually deserves. Yes, it isn't a great anime, but that doesn't mean it's so horrible to get 1's and 2's so frequently. I guess it might be people's personal grading systems. In my own way of grading, this anime deserves far more than a 1.\r\nThe art is great (in my opinion), but they take it too far that it ruins the framerate. The camera is also being moved around too much. Even a life-action movie doesn't have a camera that spazzes out THIS much. The bad moments are watchable, and the good moments areACTUALLY good. \\n\r\na 7/10 from me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts interesting.  The concept of getting together to gain power is way overused. This anime does exactly the opposite. Staying away from eachother becomes dangerous.\\n\r\nI wish they'd add more to this rather than making it pointless. This concept might aswell be dropped completely because it brings nothing actually important to the story in the end. It could've been something entirely different and it wouldn't have changed anything. I wish they put more meaning into it.\\n\r\n(Honestly, I wish they didn't incorporate generic shounen concepts. I believe it would've been better if it focussed on romance, but whatever, what it COULD've been is of no matter now.)\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a simple pattern: the protagonists meet other couples and fight them, (and for obvious shounen reasons win without any former experience, and if not, survive without any repercussions.)\\n\r\nThus it is easy to predict what's going to happen next. There are no mindblowing plot-twists, there aren't any in the first place.\\n\r\nHowever, it's not like there are any plotholes, rather, there is hardly any plot to begin with, so it isn't really hard to watch (since you won't get frustrated by stupid mistakes), but it's not something you'd want to put effort into watching either. It's bad, but not horrible.   3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character are, and many people will probably disagree with me, original.\\n\r\nBesides the MC, the characters all have something unique that hasn't been used often. \\n\r\nOr maybe it's because I haven't seen over 300 anime to know that it actually HAS been used often?\\n\r\nHowever, in some cases this aspect of them gets overused and seems rather forced. \\n\r\nThere is zero to none character development, but character development is really overrated. There is a reason that there is a term called 'flat character'.\\n\r\nYou shouldn't expect much character development from a 12 episode anime that focusses mostly on action and the connections between people, it doesn't need any! The characters are interesting enough to last for 12 episodes..\\n\r\nOn another note, they're pretty cute as well, so if you're a fan of fluff, there's plenty of it in this anime.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nI like the opening theme and the sound never seemed off to me. I never really paid attention to it but I'd notice if it was bad.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo far I enjoyed watching this anime, but it's not like I'm looking forward to the next episode every week.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's a very meh anime.\\n\r\nIt's not horrible, it's not great. A good pick for people just starting out with watching anime, but not a great watch if you've been spoiled by amazing anime...\\n\r\njust... meh...",

He entered his office and noticed a sheet of paper on his desk.  He recalled his secretary saying that an intern left it for him to consider.\r\nThe director read the sheet in front of him:\r\n\u2013 Title: Hand Shakers\r\n\u2013 Synopsis: In modern times, Tazuna, a young boy who enjoys fixing and learning mechanical equipment, encounters Koyori, a very beautiful mute girl.  Upon this \u2018fated\u2019 encountered, Tazuna and Koyori are immediately paired as Hand Shakers, i.e.partners, chosen by \u2018God\u2019, who can summon magical weapons called Nimrodes.  With this new power, they must fight other Hand Shakers in a world called Ziggurat.  Only one Hand Shaker can win.  And only then can \u2018God\u2019 grant their wish.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, many questions lingered in the his mind, such as \u2018why name the series Hand Shakers\u2019, \u2018why are the magical weapons called Nimrodes\u2019, \u2018what is this place called Ziggurat', \u2018why did God chose the main characters as Hand Shakers', etc.  But, he digressed and assumed everything will answered (P.S: it doesn\u2019t).  Plus, it was an interesting synopsis.\\n\\n\r\nThe committees and production companies approved the new show and, soon, production began.  The director started with the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nHe knew it was simple.  Just hire veteran voice actors, such as Tomokazu Sugita, Yoko Hikasa, Jun Fukuyama, etc, and good musicians, and they will sell the show for you.  Everyone wants great voice actors and music, so it made sense to get the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe director, then, focused on the art, script, and character departments.\\n\\n\r\nHe said, \u201cThose in the art and character departments must follow their director\u2019s orders down to the last detail, and as for the script department\u2026do everything to help the script writer compose a great script.  That\u2019s all.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd with those last remarks, everyone began to hustle to their departments.\\n\r\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\\n\\n\r\n[Brilliant!]\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWe need more artist visuals, while possessing the same art style as \u2018K'!\u201d yelled the art director, looking at the intern.  \u201cDo you have any suggestions?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe intern said, \u201cUh\u2026how about using CGI and photorealism?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe art director thought about it and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea. No, that\u2019s a brilliant idea!  Get a pen and write down everything that I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he replied, getting a pen and notepad from his desk.\\n\\n\r\nThe art director began to speak.  He said, \u201cThings to Include in Hand Shakers.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 A grayish, metallic-looking font will display the opening credits and will roll across the screen in big letters.\\n\r\n\u2013 Things that need to be in cheap CGI: fire, chains, cars, gears, swords, claws, dragons, buildings, some backgrounds like grass and trees, etc\\n\r\n\u2013 Things that need to be photo realistic: buildings and its interiors, the sky, grass, menus, books, paintings, phones, etc.\\n\r\n\u2013 Have regular character animations with fine details and rich in quality, and have them \u2018mesh' with the CGI and photo realistic images.\\n\r\n\u2013 Add some outline traces to emphasis the characters with CGI or photo realistic images.\\n\r\n\u2013 Add tons of color filters.\\n\r\n\u2013 Add lots of random pedestrians moving around, while the camera pans around.\\n\r\n\u2013 Include multiple random still shots of people standing around, or pan the camera to the glorious blue sky.\\n\r\n\u2013 Include many random panning movements towards the sky, the ground, or away from buildings or other objects. \\n\r\n\u2013 Have slow and low frame-rate animations for certain scenes, while the action scenes are fast and inconsistent.\\n\r\n\u2013 \"Boobs have random jiggle movements\u201d.\\n\r\n\u2013 Characters must appear younger than they seem.\\n\r\n\u2013 Have lots of awkward camera movements.\\n\\n\r\nThe intern said, \u201cThis list is perfect!  If we include everything here, then I\u2019m sure the audience will be thoroughly impressed!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art director replied, \u201cI know, it\u2019s absolutely brilliant!\u201d\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[\"Development\"]\\n\\n\r\nThe character director, returning from a meeting, entered his office, and noticed an assistant in the guest chair.  He walked to his desk, sat in the chair across from him, and asked, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAh\u2026yes.  We had just finalized our characters by adding distinct personalities, appearances, and other minor details.  We wanted you to review it, and see if some characters needed some personality or appearance adjustments,\u201d the assistant said, giving the piece of paper to the character director.\\n\\n\r\nHe received it, stared at the characters list on the sheet, and was surprised that there were many in the show.  He viewed the descriptions and appearances for the main characters:\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Tazuna: a generic protagonist, who is kind, caring, and boring.  Likes fixing and learning about mechanical equipment.  Appears like a shotacon.  Nimrod name is Single Gear.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Koyori: a pretty and cute, young girl, who is mute (until episode 9) and expresses very little facial expressions.  Resembles Tazuna\u2019s deceased younger sister.  Clueless, and very helpless, she depends on Tazuna for every little task (until later in the series).\\n\\n\r\nThe character director, then, viewed the remaining characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Break/Bind: first Hand Shaker couple.  Break is an aggressive and dominating male (possible sadist), who uses flame chains as weapons.  Bind is a docile and caring woman (possible masochist), who enhances Break\u2019s chain ability.  Both characters don\u2019t have any character development.  Potential S&M couple.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Makihara: a weird and outgoing \u2018scientist\u2019 and researcher, who likes to make conversation and provide key details about Hand Shakers, Ziggurat, God, and wishes.  Was previously a Hand Shaker.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Tazuna\u2019s Parents: their real names aren\u2019t given in the show.  They have no distinct personality, nor any character development.  They make food, clean the house, and comment on mundane stuff.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Tomoki: a classmate of Tazuna and Riri.  He has blond hair, and has no distinctive personality nor any character growth, other than to ask the main characters for assistances and to comment on his hobbies.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Chizuru/Hayate: second Hand Shaker couple.  Chizuru is a short woman, who appears like an elementary student, despite being the manager of a restaurant.  She has a sharp tongue, yet is caring and nice (possible Tsundere).  Hayate is the subordinate of Chizuru, and the tallest character in the anime.  He has a relaxed and easygoing personality, though sometimes apologetic.  Both work at restaurant called Cocktail Corn.  Their Nimrods are shadows.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Riri (Lily)/Masaru: third Hand Shaker couple.  Riri, who is kind, caring, and very bubbly, is the student council president and the older sister of Masaru.  She is sometimes an air head and whines occasionally.  Masaru is the younger brother of Riri and is in middle school.  He is very protective of his sister and cares deeply about her.  Their Nimrods are cards.  An incest relationship is implied.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Hibiki/Kodama: fourth Hand Shaker couple.  Kodama is a wannabe idol with black pigtails, who likes to spout random quotes.  She has a cheerful and confident personality.  Hibiki, the manager for Kodama, is dedicated by nature and acts very professional.  It\u2019s possible that Hibiki is a Lolicon.  Their Nimrods are swords.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Mayumi/Nagaoka: final Hand Shaker couple.  Mayumi is similar to Koyori (i.e. they are twins).  She is cute and mute.  Nagaoka is socially awkward, and has a hard time making conversation.  They both don\u2019t talk very much.  Both characters don\u2019t have any character development.  Their Nimrods are Cocoons.\\n\\n\r\nThe character director placed the paper down, and said, \u201cI like the character designs and their personalities, but most of these characters don\u2019t have any character development.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s quite unfortunate, but\u2026you can\u2019t have character development if you never had a set of personalities to begin with.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWait, are you implying that most of these characters never had a personality to begin with?\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWell, yeah.  Because, if they did the viewer wouldn\u2019t be able to relate to them.  Having a complex character would only confuse and frustrate the viewer.  This is a simple show, and simple shows need simple and relatable characters.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026,\u201d the character director said, making a perplex expression.  \u201cOn a side note, there are quite a number of archetypes in this show.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThat is true, but it\u2019s expected.  I mean, we have the typical archetypes like the non-developed main characters, the useless classmate and parents, the tsundere, the idol, and the incest siblings.  All of these archetypes make the show more enjoyable.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI see\u2026,\u201d  the character director said, thinking whether to adjust the characters or not.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, he shrugged, and said, \u201cAfter thinking about what you said, it seems all the characters are fine.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe assistant thanked the director and left the office, while the director smiled knowing that the show will succeed.\\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Filler Content]\\n\\n\r\nA box of DVDs given to him by the producer.  A deadline approaching in one month.  An incomplete script.  The script write knew the deadline was coming, but he ran out of ideas.  He asked the producer for some advice, instead he received a box of DVDs and was told to watch them.  He did as he was told.\\n\\n\r\nThe script writer was becoming weary, but after several days, he finally finished the last DVD.  He noticed that every show he watched had two things in common: filler content and a simple structure.\\n\\n\r\nHe realized he needed those elements.  With his mind full of ideas, he began to write.  He wrote the script for Episode 3, then 4, then 5, and so on.  Satisfied with his work, he handed it to the producer to review.\\n\\n\r\nThe script writer said, \u201cThe DVDs helped a lot.  I realized that I needed more filler content, and a simple structure.  The structure being: fight episode, then slice of life stuff introducing the next Hand Shakers, then fight episode, then slice of life stuff introducing the next Hand Shakers, and so on.  It\u2019s simple and predictable.  And that\u2019s what the audience is looking for.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe producer read the script and asked, \u201cSo Tazuna always wins?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d the script writer said.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAnd there will always be a slice of life stuff like boring, meaningless conversations, and cliche events that add no character development?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\"And there is barely any plot development?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYeah.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d the producer said, looking at the script again.  \u201cOkay.  I approve this script.  It\u2019s simple and effective.  Just what we needed.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe script writer smiled, knowing that his work is finally being recognized as great.\\n\r\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\\n\\n\r\nThe director reviewed the works from the three departments.  After a few minutes, he glanced at the producer, then the two directors, then back down at their works.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cGentleman, I have looked over each of your works, and I have to say\u2026you guys did a damn fine job!\u201d the director said, smiling.  \u201cIt has everything.  Great art style with distinctly new visuals, great sound design, a simple and \u2018coherent\u2019 story, and engaging characters.  And the best part is\u2026we have a high budget, so we can render those new visuals both in photorealism and CGI.  It\u2019s going to look amazing.  It\u2019s going to sound amazing.  Hell, this show will probably be contender for best anime of the year!  I can feel it.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe director thanked the producer and the two other directors for their hard work.  He dismissed them, and they left his office room, until only he remained.  Getting up from his seat, he went to the window, gazed at the blue and white sky, and hoped what he had said would come true.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that it did.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter the show\u2019s season had ended, people around the world praised it and hailed it as an artistic breakthrough in animation visuals and plot.  Studios began incorporating CGI and photorealism in every frame and slide, and moreover, made their plots simple by adding more filler content and useless dialogue.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, ends the tale of Hand Shakers, and how it became the Best Anime of the Year!\\n\\n\r\nThe End",

            "content": "In 2010, Cartoon Network greenlit a show called \"The Problem Solverz\". It attempted to compensate for its boring/obnoxious characters, choppy movement and horribly inconsistent writing by having bright, flashing, seizure inducing visuals and a high concept that was made to disguise the fact that the story in actuality went nowhere. It was hated by everyone pretty much immediately and taken off the air very quickly.\r\nIt seems history repeats itself. \r\nAs an attempt by Japanese Studio GoHands (best known for the painfully average K Project), they created Hand Shakers for the Winter 2017 anime season. It attempted to compensate for its boring/obnoxious characters, choppy movement andhorribly inconsistent writing by having bright, flashing, seizure inducing visuals and a high concept that was made to disguise the fact that the story in actuality went nowhere. This time however, it manages to set the bar so low, that it could possibly be the worst anime series to be released in this entire decade.\\n\\n\r\nThe first aspect any keen viewer will be able to notice is the art and animation. It fails in so, so many ways, and it only gets worse the further into the show's trench you go. Every color is made out to be as bright as possible, like the entire show was waxed with a car bumper. Color contrast doesn't exist, shadowing to make darker moments serious doesn't exist, nor any common sense on the production team. Actual color placement can be impossible to see. Like, whose idea was it to give a character with white hair the palest face and body imaginable? Distinguishing body details? A thing of the past and the future is Hand Shakers! Then there's the movement. The first episode has CGI chains moving like CGI that in no way fits with flat character models, and everywhere else has CGI backgrounds that our flat (both figuratively and literally) characters literally SLIDE through instead of being animated. If something is animated, expect it to move at like, 15 frames per second. In some cases stylistic artwork can compensate for lack of movement, but not here, when they try to make the backgrounds look as realistic as possible with flat characters models lazily pasted on. Or with an aquarium CGI effect that comes off as nothing but disorienting. ESPECIALLY in the OP. The show gets your eyes's attention, but not in any pleasant way.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode, you see how overeager the director is to tilt, and pan and zoom the camera all over the place. He wants to make a style, but combined with the overly bright and shiny color palette, it only results in the audience wanting to head to the nearest sink to puke. Even an emotional scene isn't free of the distracting camera tilts. A scene involving an idol character is shot to never actually show her lips while singing. It makes an already terrible looking show come off as outright nauseating.\\n\\n\r\nAll this and I haven't even discussed the frustrating dearth of plot yet! Similar to how K Project attempted to cash in on the Durarara craze two years late, Hand Shakers wants to cash in on the popular survival game craze (Deadman Wonderland, Mirai Nikki, Fate/Zero, Btooom) over five years late.  A game called the \"Ziggurat\" causes pairs of people known as Hand Shakers to challenge each other with the hopes of meeting God and making their wishes come true....:.and that's it. No more plot than that! Character relationships exist but until the 11th episode's massive plot reveal, don't mean jack crap. Most episodes exist for two purposes, make a fight scene or have an overly long, boring string of filler and exposition back to back to reintroduce us to characters we saw two episodes ago. It's like every time they add a new Hand Shakers they have to remind us characters exist! As far as the games themselves go, you'll find more logical rules in No Game No Life, a show which did a lot of this stuff right but had problems when it came to making its rules consistent. There's no real specific setup for any fight and when there is setup, it's handled in the laziest, most last minute way possible. The fight between the protagonists against President Big Boobs and Card Kid is a shining example of how NOT to establish a fight scene. It's somehow made worse later by an exclamation that might've made the two episode long fight obsolete entirely! \\n\r\nSee my colleague CodeBlazeFate's review for more on why the Ziggurat game is COMPLETE bullcrap, but there's issues outside of just that.\\n\\n\r\nJust about every single fight scene takes place in the wide open streets of their city, and yet somehow, aside from the people directly fighting, literally NO ONE ELSE notices the massive fight going on. It's not like Yu Gi Oh where fights take place in a separate dimension, all of them are in the REAL WORLD, and no one does anything to interrupt a fight. Or even peek out a window. It makes the scenes look more empty than the Market City in FoodFight. And you NEVER want to be compared to that horrific disaster. Even Mirai Nikki, terrible as it was, crafted its survival game in specific spots so that it would go unnoticed by the public, or even possibly reported as news enough to get cops on the case. Hand Shakers is so one tracked that this isn't even possible.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with all of the time devoted to either fight scenes that lack much in purpose or at least 3-4 completely pointless filler episodes in 12 episodes, how does the show resolve? [b]HORRIBLY![/b] Not only are the final revelations about backstory completely rushed and out of nowhere in the penultimate episode, but the final one ends with instant redemption and an FU teaser. Even if you wanted some reward for the heroes for all the crap you've waded through, too bad! Nothing to see here. I thought it was problematic when Angel Beats rushed its final revelations and padded itself with filler  but that is NOTHING compared to this unfulfilling slog with no ounce of heart or good animation that show contained. What you're left with is dead air with no payoff whatsoever, the worst kind of writing I haven't seen since Gunslinger Stratos The Animation.\\n\\n\r\nEven the sound mixing is totally bunk. Little to no music exists in the non-action scenes, and when it appears in action, it's often soft piano pieces or the joyful music type you'd see in a Spyro game. It works in that context but the lack of actual ACTION music removes all tension that could be in the fights to make them EVEN MORE boring. The final episode uses a vocal theme sound in dubstep, WHILE whispering, so it's impossible to even hear the song. Oh, and the OP and ED are completely generic. Nothing to say here except, the sound designer was probably as high as everyone else when crafting this show, its world and its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters....oh boy. Much like The Problem Solverz, the cast is either entirely bland or annoyingly obnoxious, with incredibly phoned-in performances. Starting with our main character Tazuma, we find out from the first episode that he's a schoolboy who's a really good mechanic for his age. And that's it. Throughout the entire series, the main character remains just an ordinary schoolboy who wouldn't look out of place in a toy commercial show, only with a sister to hold hands with. Hell, he honestly gets WORSE because the mechanic trait is pretty much entirely dropped when he gets involved in the game, save for having a plot device clock weapon. Meaning his character got worse for not doing one of two possible things. \\n\\n\r\nHis \"sister\" Koyori is even worse. For most of the show she remains silent, possibly so the audience can bask in how cute she is. Unfortunately that's all to her. Any chemistry she has with Tazuma feels off-putting, and unlike say, Gangsta, her lack of speaking isn't circumventing in any way when put in a scene. Besides, of course, talking later. Don't worry, nothing comes of it and speaking gives her even LESS personality.\\n\\n\r\nEvery enemy pair can be summed up in just a few words a piece for how little character you get. There's hardcore biker & bondage masochist, Tsundere & Baka, Idol & Star Wars kid with choppier animation than usual, scientist twin & sister twin and last but not least President Big Boobs Chan and Card junkie.\\n\\n\r\n These last two are special because this show tries to tackle a serious topic with them. You see, President Big Boobs chan has a massive, massive obsessive crush on her little brother. Related brother. Her wish when appearing towards God is basically to be with him forever. Despite them....fighting together, holding hands to win the incredibly vague crown? The incest soon becomes her only character trait, she constantly obsesses over her little brother and the show barely resolves this. It's pushed so so much and never seen as directly wrong in any way that it gives ANY other incest-related anime look better by comparison. Not freaking kidding. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, there's the scientist guy. Basically GoHands's attempt at one of my personal favorite characters Okabe Rintarou. He's quirky, is keen on giving exposition, acts weird when there's barely anything to hide besides history with another scientist, and appears as a mentor to the main character Tazuma. There's nothing more to him than that though I suppose those few character traits make him the best character by default. Still doesn't do ANYTHING for the plot besides introducing the main idea\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, if you're a character in this show, you either are one note, become worse than one note, or barely do anything for the plot. At the end of the day you're left with a horrible cast that brings nothing new to the table, barely contribute, and make this  miserable excuse for a show into flat out irredeemable annoyance and boredom.  \\n\\n\r\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\n\r\nThe final episode is called Shake the Hands, which is exactly what I felt like doing to the makers of this series. With extra shocking joy buzzers to whoever thought this was a competent finished product. I'm sorry but this show was just flat out asinine in every way. Awful animation, awful directing, awful writing, awfully bad music choices, awful characters and most of all some of the worst art directing you'll ever see. Unless you want your eyes to suffer, STAY the HELL away from Hand Shakers. \\n",

            "content": "WARNING- Unlike most of my work, this review contains explicit content\u2026 reader\u2019s discretion is advised. \r\nFor fuck\u2019s sake. I thought I'd do something a little different in this review, and start off with a few haikus that accurately illustrate Hand Shaker\u2019s impact on my well being and emotions.\r\nMy eyes are bleeding\r\nMaybe possessed by demons?\r\nNo, just Hand Shakers\r\nIf a bus hit me\r\nI would be a vegetable\r\nAt least no more pain\r\nHand Shakers is like\r\nCancer was personified\r\nAnd is your roommate \r\nThere you have it. Sometimes an anime comes along and creates so much buzz amongst the community that you can't help but check it out. The phrase, \u201chowbad can it be?\u201d constantly surfaced from my vocabulary prior to watching Hand Shakers, and after 12 episodes I can say with confidence that I survived the impossible. It goes far beyond the \u201cso bad it's good\u201d realm and into the \u201cso bad it\u2019s a precursor to suicide\u201d side. This is truly the worst series I have ever watched, and it isn't even close.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers at Studio GoHands (K) have a hard on for sadism. It's as though their anime pitch went something like, \u201cI\u2019ve got this great fucking idea about people that hold hands to randomly use badass weapons, and there\u2019s some unfappable fan service in there too\u201d. And to think that some masochistic prick actually gave it the green light. Hand Shakers is the result of no one having a single fuck left to give when it came time to write a show up for the season. On top of it, they had the nerve to tarnish the legacy of my favorite gaming franchise, Mega Man, with the synopsis\u2026. \u201cIn the year 20XX\u2026\u201d Are you fucking kidding me? It's not paying homage, it's like putting dog poo in a paper bag and lighting it on fire on Keiji Inafune\u2019s doorstep.\\n\\n\r\nIf someone told me that by holding hands with a complete stranger could cause me to harness the power of something called \u201cnimrodes\u201d, and make everyone in the world want to blow my ass to smithereens\u2026 well I would've let that bitch die in a heartbeat. Who comes up with these names? Nimrodes is one letter away from effectively summarizing the personality of everyone on Hand Shakers staffing bill. And what takes the cake is that they're trying to fight against God himself. As if holding hands with a coma-struck lolli is going to get you further with that insurmountable task. The plot is nothing short of atrocious. A monkey obediently pointing at objects on a screen could piece together a more coherent storyline than this.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the story unfolds into an even bigger, chaotic mess. Tazuna and Koyori, our hand shaker extraordinaires, go from dueling a fucked up bondage couple to some kids that love card games, making light of the fact they're attempting to overthrow the man upstairs the whole time. Hand Shakers fails at almost every turn to impress, and it isn't even the slightest bit believable within its own inconsistent jargon. It's reminiscent of watching a homeless drunkard trail off in one of his timeless tales, only to end up wetting himself in front of you and forgetting who he was. Nothing seems to follow in a digestible plot line, and believe me, I tried to look for something\u2026 anything that could salvage this anime. It just isn't there.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing, as expected, is nothing short of a disaster. The dialogue reminds me of watching two middle schoolers arguing over a Yugioh card battle. The lines \u201cYou'll never defeat me!\u201d and \u201cI'll get you next time!\u201d were just some of the Pulitzer Prize-winning excerpts from the anime\u2019s script. The comedy is as humorous as oral surgery, only without the laughing gas to put you under. It almost comes across as unintentionally deadpan, an inscrutable attempt at making us laugh. Originality was left at the door, as all your basic tropes are present: the cute lolli damsel in distress, the awkward Chibi main protagonist and tons of stereotypical side characters with as much development as Koyori\u2019s chest. And the fanservice\u2026 oh the fanservice. It's definitely there, but the manner in which it's presented (i.e., through its choppy visuals) made me want to chop my dick off. Most generic anime often rely on cheap fanservice to grab as many views as possible, but in Hand Shakers\u2019 case, I think it does more harm than good.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of us who've experimented with LSD or various types of acid/shrooms, the visuals in Hand Shakers can be summed up as a bad trip. I was intrigued by the \u201cunique\u201d art style for all of two minutes, until I realized I wasn't watching a PS2 cutscene. I assumed anime in 2017 had at least some minimum standard or acceptability criteria for animation, in which Hand Shakers would clearly fail the quality assurance inspection. It's like watching someone play a video game with continuous lag. The main character models are creepy as hell, providing an ominous juxtaposition to the childish demeanor Koyori and Tazuna exhibit throughout the series. The environments are rather plain, which only cause the jutting visuals to stand out even more. I thought when I saw how nauseating the chain scenes were in the first episode, things could only get better\u2026 but I was sadly mistaken as I began to trudge through the series, growing more weary with each passing second.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sea of the ghastly and unacceptable, I'd have to say the sound in Hand Shakers, though uninspiring by itself, was the only decent aspect of the anime. The sound effects were believable and the voice acting showed some promise, most specifically with Ai Kayano\u2019s role of Riri. The OP was quite lackluster, as the anime world seems to shovel these JPop titles out ad nauseum. Vibrant yet generic colors stifle your senses as the cliched vocals pierce your eardrums. Same old, same old. The ED was possibly my favorite track of all, the only saving grace for a monotonous soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I did it. I cannot stress enough the level of effort on my part to actually make it through a series of this \u201cquality\u201d without dropping it. This may be something used for torture viewing in the future (right up there with Baby Geniuses 2), and I applaud my fellow reviewers for sticking it out the whole length of the show with me. If I could compare it to anything, it would be Mars of Destruction\u2026 only not funny. I recommend this to absolutely no one, and as you can see by my overall reaction, neither should you. Hand Shakers should be taken down from every streaming site on the internet, and every hard copy buried in the desert (much like ET on the Atari 2600). Lock it up and throw away the proverbial key.

            "content": "So I watched Hand Shakers because I heard it's the worst thing ever. Of course, this same thing is being declared about every series ever by people who have not seen every series ever. For this reason I approached it with the same skepticism I approach the \"best series ever\" claims. And once again the exaggeration was real, and Hand Shakers was more or less like the \"best series ever\". \r\nSure this series doesn't have many good things in it. It has lots of bad, but none of the bad in it impressed me in any way. It's not advanced awfulness, terribad clusterfuckery, not evennauseating shit. In fact, it just offers a mediocre view on bad. Series such as Code Geass and Clannad did an impressive job building all the depth and factors that made these series garbage in almost every possible way. Hand Shakers seems more like a parody of those. Instead of offering its own unique take on unwatchable trash, it rather seems to be made for ironic viewing without any seriousness \\n\\n\r\nOne important thing to note about this series is how it challenges the viewer's intelligent. The concept of holding hands is a direct middle finger towards all those \"deep\" and complex anime series where instead of the characters holding each others hands - the anime itself is holding the viewer's hand. This one doesn't do it. It couldn't care less if you fucking like it or not. This series is also a reverse-ripoff of Franxx with more subtle. I can totally dig into that. #not a pun\\n\\n\r\nFor a borderline softcore hentai, Hand Shakers does quite an impressive job with the boob wiggles and tentacle-like chain movements. The scenery is colorful, detailed, and the animation is nearly as glorious as in series like Kemono Friends, Houseki no Kuni, and Kingdom season 01, so it passes. The story on the other hand is definitely better written than Code Geass R2, and I highly enjoyed it despite it being a mixture of vomit and piss, so I can't complain.",

There is some promise within the general idea behind it and the two main characters, but the barfy animation, nausea-inducing perspective and laughably bad CGI already tells you that you're in for some bad time, straight from the first few minutes of the first episode. The randomly-inserted fanservice and absurd BDSM themes also stand as a clear warning of what's to come. \r\nWhat's maybe most laughable here is the unironic use of all the most annoying anime tropes. We have brother/sister incest, a 30-years old lolilooking like a primary schooler, a Japanese idol whose dance animation felt as if they were ripped straight out of Stephen King's \"It\". We have nonsense, cryptic intrigue using random historical/mythological words, absurd motivations for the villain... It is, essentially, a kind of \"everything we don't like about anime\" compilation or a guide on how not to make a decent series.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's outlandish enough to have a bit of the \"so bad it's good\" quality.

Don't get this wrong, I really like the colorful and splashing animation style, but the CGI style doesn't match the anime at all and makes me feel really uncomfortable.\r\nThis feeling lead me to the \"poor\" plot( of the first 4 episodes). I don't get, what this anime really try to be...the story continues achingly slow, the fightscenes were the only interesting thing so far and the other half of the story does't get my attention either. I have to say that the music did a great job as supporter and makes the action scenes really enjoyable to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important point to talk about are the character designs and development.

The CGI style is still  a disrupting factor, but if you try to focalize on the animation it doesn't matter at all.

            "content": "Anime originals.  Creating original anime has the crippling fault of being the source in existence, meaning, if the anime doesn't fulfill everything it needs to do in order to complete a story by its own merits, it can and will fail stupendously.  So, with a name as ridiculous as 'Hand Shakers', it's not hard to see how GoHand's (how fitting) original show flopped so hard.\r\nStory:  Takatsuki Tazuna is a boy in high school who acts as a handyman to anyone who needs help.  Any device that's broken, he can fix in a jiffy.  One day, while arriving in a placeto help someone named Makihara on a job, he finds a sleeping bedridden girl who's hooked up to life support.  Reaching down to grab her hand, the girl suddenly awakens and the two are then thrusted into a battle with a weird S/M couple without any word or warning.  \\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers according to the show, are a pair of individuals who 'charge' their power by holding hands.  When two pairs of Hand Shakers are within a 1 km radius within each other, the two pairs are forced into battle in a place known as the 'Ziggurat', where they use powers and weapons known as 'Nimrods' to fight each other.  The pair who wins gets to keep being Hand Shakers while the pair who lost loses their power entirely and are out of the game.  It's said that the last remaining pair of Hand Shakers will be able to meet God and fulfill whatever wish that the pair so desires.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite having a tournament style plot that to some extent, has potential, the idea of having holding hands be a key aspect of the whole series is personally, a laughable way of trying to be unique.  Though it may be ridiculous, that is not the thing that makes this show a laughingstock and a crying shame.  The biggest problem with Hand Shakers is the overindulgence of style over substance.  The show primarily focuses on our two main characters fighting various pairs of Hand Shakers (5 to be exact) and inching their way closer to meeting/challenging god in order to fulfill their wish.  The problem is, the two don't really have a wish.  In fact, our pair of protagonists only have any form of motivation to continue forward once more than half of the episodes are over.  As such, the story is stuck in this loop of characters just dealing with problems as they go along without any character motivation moving them along aside from just getting to the end.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature of how the Hand Shakers work, each pair has their own reason for fighting.  The problem is, the show reveals the motivations for each pair so late in each respective mini-arc that by the time it's over and done, there's no reason to care for them.  In fact, the show doesn't even give you a hint as to what each respective pairs' problems are until after their defeated, then dump all of the info via backstory and monologue onto you expecting to care for them after they've been defeated and their struggle no longer matters in the series.  This kind of writing is what kills the series, and it persists through every pair of opponents that our main characters meet.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as positives go, Episode 11 stands as the series's high point.  The episode gives us much needed backstory to the whole situation of the series, and actually gives the audience a reason to care about what's going on.  But yet again, the flaw of \"too little, too late\" rears its ugly head, as by the time the show makes it to this point, the audience has little reason to give a damn because everything thus far has gone so picture perfect and the end result is extremely predictable.  The ending also has a confusing set of circumstances that honestly don't even make any sense.  I feel like GoHands just threw whatever they wanted at the end because the ending does not make any sense at all.  There's no definitive conclusion, there're things in there that were never shown before, and we don't even get to meet God.  You bastards.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hand Shakers' story is an example of wasted potential, as the idea of reaching God had a variety of directions that the show could go.  But because Hand Shakers was too focused on style over substance, the story became a bland piece of work that only served to move the characters from one fight to another.  The show doesn't try to do anything new, and the characters all having skin-deep motivations gave the audience no reason to care for anything in this show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Episode 11 arguably the best episode (though that's not saying much)\\n\r\n- Show gives no reason to care about anything\\n\r\n- Style over substance\\n\r\n- Forced character motivations\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As the show gives almost no reason to care about the characters and their stories, the cast is filled with characters that in sense, feel like either they don't want to be there, or that do only care to do so for about an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nTakatsuki Tazuna is the main protagonist in Hand Shakers, and his character is about as colorful as the white his hair becomes when he's fighting.  It's difficult to describe his character because Tazuna virtually doesn't have a personality to call his own.  The show makes it feel like the only thing he's good for is protecting the girl he finds named Koyori.  When he does finally get some semblance of reason to fight in the series, the end reason becomes \"We're together\", which is one of the laziest reasons to ever tack onto a character.  If you separate him from his little girlfriend, there's almost nothing to say about him.  \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Akutagawa Koyori, Hand Shakers's little doll.  As expected of the partner of our bland protagonist, Koyori does...actually nothing.  The majority of the series has her be this stiff, emotionless figure that only at the end, does something useful.  In cases like these, the caretaker (Tazuna) is supposed to make up for the character that does nothing (Koyori) by fulfilling a both roles and making up for both of them by having character traits and a personality that can encompass both of them so they don't feel like a hindrance to the overall story.  But when your protagonists both have nothing to them, the end result ends up becoming nothing as well.  (0 + 0 doesn't equal anything other than 0)  I don't blame Koyori for having nothing to do with the story, as it makes sense in the show's context, but her being a natural hindrance while her partner is an unintentional failure in the same sense of contributing nothing only furthers why the story's content is bad.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the rest of the cast, made entirely up of other Hand Shakers that our pair of protagonists encounter (and one tutorial guy who basically does all of the info dumping).  As mentioned before, all of these Hand Shakers have forced character motivations that are only told at the end of their arc, which by then, we have no reason to care for them because it's already painfully obvious what's going to happen if the first two episodes are any indication.  Not only that, but each pair has their own unique dynamic which seems to be the only character trait they have.  This 'character trait' of theirs gets repeated over and over and over and over again throughout each of their arcs, and persists even after their time in the spotlight is over.  This gave me less of a reason to give a damn about them because their repeated behaviors irritated me to the point of not caring even more than I already didn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n- Bland main protagonists\\n\r\n- Annoying and equally bland side characters\\n\\n\r\nArt: Despite how poorly GoHands managed to screw up on Hand Shaker's story and characters, thankfully, the concept of 'style over substance' was consistent throughout all parts of the show.  Made with a strange combination of CG done in a handdrawn artstyle, Hand Shakers bears a unique style where everything is fluid like handdrawn animation, yet is done in a way that can only be executed by computer graphics.  This artstyle has its ups and downs, but largely gives the series a very unique look.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is split into two different aspects.  Fights, and normal everyday scenes.  For both of these styles, the colors that're used are blindingly bright to the point that it becomes a little hard to discern colors, yet still plays to the series's strengths.  The everyday scenes are detailed and actually quite nice to look at, though these scenes are the less intensive parts of the show.  The actual kicker to all of this are the fight scenes.  Due to the nature of devoting almost solely on computer graphics, the show has a lot of effects during the battle, a great deal of fluidity, and manages to use its bright and vibrant artstyle to its advantage to make everything look like a moving palette.  The problem is, the fights are a little too fluid sometimes.  During fights, the show likes to use a variety of nauseating camera angles while the characters are moving which make it both hard for the audience to see and understand what's going on.  I personally felt a little sick watching my screen with some of the fights with just how much was going on.  Despite that, the art is still a genuinely good aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Aesthetically pleasing\\n\r\n+ Managed to make CG look good\\n\r\n+/- Bright colors (sometimes too bright)\\n\r\n+/- Fluid fight scenes (Warning: May cause nausea)\\n\\n\r\nSound: In terms of sound, Hand Shakers also has a surprisingly good OST.  \"One Hand Message\", its opening, has an energetic rock beat that, while isn't the most memorable song to exist, has positive merits that compliment the wild action that the show exhibits.  Its \"Yume Miru Ame\" on the other hand is a more somber piece that personally I wasn't a fan of.  The notes are far too screechy for a supposedly somber piece, and I couldn't stand listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, Hand Shakers also has a notable array of BGM that's worth noting.  Battle music like \"Dust Trail\", more emotional pieces like \"Aism\", and others utilize a lot of piano and synthesized piano to create music that not only fits with the show, but puts weight on the fight scenes and other moments that they're used in.  They give the illusion that the characters are actually doing something meaningful, and while they may not have been too effective as I still didn't care for anyone by the end, these tracks are genuinely good and actually nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great tracks\\n\r\n-  ED is less than stellar\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: I went into Hand Shakers not knowing what to expect.  Sure the title was ridiculous, but I've watched more ridiculous things before.  But when I started, I realized that this show was going to end up being a mistake.  By the end, I just did not care.  Hand Shakers was so devoid of meaningful content or anything for me to give a damn.  It's not bad enough for me to loathe this show and spit on it for everything that it stands for, but the show gave me so little reason to care about ANYTHING that was happening on-screen that the overall experience just felt like a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI actually really like some of the Nimrod designs; especially the intricacy of Tazuna's gear sword.  The use of CG was well done and gave the show a layer of detail that I greatly appreciated.  The show's aesthetics and soundtrack are by far the best parts of the show and create a good amount of nice-looking still images and nice music to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I was truly irritated by was the character 'quirks'.  Each of the Hand Shakers have their own quirk (be it fawning over your younger brother, yes that's in here, or reciting off quotes of famous people like you're a goddamn scholar every other line) that made me care about them even less than I already did.  Not only that, but the show repeats these various quirks, and it gets quite annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is honestly not worth your time.  Despite its good art and decent soundtrack, the lack of story and proper characters makes this show an experience not worth having.  If anything, I'd suggest just googling images of Hand Shakers so you can appreciate GoHands's work on the show's look, and finding the tracks of the show so you can listen to how good the music is.  Beyond that, Hand Shakers isn't worth the investment.",

This show has nauseating graphics and camera effects with badly integrated 3D (coming from a guy who enjoyed the new season of Berserk so it's not the concept I don't like), the characters are empty, the story makes no sense and I would fear that a newcomer watching this show as a first anime because the opening looks fine and the synopsis sounds cool would then be discouraged to watch any more. \r\nIf the concept presented by this anime interested you, I would recommend No Game No Life, that hasa similar concept but that was realized way better, and if it was an example of fluid graphics and cool visual effects that got you wanting to try this, please first consider both seasons of Zestiria the X for the VFX or Berserk (2016) for the 3D. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the music/sound, pretty much the only part of this show that is decent, I would still recommend Hunter X Hunter over this, or alternatively Kill la Kill if HxH seems like too long of a time investment for you. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this comment helped at least one person avoid this show, or at least make them realize that this isn't what anime is about and that there is way better out there. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, for anyone watching this of their own will and enjoying this anime, good for you. Seriously, there is nothing wrong with liking any anime, regardless of its objective value, anything you enjoy watching is what you should be watching. However, I would like you to consider the points I made earlier about newcomers before giving this a high note or complaining about bad reviews. It's ok to disagree with the majority, but this kind of site has reviews to help people who can't decide whether to watch the show or not and I think that there are enough shows out there for you to find better than this whatever your tastes are.",

            "content": "*TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.*\r\nHand Shakers was and is the greatest show of Winter 2017... or so I wish I could say with full confidence.\r\nWelcome to Hand Shakers, quite possibly the worst show of Winter 2017 and of the year thus far. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it will most definitely be the worst show this year, by miles. This is how horrendous this show really is. \r\nHand Shakers entails young Tazuna Takatsuki and Koyori Akutagawa whom are Hand Shakers: receivers of the Revelation of Babel or some shit,and are destined to fight God himself via... holding hands? Well, it couldn't possibly be that bad, right? Wrong. So wrong. Not only is the story itself poorly executed, just about everything else went dreadfully, discounting the art (the one saving grace of this show. Also, Koyori is kinda cute, but I'll talk about the characters more later). Watching this show will absolutely make you want to throw up from motion sickness, as they constantly shake and move the camera during fight scenes. In fact, there are very few instances where there is action going on with a still camera. Not only is the just the cinematography style bad, the animation itself is just so bad it's laughable. So many scenes of the characters running in place whilst moving the background making it look so... gross, and many other things such as poor human movement or bad scene-switching. And the CGI... oh man. I could go on and on for days about how terribly animated this show was (curse you, GoHands), but let's move on to how the characters were.\\n\\n\r\nBad. That's how they were. MC Tazuna has a catchphrase of \"I made it mesh!\" or something similar. Now, there's an art to picking a good sounding catchphrase that doesn't tire and sounds good. For example, Naruto Uzumaki from the Naruto series \"dattebayo!\" This doesn't get boring or overly annoying. Tazuna manages to to make his catchphrase sound so frustratingly annoying within the first three times he uses it, which blows my mind. You then have Koyori, who ***spoiler alert here*** is a mute for just about 9 episodes, then starts talking. And she only talks about being together with Tazuna. That's about it for her lines. ***end spoiler here***\\n\\n\r\nAlong with that, the characters and enemies they meet range from a hardworking couple, a sister and a brother (the sister is a brocon), an unpopular idol and her rather unfit manager who moves around like a superhuman (part of being a Hand Shaker, I guess...) and an edgy scientist. There's also Makihara, the \"teacher\" like figure who constantly contradicts himself and won't stop talking about shumai. This vast character pool would have at least one interesting character, right? Wrong again. None of these characters last more than 2-3 episodes (other than the main cast and some supporting characters) and they aren't touched upon except in the worst ways, like the brocon girl.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Hand Shakers is quite possibly the worst anime in recent years and you will not benefit from watching it whatsoever. Watching it in itself is hardly enjoyable, due to the many animation and character flaws it holds. I will never be able to recommend this show to anybody, even those masochists our there much like myself who can manage to finish this show. Take it from me, and do not watch this show unless you're really into some hardcore handshaking.",

Hand shakers....Battles....God....Wish...Koyori. Plot is almost nonexistent, things just happen and we know next to nothing about the handshaker thing or even about the main chars. There are a lot of fight sequences and by GOD they are awfully edited. 10FPS with strange camera movement and composition. Blink and you are lost. It really looks like that they are trying to be really unique and artsy with their wonky camera angles and movements but it falls flat. Only good thing to sayabout this anime is its Art style and backgrounds. Style looks too good for this anime and this is of course excluding god awfully CGI. Backgrounds are vibrant and they really are well made and detailed, especially pan shots of building. Sound design is stock af and sounds at times like cat walking on piano and very easy to forget. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict.\\n\r\nInterior decorations of the rooms in this anime really summarize Hand shakers; empty, pretty coloured and lacks substance. I don't know about source material but this is a bad anime.  This regained 1 point after seeing 9th episode. It wasn't much but seeing even slightest of development in main chars. is bonus. Motives and plot are still mess so if something completely game changing doesn't happen this is final. 4/10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "HandShakers, is it the worst anime ever? Pretty much every review says yes, but when it comes to me, I like to see the good in things, but in this show, it's Really hard.\r\nHand Shakers is pretty much fate stay night but with generic anime character, the main character is this boy who looks like a grade school student and suddenly he is paired with this silent girl who has been comatose for a long time, so they have to fight all these other pairs and win so they can get a wish granted by God.The main hook of the story is so  thefact that the two main characters can't let go of their hands or they die but this concept is thrown out the window.They fight using powers called \u201cnimrods\u201d but the only \u201cnimrods\u201d are the people who edited this mess, it's like the scenes got jumbled out of order and it's very weird.Also this has to be the worst thing they could do, but you expect to see people fight each other. You do get that for like one half of the episode and literally the next hour and a half is just nothing but pure BOREDOM.OMG I was begging for something to happen I mean come on.They do the regular fighting but after two or three of those, the show slows down so quickly I think I got skidmarks. The second to last episode is just a regurgitated fest of exposition and the ending begrudgingly was alright, but really see why people drop this show.It's really hard to get through.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlrighty then, the hardest part to talk about is the animation.It was done by Gohands who are masters of chromatic coloring,see \u201cK\u201d for example.In this show though, you can tell where they were going for but it doesn't completely work. What actually shocked me was that the main director and art director both worked on K, so if they did work on this they were probably drunk as hell.The show tries make everything in the background animated on par to what's in the foreground,but it all looks slow and sloppy, some of the characters disappear before even leaving the fucking shot.And what really doesn't help at all is whoever directed the camera movements .There is this one scene where someone gets a close up but they are walking towards the camera so they just disappear and it's very weird.Alsk the camera has the stupidity to try to follow the characters around when they fight and it made me so freaking dizzy.This one girl jumped like two blocks to hit this building and bounced off and just went back. WTF. The 3d can sometimes look good (if the show was released in 1999)but when it gets involved with 2d and the crackhead behind the camera, it can look very bad. Getting to the art, its fine but just so overwhelming, the hair looks so fake, and the background is just Bleeeeh. There are times when it zooms into the background but it's low in resolution.There is one part that looks decent. it's when the pair enter the fighting world and all the walls have cool looking designs that come to life and it looks kinda nice.That\u2019s the nice looking flower you see in all of the trash in the dumpster.\\n\\n\r\nNow the BEST part of this show hands down (seriously if you think anything about this show is better than the sound,there is something wrong with you.)I watched the dub, cuz Funimation is the best, and it's alright.The soundtrack sounds like a bunch of royalty free computer leisure music from  the youtube editor.Not only that but i feel like if I bought the CD, it would be like 20 minutes long.There are like 5 songs on the soundtrack.But they don't sound too bad.The foley was alright. I The best song is Dust Trail for sure.It\u2019s like a mash of ballroom dancing music with orchestra and its very good.I recommend to listen to it on your own.The opening was done by Oxt who did openings to Overlord Season 1 and 2.Those opening themes weren't my favorite,but after hearing \u201cOne Hand Message\u201dI can see why they are so popular.It's super addicting and kinda unfair that they have to be put with messy eye gouging opening visuals.The ending is freaking beautiful too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are kinda clique but there are very weird turns taken with them.The main character and the emotionless girl are bland but I can't say the same for the others. Including a girl with Hypopituitarism, another girl who is actually a.pedophile, and also another girl who uses the powers of orgasms to break the ground around her.Despite that, the actual interaction with each pair is decent.One pair uses cards.Another pair can only use her nimrod after using hand sanitizer.The route they went with the two MCs wasn't bad,but the execution made the show BORING AS HELL.There was one episode moment that lasted 5 seconds, but it did a good job of showing interaction between the two characters but that was the only memorable thing in the whole episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI can see why everyone trashes this show ,but I don't hate it with a passion.It's just forgettable.The story is alright but done way better.The animation and art had potential but it was just too overwhelming and lazily put together.The soundtrack is not bad but it sounds like stock music.And I can appreciate the personalities of each pair but the MC and the girl interaction was just so freaking boring I was tearing up from yawning all the time.This show is pretty freaking bad, but people are just overreacting.People who say this is the worst anime ever probably haven't seen all the other trash that anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\n I feel sorry for Gohands right now....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I want this show known for its awful CG animation,  I want this show become a good show they deserve. \\n\\n",

            "content": "GoHands, the studio that makes this statement clear in their branding - \"Animation Entertainment to Advance\". GoHands presents a parody to their company goal - Hand Shakers.\r\nStory - The entire premise of Hand Shakers is flawed and should've been changed during pre-production. The premise could've had changes made to allow a less awkward development and scenario between all of the characters. It forces certain characters to do illogical acts to try and keep the series' drama and motives to battle each other. The original creator, rather than making changes to the premise, decided to try and work around it, which resulted in the series digginga hole further and further.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is capped and limited by the amount of time spent on completely unnecessary scenes, such as the repeated gag of one of the characters being short. There are also plenty of other mundane scenes which does not help to grow any characters or plot developments what-so-ever.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art in this series has a lack of colour coordination, that any professional colourist should be capable of. Some scenes have very vibrant colours, and has a sleek look with many shiny surfaces and light reflection. In other scenes, colours will suddenly go to a much more bland look that reminds me of 1970s decor.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every background art is rendered in CGI, which a few hand-painting things like leaves and grass over the shot. But most of the time, uses a single tree image and does a copy, paste to several in a row, making scenes look completely unnatural and repetitive. Cameras will be placed at very odd angles and do unnecessary movements that will make you nauseous. \\n\\n\r\nThe CGI in general, is very patchy and made up of poorly textured models which makes the backgrounds look more akin to films outside of anime, known as Ratatoing and The Little Panda Fighter.\\n\\n\r\nThough thankfully, most of the character designs actually look great, and are coloured very nicely. The character animations can rarely be jerky, but for the most part keeps consistent quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The music is very nice, and even though it doesn't have the epic sounds of most action series, it really works well with the pacing and mood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects can sound a little bit like stock audio files on royalty free sites, but doesn't really impact the experience of the anime after you spend most of your cognitive thinking power trying to follow characters through the wacky pans and flips and rotations.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors' performance can sometimes sound forced, although it might sound more cringe due to the bad scripting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - You wont know any more about a character that you will have seeing them for their initial 3 minutes on screen. It will keep on re-iterating their personality type and complex for the rest of the entire series (so far).\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters seems to be the least fleshed out, as each arc in this series always focuses on their enemies, leaving very little time to build the relationship between Tazuna and Koyori. Koyori being potentially the most interesting if we could ever get a look into her mind.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The series has at least kept me interested enough not to drop it, but as I watch each episode, my patience decreases slightly. Being a 3D modeller, I would sometimes pause on scenes have a little giggle to myself over the poor CGI being presented.\\n\\n\r\nWhat a shame.",

            "content": "IMPORTANT: There are enough reasons to watch this. Because you won't know it if you'll like it without even trying. So just try it. Watch 2-3 episodes and reach to an conclusion. If you like it you watch further, if you dont you drop this\r\nAlso this is my first review so you shouldnt read this unless you are interested about my opinion.\r\nBefore the anime aired there was a lot of hype. Even I got onto the hype train.\r\nBut it was all for nothing read further to find out why it was an utter disgrace.\r\n***************************\r\nSo lets start with the story:\r\nI have watched 5 episodes now andI can say the concept is great. You have 2 MC that fight others to get their wish fulfilled kind of like Fate/Stay night where they needed to get the holy grail.\\n\r\nHere we dont know anything about how you actually get it fulfilled. They tell us that after they defeated all other Handshakers you'll meet god. Which I am not sure of if its actually true.\\n\\n\r\nBut the bad thing is how bad they handled the story. They don't tell us much about the story and I feel like I'm being left out of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story keeps repeating itself. They meet some cool people, they get friendly and suddenly they reveal themselves as Handshakers. And this keeps happening over and over.\\n\\n\r\n***************************\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\\n\r\nOh god. Its bad. They tried to make the graphic so good that they sacrificed the framerate. Its like putting graphics to extreme in GTA 5 on a Intel HD Graphics.\\n\\n\r\nThey used so bright colorfull colors that my eyes start to hurt after watch half the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThese angles they are using are also really annoying. I will really be lucky if I dont end this series with naussea or epilepsy.\\n\\n\r\n************************\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\r\nThe sound is something else I really liked it. Well uhm I would have liked it if it was played in another anime. Since they are playing happy music when its sad and when they are fighting. \\n\\n\r\nThe K project, which Handshakers is being compared with was good enough. I liked the music while the fighting and the music style/genre turned when it got serious\\n\\n\r\nBut Handshakers is really the worst in this. I really wanted them to get serious with non happy music. But they dont show anything sad. Now Im getting a bit to far onto the Character category but I need to include it in this part. They get thrown into something really big, they are kids HOW do they stay so calm. They lost their normal life and get forced to fight. WHAT is this....\\n\\n\r\n**********************\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\r\nLets just say no character development. Still know nothing about Koyuri and the MC. The MC keeps repeating the word 'Meshing', which is original but really annoying. We got some character development in the first episode but that was it. nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nKoyuri doesnt say a thing. Nothing. \\n\\n\r\n*************************************\\n\r\nLets now talk about Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nOh god can I just skip this section??? This was the worst anime that I have seen even the Naruto Shippuden fillers are better than this. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime keeps bugging me like hell. Its annoying. And I still regret hyping for this anime. I like that the animation studios dont make things so obvious. The cliches gosh too many to count!.\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nSo overall I'd give this anime a 1 out of respect for the other animes that were bad but not this bad. I'd love if some others animation studios to take over this story and remake it. Because this is too much for me. I hyped myself for this anime as the number one anime from this season. But it was all a lie.\\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\n*****************\\n\r\nSo now we get to the conclusion. Should you watch this?\\n\\n\r\n- if you like happy go lucky stories you should like this one too.\\n\\n\r\n- if you like a colorfull color palette you should like this.\\n\\n\r\n- Do you like much bloom and flares in the animation you should like this\\n\\n\r\n- If you like cute boys/girls who shake hands almost the whole time?\\n\\n\r\nThere are enough reasons to watch this. Because you won't know it if you'll like it without even trying.\\n",

So excited that you'll be jumping around your room in joy?\r\nThat was me and a few other's simple reactions to the PV trailers for this anime.\r\nKnowing that the same studio that made KK, GoHands, was making this anime, I got really excited. I found much enjoyment in KK, and I was truly, deep inside, looking forward to this anime.\r\nAnd then, when the subs came out on the exactrelease date, I immediately clicked on it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all I can say about it.\\n\\n\r\nI'VE NEVER BEEN THIS DISAPPOINTED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.\\n\\n\r\nIn all of the years I've watched anime, I had NEVER seen this much laziness in a show.\\n\\n\r\nEVER.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't Pupa levels of bad.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't Mars of Destruction bad.\\n\\n\r\nOhohoho, this is FAR worse.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\\n\r\nStory. What story?\\n\\n\r\nYOU MEAN THE CLICHE PILE OF TRASH THEY THREW AT US?!\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, did they even attempt to at least write a decent story? Because from what I saw, they clearly didn't.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single line felt lifeless, predictable, shallow, etc.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on at how bad the story in this, but you wanna know the worst part?\\n\\n\r\nTHE IDEA THEY WAS ACTUALLY INTERESTING!\\n\\n\r\nSure, it wasn't the most original idea, but it definitely was one that peaked the interests of many, and we haven't seen many plotlines like that in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nNope!\\n\\n\r\nThey decided:\\n\\n\r\n\"Hey, let's just make the laziest excuse for a story that we possibly can!\"\\n\\n\r\nSuch a good concept was wasted on laziness.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nArt 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll give GoHands the credit where it's due: Some of the frames in the show were absolutely stunning to look at. It'd be enough to get a person's panties moist. \\n\\n\r\nBut, I'm just gonna let out the enormous elephant in the room.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CGI.\\n\\n\r\nOh god, I've seen '90s cartoons with better CGI than this.\\n\\n\r\nLike, there are video games with crappy CGI that are absolutely terrible, and they put much more effort into the CGI than Hand Shakers did.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just so unappealing to look at!\\n\\n\r\nAnd the chains, OH GOD THE CHAINS.\\n\\n\r\nThe earlier episode of Veggietales look more appealing than Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nDorbees looks more appealing than Hand Shakers.\\n\\n\r\nThat's saying a whole lot.\\n\\n\r\nJust imagine a Chocolate Truffle, with the interior being sewage, while the exterior is just chocolate.\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically the art in a nutshell.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the series, without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the music, other than it not being the best music ever, but it isn't really the worst either.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOh. you mean there are CHARACTERS in this anime, and not just cardboard cutouts?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, what an absolute shame.\\n\\n\r\nThese have to be the most dull, clich\u00e9, and lifeless characters I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThey're just so one-dimensional and forgettable. Heck, the only notable thing about them were their character designs, and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nDo I remember any of their names?\\n\\n\r\nNope.\\n\\n\r\nDo they have any memorable traits?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely not.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like they took out pieces of computer paper, scribbled on them, and said:\\n\\n\r\n\"Yep, these are dynamic, fleshed-out, memorable characters that an audience will absolutely love!\"\\n\\n\r\nThey're basically flat characters, accompanied with flat writing.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat did y'all expect me to rate this?\\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly not surprised if they use this anime to torture people or something.\\n\\n\r\nIt took me so long to make this review as a whole, because of how much I was dreading to go on with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut somehow, I finished it without dying.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm only giving this a 2/10 because no show is completely \"bad.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis show had so much potential to be great, but it ultimately wasted it all, and resulted in being the pile of garbage that it became.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, if you want to torture yourself or your friends, look no further than watching Hand Shakers!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The art is atrocious and makes no sense. The studio couldn't even composite the characters into the backgrounds properly, which ended up with many scenes where characters are standing still and are sliding around on the floor. Plus, the perspectives make absolutely no sense. \r\nThe directing is equally as bad with horrible framing and shots that break continuity constantly. They even break the 180 degree rule and have scenes where the scene will have a cut which completely reversesthe direction of the scene and makes it almost impossible to follow what is happening. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is almost non-existent and the music, especially the OP, is comically bad. \\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely no establishment, progress, or pay off of any conceivable plot or characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe only enjoyment that arose from watching this atrocity from start to finish was from watching this with a group of friends and being absolutely dumbfounded by everything that was going on. Only watch this with a group of friends or if you want to see just how badly actual human beings are able to fuck every single part of a production up. I honestly don't think I could even come halfway close to making something this bad intentionally.",

Other than that it's art style for characters is pretty nice to look at.\r\nOpening -- Song isn't bad, maybe a little pacy and lots of high motion.\r\nNormal Animation -- Usually not bad some parts of the first episode were a little laggy.\r\nEnding -- Song is another neutralthing but animation really isn't a big deal there due to lower key music tone.\\n\\n\r\nHow is the music in the background, well it complements it quite well the fighting sequences usually have more upbeat music in the background. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I have finished watching the series, the story is definitely different, though the end leaves on a cliffhanger of meeting God?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe an OVA (Supposed Episode 13 \"Go ago Go\") which is apparently a prequel seems to be focused on pre story stuff. Though this new character in it who is apparently called K\u014dichi from my research. This new character looks similar to that guy who was seen at the last seconds of Episode 12. I don't think a 20min OVA will cover the stuff after as well.\\n\\n\r\nWelp time to go back waiting for Index III or the next season of Railgun\\n\\n",

This is my personal opinion. \r\nSo I started watching this anime when the 4th episode had aired, and I was just trying it out because why not. \r\nI really find the colours and how they contrast to be amazing as well as the animation that is what totally lured me in! \r\nThe story is unique to some extent, and I have no idea why but it always makes me want to watch the next episode! \r\nI honestly did not think I would like this anime based off the description sogive it a try!\\n\r\nI love the characters and I always wonder of the man girl will ever talk. I wont state any names because I hate spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so thanks for reading!:)",

            "content": "The battle tournament/ survival game genre is something that always catches my interest due to it's massive potential. It's a quick and sure-fire way to have epic battles, dynamic characters and a thrilling ride of suspense. Even an average writer could make a good survival story. A terrible writer, however, can only produce garbage. Hand shakers could very well be the worst anime to Grace this genre.\r\nLet's get straight to the elephant in the room: the art and animation. I don't understand how Gohands( what is it with Japan and weird names?) Could produce something as beautiful as k project then make this dumpster fire.The show tried so hard to be advant garde by combining 2d and 3d animation but the director hadn't the slightest clue what to do. The CG is painfully poorly rendered to the point there are ps2 games with better graphics  There's also the poorly handled camera that just spins around without any real meaning. I'm guessing the director was going for a cinematic feel but it felt like the show was made by a child playing with his phone. Viewers are bombarded with oversaturated rainbow vomit colors you can find on a bad Wattpad faction cover. More colors don't mean better art If there's no rhyme or reason put into it. Some people even claimed to have gotten nauseous from these pathetic visuals. I'll admit the actual character designs were good and I liked the outfit worn by the mc. His jacket is chic and looks good enough to be sold in fashion retails.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was completely dull. Not a single song stuck out to me and I forgot every piece of music as soon as it ended. I understand not every anime can get that Iwasaki Taku or Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack but at least have something noteworthy in the audio-visual department to distract viewers from the clusterf*ck story. I liked the voice acting in the English dub and I would've never watched this boring show with subtitles so that's one positive I guess.\\n\\n\r\nTime to finally get to the real meat of the show. Or maybe it's vegan meat cause it's completely bland boring and a utter waste of time. \\n\\n\r\n ( Cue dramatic narration in the voice of Optimus Prime)\\n\r\n  Fierce opponents from all across Japan battle to enlist in a legendary tournament to own the right to talk to God. The battles are daunting and survival is not guaranteed. Only one boy and his basic bitch girlfriend may come out supreme.\\n\r\n  ( End credits)\\n\r\n  And that's the entire show in one paragraph. Episodes either have bland mc and basic bitch go on a date or have them battling other fighters. Let's take a quick look at the setup.  Why are the weapons here called nimrods? I understand the old definition means mighty Hunter( I researched it so the show indirectly taught me a new meaning) most people would immediately think of an idiot. What's also idiotic is why the area these teens fight in is called a ziggurat. It's another biblical term that refers to a temple. These people are never in a temple so calling an empty space a ziggurat is stupid and pretentious. I just know the writers thought they were being clever with the naming. Anime has this weird fascination with using religious terms simply to look cool without any thought put into it.\\n\\n\r\n There isn't a lot to say about the story since this show is as superficial as it gets. It's utterly cluttered with archetypes and badly animated fights. Let's make a list of the cliches shall we\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Emotionless quiet girl\\n\r\n\u2022 quirky scientist\\n\r\n\u2022 Laid back parents who don't question the obvious\\n\r\n\u2022 sadist and masochist duo\\n\r\n\u2022 pop idol\\n\r\n\u2022 a loli who's actually an adult\\n\r\n There's more but you get the point.  The dynamic between the characters felt drier than the devil's ass. Tazuna wants to protect hiyori cause she looks like his dead sister and hiyori wants......???????  Other contestants include a brocon sister who wants to be by her brother's side forever, a pop idol who wants to remain in fame and a businesswoman who wants to be taken seriously. With motives and personalities so boring, it's hard to care who wins and losses.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's worse is that the entire tournament was for nothing. Tazuma wins but he never talked to God.  Thanks for cementing your complete lack of skill dear writers. we never get to find out anything about this god and the show ends.\\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend watching hand shakers. You might have fun laughing at how bad it is but the atrocious visuals and lackluster cast make it hard to sit through.\\n\\n",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nTo keep it short. I did enjoy the concept and a lot of ideas in this Anime. The bonds, past and general lives that were presented here were quite conflicted that made the story fairly emotional.\r\nWhat I did not enjoy. I felt that the story was way too fast pace and another thing I disliked that the story constantly built us a fairly interesting world, powers and concept but it kept growing it's sense of mystery. Building sense of mystery in 12 episodes Anime is a seriouspunch in your face. It's one of those Anime that basically tell you to read the source material. As Anime simply fast quick paced intro to the world.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I will have to mention about each section of this review is the general mixed feelings I got from this series. As for story, I felt it had lot of good, but at the same time I cannot really praise it as much as I would like to. I simply cannot explain, but the emotion it gave me in general was \"kinda good, but not quite\" . Or to put it simply, mixed feelings is the cause of my inability to give it more credit/praise score-wise. \\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nWell, studio behind this is same as Anime \"K\", which means we have very unique, different, colorful and alive art & animation. Even if wasn't as impressive as in Anime just mentioned. It was still highly enjoyable. Action and some camera pans felt very awkward at times, and low framerate didn't make it any better. And another issue regarding Art would be that faced did feel quite \"derp\" now and then.\\n\\n\r\nAside that I gotta add I did love the fashion in this Anime. Very fancy clothes and FMC had some extremely fancy and pretty underwear.\\n\r\nFanservice to be honest felt non-existent aside oppai-chan, which had some extreme jiggles. Felt odd but artsy, didn't feel anything else.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was funky, active and generally had presence and was quite \"stylish\". In this particular case I mean that it did fit well with Anime visual style. Nevertheless I found it superb.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, again with Art I had some mixed feelings as most of it felt really good, whilst some things made it very odd.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nThis Anime was way too short... essentially we got episodic Anime with different pair every episode.\\n\r\nBut to put it plainly, hand shakers are essentially people with painful past thus developed into sad, empty and pitiful present selves. And \"hand shakers\" essentially gives characters hope to gain their dreams that simply were in emotional way quite ghastly? I don't really want to mention characters too much as there were plenty of them and we were given little of time to know them. So anything real would be spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nBut I have to add, that once again characters concept was fairly nice. Very dark and sad, but nice. All of the characters had their issues in life and essentially got scarred or damaged. Thus their hunt towards the \"god\" to achieve their dreams. While on the other hand, everything progressed too fast in this Anime that gave me difficulty to truly grow into characters or fully understand them. Essentially it gave you little tease to feel for the character, but by the time you will actually achieve that \"feel\", it was all over. As felt I felt characters were fairly ironic as well.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, odd bunch of characters that I personally did enjoy as whole, BUT at the same time I would loved to know about them a fairly large portion more of. But eh \"go read the novel\", I guess.......\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nDid mention most things in previous sections, but I can add that it was probably the most mixed feelings Anime I've watched in a very long while. As lot of things I loved about this Anime. Lot were sad, painful and probably even relatable, whereas at the same time I just feel I wasn't give enough time to feel those feelings as intended. Same with growing into characters. And that dark and cruel sense of mystery this Anime oozed off, was simply bullying at this point. There were simply so many things they explained, teased about, but simply didn't give us enough.\\n\\n\r\nAverage of this review probably would be higher than 6. But this is one of these odd little unpolished gems that this time around, simply won't get that praise from me just because I love Anime in general.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap it up, it's unique Anime but suffers from excessive fast pacing and various \"feeling vibe\" issues, that might you think this Anime is bad or very good. But the truth is, it's middle line that has been approached and conveyed a tad bit incorrectly.\\n\\n\r\nMoral of the story.\\n\r\nThis Anime is weird....I cannot explain why.. it just is weird. Not even sure whenever in bad or good way...that is as well weird.\\n\r\nWeird. Period.",

            "content": "THIS SHOW SUCKS!\r\nThere isn\u2019t any point reviewing this so I\u2019ll just leave a couple of pointers\r\nFirst off, the animation is one of the worst I\u2019ve ever seen in anything, the overuse of CGI is embarrassing and some of it isn\u2019t even good CGI, honestly even Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence was better with its use of CGI.\r\nThe story, there really isn\u2019t one. There are bits of story but it only kicks in towards the end of the show. Most of the show focuses on the two main characters and the connection between them which is good but sadly I\u2019ve seen this done better inloads of other shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack I\u2019ll admit is good but that as well as the two main characters is the only plus points for this 12 episode drag.\\n\r\nI can\u2019t believe Hand Shakers got dubbed while Scum\u2019s Wish and RE Creators haven\u2019t been picked up yet, it\u2019s this type that makes me believe that Funimation will just dub anything regardless how good or bad it is (a bit like Steam with its own storefront).\\n\\n\r\nHand Shakers is not just the worst anime of 2017 so far, it\u2019s also the worst anime I\u2019ve watched this year, hell even possibly the worst anime I've ever watched. (yep possibly even worse than Sword Art Online) This show would have done better if it was just an indie anime fan made project posted on YouTube and not on one of the industry\u2019s biggest websites. (Funimation)\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy this then all power to you but I can\u2019t and I probably never will.",

            "content": "There are Slight spoilers mainly for character analysis. \r\nPlot \r\nThe premise of handshakers is nothing new to the anime world. Anime's featuring characters that have some kind of power are one of the most common type of genres within the anime world. From the outside this anime can be said to be anything but special but what drew me to Hand shakers was the concept behind it and its story. \r\nHand shakers takes place in the city of Osaka sometime in the near future and follows the life of Tazuna Takatsuki a high school student and who whether through fate or something else meets amysterious girl called Koyori. Their meeting which coincided with the touching of their hands transported both to an alternate dimension where they meet the being that resided there where their bonds as hand shakers are forged and their powers are born.  \\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot of the series story revolves around the use of the powers called Nimrods that Tazuna and the mysterious girl Koyori gained from their little trip to that dimension and use that to grant their shared wish by beating every other pair that too have their own powers that are derived from their bonds with each other. As the nimrods are born from their shared bonds with each other  the bond that Tazuna and Koyori forge and improve as the series goes is one of the main themes of this story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTazuna \\n\\n\r\nTazuna played by veteran voice actor Soma Saito is one of the main characters of the series and is the main hero of the series. A kind and caring person that\u2019s also honest to a fault Tazuna is the image of a standard Japanese teenager. A high school student that has a knack for mechanics and repairs Tazuna loves to repair stuff whether it\u2019s a simple thing like a MP3 player to a car he can with enough time be able to determine what\u2019s wrong with it. As a result of this talent of his however Tazuna has more focus than most people but this is offset by the fact that this trait also makes him unaware of whats happening around him. In the beginning of the series Tazuna thanks to an errand encounters the series main heroine Koyori who lies unconscious in a room that Tazuna encountered upon. A mere touch of her hand eventually resulted in Tazuna and Koyori becoming Hand shakers after encountering the being that resided in that space. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning Tazuna did not believe much in the role of a handshaker and wanted his life to remain the way it is. Additionally, because Tazuna has a personality that can be best be described as non-violent Tazuna in the early battles wanted to avoid combat at all costs. However, as the series progresses and he is made aware of the consequences for not just him but also for Koyori of not winning this contest his attitude starts to change. Tazuna starts to fight hard yet at the same time fight smartly. While being kind and caring towards not just his friends and classmates but also to Koyori, Tazuna is also quick thinking and can easily see the different situations that can arise when in combat. This quick thinking also allows him to sometimes come up with tactics that others haven\u2019t accounted for during battles with other handshakers which had the effect of making some of their fights interesting. In combat Tazuna\u2019s Nimrod takes the form of a large number of gears that can either be forged into either a sword for offence or a shield of gears for defense. Generally, his tactics are a mix of defensive strategies mixed with precise strikes on the enemy\u2019s weaknesses. \\n\\n\r\nTazuna\u2019s bond with Koyori is one of the main points of the story for this anime and can be said to be one of the central points. At first Tazuna\u2019s relationship with Koyori can be termed as awkward because due to the fact that they have to hold hands as per their bond both to maintain their powers and also to keep Koyori alive.  This inevitably causes problems both at home and at school. At first Tazuna\u2019s first impression of Koyori was that she was a beautiful if silent girl that seemed to have a past that she didn\u2019t know about. As the series progresses however and Tazuna\u2019s bond with Koyori grows in power Tazuna begins to understand Koyori more as she learns new things and learn about the things that are in this new world of hers. As their bond increases which also gives them more power their relationship becomes closer as they come to care about each other more. This however had the effect of Tazuna becoming more protective of her which I thought was nice to see. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Tazuna I though was an interesting character. While he may look like an average teenager the evolution from a reluctant combatant to one that not only fights well but also smartly while trying to grant the wish to his beloved was nice to see. Soma Saito I felt did a pretty good job here. \\n\\n\r\nKoyori \\n\\n\r\nKoyori played by veteran seiyuu Sumire Morohoshi of Bungou stray dogs fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of this anime. A mysterious girl that Tazuna stumbles upon while exploring a lab that he had been summoned to Koyori is in fact a hand shaker who had lost her partner in the past. By inadvertently touching her hands with his a bond between the two of them is established and both become hand shakers. Personality wise Koyori has two different personalities that is developed as the series goes on. Koyori\u2019s initial personality which lasted from the time she woke up and right up to she gained her own nimrod was very timid and she seemed to be reluctant to fight very much like Tazuna. At this stage, she was also very quiet and had problems interacting with others partly from the fact that she didn\u2019t trust people that easily. However, as the series goes on Koyori\u2019s personality changes as she fights more with Tazuna and her understanding of him improves which also had the effect of improving their bond as well. As a result of this Koyori becomes more trusting of others, more willing to express her own thoughts and more honest with her feelings towards Tazuna. At first Koyori didn\u2019t actually speak and usually communicated with gestures or facial expressions. This made it hard for Tazuna in the beginning to figure out what she wanted at times. However after gaining her voice back during one of the later battles Koyori was able to express her emotions and feelings much better. Throughout the series we can see that the bond that Koyori shares with Tazuna is important to her because in addition to keeping her alive it also allows them to improve the power that they have as the bond is directly affected by the trust they have with each other. While trust is important ultimately, it\u2019s the feelings that Koyori and Tazuna have for each other that actually makes them more powerful as they fight more battles and overcome the increasingly heavy odds that are laid against them. The love story between them I felt was well done and flowed pretty naturally. \\n\r\nAll in all, I thought that the character of Koyori was pretty well designed and that her seiyuu Sumire Morohoshi really did a great job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nChizuru and Hayate \\n\r\nChizuru Mitsudera played by veteran seiyuu Sumire Uesaka of Myriad colors phantom world fame and Hayate Azuma played by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa of Occultic nine fame are fellow handshakers that Tazuna and Koyori encounter as they embark on their quest and are the second pair that they face. Chizuru and Hayate are actually adults that run their own company that deals with new technology that are being leased to places like schools. In this regard Chizuru is the boss of the company while Hayate is the subordinate. Personality wise these two though they have a close relationship as both friends and confidants have different personalities that often clash with each other which is used for comical effect in the series. Chizuru is a serious but cheerful young woman that\u2019s very capable and efficient at her job. Her most notable trait is that of her height which is short to the point that she\u2019s often mistaken for a child much to her chagrin. In the comical arguments that often erupt between her and Hayate Chizuru often makes witty comebacks to Hayate\u2019s comments which is usually pretty funny. \\n\\n\r\nHayate Azuma is Chizuru\u2019s partner and also co-worker and helps manage the day to day affairs of the company while also accompanying his boss for business meetings. Compared to Chizuru\u2019s serious and hardworking nature Hayate\u2019s personality is the complete opposite in that he has a more laid-back personality and generally is pretty easy going. Due to his tall height and the fact that he can stand both tall and straight Hayate is often mistaken by others to be the actual boss of the company with Chizuru if she\u2019s present being often mistaken as the new girl instead. This is used for comical effect during the series and it\u2019s always something that\u2019s amusing to see. \\n\\n\r\nAs with all handshakers Chizuru and Hayate have their own wishes that they wish fulfilled once they manage to beat all the other handshakers. This wish was a result of the injustice and the way that they were treated when they first came into the world of the adult working world. I felt that their wish was actually a pretty worthy one and one that I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing. All in all, I felt that the characters of Chizuru and Hayate were well designed characters that contrasted greatly with the first pair in that they had a decent reason and motivation to fight for. I felt that Sumire Uesaka and Kaito Ishikawa did an excellent job portraying their respective characters here.  Of all the pairs that fought in the series Chizuru and Hayate are after Tazuna and Koyori probably one of my favourite characters as their interactions with each other are just hilariously funny. \\n\\n\r\nRiri and Masaru \\n\\n\r\nRiri Houjou voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Tales of Zestiria the x and Anohana fame and Masaru Houjou voiced by veteran voice actor Ayumu Murase of elDLIVE fame are fellow handshakers of Tazuna and Koyori that they encounter on their quest and is the third pair of hand shakers that they face. Riri is both the student council president of the school that Tazuna attends and a classmate of his and as a result is someone that Tazuna knows very well. Riri who likes to be called Lily for some reason has a cheerful personality and one that is best described as a big sister type personality commonly seen in anime. When in school and in student council president mode Riri is calm, cheerful and confident and composed however this personality of hers change when she\u2019s with her younger brother who she adores and dots on. Riri has a rather unique hobby which is that of divination in which she makes of use of tarot card reading to determine the fortune of someone. Like Tazuna Riri is someone that dislikes violence yet she and her brother like every other hand shaker has their own wish that they wish fulfilled and as such even if they have to face someone that they know neither will step back as both want to achieve their wishes. \\n\\n\r\nMasaru is the younger brother of Riri and is a 12-year-old boy who has a talent for card games. Personality wise Masaru is a calm, collected and mature person who despite the age difference actually looks out for his sister even though it should be the other way around. Masaru can be quiet and slow to trust people especially strangers but he\u2019s the type of person that will open up to someone once that person has proven he\u2019s not anyone dangerous or untrustworthy. Masaru\u2019s talents for card games is not just a hobby that he takes part in for the fun of it though and instead forms a part of his Nimrod as well.  Though not as developed as pairs like Kodama and Hibiki and Chizuru and Hayate the pair of Riri and Masaru are still pretty interesting characters with much of this coming from Riri\u2019s interactions with her brother and the fact that she\u2019s always being embarrassed by him. I felt that Ai Kayano and Ayumu Murase really did a good job portraying their respective characters. Being able to use his hobby as his nimrod though was an interesting design decision on the part of the writers here. \\n\\n\r\nKodama and Hibiki \\n\\n\r\nKodama voiced by veteran seiyuu Mikako Komatsu of Re Creators and Tales of Zestiria the x fame and Hibiki Moriyama voiced by veteran voice actor Tomokazu Sugita of Kanon and Buddy complex fame are fellow hand shakers that Tazuna and Koyori encounter as part of their trials. Kodama is a popular idol singer that is recognized by her fans for her use of prominent proverbs from famous people as well as her singing ability. Personality wise Kodama is a cheerful, positive and self-assured person that can be overconfident at times. Though not underestimating any of her enemies Kodama can however be smug at her opponents Kodama has real skill in combat as in the story she was able to hold her own against every one that challenged her. Kodama\u2019s fighting style is very different to what the other handshakers make use of as part of their fighting techniques in that Kodama\u2019s are more akin to being at a concert as her moves while certainly hard-hitting look like the finely tuned dance routines that are seen at concerts. Due to her experience Kodama and Hibiki can be said to be the first real challenges that Tazuna and Koyori have to face in their journey. Kodama\u2019s most prominent trait is probably her use of famous proverbs that she often uses whether in battle or outside of it. \\n\\n\r\nHibiki is the manager of Kodama and also a handshaker whose main role is to support her. Though in the support role Hibiki isn\u2019t a pushover in a fight as he is very much capable of launching some rather strong attacks that can be surprising given his role. Personality wise Hibiki is calm, polite and positive and even during combat tends to stay focused for his role of support for Kodama. The relationship between the two is very much like that of a manager and idol in that Hibiki helps manage the activities of Kodama while also helping to both support her in battle and to motivate her both in and out of it. From this it can be seen that apart from being a manager and performer Kodama and Hibiki are also really good friends from their actions as handshakers and also from the past memories that were shown in the series. As with all handshakers the power of a handshaker was gained by Kodama and Hibiki thanks to the hardships and challenges that both experienced. In this case the challenges came from being looked down and disregarded by both their fans and the companies that managed them despite the hard work that both have done. As a result of this injustice that also serves as the team\u2019s main motivator Kodama and Hibiki can be said to be fighting the hardest to achieve victory in order to enter the other dimension and have their wish granted. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Kodama I felt was actually pretty done and designed as though she appears to be a girl that\u2019s slightly older than Tazuna and Koyori the hardships and challenges that she has faced in her career has hardened her so while she still retains her trademark positive and upbeat nature that defines her it can be said that she knows what the reality of life is and how unfair that can be to people. As a result, she can be seen as a good contrast between Tazuna who though as determined as she is doesn\u2019t have the same wealth of experience in life that Kodama has seen. In a way, the fight between the pair is very much a clash of ideas as it is a clash of arms. All in all, I felt that the character of Kodama was an interesting character and that her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu really did an excellent job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nBind and Break \\n\\n\r\nBind played by veteran seiyuu singer Yoko Hikasa of the Devil is a part timer and High school DxD fame and Break who is played by veteran voice actor Jun Fukuyama of Code Geass and Rail wars fame are fellow hand shakers of Tazuna and served as the first opponents after Tazuna and Koyori become hand shakers. Though their appearance in the series was relatively brief it can be seen that the relationship that the two had was very different to the other hand shakers that are present in the anime. In their relationship, it can be seen that Break is the master here who makes use of his partner\u2019s ability by tormenting her which I found to be slightly disturbing. His attitude towards her rather than being caring and understanding seems to be the opposite in that he seems to view her as something akin to a tool instead of a human. Despite that it seems that doesn\u2019t seem to bother his partner Bind as she seems to be both close to and devoted to her master. Despite their flaws the pair of bind and break managed to serve their intended purpose in the story by showing Tezuna and Koyori just the types of fights that they will be expected to face now that they have become hand shakers. It also taught them that brawn and might are not the only thing that can lead to a victory as intelligence and tactics are also things that need to be considered which is best shown when Tazuna and Koyori used this to win against them. \\n\\n\r\nMakihara \\n\r\nMakihara played by veteran voice actor Shoutaro Morikubo of Naruto fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A scientist that worked at the university that Tazuna visited and where he encountered and met Koyori Makihara is a researcher whose research is focused on what he calls the hand shakers phenomenon. Though Makihara has a serious side to him when he explains new developments that affect both the world and Tazuna and Koyori his default personality is rather laid back and relaxed which often causes him to be disregarded by Tazuna and Koyori at times which is comical every time this happens. Makihara\u2019s main role in the series apart for providing support to Tazuna and Koyori also consists of watching over Koyori who he was charged with monitoring and document the changes to her as her bond with Tazuna improves and advances. A recurring trait of Makihara\u2019s is his rather over the top expressions that he uses when told positive things or being made aware of good things which I found comical. \\n\\n\r\nNagaoka and Mayumi \\n\\n\r\nDaichi Nagaoka voiced by veteran voice actor Kenjiro Tsuda of Attack on Titan fame and his partner Mayumi who is voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Asterisk wars and Clockwork planet fame are fellow hand shakers that Tazuna and Koyori face near the end of their journey. A mysterious character whose appearance in the plot leaves more questions than answers made even more so by the cryptic comments that he leaves before vanishing. This had the effect of making this character even more mysterious. The reveal of his characters true role in the story and his connection with not just Makihara but also with Koyori\u2019s past was however a well-executed move.  Personality wise Nagaoka is a calm, aloof and analytical person that has a degree of intelligence in him that reminds you of a scientist. Yet this is offset by the fact that Nagaoka seems to have problems conversing with people in that due to his limited social skills he has trouble coming up with smart answers or converse with people that he hasn\u2019t seen for some time. Nagaoka\u2019s main personality trait that defines him however is that he is someone that is extremely driven and determined to achieve his goals to the point where he will use any and all means to do so even if these means are underhanded or evil. \\n\\n\r\nMayumi is Nagaoka\u2019s partner and fellow hand shaker and in physical appearance looks very much like Koyori because they are related. Like all hand shaker\u2019s Mayumi is very loyal to her master who in this case is Nagaoka however it can be seen that rather having a bond that is built from mutual trust and genuine feelings their bond seems to be built on something else entirely. Due in part to how Nagaoka helped maintain her life Mayumi has very limited personality besides her loyalty however it can be seen with her attacks that she seems to be rather childlike in that she seems to like playing with toys like balls. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that Mayumi doesn\u2019t have a personality as though she may be quiet she can still speak and from this we can see that while she is obedient to her partner she also has the capability to make her own decisions especially if it clashed with her core duties of protecting her partner.  Mayumi\u2019s other personality that she recovers near the end of the series is slightly different to her other personality that was born of how she was treated by her partner. In this personality though she retains her loyal nature Mayumi is a bit more understanding and talkative and not afraid of embarrassing her partner. This personality I felt also made her look more positive which is different to her other personality which was a bit gloomy. \\n\\n\r\nLike all handshakers Mayumi and Nagaoka also have their own wishes that they wish to be fulfilled and in this case, it\u2019s to continue the work of Nagaoka\u2019s teacher and Mayumi\u2019s father. The defining trait about Mayumi is that because she has no emotions and no personality she will usually use the more direct methods to settle her fights and in away actually resembles Koyori when she was still in her old self. Mayumi\u2019s nimrod within the series is rather unique in that it takes of the form of a ball that can be used to create countless other balls that can be used to encompass an area where Nagaoka\u2019s attacks can reach. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nThe art style that was used in this series I felt was pretty good and both the environments that were shown as well as the designs of the individual characters was well designed and implemented. In particular the character design for Koyori and Kodama I though was pretty good. Koyori\u2019s design can aptly  be described as the sleeping beauty as true to her persona she is someone that was created and born into this world a long time ago in the past which meant that there are few girls in this period that can be compared against her. With the persona of Koyori being someone that has been asleep for a long time I thought this design of hers really matched her. Plus, Koyori\u2019s design really made her look really cute. The character design for Kodama was also another one that matched her persona yet one that also emphasized on the fact that idols should be approachable to the people. The resulting design I felt was nicely done and the different shades of colors that she had on her outfit contrasted nicely with each other. Another thing that was noticed in regard to the animation is how clear everything is especially when they show the city scenes. The details that are present in these scenes was nicely done.  With regards to the combat scenes I thought that they were well done and clear enough in that we as the viewer were able to see clearly what was going on in the battle itself. The animation of individual characters and scenes I felt were also well done. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme for the series I felt was pretty good and helped set the mood for the series while also having a good tempo. The music for individual scenes within the series was well done and felt appropriate for the scenes that it was used in. The ending theme for the series however is different to the opening theme in that it seems to be more focused on Koyori and her struggles in life and as a result has a rather somber tone to it compared to the upbeat nature of the opening theme. However, I do like the contrast between the two though and I can clearly see what the intended effect the animator clearly intended with their choices. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the series I thought was actually pretty good which is helped by the fact that almost every cast member that was in this series is a veteran with many roles to their name. In particular the seiyuu\u2019s for the characters of Koyori, Chizuru and Kodama which are Sumire Morohoshi, Sumire Uesaka and Mikako Komatsu I felt did an excellent job portraying their respective characters. Sumire Morohoshi in particular is a seiyuu that I only seen in support roles until now most recently in Bungou stray dogs. The line that divides a support role and separates that from a main role is a large hurdle and challenge yet it\u2019s nice to see Sumire was able to handle the job of portraying Koyori who is not the easiest character to play. Overall the voice acting for the series was pretty strong which helped make the characters that they portray more lifelike. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Handshakers was an anime series that I really enjoyed watching when it first came on during the first anime period. To me the strong points of this anime was the overall concept, story, characters and the voice acting. \\n\\n\r\n Although the overall concept of people gaining powers is not a genre that is particularly new in anime the concept and variation of it that was used in this anime I thought was interesting and well designed. The idea to make use of a bond that two people have created and share with each other as the main form of power within the series rather than the usual single person power was an interesting concept and a gamble as was the promise that by managing to defeat every other pair that have similar powers you will be able to enter the other world and have your wish granted by the god there. Ultimately this gamble did pay off and because this bond will get more powerful the closer one is to their partner it also provides a good means to affect some good development of the individual characters. The wishes part of the bond I felt was well thought out as each of the characters that were featured in the series though having different personalities all have one thing that they have in common with each other which is the wish that they would like the god in the other world to grant. Each of the characters no matter how positive they may be have had horrible things happen to them in the past that had the effect of creating the bonds with someone that share their pain and thus giving them the means to become hand shakers. Because each of these wishes are a result of the hardships that each character faces they are directly connected with the personalities of each character and can be said to be unique to each. Naturally as a fighting type anime the bond that the characters share with their partners directly affect how powerful they are as hand shakers with them becoming more powerful as they trust their partner more. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series revolves around Tazuna and Koyori\u2019s journey to both discover the truth of Koyori herself as well as get to the other dimension to see the god there and have their wish granted by defeating every other pair if hand shakers that share their goals. Arguably the most important aspect of the story was Tazuna and Koyori\u2019s meetings with the various hand shaker pairs that though their enemies at first quickly become allies once defeated. It is through each of their personal stories and wishes that one can see and understand the motivations for them becoming hand shakers. An important part of the overall story for the series is of course the bond that is forged between Tazuna and Koyori and its improvements as the series goes on. Though they had the most unusual of first encounters watching them get to know each other and see their bonds develop as they both find the motivation that they need for their quest was heart-warming. As was seeing them put the new powers that they gained from this bond to good use. Koyori\u2019s past forms a part of the main story for the series but isn\u2019t addressed until near the end of the series. This part of the plot I felt was actually pretty good and helped in explaining how she was created and the hardships that she went through that ultimately caused her to be put to sleep by Makihara. \\n\\n\r\nThe combination of an interesting concept, interesting story and reinforced by a talented voice cast and great characters made Hand shakers one of the better anime that I saw back in the first period. Though some of the characters I felt could have used some more development I felt that the series as it stands is an interesting one.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Status: Completed \r\nEps Seen: 12/ 12\r\nYour Score: 7/10 (good) \r\nK project + Sekirei = Hand Shakers\r\nFirst of all, +1 star because of Rei, Hayate, Masaru, Mayumi and the opening.\r\nMonths ago, when I saw the Pv, I thought \"I will probably hate this  because it looks like K a lot, there is even Mayumi that looks like Anna (blue version) and the damn sword but I actually enjoyed it. \r\nStill, GoHands did something like \"Let`s take the characters from K and make everyone younger, chibi and fanservice trash\" \r\nI mean, have you seen Lily? Girl that's not how boobs work! I love what thisseries could have been and the potential that this  \\n\r\nhad without all those 3d animations,fanservice and chibi characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Story: Back to it, a bit clich\u00e9. Hand Shakers is not strong in terms of it\u2019s writing or it\u2019s characters but the decent writing came \\n\r\nafter episode 8. The concept of the story is good, I really like it even if it reminds me of Sekirei a lot. \\n\r\nTwo partners in a competition, fighting with the others for a prize. You lose, you`re out. \\n\r\nEverything is also named after ancient Mesopotamian things, nice. The last ep was a bit rushed.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters: Character development is okay but not okay, really overrated. There is a reason that there is a term called 'flat character'. You shouldn't expect much character development from a 12 episode  that focusses mostly on action and the connections between people. They were fine. There's still something that bothers me.\\n\r\nRei, how tf could you treat like shit and step on your girlfriend or whatever she is in the first ep and later,\\n\r\nyou two are acting like a married couple?\\n\\n\r\n-Art: The bad thing about this  is the animation. I think they're trying way too hard. I have to admit that some of the scenes were quite beautifully animated and detailed but 3D and 2D mixed was a bad idea. The visuals go way over the top in a bad way that distracts the viewer from what's actually going on. The camera is also being moved around too much. \\n\r\nWay too detailed character designs, too saturated with colors and brightness. \\n\\n\r\n-Music: I`m addicted to the opening, it`s amazing. \\n\r\nThe soundtracks are similar to K`s so I love them. My favorite OST is the one they play during the battle with Chizuru and Hayate.\\n\r\nAnd the voice actors, I especially love Rei`s voice (Jun Fukuyama) and Daichi`s (Tsuda Kenjirou) \\n\r\nmaybe because they also did Misaki and Mikoto, no need to mention the  <3 \\n\r\nLast thing, I`m addicted to the way Lily says \"Masaru\" with that cute voice. Omg I could listen to it for hours, just cute.\\n",

            "content": "Warning: The review will contain spoilers\r\nHere's an update review in YouTube. Don't is still mine and sorry if my voice sound shaky I'm just a poor college student that have no money to buy a mic and used my earphone as a mic....\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8ViiGfxiIc&t=198s \r\nIf not then... Here's the script. Kinda I think....\r\nWell\u2026 there\u2019s one place I can put this anime. \r\nAnime that everybody hates but I don\u2019t category.\r\nStory: Is a battle royal anime. The stories are inside the characters and the world itself of the show (For this case is the ziggurat, the world and the nimrod, the weapons). So for the characters stories I'mgoing to talk more about it as we go to the characters section. While the world itself, does leave us some mystery but it did explain as the series progress. Like, the changes of the ziggurat in episode 6 and in episode 8, where the ziggurat change and Kodama nimrod is in the ziggurat (Like literately), how did the characters enter the ziggurat?? Why does Koyori have the scar??\\n\\n\r\nNow without more spoilers of the world. Let's move on to characters.\\n\r\nCharacters: Like I say for story, a battle royal anime story comes from the world and the characters itself. So I'm going to organised from my least favourite pair to my favorite. \\n\\n\r\nBreak (Rei) and Bind: This got my least favourite because... Well... We don't barely know them...Like seriously... They fought Tazuna and Koyori in episode 1 and we didn't see them until episode 12. But give them some credit we do get some hints about why do they want to be a hand shakers in the last episode. But if I have to guess what is his story for the last episode. It have to be that they were in a band but they want to help others to get instrument but they are poor and do not have the money to help. \\n\\n\r\nMayumi and Koyori parents: I can understand that you don't want your kids to get hurt. But by god are they mean to their kids. Now the series did explain why and how they disappear. They are fighting with god and nobody knows what happen to them. Did they die?? Did they win?? Nobody knows... Why they got higher than Break and Bind?? Well... at least their motive make sense.\\n\\n\r\nNagaoka, Mayumi and Makihara: Hell, as we get some backstories not in the sense on why they are hand shakers but as to why the relationship between Makihara and Koyori. Mayumi and Koyori are twins and they were born as hand shakers. Not given by god but thye were born in the Ziggurat. While Nagaoka and Makihara act as a bodyguard for Mayumi and Koyori from other hand shakers. He still steal Mayumi in a comma because he wants to protect her and take good care of her.\\n\\n\r\nMasaru and Lily: Those 2 are incest relationship?? Or not?? Like nobody knows... Either way I'm not that bother with incest that much. I just treat it as normal romances. But the story with them are pretty relatable for me. I mean a smart ass sister and a stupid (Well... in term of his study). Does remind me of me and my brother. He being a smart ass while I'm not...\\n\r\nNow their story is to be together?? Nah, they want brothers and sister relationship in the world to be treated as normal romance. A quote from Yosuga no sora \"Who cares if we are related?? Let them think what they want.\"\\n\\n\r\nTazuna and Koyori: The main pair, which I really like in the end of the series. The relationship between those 2 could be interesting. Tazuna is still having withdrawing symptoms for his sister death when he saw Koyori and treated her as a replacement for his sister until Nagaoka knock to his brain and say \"Ding Dong bitch she ain't your sister\". While he didn't have a wish... In fact he was just thrown into the world without any warning. I'm pleased to see some development inside him as to she isn't his sister but a different person. While for Koyori, I'm glad that she has a different story than Mayumi and she is a balancing act for Tazuna. Take their relationship as to Kuro and Mahiru in Servamp. I like anime that have character relationship like those 2 called me a sucker for that. It's because of that character interaction is why I like Tazuna and Koyori as a character. \\n\\n\r\nChizuru and Hayate: Now those 2 have one of the easiest character story out of all the pairs in the series. They were bully and we finally get a legit reason as to why a loli is a loli and why a wimp is a wimp. Is because of those reason is why I felt for them when they lose the fight between Tazuna and Koyori. I don't really want to go through their backstory as it is straight to the point and simple.\\n\\n\r\nKodama and Hibiki *BEST PAIR!!!!*: Those 2 are easily my favorite pair of the series as the story in them are pretty understandable. Not too complex but not too simple. Kodama wants to be the best idol but with lives gig getting cancel one by one. Her dream of being an idol slowly slip out of her sight until Hibiki came. Hibiki legit quit his job so he could train and help Kodama to become an idol. Not to mention, he became Kodama first fan as a boost for her confidences in her that she can do it.\\n\\n\r\nNow after that long ass talk about the characters let's look at the art/ animation. Is studio GoHand... You know the K and coppelion people. While the background art and the 2D looks gorgeous. The CG looks... How should I put this nicely?? Bad...\\n\r\nNot to mention how they do camera movement for some felt shaky. Now they could fix the camera movement (and in fact I do pray they do fix it) by adding more in-between motion to make it look smother. Beside that... There's not much to talk about art/ animation. So let's move on to music.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: For the opening is sang by OxT which is famous for the overload, prince of stride alternative and Gekkan shoujo Nozaki kun opening. Which start out with a kick ass opening and a stellar guitar and amazing beat which leads up to the chorus which is kick ass. While the opening did spoil the whole damn thing. I don't mind as majority of opening did that. While the ED is sang by Akino Arai which is Amanchu! ed and Aria op. While is just a chill and relaxing song the lyrics after an amazing episode after the next. While the OST is able to bring out the mood in some with it's beautiful piano music and the soft calming drumming in it. Also Hand Shakers probably have the best OST of the season and if I got an opportunity to buy it I would.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is probably the best work GoHand has put out in years. (well... beside seitokai Yakuindomo). I'll never enjoy K, while for coppelion I got some mix feeling about it. It didn't make me understand the world the characters are in and that's a problem. While for hand shakers the world of the Ziggurat, nimrod and the characters motive are clear as day light to me. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Well... with all being say I give hand shakers a score of 8.0 and a recommendation to watch it. If you want a fun and extincting world building anime for this winter season. I highly suggest hand shakers.\\n\\n\r\nOther recommendation will be K (I don't really recommend it tho...) and there's guilty crown which have which have a similar vibe with hand shakers about high schoolers in war between each other and giant sword.\\n",

            "content": "\"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions\", as such is Production GoHands and Shingo Suzuki's motivations in making this travesty.\r\nLA wants you to to put your hand in front of your face...then start violently shaking it in front of you...yeah that dizziness and annoyance is Hand Shakers in a nutshell.\r\nLet's get on with this.....\r\nIn terms of characters, Hand Shakers has a major problem with it's characters...as in their nothing but running gags with a body, let's start with the main duo, Koyori Akutagawa voiced by Sumire Morohoshi and Tazuna Takatsuki voiced by Soma Saito, Tazuna is a mechanic and has this schtick wherehe sees if a situation or problem is in a \"mesh\" or not, Koyori is probably the worst character for LA, merely because she hardly speaks thus giving us no personality either and she is a special case where she needs to always have her hands joined with Tazuna otherwise she dies...except when it doesn't and she can even stay far away from Tazuna for a vague \"limited amount of time?\"...yeah LA is just as confused as you are, but the main duo characters have alot more problems but that a bit later on. So how about the rest of the Hand Shakers?, well Break voiced by Jun Fukuyama and Bind voiced by Yoko Hikasa are essentially the BDSM couple and LA hated both of them, one as a waste of Yoko Hikasa, second is that Break is a overly lunatic \"kill kill\" guy making him instantly unlikable and even worse what with his powers in physically abusing Bind. Lastly is that Bind essentially a moaning machine thus a waste of Yoko Hikasa...let's move on to Chizuru Misudera voiced by Sumire Uesaka and Hayate voiced by Kaito Ishikawa , their schtick is that due to how Chizuru looks like a little kid, they think that Hayate is the boss when really Chizuru is. That's it. Next are Masaru Honjou voiced by Ayumu Murase and Riri Honjou voiced by Ai Kayano and their schtick are cards, more respectively Masaru for a REAL LIFE card game by the name of Precious Memories and Riri with tarot cards, they were the ones LA was expecting them to be interesting....until Riri hit the incest bomb destroying any chance LA would care about them (and LA doesn't care about their backstory it's every abusive parent storyline and an even sloppier incest subplotline...LA could take Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! more seriously than this). Next are Kodama Awaza voiced by Mikako Komatsu and Hibiki voiced by Tomokazu Sugita who have the entire idol and her manager routine...it's just that Kodama has this schtick of quoting random people, Hibiki is just fast. Finally let's talk about Makihara voiced by Shoutaro Morikubo our primary repetitive exposition fairy and obviously yes...he gets annoying very quickly and just spouts off things about Hand Shakers, Nimrod and the Ziggarut...something he should have KNOWN and said to Tazuna and Koyori AGES AGO. -sigh- what can LA say...this character cast is ghastly horrible and at best stereotypically \"running gagged\" annoying.\\n\\n\r\nIt does feel like the Hand Shakers' characters TRIES to look at certain genres from Bind and Break in an abusive relationship \"romance\" genre, Masaru and Riri's incest, Chizuru and Hayate for comedy and Kodama and Hibiki for the idol genre and seriously LA thinks that Kodama as a character is the closest character to have legitimate character development outside of trying to be a Hand Shaker through her being a \"fake idol\" or sorts...until she immediately retracts her statement and be her running gag persona again...-sigh-, however the biggest problem is that even with this in hand, they DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT and just use their wasted character potential as running gags and nothing more...\\n\\n\r\nLet's move to the element of Hand Shakers everyone is \"interested in\"..*ahem*, in terms of animation, the animation done by Production GoHands, the animation is \"ambitious\" to say the least but comes with the territory of wrong execution in the process, what does LA mean by that?, well for the majority of the battles in Hand Shakers, it has the tendency to do ALOT of changing perspective with long panning shots of the fight, but the rapid perspective changes along with the twisty and turning battle flow makes you either disorientated from the experience or just plain confused of the battle itself all due to the speed, different animations perspectives and the spatial plane on during the battle makes it extremely hard to know what the hell is going on most of the time, outside of the battles, the animation has \"photorealistic\" backgrounding with the animation with the bright animation on the forefront (typical Production GoHands, which isn't a bad thing), on it's own, that is quite unique, but coupled with the bright characters and their designs makes the background standout even further and again MUCH worse when it comes to the battles as well. CGI was also used, mainly on the weapons and LA just could care less how \"cool\" the weapons look like as the CGI implemented into the battles clashed with the photorealistic environment only brings focus to the colorfully CGI weapons and the characters carrying them (in which it even gets infected to the background). LA started seeing repetitive \"stock footage\" previously shown in earlier episodes which also dampened the animation quality though LA does exactly think this one is something to rage about as LA was more annoyed and placed under headaching inducing moments with it's ambitious animation style more. LA \"gets\" it, Hand Shakers wanted to do something unique but was slightly too ambitious and wanted EVERY animation idea on the plate, instead of making a more cohesive animation style it just felt like a disorientated mess.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, felt like it was where there would be some grace here and there and there is thankfully but that only makes the characters they voice all the more troublesome...it's not the voice cast's fault...it's their bland characters. LA will rapidfire all this soooo <LA breathes in>...Soma Saito was ok, Sumire Morohoshi got a VERY easy paycheck by essentially moaning and grunting all her lines and when Koyori FINALLY DOES starts to speak...she's ok at best but LA still has a problem with Koyori as a character and not because of Sumire's acceptably ok vocals, Yoko Hikasa was wasted on, Jun Fukuyama was annoying with him basically shouting all his lines, Ai Kayano and Sumire Uesaka were tolerable at best, Ayumu Murase was ok, Tomokazu Sugita, Shoutaro Morikubo and Mikako Komatsu talked far too much making them very annoying. -sigh- with this good of voice cast.....all LA can say to this is that it's a HUGE wasted potential on this voice cast.\\n\\n\r\nWe haven't even gotten to the PLOT of Hand Shakers...well that's easy yet vague as hell enough...the concept of Hand Shakers is like a sanitized version of Mirai Nikki or Fate stay night, with no blood, no killings and with no solid reasoning as to why Hand Shakers are fighting each other (Yes, LA knows that they can get a wish or meet and become god? and everything, but even the wish-granting or meeting and becoming god is extremely vague.) Which breaks any sense of tension during the battles (unless you develop motion sickness first) as we KNOW all the characters aren't gonna die from the battles due to the rules of the Ziggurat allowing for fast regeneration after the battle and out into the real world. There is one major subplotline what with Tazuna and Koyori's \"romantic\" relationship but due to it being one-sided on Koyori's part and worse, but there's just no chemistry between Tazuna and Koyori and it just comes out a completely forced and manipulative, from their interactions to them as a fighting duo and LA entirely blame Koyori for this as she just doesn't emote and when she DOES starts emoting and speaking, her personality is as dull and bland as Tazuna is and probably even worse in the romantic standpoint as she only ever thinks and talks about Tazuna...this is our main love relationship people and even at it's best it's just cliche. Koyori maybe the one pushing the romantic relationship but LA still doesn't see the romance side of things as nothing more than the main characters faffing about before the next disorientating battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc of Hand Shakers does try to explain Koyori's backstory and the entire backstory to the major villain of Hand Shakers goal in fighting Koyori and Tazuna in all this and it's a grand effort just to explain, something LA greatly wanted after all the faffing about and lulling it did just to get to this point and fine, the final arc did salvage what lackluster plot it had it already had. The ending still didn't fix it's animation flaws to our main leads, Tazuna and Koyori (yes even Koyori's backstory didn't help her own character!, it just gave us more depth to the already blank slate Koyori...but nothing more and even WORSE on Mayumi's part). The final showdown overall had problems with spatial battle orientation due to how Tazuna and Koyori kept changing their battle area...and it ended -sigh- in an anti-climax with a rush character development job on Mayumi as well, ohh and the entire challenging God thing is only said in passing due to the resolution of the major villain in their final showdown with Tazuna and Koyori. Overall, LA felt rather mixed with this ending.\\n\\n\r\nYes, Hand Shakers, LA is shaking LA's hands....in pure disappointing awe as to what you produced, fine you had the best of intentions, but LA mostly thinks that either you were too ambitious or you had no idea what the hell you were doing!, sure being ambitious is a double-edged sword, where if you put effort and KNOW what your doing, that ambition can bring about a great show, but in LA's eyes, that ambition can be corrupted if you don't know what the hell your doing and your overly ambitious to the point of just throwing everything at the wall and just seeing what sticks. Yes, at the start of this review, LA DID call Hand Shakers a travesty and on an animation standpoint, it's an experimental misguided travesty if to the point of headachy induced nausea, but what really broke the anime for LA was the lackluster and extremely lacking plot AND it's one-dimensional \"running gag\" characters and even lazier romance to our main protagonists. No, this isn't the worst anime LA seen, but it's one of the worst misguided animation experiments in quite a while...\\n\\n\r\nIcarus tried to fly to the Sun with wax wings and in his hubris fell on melted wings...\\n\\n\r\nProduction GoHands tried to make a great anime with Hand Shakers with it's disorientating animation and even lazier plot as it's wings and in Shingo Suzuki's hubris fell into LA's WORST anime of Winter 2017.\\n",

            "content": "Hand Shakers was an \"Attempt\" at an action SOL story with some deeper meaning behind it. Fortunately it failed at that and became a fun train wreck to watch, except when it actively tries to give you motion sickness with its camera movement, poor action, and poor art. Fair warning, I don't expect you to watch this so I will be spoiling some things about this show.\r\nIt has a soundtrack though, albeit I don't remember it but it didn't make my ears bleed.\r\nThe characters were all a singular personality trait with a gimmick, whether it be \"Doting sister who reads tarot cards\" or \"Generic idolwho quotes things.\" Some of these are fun such as the Idol but the rest of them are just obnoxious save for three characters, The restaurant manager loli with a temper, and her underling who apologizes for everything. This duo is very entertaining when on screen, and honestly if they were the main characters of this story it probably would have been at least more fun to watch. The other interesting character is the lead girl Koyori. She is a fun character to watch because of her inability to speak and this leads to the writers having to be creative to how she expresses her emotions. Shame this gets thrown out the window toward then end of the series and she becomes LESS of a character when she gains the ability to speak.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end this show commits a big sin for a shitty anime, its boring. The main character is bland and doesn't mesh with the rest of the show, None of the action sequences are good or even laughably bad like the first one. The story tries to be #deep but ultimately becomes a semi-predictable ride that just isn't fun. 3/10 its not bloodivores.",

            "content": "The reason for my hatred is that some time ago he wrote a certain story / novel with an exaggerated resemblance to Hand Shakers, the point is that I wrote it before I even knew that this existed, I decided to give it a try, and I found the animation more beautiful that I've never seen in the anime, it was as if they had taken my lore and adapted it to the anime, that made me feel ... well, sad, they did something I wanted to do, and they did it well! another thing is to take a premise and handle it badly, nowif I take out that novel it will seem plagiarism, but in turn, the anime I love it! That's why my love relationship is hate. Well, I left that aside, so, here goes my criticism.\\n\\n\r\n-Animation and Colors: Simply beautiful, a series that should be seen at no less than 1080p, the work in detail is excellent in terms of the foreground and even more in the fights, the weapons at first are representations of the Hand Shaker, in the case of Tazuna it is a kind of sword formed by gears, and the care to the movement and animation of this is beautiful, yes, it relies on a rough use of the CGI and for obvious reasons it is noticeable, but the own filter of the series with the colors it pays to spare, each character has a certain \"control / corruption\" of the world where the fights take place and each one uses a treaty of different color, which is in agreement with the character in course , they just hit right away.\\n\\n\r\n-The attitude of Koyori: It seems somewhat ambiguous for a single point, but this made the difference between other series with clich\u00e9s of the \"silent girl\" that normally appears in the Kuuderes... just in a certain chapter to defeat Chizuru and Hayate, it is shown that he has feelings and coldness is only part of the inability to speak, by giving that blow to Tazuna it shows that he has decisions with what he feels and thinks, and that he is not indifferent to the world that surrounds him, only to show That gains points to the attitude, it is not a Kuudere as it was seen at the beginning, and the knowledge that it has feelings gives the missing touch to that relationship, since it does not feel like a monodirexional relation (it took me a long time to invent a word).\\n\\n\r\nBut! Not everything is good with the series, there is a point that gives me a lot to think about, apparently the one who chose the plans or was drunk or wanted to get sick every time there is a monologue, that choice is strange, sometimes it is given an emphasis of greatness/smallness to the character, but at other times, deforms the shot to the point of saying \"why?\" They do not make sense, that takes me out of my head. I mean, is it necessary to try to make the viewer dizzy when it comes to watching the series? I say as you can see, curving the whole image while doing a panning is uncomfortable, just that, I do not know if it is a bad or good decision, I leave it in you.\\n\\n\r\nPoints against:\\n\\n\r\n- Character design: Lolis, lolis, shotas and more lolis, why? make a design like that, more in a series of this kind, that's why I said that I appreciate moderating the fanservice, I do not see it necessary to be watching ecchi in a series purely of fights and plot, I already said it, it is appreciated, but it is uncomfortable see children fighting, and in itself, they touch issues of incest and obsession, now, the cherry would be child abuse xD. Although at the end of the day, well, they are mostly high school kids, but there is no excuse, the only Hand Shakers that look like adults are the masoca and Hayate, from then on they look like children.\\n\\n\r\n- The brightness of the series: Another thing to which I do not find any sense unless I emphasize... why so much brightness? someone passed his hand that filter, I say, would not be wrong in certain situations... but at all times there is extreme brightness, or flashes of light, it may be for an artistic theme but it becomes more uncomfortable than pleasing to the eye , without a doubt, to omit most of the situations in which the characters have their own phosphorescence would make the scenes of monologues much more attractive... since already being in the subject, they are also enough\\n\\n\r\n- Empty battles: This is complicated to explain, but, the battles feel empty, not lifeless, as I said above, the work in detail is brutal, but I do not know, the problem maybe is that they do not take more than one chapter to finish, I do not know, maybe it is something that can only be seen and not explained, but at the end of each fight you feel that something is missing, as if it really was not over, although the series specifies that it is not likely that someone I die during a fight, it's not the fact that we keep seeing the character, that's fine, I mean, it's strange.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all that there are certain things that I feel I should talk but the truth is not too important to deserve a point, as the way in which Koyori wakes the nimrod, I liked nothing, and other things, but I think I better give a small opinion about the series in general, I already said above, without a doubt, the best animation I've seen in any anime, I am amused that people labeled this series as \"Another clich\u00e9 anime\" yes, it is not bad to be inspired by a theme that is already known, I can name several animes like that, but even the best works are plagiarism of something else, the point is how you are going to handle that premise, and without a doubt Hand Shakers did it well, and the points that had to be to play better as the relationships of each couple or Koyori's own attitude, themes that other series displace, Hand Shakers did well, a series worth seeing, worst of all, is... THAT ALL THAT ANNOYING ME! It's a beautiful series, and I had a similar story if not equal, and someone already did well! I'm glad they knew how to carry a story in which I got stuck for years. \\n",
