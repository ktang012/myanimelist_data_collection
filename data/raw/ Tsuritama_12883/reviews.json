I didn't watch this show until the fifth episode came out so byt ehn I was practically bombarded with praise and gifs of the show showing off how amazing it was. So I decided to give it a try. \nThe beginning of the story made me feel so confused. All I understood was that there was a red haired awkward boy who was constantly followed around by an annoying white-haired self-proclaimed alien with a talking fish. However, as time passed on and more episodes were watched, everything became clear and the plot revealed itself. However, Tsuritama is so much more than that. It'sabout a group of misunderstood outcasts who bond together over the hobby of fishing and understand the true meaning of friendship. \\n\\n\nThe art absolutely captivated me. When I first watched Tsuritama, the colorful bright array of colors was one of the only reasons I kept on watching. Enoshima was beautifully designed and colored to make it seem like a wonderful, peaceful place to live; and when the emotion of the story became hostile, they used the correct setting and colors to represent it. The character art isn't super gorgeous, but it's better than most animes out there.\\n\\n\nThe music used in the story fit each setting in the story perfectly. Its upbeat songs set the mood perfectly and sometimes it really pumped you up and sucked you in the anime even more. It can range from happy, to emotional, to an adventurous-type song. Even the sounds of the sea were realistic. If you closed your eyes, you could imagine yourself to be standing right next to the ocean. \\n\\n\nTsuritama oozes character development. The show does not really take in the time to get the complete background of the characters, but it gives you just enough to make you feel like they're on of your friends. Each one experiences some form of emotional growth, whether it's realizing how important family is to learning the virtues and friendship. The characters and their relationships absolutely touched my heart. \\n\\n\nIn the beginning, Tsuritama gave me mixed feelings but now it's touched me in so many ways and makes me appreciate the bonds I have with people even more. I implore you all to try out the anime; just watch a few episodes and you'll understand all of the praise that I have for it. Thank you.",

            "content": "Tsuritama is a show that will exceed your expectations. It will lure you in hook, line, and sinker, and make you question how an anime about fishing could ever be quite so enjoyable.\r\nThe story is set in the quaint town of Enoshima. There, the show\u2019s protagonists\u2014Yuki, Haru, Natsuki, Akira, and Tapioca (*quack quack*)\u2014all come together to share in a singular pastime: fishing.\r\nIt is through the characters\u2019 forced participation to undertake in this hobby that we are able to truly understand each and every one of their personal anxieties and motivations. We are imbued with a real sense of fulfilment, as through their fishing we arenot only a witness to their own personal growth, but also to the most important theme of the show\u2014friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that by the end of the last episode, you will find yourself truly invested in the characters. You will feel like you have walked through the streets of Enoshima yourself, and you will feel like you could just as easily cast off, and spend the afternoon winding down to a spot of fishing\u2014it can be that immersive at times.\\n\\n\r\nA big part of why is due to the art and the sound, which are both thoroughly quirky. The art in particular, opts for a unique style that colours the setting of Enoshima and its occupants, in a vivid, refreshing palette. It does a fantastic job of symbolising and emphasising certain parts, which at times can also make it feel rather reminiscent of a work by Shaft.\\n\\n\r\nThe use of sound is also well thought out. The OP and ED are incredibly catchy, and ease you into the feel of the show, whilst the soundtrack never feels repetitive, or out of place.\\n\\n\r\nIt should go without saying that there are obvious limitations. Notably, Haru, who you will turn out to either love or despise. There are also personal niggles of mine, which include how certain objects do not benefit from the art style, and how there is practically no development for the character Erika, but these are subjective.\\n\\n\r\nTsuritama, overall, feels like it offers exactly what it set out to do. It is silly, imaginative, and charming, never once complicating its wacky, yet simple plot with unnecessary information. It is a true feel good show that I can thoroughly recommend trying.\\n\\n\r\nDuck!",

Of course, as this isn't a silly battle shounen, it is much more than a simple excuse to randomly power up a character to beat the big bad evil, but rather, is a simple and heartwarming tale of how a mysterious alien boy manages to break the barriers of a few boys, helping them form bonds that would last a lifetime, helping them to grow beyond who they are.\r\nBeyond its excellent slice of life portion, the show also features a very bizarreplot. I often call these things silly, but it is done with some remarkable charm that I can't help but love it. Ranging from Tapioca to the D.U.C.K organization, the show mixes its 'serious' side with some very hilarious scenes, resulting in a great experience. The actual plot is pretty well done as well, resulting in a satisfying ending that perfectly concludes the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs yet another excellent entry into the slice of life genre, Tsuritama mixes the supernatural with strong characterization to create a hilarious and heart-warming work that can surely resonate with most.",

            "content": "With age comes a sense of self. Or at least, that's what Tsuritama wants us to believe. Ironically, though, the series itself never knows what it wants to be \u2013 is it a dramatic slice of life or a quirky, supernatural adventure? The result is ultimately spontaneous, for better or for worse. \r\nYuki has a hard time making friends. Always moving from place to place, there's little time for him to get to know anyone, and his social anxiety doesn't help. More than anything, he's afraid of being considered weird. But while living with his grandmother on the island of Enoshima, Yuki meets a self-proclaimed'alien' transfer student named Haru. To make matters worse, his grandmother is allowing Haru to stay with them, and he's asked their classmate to teach them to fish. Some may find this to be a bit of a boring premise, and they'd be right \u2013 it's just done very reasonably. When the rag-tag group begins to learn to cast their lines, choose their bait, and have fun, the series is at its best; even though the drama presented isn't anything groundbreaking, there's more than enough to keep the viewer entertained and smiling through these episodes... Until the direction of the series shifts drastically.\\n\\n\r\nDisorienting would be an understatement. The events that follow this change feel like two completely different shows quickly mashed together. Plot elements that were previously completely ignored or played off as jokes were then brought to the forefront, and the elements I was beginning to grow fond of became totally irrelevant. As Tsuritama makes its way down a long checklist of sci-fi and coming-of-age clich\u00e9s, we learn more about the history and goals of our characters as they work their way towards an unexciting climax. Given that the characters are nearly impossible to care about, the drama goes nowhere; the only effort put into writing them is regarding how weird or unique they are. It's enough for a simple slice of life, but becomes intolerable once any relatively serious element comes into play. \\n\\n\r\nThe only real consistency viewers should note is within the art and sound. If anything, the latter is too consistent. While the music is fun and compositionally playful, there's little risk or direction taken with it. The soundtrack is seemingly only made up of woodwind instruments and the occasional percussion, and that's the problem. While it may compliment the occasional scene, it usually sticks out like a sore thumb. The cheerfulness of it all doesn't refrain from playing in the middle of more dramatic or tense moments, so why not make use of silence? Character designs are also notable, but not in a positive fashion. The visuals are incredibly close to being considered good; you're shown scene after scene of bold, watercolour-inspired scenery and characters, yet something as simple as their hair doesn't match up with the rest of the artstyle. Thankfully, it's probably the only thing in the show that looks outright ugly, but it was more than enough to bother me a few times every episode. \\n\\n\r\nWith the first half of Tsuritama serving only as a setup for the second, it feels like a playful accident in which character development was an afterthought. As a whole, it could probably be described as an all-too-sweet desert stuffed into you after you're already full. The extra course proved to be a bit too much for me, but the less picky may find it welcome or even superior to the main dish. Taste is a strange beast to tackle.",

            "content": "It's a bit early yet to say anything definitive about Tsuritama. And yet I think that it's not too early to describe the series as rather unique. Having said that, I'll edit this review as the season progresses.\r\nTsuritama was created by the same director who did Mononoke and Trapeze - two series memorable for distinctive visual style and approach to storytelling. I think in some ways Tsuritama is a younger sibling to those series - while it is certainly as interesting to look at and only  mildly less thought-provoking, it has a sense of humor about it that is somehow invigorating - there's funto be had here, in a fishing village called Enoshima. The setting is certainly colorful, and it's got nothing on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOur lead, Yuki Sanada, is an anxious young man who has the unfortunate tendency to make a hideous facial expression whenever something makes him uncomfortable. His foil is a self-proclaimed alien invader named Haru who thus far seems to be capable of controlling people with a single squirt of his water gun. If it sounds like Haru is in any way sinister, you've been misled - so far, the only thing he enjoys using this power for is forcing unwilling high schoolers to dance a folk-dance. Haru is irrepressibly upbeat and smiley, and his character is more charming than anything else. Soon we meet a few other boys with social issues - there's Natsuki Usami, the \"fishing Prince,\" who seems rather friendless and resentful of his father. And perhaps best of all is an Indian boy with a duck accomplice - yes, a duck - who seems to be investigating Haru. The duck's name is Tapioca; the boy's name is Akira.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, these kids aren't exactly all that friendly with each other. But we should give them time.\\n\\n\r\nThis show pretends to be about fishing, but it's not. It pretends to be about an alien invasion, but that's not quite it either. It sometimes seems to be about social anxiety, and that's closer to the mark. As of now, Tsuritama is sprouting into a show about friendship among misfits. Our protagonists are as goofy a bunch of oddballs as any that anime proffers, but it is already apparent that the best friendships may be grown from mutual weirdness. \\n\\n\r\nIf all of this seems rather vague and plotless when laid before you, I think in some senses that's the point. This show is deliberately casual and nearly introspective in the way it develops its characters. There's something beautiful i how not a great deal of fuss is made about the fact that one of the lead protagonists is probably from a foreign planet. The show manages to be leisurely and captivating, and most importantly - it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. This is disarming, of course - because I think the show itself should be looked at with a serious eye.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis should appeal to fans of Kuragehime and Welcome to the NHK. Artistically and tonally, it has been noted that this is similar to Mawaru Penguindrum. I hope that Tsuritama earns a following like Penguindrum did, because it's just quirky enough to merit it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Tapioca is a duck; Akira feeds him duck curry. Ponder this.",

            "content": "Tsuritama (2012) is an \u201codd duck\u201d (pun intended) of an anime, meaning it uses a less common style of story telling. While many stories can happen almost \u201canywhere,\u201d and many occur in a fantasy location, this show has a very strong sense of a real place; namely Enoshima.\r\nEnoshima is an actual Island at the mouth of the Katase River in Sagami Bay, on the Pacific Ocean. The island is connected to the mainland by a pair of 600m bridges; a pedestrian bridge and a bridge for motor vehicles. Enoshima and Sagami Bay were made world famous for being the harbour and the area where thesailing races of the 1964 Olympic Games were held.  The island is the centre of Sh\u014dnan, a popular resort area both because of the sandy beaches, and because of its proximity to Tokyo. Enoshima is roughly halfway between the center of Tokyo and the top of Mount Fuji. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime renders accurate depictions of the area, albeit with vibrantly exaggerated colours. The bridges, the sky tree (a prominent feature of Enoshima), the train stations, the high school, the beaches and piers, even the bridge at the mouth of the Katase River, and many other features of the area are all reproduced quite well for us here to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a complex story with many layers and story types. It is partly a fishing story, partly a coming of age story, a story about the value of friendship and family, the importance of place, a even little bit of Man vs Alien, all with enough whimsy and over-the-top absurdity to keep it fun. With the exception of the opening of Episode 1, the entire story occurs in the Enoshima area, either on land or in the waters of Sagami Bay. And it is this strong sense of a real place that keeps the story somewhat grounded, even when the most absurd of events are occurring. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters are, obviously, caricatures. The story is primarily about Yuki Sanada, a boy so helplessly self-conscious that he makes an absurd face when under stress which only makes him feel even more self-conscious and stressed. He lives with his Grandmother, Keito Sanada. Yuki is not particularly bright nor gifted in any way, but he is a nice guy when he\u2019s not allowing himself to be too embarrassed to show it. Keito tries her best to guide and advise Yuki. \\n\\n\r\nUpon arriving in Enoshima, an alien named Haru moves in with Yuki and Keito. Haru\u2019s has arrived on Earth with his sister, Coco, and they have a mission to fulfil while here. Coco only shows up from time to time in the series. Haru immediately starts work on their mission, and Yuki is going to play a prominent role in fulfilling their mission on earth. Not being from earth, Haru is often unaware of human emotions and also find himself receiving plenty of advice from Keito.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody needs a hobby, a pastime, or some goals in life. And everyone needs a mentor to be able to succeed at any of those. Natsuki Usami, a fellow high school student of Yuki and Haru, is a bit of a loner. Natsuki starts as the fishing instructor and mentor for Yuki and Haru and becomes a friend to them over time. He is a locally famous for his fishing skills and is called the \u201cfishing prince\u201d for his skills in competitions. Natsuki lives with his father and sister. His relations with his father are strained, but he holds his sister quite dear and is like another, much kinder, person around her.\\n\\n\r\nThe last of the main characters is the alien hunter, Akira Agarkar Yamada. He is older than Yuki, Haru and Natsuki, by about 10 years, but he ends up in the same high school anyway. Akira is quite aloof and another loner character. Akira keeps a white goose (or is it an oversized duck), named Tapioca, with him at all times, and constantly talks to it. Akira is an agent of \u201cDuck,\u201d a mysterious organization that tracks aliens. Akira has enough rank to have several agents who report to him, but still reports to several layers of superiors within \u201cDuck.\u201d Unsurprisingly, \u201cDuck\u201d has resources at its command that would make most Generals, and even most Commanders-In-Chief, jealous. As Akira follows and starts interacting with Haru and the rest, he becomes aware of the mission that Haru and Coco have, and starts to take part with fulfilling their mission while also making fiends with Natsuki, Haru and Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and action are the catalyst for the bringing together of these four characters. Haru, in part to fulfill his mission and in part because of how his character is, is usually the one to push and pull the story along until the climactic scenes. Learning any new skill takes time and practice and the process can be quite frustrating, even for fishing. But this learning process is the time when Haru, Yuki and Natsuki start to get to know each other, and during this process they become closer. It is also during this process that Akira stops watching from afar, and starts to participate with the others.\\n\\n\r\nThe story shows us how Yuki turns from an awkward boy with little by way of roots in any place, to a more confident young man with a deep connection to Enoshima; for this reason alone the story\u2019s strong sense of place in Enoshima is critical. Haru, who knows little of human relationships, comes to learn of the importance of family and friends, and learns to participate as a friend amongst humans, all while receiving motherly advice from Keito and while being supported by his sister, Coco. Natsuki is able to open up enough to make friends with the others, and also opens himself up enough to improve his relations with his father. Meanwhile Akira is able to also open up and find friends, and to find the fortitude to stand up to what is important to him.\\n\\n\r\nFish tales are always hyperbole, and this anime is likewise over-the-top. But at its core is a heartwarming story about growing up and making friends, and about what friends can do together to overcome incredible hardships. It also shows that process of making friends is not without its own hardships, and that overcoming these hardships is well worth the effort. Likewise, the art style, the music, the story, the characters are all also over-the-top. But that it is all a bit over-the-top helps add to the comedy while softening some of the harsher moments.\\n\\n\r\nBecause it is a bit over-the-top it can be a bit hard to see the core of the story, specifically the character development of the main characters, at least at the beginning. But if you let yourself be taken in by this fish tale, you\u2019ll have a whale of a time.\\n",

            "content": "Watch the series from beginning to end. The first 5 episodes are slow, but it definitely picks up from there. The pacing of the story is like that of a swelling wave: first you don't notice how slowly it's building up, and then suddenly it's 30 feet high and growing more impressive by the second. \r\nAt first, I rated this anime an 8, but right now it's a solid 10, and it wouldnt have been without the earlier episodes to build it up to the final and beautiful conclusion. \r\nThe anime isn't exactly slice of life, if I had to pick a genre, it wouldprobably fit best in that category in terms of feel. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nThe story starts off with two main protagonists: Yuki (Japanese: Winter Snow) the red head with a fear of being stared at, and Haru (Spring), the innocent alien whose complete lack of self-consciousness allows him to bond with everyone. The story then expands to include Natsuki (Nastu=Summer), the reclusive fishing Prince with family problems, and Akira (Aki=fall), the indian who grew up friendless and claims that friendship is unnecessary. Each of these characters has a problem that they try to deal with on their own, but is unable to overcome until they accept the help from their friends. \\n\\n\r\nHaru is the most polarizing character of the bunch. Because he's an alien, he inadvertently says or does some very, very offensive things. Like, \"wow please just get punched in the face now\" offensive. If you hate the series because of Haru, or because the plot is too slow, just stick with it, because I promise it gets better.\\n\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nPlot: 10\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nYes, there is some plot. From the first episode, you see that an fishy alien (Haru) comes down to earth and meets the socially-anxious Yuki, and asks him to fish with him. Plot wise, the anime goes deeper into how Yuki masters each fishing technique (shounen-style) from his tutor Natsuki, while Akira, the DUCK officer, tries to observe Haru without drawing suspicious. While this might not sound exciting enough to make you keep watching, I promise you it is better than it sounds. And that the main draw of the anime isn't exactly the plot as it is the character development and the forging of friendships\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most beautiful part of this anime is seeing how each of these characters manages to change dramatically from the start of the series to the end, especially when you notice that a development in one character manages to spur maturity in another, and etc. Isn't this how we mature as people in real life, as well?\\n\\n\r\n- Pacing Note -\\n\\n\r\nFirst 5 episodes - slow, but the effort the show puts into developing basically every character and story you'll run into makes the emotional payoff from these episodes worth it. You have to pay attention, because there are so many beautiful little details scattered throughout that I didnt notice until I rewatched them (after episode 11)\\n\\n\r\nAll episodes after the first 5: just ridiculously amazing. The plot resurfaces after seemingly been shoved aside for awhile, and everything just picks up.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall, this a beautifully drawn anime with a relatively simple (though eccentric) plot of how these 4 really different people meet, become friends, and change each other for the better.",

            "content": "The story was very unique, but in a way it was almost it's crutch.  While I did l enjoy the creative mix of fishing, supernatural, and alien, sometimes the absurdity of it all made the the story feel kind of silly.  There were where times when the mixing of genres would take away the bite out of serious moments, of course there were also those pitched perfect moments where everything just came together.  It was a bit awkward, but for the most part, it just worked.\r\nI am a real sucker for interesting art styles, I really couldn't help but appreciate that inTsuritama.  The vibrant colors really made this anime pop, and it really suited a lot of the characters.  Towards the end of the series a lot of that color was brought down to fit the climax, what little color was left really gave it a surreal sort of tone, fitting for an alien.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great through out the series, though I did wish they would have changed the eyecatch a little at times.  Hearing its happy tone interrupting some of the more serious moment was a bit unsettling, luckily the series remained happy go lucky most of the time, so this problem didn't occur too much.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honestly, I had some trouble getting used to Haru at the beginning, but I eventually warmed up to is absurd personality.  As the story went on, Haru along with the rest of the cast became easier to sympathize with or just generally like.  Whether it is the father who is trying to fix the strained relationship with his son, or the hilarious antic of the love struck small time ship captain.  More notably our MC Yuki, a severely socially awkward young man, who is changed by a couple of strange new acquaintances, brought together by fishing.  We get a few really great character breakthroughs in the series that is just handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not one who easily enjoys everything they watch, but I really enjoyed this series.  I enjoyed it for its modesty, something I don't see as often in anime, something that was very apparent in this series (unless you misread friendships for something else).  The bond shared by close friends, and their obstacles they overcome together, something simple in a complex setting, something that just work.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this series although not the greatest anime ever.  A colorful story, wonderfully designed/likable characters, odd setting and an equally odd plot.  Tsuritama is a great watch, and a solid 8 from me.",

            "content": "*updated* Ah, fishing. It's how a group of four boys will quite possibly save the world.\r\nI'll be first to say that the premise of four quasi-bishonen boys is what enticed me to start tsuritama. The statement that this show is about an amazing story of saving the world comes at a close second.\r\nTsuritama spends part of the show developing characters and relationships and such, like an entertaining extended backstory. It has a very light mood, heavily reminiscent of a slice-of-life comedy, mixed with a little \"Growing-Up Protagonists\". However, without saying too much, the series then takes a relatively dark turn; and the original hook forthe series, the saving-the-world part, is addressed. The development of the characters from the earlier portion of the show further adds to the drama, and it makes a good normal-boys-turned-hero tale. With all this said, it is still not an action or fighting anime. It was never meant to be, but that doesn't mean it lacks suspense and emotion.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they are all very interesting, to begin with. In the main cast, first impressions are as follows: There's the But-Not-Too-Foreign Yuki with his thizz face panic attacks, the adorable alien Haru, Akira, the turban-wearing spy guy, and Natsuki, the tsundere fishing prince. With glasses. That doesn't even begin to cover all of tsuritama's characters. All of the cast is quirky and well-developed and it's truly fun to watch them interact with each other.\\n\\n\r\nI suck at critiquing art, but the art is particularly pretty and fascinating in tsuritama; with vibrant color palettes and seemingly brand new blends of ocean blue. The use of animated cut-out style backgrounds is kind of cool. In no way does the art style look cheap-o whatsoever, and they do great justice to the sea. They don't make water look overly realistic looking, but it is just as well-animated with the occasional cut-outs or lots of pretty blends of blue.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound makes good use of whimsical instruments and such, like flutes and recorders, to suit the relatively light mood of the series that takes place by the ocean. When necessary, the sound is able to take the central themes and create multiple semi-orchestral versions to suit the situation, varying from triumph to touching. Darker themes exist too, and they are executed quite well for such an airy series. It is well-suited to the series and fitting, but then again, it is nothing TOO spectacular; and for that it loses some points. I'd also like to pay special attention to the opening sequence, 'cause the song is really freaking catchy. The dancing OP is not as out of place as one would think it'd be, since it is a traditional Japanese dance (at least I think it is); and hey, Haru had the mind control gun. He could totally be controlling the cast to dance. The voice actors, as well, are very suited to their characters, especially Haru's bubbly voice.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend tsuritama: It's a story packed with great characters, humor, and captivating art.",

            "content": "Tsuritama is a science fiction comedy from 2012. It was written by Ono Toshiya and produced by A-1 Pictures. Yes, the studio that brought us Kuroshitsuji, Sword Art Online & Boku dake ga Inai Machi among others. In other words, their quality varies quite a bit. I haven't really heard anything about this anime, so I'm going into it pretty blind. Let's see how well it compares to the other A-1 anime I've reviewed. \r\nStory:\r\nYuki is a highly introverted lad who moves a lot. After moving to Enoshima, his life turns around. Another transfer student, Haru, comes into class and introduces himself as an alien.He then insists that Yuki go fishing with him to save the world. Shenanigans incoming. \\n\\n\r\nThe first noticeable issue with this series is that there's a lot of technical talk on the mechanics of fishing and it's all really tedious and completely uninteresting. Look, I know that your comedy here is using fishing as its method to save the world but that doesn't mean there's anything comedic about long explanations of how to catch mahi mahi or the proper way to cast. I would go so far as to say that that time could have been better spent on amusing hijinks. Another issue is that the series doesn't really take full advantage of the comedic possibilities of its premise. This is a series about aliens who can control humans with water and an alien teaming up with some humans to save the world by fishing. That's a premise that's so patently ridiculous that it shouldn't be that hard to make laughs happen. But they downplay the comedic elements in favour of teaching us the mechanics of fishing. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, those moments where they do embrace the absurdity tend to work pretty well. The funniest scenes all centre around Haru too. I will also say that some of the quieter, emotional moments are, surprisingly, really good. The scene where Yuki tells his grandmother how much she means to him in particular. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nTsuritama is a bit unusual in the regard that the major characters really vary. Haru is good for comedic scenes but not so much for anything more serious. Yuki can work in both, but has his strongest scenes in the more serious moments. Natsuki largely plays the straight man in the comedic bits and works better for the more emotional moments. Akira is just a flat, predictable character. The side characters largely exist to play off of the main cast and provide them with strong moments. The only ones who really stand out are Yuki's grandmother and Natsuki's father & sister. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty well done. There's a lot of effort put into making the water, fish and fishing equipment look polished. The character designs are a bit lacklustre, but functional. The animation is solidly done. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is pretty solid. We've got the talents of Irino Miyu, Osaka Ryota, Sugita Tomokazu, Uchiyama Kouki & various others. The performances are generally good for what they're doing. They can carry the comedic parts and sound like they're reading from the world's dullest instruction manual when explaining the mechanics of fishing or repeating them to show us that their character understands them. Osaka Ryota does a great job with the emotional stuff. The music is okay. Probably not anything I'd listen to again, but it's functional. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some moments betwixt Yuki and Haru where I question whether they're really just friends but there aren't many. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Tsuritama is a series that has its charming and funny moments but it's also a bit of a slog with stretches of tedium to get through before reaching those moments. In the end, its good moments elevate it above mediocrity, but it's not a superb series. It's just okay. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If you really love the mechanics of fishing, you'll probably like it better than I did. Next week I'll look at Palme no Ki.",

The palate matches the cutesy, lighthearted theme of the show, especially on some of Haru's outfits (god damn I wish I had some of them.)\r\nI never found myself wowed by the backgrounds,character design or setting - but a tidy consistency does find itself here.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8) Toshino Ooya really did create a lovable cast here. Naturally, Haru is the shining star, but it isn't even the individual characters that I appreciated the most. The relationships between Natsuki and his family are something I found myself invested in, which is particularly surprising considering the lighthearted nature of this relatively concisely told show. Props also go to the Grandmother character who almost acted as a narrator and did a great job of acting as a spine for the morals the show tried to express.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character had their purpose and fulfilled it well, yet no-one felt thrown into the mix to fill a hole. There were a set amount of characters for comic relief, and none of them ever became stale or annoying.  Many of the characters were memorable and they played off of each other nicely.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (4) The story is the significant weak point that I find with this show. I won't spend much time on this topic because it would be too difficult to describe in detail without spoilers, but the change of pace that the show dragged itself into towards the end was crude, brash and unwelcome. The show felt very natural at the start, and as increasingly heavier plot developments arose, down went the ship, and the general atmosphere along with it. I would have been okay with this change, had it been that the heavy stuff was actually of substance, but it still carried the silly senselessness of the first lighthearted half of the show. It just felt unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8) Despite its flaws, Tsuritama was genuinely heartwarming and very fun to watch. I'd consider rewatching it in a year or two, but likely without the final few episodes.",

            "content": "Let me get one thing straight: I hated 2012. I hated all the stuff that has been going on in my life since November 2011, when everything I know and love suddenly started mercilessly going down the drain. Ever since then, I've wanted to crawl under a rock and die, and I still do! Heck, I'd even be so bold as to wish that the world DID end on December 21st, 2012! After all the crap that's been happening to me, I honestly didn't think I'd ever be happy again, and I still don't think I'll ever be truly happy again considering how traumatizing everything'sbeen for me...that is, until April 2012. What if, one day, you were in a really depressed mood, and then you suddenly find something that somehow manages to put a smile on your face throughout the whole thing. It's so cheery, so colorful, so funny, so bright, so optimistic, so joyful, and so downright refreshing that you feel so happy you wonder why you were ever depressed in the first place. That is Tsuritama, right here. I still consider anime to be my gateway drug in times of great despair and anguish...though this anime in itself just fulfilled all of my gateway drug wishes.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people were a bit confused by the story so I'll try to explain it as clearly as possible. There's this kid named Yuki whose grandmother has to move around a lot due to her job, and he hasn't been able to make friends, nor does he have the proper social skills to really make any, and is frequently overcome with anxiety, mostly in the form of his face turning into a red demon face which scares the heck out of everybody (Why does it happen to him? I dunno. They never explain it). So he and his grandmother move to Enoshima, a beautiful island by the sea. All of a sudden, Yuki is approached by this strange cloud cuckoolander kid named Haru who claims he's an alien and forces him to go fishing. Why? Because Haru wants to save the world. But why does he need Yuki of all people, and how can fishing save the world? Joining them are Natsuki, a sour kid who hates everybody, and Akira, a strange Indian guy who works for an organization named DUCK and has a pet duck named Tapioca. They go on a bunch of adventures while learning about fishing, though some strange stuff happens.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I noticed about anime in my seven years of watching them in Japanese, it's the fact that no two anime can really have the same animation style (save for some exceptions). Every anime is different in their presentation and animation, which I think is one of the reasons why I've stuck with a lot of anime for all these years, and Tsuritama is no different. However, Tsuritama's animation in itself is quite different from a lot of modern anime you see in this day and age. Everything is completely bright and colorful for the purpose of showing us the sheer joy we find in the things we like doing, like how Yuki grows to like fishing after trying it. The animation style also helps to set the mood when it needs to, bright when it's happy and cheery, dark when wants to be serious and morose, and believe me, Tsuritama DEFINITELY has its serious moments, and they do NOT mess around! It may help to know that the animation was done by A-1 Pictures, known for doing anime like Sora no Woto, Sword Art Online, AnoHana, and Fractale, all with the same simple but fluid and motion-filled style of animation. Granted, some faces get distorted at times, but it's not anything that'll kill the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is another area where the show shines brightly, because it also has a very unconventional soundtrack. Let's put it this way: it's basically 85% woodwind instruments, complete with FWEET noises all over...and it is awesome. All of said pieces are bouncy, happy, and cheerful sounding, completely fitting the show's bright color palette and cheerful mood. But there's still room for nice orchestral pieces and bombastic epic pieces too, all fitting their respective scenes and moods like peanut butter and jelly meshing together perfectly. I can't seem to find any flaws with it! It's the kind of music that'll stick in your head for years and never leave, and you'll find yourself whistling it forever!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another great aspect of the show. There are just too many shows ripping off each other with teenagers as lead characters who all have the same personalities and archetypes: there's a shy kid, a cheerful kid, a stoic sourpuss, etc. Tsuritama, however, makes it a point to give its characters as much development and originality as possible, and they wind up growing into great characters in the process, and they don't stick to their gimmicks for long. Yuki starts off cripplingly shy, but soon he's able to speak his mind. Natsuki starts off as a jerk, but he becomes kinder later on. Haru is just too oppressively cheerful, but there's a lot more to his excessive childlike cheer than he lets on. There's also the fact that the situations they're in play out more naturally and don't come off as cheesy or ham-fisted, truly setting off their development. All of the characters are great, and because they bounce off each other and clash like the dickens, their chemistry comes off as really natural and realistic. I can see people acting the way they do in real life, and the animation really helped in bringing them to life, too.\\n\\n\r\nI feel really bad trying to find flaws for this show, as it's the sweetest thing ever! But unfortunately, like all anime and everything else, it does have some flaws. For one thing, we never get a reason for where the heck Yuki's parents are, nor do we ever find out why he makes a demon face whenever he's anxious to the point of feeling like he's drowning. I also really didn't like Haru's Japanese voice. It got annoying hearing that overly squeaky voice...and surprisingly enough, his English dub voice improved on it in every single way! I seriously must talk about the English dub. Sentai Filmworks may not make good dubs most of the time, but when they hit, they hit REALLY hard, and Tsuritama is seriously one of the best English dubs they've made! Most of the voices are perfectly cast, the scripting is great, and it really does the show justice! I only found one major flaw with the dub, though: Sakura's voice. Nancy Novotny does her English voice, and while she isn't BAD, her voice is just too hoarse for a little kid like her, she sounds really forced, and unfortunately she misses the mark on one pivotal moment in episode 7. That, and I'm a HUGE Ogura Yui fan. That's about it. Plus, the first five episodes run at a slow pace and most of the episodes in that period are lessons on fishing, so it may test your patience quite a bit. Haru's English voice is seriously the high point of the English dub. It's like they shipped Miyu Irino off to America, made him take English for ten years, and recast him in the role, he's THAT good! You guys really need to check out the English dub! Also, my school's anime club absolutely LOVED this anime to death. We watched six straight episodes of it alongside Deadman Wonderland within two semesters!\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something sweet and colorful that'll put you in a good mood and tug at your heartstrings, fish Tsuritama out of the water! Enoshima don!",

I think that's the summary of my review.\r\nNo, seriously, this is one of the MOST confusing anime I've EVER seen in my whole bloody life. The first 3/4 episodes don't make much sense... and the story don't take off until ep 6. By then, I figure most people would've dropped it already. \r\nSo in a sense, this anime tests the viewer's perseverance .... and my God, if you persevered, you're in for one goodtreat. When the story kicks in, you are hooked, much like a fish. There's a sense of uniqueness surrounding this anime. You just gotta watch it to understand.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you've read my review all the way here, I thank you. But honestly, you would've noticed I've not talked about the characters/story/art etc at all. Well, I did say you gotta watch it to understand. I could say how good/bad this anime is, but that's my opinion. I only want to encourage others to explore an anime, instead of reading some stranger's comments.",

            "content": "-\r\nI've just recently started doing reviews on Youtube, and thought I might as well share them over here. They were written for video-form though, so either read it or give it a watch: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX84r7k6vNM\r\n-\r\nTsuritama is a 12-episode show full of quirky fun and sympathetic characters. It was produced by Studio A1-Pictures and aired  during 2012's spring season. \r\nWhile directed by Nakamura Kenji and written by Oono Toshiya, it is most likely best recognized for its character designer, Uki Atsuya. \r\nIn this kinda SoF, kinda sports and kinda sci-fi anime, the headline is \u201cYou can't catch fish if you don't go fishing, and you can'tmake friends if you don't at least try.\u201d\\n\r\nThe story follows Sanada Yuki, who just had to move to the island of Enoshima with his grandmother. His problem is, he's really bad at talking with strangers, can't handle pressure and therefore has problems making friends. \\n\r\nThen there's Haru, who just out of nowhere declares four things:\\n\r\n1. He's an alien. \\n\r\n2. He's now Yuki's friend.\\n\r\n3. He's now living with Yuki.   and\\n\r\n4. He wants to learn fishing with Yuki.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhy fishing?\u201d, you may ask. Well, there seems to be one of Haru's kin living in the sea around the island and threatening all of humanity, and he chose Yuki to help catch him.\\n\r\nThe dynamic between those two boys make out a great chunk of the show, as Haru really easily befriends just about anyone with his open and funny nature, and Yuki as the contrast, an introvert who usually prefers not to talk. Due to Haru having no clue of common sense from Yuki's perspective, they often clash with each other, but through that, Yuki can grow and become a better person making some friends on the way. \\n\r\nOne of these friends is Natsuki, an experienced fisher in their age, called the \u201cprince of fishing\u201d, who's constantly in argument with his father after his mother died, but cares deeply about his little sister. And believe me, he and his problems get their time to shine.\\n\r\nThen there's Akira, an indian agent for a secret organization called \u201cDUCK\u201d with the mission to find, observe and capture aliens. He's also a big fan of fishing and therefore combines his hobby with Haru's observation. He also has a duck called Tapioca.\\n\r\nIn the supporting cast, every character has their clear role and fulfills that without problems, Keito, the aforementioned grandmother, for example, who acts as a mentor for Haru or Koko, Haru's sister who doubts Yuki's ability to catch fish and puts even more pressure on him. And Tapioca is there as well. Just saying.\\n\r\nAll the characters, be it main cast or a supporting role, are extremely fun to watch and likeable.\\n\\n\r\nLike many other shows from A1-Pictures, Tsuritama's visuals seem gorgeous at first, especially in this case, as the unique artstyle full of blue and many light colors, really supports both the quirkyness and lightheartedness of the show. The animation though has some drops in the later parts from its usually pretty good standarts, but in this case, they aren't so major they'd interrupt your enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTsuritamas soundtrack by a band called \"Kuricorder Quartet\" simply fits the show perfectly.\\n\r\nAnd while that may seem totally random, some parts reminded me of the music for the \u201clost woods\u201d in \u201cocarina of time\u201d and \u201ckirby air ride\u201ds OST, two of my all-time favorite videogames, so that is cool.\\n\r\n Most of the sound is really soothing and calm or supports the shows quirky atmosphere, but even when for example Natsuki's story arc reaches its dramatic climax, the OST can adapt to that. That said though, there aren't really that many pieces I'd listen to outside of the series, and in these more dramatic parts, the opening and ending can really easily feel out of place if you marathon the show. \\n\r\nMy personal favorite tracks would be #1 \u2013 \u201cTsuritama March\u201d and #19 - \u201cHajimete Tsuru\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say anything about the japanese dub though, as I have no complaints whatsoever, but also can't crown one of the voice actors for doing a job out of the ordinarily good you find in any well made show.\\n\r\nAs for the english dub, well, it's passable. If you don't tend to like dubs, this won't convince you otherwise, but if you don't feel like reading subtitles, you might as well consider it as long as you're not too picky.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the only question left: Is Tsuritama worth the watch?\\n\r\nYes, definetly, go for it. I wouldn't define it as a must-watch, but if you have the opportunity to see it, you'll most likely not be disappointed, as I think just about everyone can get something out of the show.",

            "content": "=================\r\n                  INTRO\r\n=================\r\nWow. I'm surprised how this gem passed under my radar for so long. I've forgotten how long it was since I watched a show so fun and relaxing that I always have a stupid grin on my face after each episode.\r\nTsuritama is simple (the studio knows it) and sometimes simplicity is good enough for a show about fishing.\r\n=================\r\n             THE REVIEW\r\n=================\r\nThe show starts with Yuki, a socially awkward boy, transferring to a new school. There hemeets Haru, who's a hyperactive self-proclaimed alien, and invites him to fishing. Sounds silly? Don't worry it gets more sillier! Haha. From there on, you will see an indian guy, an alien organization that worships ducks, hilarious dances, squirt gun madness, a cool grandma, etc. You can actually see that the studio is having a great time making this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe background visuals are well suited to the show. It's simple but the colors are crisp and vibrant. There are times when the backgrounds looks like painting out of a canvass and it's just a treat to watch. The meshing of the colors are really relaxing to the eyes and you would just want to sit back, get a cool drink, and relax.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was also pretty good. Some might find it a little slow but for a premise such as fishing you don't need an adrenaline pumping sequence. Truthfully, every scene has a purpose and builds character.\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n             CHARACTERS\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nThis is where tsuritama shines.  Our main characters feel so alive. Yuki starts off as an anxious boy who's had a difficult time making friends due to him and his Grandma moving places so frequently. Natsuki, the fishing prince, is a grumpy rebellious boy who has a family problem. Ya-maaaaa-dah, the indian guy, starts off as a stalker. Haru, the alien, is just there to annoy Yuki. Each episode always bring something to their characters and by the end of the show they have shown a new level maturity and growth.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are also engaging specially the Grandma, Natsuki's family, and Tapioca the duck. Yes...the duck. I can't count how many times I've laughed whenever Tapioca gets a screentime. And come on, it's name alone makes me crave for a bubble tea.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the symbolisms. From Yuki getting drowned whenever anxious, Haru carrying a fishbowl, Natsuki getting a haircut, the flowers in the garden, etc. It provides a nice contrast to the silliness of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also good, I find myself always looking forward to the ED. When that \"Hooo..Ho Ho..Ho Ho.\" starts to fade in, I find myself humming to the tune and singing it. It's a nice song to listen to when you're at the beach.\\n\\n\r\nFor a SoL show, there is actually an overarching plot that slowly gets develop with each episode so even with the \"compelling story guys\", they will have a hard time bashing the show.\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n             VERDICT\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nTsuritama tells a good story and message. Like fishing, we may find ourselves bored and exhausted with our everyday lives; but when we finally caught that elusive fish, friendship in Yuki's case, it makes all those difficult moments worth it. Thing is, we should always cherish the smallest things in our lives no matter the hardship because that's what living comes down to.\\n\\n\r\nThere a some flaws with the show and I'm pretty conflicted whether I should deduct it to my score. It could've been better to add more characters or show some character's backstory but at the same time it felt like the overall intention of the show might get lost if it was the case. So ultimately, I give it:\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10!\\n\\n\r\nTsuritama is one of the best on its genre. It's full of enjoyable characters and silly moments. Don't watch this show with the intention of getting an adrenaline pumping story. A good way is to watch it once a week, gather your snacks, and watch with a friend or family.",

            "content": "Tsuritama is definitely one of the most re-watchable animes that I've ever watched. \r\nThe story was quite different, and I'm not used to watch animes associated with 'fishing'?? \r\nSanada Yuki is an introverted and socially awkward red-haired teenager who is used shifting schools with his grandmother, and somehow they happen to shift to this small island: Enoshima. There, Yuki encounters the cheerfully alien Haru and Natsuki, the fishing prince. The main reason why Haru and Yuki became friends is to save the world from the danger threatening the island of Enoshima. A mysterious organization \u2018DUCK\u2019 tries to capture Haru thinking he\u2019s the main cause ofthe danger, and there they meet up with Akira (I didn\u2019t like him at all but then he was wicked cool at the end!). And the only person who can save the world is Yuki, and that\u2019s by learning how to fish. Thanks to Natsuki and other secondary characters in the story, Yuki\u2019s confidence is built up and his determination to keep his friends close and saving the world kept me at the edge of my toes.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the characters and the art of the anime was quite different than the typical ones I watch. I enjoyed it though!\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I loved the most about this anime is that the 4 friends learn from each other and that Akira might have took too much time to shine but in the end it was Haru who saved the day. I laughed and cried in the same time, so that means this anime is sugoi sugoi!!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ahh... Tsuritama. I didn't watch this show until the fifth episode came out so byt ehn I was practically bombarded with praise and gifs of the show showing off how amazing it was. So I decided to give it a try. \nThe beginning of the story made me feel so confused. All I understood was that there was a red haired awkward boy who was constantly followed around by an annoying white-haired self-proclaimed alien with a talking fish. However, as time passed on and more episodes were watched, everything became clear and the plot revealed itself. However, Tsuritama is so much more than that. It'sabout a group of misunderstood outcasts who bond together over the hobby of fishing and understand the true meaning of friendship. \\n\\n\nThe art absolutely captivated me. When I first watched Tsuritama, the colorful bright array of colors was one of the only reasons I kept on watching. Enoshima was beautifully designed and colored to make it seem like a wonderful, peaceful place to live; and when the emotion of the story became hostile, they used the correct setting and colors to represent it. The character art isn't super gorgeous, but it's better than most animes out there.\\n\\n\nThe music used in the story fit each setting in the story perfectly. Its upbeat songs set the mood perfectly and sometimes it really pumped you up and sucked you in the anime even more. It can range from happy, to emotional, to an adventurous-type song. Even the sounds of the sea were realistic. If you closed your eyes, you could imagine yourself to be standing right next to the ocean. \\n\\n\nTsuritama oozes character development. The show does not really take in the time to get the complete background of the characters, but it gives you just enough to make you feel like they're on of your friends. Each one experiences some form of emotional growth, whether it's realizing how important family is to learning the virtues and friendship. The characters and their relationships absolutely touched my heart. \\n\\n\nIn the beginning, Tsuritama gave me mixed feelings but now it's touched me in so many ways and makes me appreciate the bonds I have with people even more. I implore you all to try out the anime; just watch a few episodes and you'll understand all of the praise that I have for it. Thank you.",

It will lure you in hook, line, and sinker, and make you question how an anime about fishing could ever be quite so enjoyable.\r\nThe story is set in the quaint town of Enoshima. There, the show\u2019s protagonists\u2014Yuki, Haru, Natsuki, Akira, and Tapioca (*quack quack*)\u2014all come together to share in a singular pastime: fishing.\r\nIt is through the characters\u2019 forced participation to undertake in this hobby that we are able to truly understand each and every one of their personal anxieties and motivations. We are imbued with a real sense of fulfilment, as through their fishing we arenot only a witness to their own personal growth, but also to the most important theme of the show\u2014friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that by the end of the last episode, you will find yourself truly invested in the characters. You will feel like you have walked through the streets of Enoshima yourself, and you will feel like you could just as easily cast off, and spend the afternoon winding down to a spot of fishing\u2014it can be that immersive at times.\\n\\n\r\nA big part of why is due to the art and the sound, which are both thoroughly quirky. The art in particular, opts for a unique style that colours the setting of Enoshima and its occupants, in a vivid, refreshing palette. It does a fantastic job of symbolising and emphasising certain parts, which at times can also make it feel rather reminiscent of a work by Shaft.\\n\\n\r\nThe use of sound is also well thought out. The OP and ED are incredibly catchy, and ease you into the feel of the show, whilst the soundtrack never feels repetitive, or out of place.\\n\\n\r\nIt should go without saying that there are obvious limitations. Notably, Haru, who you will turn out to either love or despise. There are also personal niggles of mine, which include how certain objects do not benefit from the art style, and how there is practically no development for the character Erika, but these are subjective.\\n\\n\r\nTsuritama, overall, feels like it offers exactly what it set out to do. It is silly, imaginative, and charming, never once complicating its wacky, yet simple plot with unnecessary information. It is a true feel good show that I can thoroughly recommend trying.\\n\\n\r\nDuck!",

Of course, as this isn't a silly battle shounen, it is much more than a simple excuse to randomly power up a character to beat the big bad evil, but rather, is a simple and heartwarming tale of how a mysterious alien boy manages to break the barriers of a few boys, helping them form bonds that would last a lifetime, helping them to grow beyond who they are.\r\nBeyond its excellent slice of life portion, the show also features a very bizarreplot. I often call these things silly, but it is done with some remarkable charm that I can't help but love it. Ranging from Tapioca to the D.U.C.K organization, the show mixes its 'serious' side with some very hilarious scenes, resulting in a great experience. The actual plot is pretty well done as well, resulting in a satisfying ending that perfectly concludes the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs yet another excellent entry into the slice of life genre, Tsuritama mixes the supernatural with strong characterization to create a hilarious and heart-warming work that can surely resonate with most.",

            "content": "With age comes a sense of self. Or at least, that's what Tsuritama wants us to believe. Ironically, though, the series itself never knows what it wants to be \u2013 is it a dramatic slice of life or a quirky, supernatural adventure? The result is ultimately spontaneous, for better or for worse. \r\nYuki has a hard time making friends. Always moving from place to place, there's little time for him to get to know anyone, and his social anxiety doesn't help. More than anything, he's afraid of being considered weird. But while living with his grandmother on the island of Enoshima, Yuki meets a self-proclaimed'alien' transfer student named Haru. To make matters worse, his grandmother is allowing Haru to stay with them, and he's asked their classmate to teach them to fish. Some may find this to be a bit of a boring premise, and they'd be right \u2013 it's just done very reasonably. When the rag-tag group begins to learn to cast their lines, choose their bait, and have fun, the series is at its best; even though the drama presented isn't anything groundbreaking, there's more than enough to keep the viewer entertained and smiling through these episodes... Until the direction of the series shifts drastically.\\n\\n\r\nDisorienting would be an understatement. The events that follow this change feel like two completely different shows quickly mashed together. Plot elements that were previously completely ignored or played off as jokes were then brought to the forefront, and the elements I was beginning to grow fond of became totally irrelevant. As Tsuritama makes its way down a long checklist of sci-fi and coming-of-age clich\u00e9s, we learn more about the history and goals of our characters as they work their way towards an unexciting climax. Given that the characters are nearly impossible to care about, the drama goes nowhere; the only effort put into writing them is regarding how weird or unique they are. It's enough for a simple slice of life, but becomes intolerable once any relatively serious element comes into play. \\n\\n\r\nThe only real consistency viewers should note is within the art and sound. If anything, the latter is too consistent. While the music is fun and compositionally playful, there's little risk or direction taken with it. The soundtrack is seemingly only made up of woodwind instruments and the occasional percussion, and that's the problem. While it may compliment the occasional scene, it usually sticks out like a sore thumb. The cheerfulness of it all doesn't refrain from playing in the middle of more dramatic or tense moments, so why not make use of silence? Character designs are also notable, but not in a positive fashion. The visuals are incredibly close to being considered good; you're shown scene after scene of bold, watercolour-inspired scenery and characters, yet something as simple as their hair doesn't match up with the rest of the artstyle. Thankfully, it's probably the only thing in the show that looks outright ugly, but it was more than enough to bother me a few times every episode. \\n\\n\r\nWith the first half of Tsuritama serving only as a setup for the second, it feels like a playful accident in which character development was an afterthought. As a whole, it could probably be described as an all-too-sweet desert stuffed into you after you're already full. The extra course proved to be a bit too much for me, but the less picky may find it welcome or even superior to the main dish. Taste is a strange beast to tackle.",

            "content": "It's a bit early yet to say anything definitive about Tsuritama. And yet I think that it's not too early to describe the series as rather unique. Having said that, I'll edit this review as the season progresses.\r\nTsuritama was created by the same director who did Mononoke and Trapeze - two series memorable for distinctive visual style and approach to storytelling. I think in some ways Tsuritama is a younger sibling to those series - while it is certainly as interesting to look at and only  mildly less thought-provoking, it has a sense of humor about it that is somehow invigorating - there's funto be had here, in a fishing village called Enoshima. The setting is certainly colorful, and it's got nothing on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOur lead, Yuki Sanada, is an anxious young man who has the unfortunate tendency to make a hideous facial expression whenever something makes him uncomfortable. His foil is a self-proclaimed alien invader named Haru who thus far seems to be capable of controlling people with a single squirt of his water gun. If it sounds like Haru is in any way sinister, you've been misled - so far, the only thing he enjoys using this power for is forcing unwilling high schoolers to dance a folk-dance. Haru is irrepressibly upbeat and smiley, and his character is more charming than anything else. Soon we meet a few other boys with social issues - there's Natsuki Usami, the \"fishing Prince,\" who seems rather friendless and resentful of his father. And perhaps best of all is an Indian boy with a duck accomplice - yes, a duck - who seems to be investigating Haru. The duck's name is Tapioca; the boy's name is Akira.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, these kids aren't exactly all that friendly with each other. But we should give them time.\\n\\n\r\nThis show pretends to be about fishing, but it's not. It pretends to be about an alien invasion, but that's not quite it either. It sometimes seems to be about social anxiety, and that's closer to the mark. As of now, Tsuritama is sprouting into a show about friendship among misfits. Our protagonists are as goofy a bunch of oddballs as any that anime proffers, but it is already apparent that the best friendships may be grown from mutual weirdness. \\n\\n\r\nIf all of this seems rather vague and plotless when laid before you, I think in some senses that's the point. This show is deliberately casual and nearly introspective in the way it develops its characters. There's something beautiful i how not a great deal of fuss is made about the fact that one of the lead protagonists is probably from a foreign planet. The show manages to be leisurely and captivating, and most importantly - it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. This is disarming, of course - because I think the show itself should be looked at with a serious eye.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis should appeal to fans of Kuragehime and Welcome to the NHK. Artistically and tonally, it has been noted that this is similar to Mawaru Penguindrum. I hope that Tsuritama earns a following like Penguindrum did, because it's just quirky enough to merit it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Tapioca is a duck; Akira feeds him duck curry. Ponder this.",

            "content": "Tsuritama (2012) is an \u201codd duck\u201d (pun intended) of an anime, meaning it uses a less common style of story telling. While many stories can happen almost \u201canywhere,\u201d and many occur in a fantasy location, this show has a very strong sense of a real place; namely Enoshima.\r\nEnoshima is an actual Island at the mouth of the Katase River in Sagami Bay, on the Pacific Ocean. The island is connected to the mainland by a pair of 600m bridges; a pedestrian bridge and a bridge for motor vehicles. Enoshima and Sagami Bay were made world famous for being the harbour and the area where thesailing races of the 1964 Olympic Games were held.  The island is the centre of Sh\u014dnan, a popular resort area both because of the sandy beaches, and because of its proximity to Tokyo. Enoshima is roughly halfway between the center of Tokyo and the top of Mount Fuji. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime renders accurate depictions of the area, albeit with vibrantly exaggerated colours. The bridges, the sky tree (a prominent feature of Enoshima), the train stations, the high school, the beaches and piers, even the bridge at the mouth of the Katase River, and many other features of the area are all reproduced quite well for us here to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a complex story with many layers and story types. It is partly a fishing story, partly a coming of age story, a story about the value of friendship and family, the importance of place, a even little bit of Man vs Alien, all with enough whimsy and over-the-top absurdity to keep it fun. With the exception of the opening of Episode 1, the entire story occurs in the Enoshima area, either on land or in the waters of Sagami Bay. And it is this strong sense of a real place that keeps the story somewhat grounded, even when the most absurd of events are occurring. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters are, obviously, caricatures. The story is primarily about Yuki Sanada, a boy so helplessly self-conscious that he makes an absurd face when under stress which only makes him feel even more self-conscious and stressed. He lives with his Grandmother, Keito Sanada. Yuki is not particularly bright nor gifted in any way, but he is a nice guy when he\u2019s not allowing himself to be too embarrassed to show it. Keito tries her best to guide and advise Yuki. \\n\\n\r\nUpon arriving in Enoshima, an alien named Haru moves in with Yuki and Keito. Haru\u2019s has arrived on Earth with his sister, Coco, and they have a mission to fulfil while here. Coco only shows up from time to time in the series. Haru immediately starts work on their mission, and Yuki is going to play a prominent role in fulfilling their mission on earth. Not being from earth, Haru is often unaware of human emotions and also find himself receiving plenty of advice from Keito.\\n\\n\r\nEverybody needs a hobby, a pastime, or some goals in life. And everyone needs a mentor to be able to succeed at any of those. Natsuki Usami, a fellow high school student of Yuki and Haru, is a bit of a loner. Natsuki starts as the fishing instructor and mentor for Yuki and Haru and becomes a friend to them over time. He is a locally famous for his fishing skills and is called the \u201cfishing prince\u201d for his skills in competitions. Natsuki lives with his father and sister. His relations with his father are strained, but he holds his sister quite dear and is like another, much kinder, person around her.\\n\\n\r\nThe last of the main characters is the alien hunter, Akira Agarkar Yamada. He is older than Yuki, Haru and Natsuki, by about 10 years, but he ends up in the same high school anyway. Akira is quite aloof and another loner character. Akira keeps a white goose (or is it an oversized duck), named Tapioca, with him at all times, and constantly talks to it. Akira is an agent of \u201cDuck,\u201d a mysterious organization that tracks aliens. Akira has enough rank to have several agents who report to him, but still reports to several layers of superiors within \u201cDuck.\u201d Unsurprisingly, \u201cDuck\u201d has resources at its command that would make most Generals, and even most Commanders-In-Chief, jealous. As Akira follows and starts interacting with Haru and the rest, he becomes aware of the mission that Haru and Coco have, and starts to take part with fulfilling their mission while also making fiends with Natsuki, Haru and Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and action are the catalyst for the bringing together of these four characters. Haru, in part to fulfill his mission and in part because of how his character is, is usually the one to push and pull the story along until the climactic scenes. Learning any new skill takes time and practice and the process can be quite frustrating, even for fishing. But this learning process is the time when Haru, Yuki and Natsuki start to get to know each other, and during this process they become closer. It is also during this process that Akira stops watching from afar, and starts to participate with the others.\\n\\n\r\nThe story shows us how Yuki turns from an awkward boy with little by way of roots in any place, to a more confident young man with a deep connection to Enoshima; for this reason alone the story\u2019s strong sense of place in Enoshima is critical. Haru, who knows little of human relationships, comes to learn of the importance of family and friends, and learns to participate as a friend amongst humans, all while receiving motherly advice from Keito and while being supported by his sister, Coco. Natsuki is able to open up enough to make friends with the others, and also opens himself up enough to improve his relations with his father. Meanwhile Akira is able to also open up and find friends, and to find the fortitude to stand up to what is important to him.\\n\\n\r\nFish tales are always hyperbole, and this anime is likewise over-the-top. But at its core is a heartwarming story about growing up and making friends, and about what friends can do together to overcome incredible hardships. It also shows that process of making friends is not without its own hardships, and that overcoming these hardships is well worth the effort. Likewise, the art style, the music, the story, the characters are all also over-the-top. But that it is all a bit over-the-top helps add to the comedy while softening some of the harsher moments.\\n\\n\r\nBecause it is a bit over-the-top it can be a bit hard to see the core of the story, specifically the character development of the main characters, at least at the beginning. But if you let yourself be taken in by this fish tale, you\u2019ll have a whale of a time.\\n",

            "content": "Watch the series from beginning to end. The first 5 episodes are slow, but it definitely picks up from there. The pacing of the story is like that of a swelling wave: first you don't notice how slowly it's building up, and then suddenly it's 30 feet high and growing more impressive by the second. \r\nAt first, I rated this anime an 8, but right now it's a solid 10, and it wouldnt have been without the earlier episodes to build it up to the final and beautiful conclusion. \r\nThe anime isn't exactly slice of life, if I had to pick a genre, it wouldprobably fit best in that category in terms of feel. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nThe story starts off with two main protagonists: Yuki (Japanese: Winter Snow) the red head with a fear of being stared at, and Haru (Spring), the innocent alien whose complete lack of self-consciousness allows him to bond with everyone. The story then expands to include Natsuki (Nastu=Summer), the reclusive fishing Prince with family problems, and Akira (Aki=fall), the indian who grew up friendless and claims that friendship is unnecessary. Each of these characters has a problem that they try to deal with on their own, but is unable to overcome until they accept the help from their friends. \\n\\n\r\nHaru is the most polarizing character of the bunch. Because he's an alien, he inadvertently says or does some very, very offensive things. Like, \"wow please just get punched in the face now\" offensive. If you hate the series because of Haru, or because the plot is too slow, just stick with it, because I promise it gets better.\\n\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nPlot: 10\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nYes, there is some plot. From the first episode, you see that an fishy alien (Haru) comes down to earth and meets the socially-anxious Yuki, and asks him to fish with him. Plot wise, the anime goes deeper into how Yuki masters each fishing technique (shounen-style) from his tutor Natsuki, while Akira, the DUCK officer, tries to observe Haru without drawing suspicious. While this might not sound exciting enough to make you keep watching, I promise you it is better than it sounds. And that the main draw of the anime isn't exactly the plot as it is the character development and the forging of friendships\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most beautiful part of this anime is seeing how each of these characters manages to change dramatically from the start of the series to the end, especially when you notice that a development in one character manages to spur maturity in another, and etc. Isn't this how we mature as people in real life, as well?\\n\\n\r\n- Pacing Note -\\n\\n\r\nFirst 5 episodes - slow, but the effort the show puts into developing basically every character and story you'll run into makes the emotional payoff from these episodes worth it. You have to pay attention, because there are so many beautiful little details scattered throughout that I didnt notice until I rewatched them (after episode 11)\\n\\n\r\nAll episodes after the first 5: just ridiculously amazing. The plot resurfaces after seemingly been shoved aside for awhile, and everything just picks up.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall, this a beautifully drawn anime with a relatively simple (though eccentric) plot of how these 4 really different people meet, become friends, and change each other for the better.",

            "content": "The story was very unique, but in a way it was almost it's crutch.  While I did l enjoy the creative mix of fishing, supernatural, and alien, sometimes the absurdity of it all made the the story feel kind of silly.  There were where times when the mixing of genres would take away the bite out of serious moments, of course there were also those pitched perfect moments where everything just came together.  It was a bit awkward, but for the most part, it just worked.\r\nI am a real sucker for interesting art styles, I really couldn't help but appreciate that inTsuritama.  The vibrant colors really made this anime pop, and it really suited a lot of the characters.  Towards the end of the series a lot of that color was brought down to fit the climax, what little color was left really gave it a surreal sort of tone, fitting for an alien.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great through out the series, though I did wish they would have changed the eyecatch a little at times.  Hearing its happy tone interrupting some of the more serious moment was a bit unsettling, luckily the series remained happy go lucky most of the time, so this problem didn't occur too much.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honestly, I had some trouble getting used to Haru at the beginning, but I eventually warmed up to is absurd personality.  As the story went on, Haru along with the rest of the cast became easier to sympathize with or just generally like.  Whether it is the father who is trying to fix the strained relationship with his son, or the hilarious antic of the love struck small time ship captain.  More notably our MC Yuki, a severely socially awkward young man, who is changed by a couple of strange new acquaintances, brought together by fishing.  We get a few really great character breakthroughs in the series that is just handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not one who easily enjoys everything they watch, but I really enjoyed this series.  I enjoyed it for its modesty, something I don't see as often in anime, something that was very apparent in this series (unless you misread friendships for something else).  The bond shared by close friends, and their obstacles they overcome together, something simple in a complex setting, something that just work.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this series although not the greatest anime ever.  A colorful story, wonderfully designed/likable characters, odd setting and an equally odd plot.  Tsuritama is a great watch, and a solid 8 from me.",

            "content": "*updated* Ah, fishing. It's how a group of four boys will quite possibly save the world.\r\nI'll be first to say that the premise of four quasi-bishonen boys is what enticed me to start tsuritama. The statement that this show is about an amazing story of saving the world comes at a close second.\r\nTsuritama spends part of the show developing characters and relationships and such, like an entertaining extended backstory. It has a very light mood, heavily reminiscent of a slice-of-life comedy, mixed with a little \"Growing-Up Protagonists\". However, without saying too much, the series then takes a relatively dark turn; and the original hook forthe series, the saving-the-world part, is addressed. The development of the characters from the earlier portion of the show further adds to the drama, and it makes a good normal-boys-turned-hero tale. With all this said, it is still not an action or fighting anime. It was never meant to be, but that doesn't mean it lacks suspense and emotion.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they are all very interesting, to begin with. In the main cast, first impressions are as follows: There's the But-Not-Too-Foreign Yuki with his thizz face panic attacks, the adorable alien Haru, Akira, the turban-wearing spy guy, and Natsuki, the tsundere fishing prince. With glasses. That doesn't even begin to cover all of tsuritama's characters. All of the cast is quirky and well-developed and it's truly fun to watch them interact with each other.\\n\\n\r\nI suck at critiquing art, but the art is particularly pretty and fascinating in tsuritama; with vibrant color palettes and seemingly brand new blends of ocean blue. The use of animated cut-out style backgrounds is kind of cool. In no way does the art style look cheap-o whatsoever, and they do great justice to the sea. They don't make water look overly realistic looking, but it is just as well-animated with the occasional cut-outs or lots of pretty blends of blue.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound makes good use of whimsical instruments and such, like flutes and recorders, to suit the relatively light mood of the series that takes place by the ocean. When necessary, the sound is able to take the central themes and create multiple semi-orchestral versions to suit the situation, varying from triumph to touching. Darker themes exist too, and they are executed quite well for such an airy series. It is well-suited to the series and fitting, but then again, it is nothing TOO spectacular; and for that it loses some points. I'd also like to pay special attention to the opening sequence, 'cause the song is really freaking catchy. The dancing OP is not as out of place as one would think it'd be, since it is a traditional Japanese dance (at least I think it is); and hey, Haru had the mind control gun. He could totally be controlling the cast to dance. The voice actors, as well, are very suited to their characters, especially Haru's bubbly voice.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend tsuritama: It's a story packed with great characters, humor, and captivating art.",

            "content": "Tsuritama is a science fiction comedy from 2012. It was written by Ono Toshiya and produced by A-1 Pictures. Yes, the studio that brought us Kuroshitsuji, Sword Art Online & Boku dake ga Inai Machi among others. In other words, their quality varies quite a bit. I haven't really heard anything about this anime, so I'm going into it pretty blind. Let's see how well it compares to the other A-1 anime I've reviewed. \r\nStory:\r\nYuki is a highly introverted lad who moves a lot. After moving to Enoshima, his life turns around. Another transfer student, Haru, comes into class and introduces himself as an alien.He then insists that Yuki go fishing with him to save the world. Shenanigans incoming. \\n\\n\r\nThe first noticeable issue with this series is that there's a lot of technical talk on the mechanics of fishing and it's all really tedious and completely uninteresting. Look, I know that your comedy here is using fishing as its method to save the world but that doesn't mean there's anything comedic about long explanations of how to catch mahi mahi or the proper way to cast. I would go so far as to say that that time could have been better spent on amusing hijinks. Another issue is that the series doesn't really take full advantage of the comedic possibilities of its premise. This is a series about aliens who can control humans with water and an alien teaming up with some humans to save the world by fishing. That's a premise that's so patently ridiculous that it shouldn't be that hard to make laughs happen. But they downplay the comedic elements in favour of teaching us the mechanics of fishing. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, those moments where they do embrace the absurdity tend to work pretty well. The funniest scenes all centre around Haru too. I will also say that some of the quieter, emotional moments are, surprisingly, really good. The scene where Yuki tells his grandmother how much she means to him in particular. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nTsuritama is a bit unusual in the regard that the major characters really vary. Haru is good for comedic scenes but not so much for anything more serious. Yuki can work in both, but has his strongest scenes in the more serious moments. Natsuki largely plays the straight man in the comedic bits and works better for the more emotional moments. Akira is just a flat, predictable character. The side characters largely exist to play off of the main cast and provide them with strong moments. The only ones who really stand out are Yuki's grandmother and Natsuki's father & sister. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pretty well done. There's a lot of effort put into making the water, fish and fishing equipment look polished. The character designs are a bit lacklustre, but functional. The animation is solidly done. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is pretty solid. We've got the talents of Irino Miyu, Osaka Ryota, Sugita Tomokazu, Uchiyama Kouki & various others. The performances are generally good for what they're doing. They can carry the comedic parts and sound like they're reading from the world's dullest instruction manual when explaining the mechanics of fishing or repeating them to show us that their character understands them. Osaka Ryota does a great job with the emotional stuff. The music is okay. Probably not anything I'd listen to again, but it's functional. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some moments betwixt Yuki and Haru where I question whether they're really just friends but there aren't many. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Tsuritama is a series that has its charming and funny moments but it's also a bit of a slog with stretches of tedium to get through before reaching those moments. In the end, its good moments elevate it above mediocrity, but it's not a superb series. It's just okay. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If you really love the mechanics of fishing, you'll probably like it better than I did. Next week I'll look at Palme no Ki.",

            "content": "Tsuritama was a cute adventure and a heartwarming story of friendship, with a healthy amount of sweet humor, likeable characters and pretty art mixed in. \r\nArt: (6) Tsuritama isn't going to offer you much if you put it side by side with the big studios like KyoAni or Madhouse (even though A1 Pictures aren't all that small themselves). With that said, the show offers a consistent quality and some really appealing, soft colors. The palate matches the cutesy, lighthearted theme of the show, especially on some of Haru's outfits (god damn I wish I had some of them.)\r\nI never found myself wowed by the backgrounds,character design or setting - but a tidy consistency does find itself here.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8) Toshino Ooya really did create a lovable cast here. Naturally, Haru is the shining star, but it isn't even the individual characters that I appreciated the most. The relationships between Natsuki and his family are something I found myself invested in, which is particularly surprising considering the lighthearted nature of this relatively concisely told show. Props also go to the Grandmother character who almost acted as a narrator and did a great job of acting as a spine for the morals the show tried to express.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character had their purpose and fulfilled it well, yet no-one felt thrown into the mix to fill a hole. There were a set amount of characters for comic relief, and none of them ever became stale or annoying.  Many of the characters were memorable and they played off of each other nicely.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (4) The story is the significant weak point that I find with this show. I won't spend much time on this topic because it would be too difficult to describe in detail without spoilers, but the change of pace that the show dragged itself into towards the end was crude, brash and unwelcome. The show felt very natural at the start, and as increasingly heavier plot developments arose, down went the ship, and the general atmosphere along with it. I would have been okay with this change, had it been that the heavy stuff was actually of substance, but it still carried the silly senselessness of the first lighthearted half of the show. It just felt unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8) Despite its flaws, Tsuritama was genuinely heartwarming and very fun to watch. I'd consider rewatching it in a year or two, but likely without the final few episodes.",

            "content": "Let me get one thing straight: I hated 2012. I hated all the stuff that has been going on in my life since November 2011, when everything I know and love suddenly started mercilessly going down the drain. Ever since then, I've wanted to crawl under a rock and die, and I still do! Heck, I'd even be so bold as to wish that the world DID end on December 21st, 2012! After all the crap that's been happening to me, I honestly didn't think I'd ever be happy again, and I still don't think I'll ever be truly happy again considering how traumatizing everything'sbeen for me...that is, until April 2012. What if, one day, you were in a really depressed mood, and then you suddenly find something that somehow manages to put a smile on your face throughout the whole thing. It's so cheery, so colorful, so funny, so bright, so optimistic, so joyful, and so downright refreshing that you feel so happy you wonder why you were ever depressed in the first place. That is Tsuritama, right here. I still consider anime to be my gateway drug in times of great despair and anguish...though this anime in itself just fulfilled all of my gateway drug wishes.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people were a bit confused by the story so I'll try to explain it as clearly as possible. There's this kid named Yuki whose grandmother has to move around a lot due to her job, and he hasn't been able to make friends, nor does he have the proper social skills to really make any, and is frequently overcome with anxiety, mostly in the form of his face turning into a red demon face which scares the heck out of everybody (Why does it happen to him? I dunno. They never explain it). So he and his grandmother move to Enoshima, a beautiful island by the sea. All of a sudden, Yuki is approached by this strange cloud cuckoolander kid named Haru who claims he's an alien and forces him to go fishing. Why? Because Haru wants to save the world. But why does he need Yuki of all people, and how can fishing save the world? Joining them are Natsuki, a sour kid who hates everybody, and Akira, a strange Indian guy who works for an organization named DUCK and has a pet duck named Tapioca. They go on a bunch of adventures while learning about fishing, though some strange stuff happens.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I noticed about anime in my seven years of watching them in Japanese, it's the fact that no two anime can really have the same animation style (save for some exceptions). Every anime is different in their presentation and animation, which I think is one of the reasons why I've stuck with a lot of anime for all these years, and Tsuritama is no different. However, Tsuritama's animation in itself is quite different from a lot of modern anime you see in this day and age. Everything is completely bright and colorful for the purpose of showing us the sheer joy we find in the things we like doing, like how Yuki grows to like fishing after trying it. The animation style also helps to set the mood when it needs to, bright when it's happy and cheery, dark when wants to be serious and morose, and believe me, Tsuritama DEFINITELY has its serious moments, and they do NOT mess around! It may help to know that the animation was done by A-1 Pictures, known for doing anime like Sora no Woto, Sword Art Online, AnoHana, and Fractale, all with the same simple but fluid and motion-filled style of animation. Granted, some faces get distorted at times, but it's not anything that'll kill the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is another area where the show shines brightly, because it also has a very unconventional soundtrack. Let's put it this way: it's basically 85% woodwind instruments, complete with FWEET noises all over...and it is awesome. All of said pieces are bouncy, happy, and cheerful sounding, completely fitting the show's bright color palette and cheerful mood. But there's still room for nice orchestral pieces and bombastic epic pieces too, all fitting their respective scenes and moods like peanut butter and jelly meshing together perfectly. I can't seem to find any flaws with it! It's the kind of music that'll stick in your head for years and never leave, and you'll find yourself whistling it forever!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another great aspect of the show. There are just too many shows ripping off each other with teenagers as lead characters who all have the same personalities and archetypes: there's a shy kid, a cheerful kid, a stoic sourpuss, etc. Tsuritama, however, makes it a point to give its characters as much development and originality as possible, and they wind up growing into great characters in the process, and they don't stick to their gimmicks for long. Yuki starts off cripplingly shy, but soon he's able to speak his mind. Natsuki starts off as a jerk, but he becomes kinder later on. Haru is just too oppressively cheerful, but there's a lot more to his excessive childlike cheer than he lets on. There's also the fact that the situations they're in play out more naturally and don't come off as cheesy or ham-fisted, truly setting off their development. All of the characters are great, and because they bounce off each other and clash like the dickens, their chemistry comes off as really natural and realistic. I can see people acting the way they do in real life, and the animation really helped in bringing them to life, too.\\n\\n\r\nI feel really bad trying to find flaws for this show, as it's the sweetest thing ever! But unfortunately, like all anime and everything else, it does have some flaws. For one thing, we never get a reason for where the heck Yuki's parents are, nor do we ever find out why he makes a demon face whenever he's anxious to the point of feeling like he's drowning. I also really didn't like Haru's Japanese voice. It got annoying hearing that overly squeaky voice...and surprisingly enough, his English dub voice improved on it in every single way! I seriously must talk about the English dub. Sentai Filmworks may not make good dubs most of the time, but when they hit, they hit REALLY hard, and Tsuritama is seriously one of the best English dubs they've made! Most of the voices are perfectly cast, the scripting is great, and it really does the show justice! I only found one major flaw with the dub, though: Sakura's voice. Nancy Novotny does her English voice, and while she isn't BAD, her voice is just too hoarse for a little kid like her, she sounds really forced, and unfortunately she misses the mark on one pivotal moment in episode 7. That, and I'm a HUGE Ogura Yui fan. That's about it. Plus, the first five episodes run at a slow pace and most of the episodes in that period are lessons on fishing, so it may test your patience quite a bit. Haru's English voice is seriously the high point of the English dub. It's like they shipped Miyu Irino off to America, made him take English for ten years, and recast him in the role, he's THAT good! You guys really need to check out the English dub! Also, my school's anime club absolutely LOVED this anime to death. We watched six straight episodes of it alongside Deadman Wonderland within two semesters!\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something sweet and colorful that'll put you in a good mood and tug at your heartstrings, fish Tsuritama out of the water! Enoshima don!",

I think that's the summary of my review.\r\nNo, seriously, this is one of the MOST confusing anime I've EVER seen in my whole bloody life. The first 3/4 episodes don't make much sense... and the story don't take off until ep 6. By then, I figure most people would've dropped it already. \r\nSo in a sense, this anime tests the viewer's perseverance .... and my God, if you persevered, you're in for one goodtreat. When the story kicks in, you are hooked, much like a fish. There's a sense of uniqueness surrounding this anime. You just gotta watch it to understand.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you've read my review all the way here, I thank you. But honestly, you would've noticed I've not talked about the characters/story/art etc at all. Well, I did say you gotta watch it to understand. I could say how good/bad this anime is, but that's my opinion. I only want to encourage others to explore an anime, instead of reading some stranger's comments.",

            "content": "-\r\nI've just recently started doing reviews on Youtube, and thought I might as well share them over here. They were written for video-form though, so either read it or give it a watch: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX84r7k6vNM\r\n-\r\nTsuritama is a 12-episode show full of quirky fun and sympathetic characters. It was produced by Studio A1-Pictures and aired  during 2012's spring season. \r\nWhile directed by Nakamura Kenji and written by Oono Toshiya, it is most likely best recognized for its character designer, Uki Atsuya. \r\nIn this kinda SoF, kinda sports and kinda sci-fi anime, the headline is \u201cYou can't catch fish if you don't go fishing, and you can'tmake friends if you don't at least try.\u201d\\n\r\nThe story follows Sanada Yuki, who just had to move to the island of Enoshima with his grandmother. His problem is, he's really bad at talking with strangers, can't handle pressure and therefore has problems making friends. \\n\r\nThen there's Haru, who just out of nowhere declares four things:\\n\r\n1. He's an alien. \\n\r\n2. He's now Yuki's friend.\\n\r\n3. He's now living with Yuki.   and\\n\r\n4. He wants to learn fishing with Yuki.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhy fishing?\u201d, you may ask. Well, there seems to be one of Haru's kin living in the sea around the island and threatening all of humanity, and he chose Yuki to help catch him.\\n\r\nThe dynamic between those two boys make out a great chunk of the show, as Haru really easily befriends just about anyone with his open and funny nature, and Yuki as the contrast, an introvert who usually prefers not to talk. Due to Haru having no clue of common sense from Yuki's perspective, they often clash with each other, but through that, Yuki can grow and become a better person making some friends on the way. \\n\r\nOne of these friends is Natsuki, an experienced fisher in their age, called the \u201cprince of fishing\u201d, who's constantly in argument with his father after his mother died, but cares deeply about his little sister. And believe me, he and his problems get their time to shine.\\n\r\nThen there's Akira, an indian agent for a secret organization called \u201cDUCK\u201d with the mission to find, observe and capture aliens. He's also a big fan of fishing and therefore combines his hobby with Haru's observation. He also has a duck called Tapioca.\\n\r\nIn the supporting cast, every character has their clear role and fulfills that without problems, Keito, the aforementioned grandmother, for example, who acts as a mentor for Haru or Koko, Haru's sister who doubts Yuki's ability to catch fish and puts even more pressure on him. And Tapioca is there as well. Just saying.\\n\r\nAll the characters, be it main cast or a supporting role, are extremely fun to watch and likeable.\\n\\n\r\nLike many other shows from A1-Pictures, Tsuritama's visuals seem gorgeous at first, especially in this case, as the unique artstyle full of blue and many light colors, really supports both the quirkyness and lightheartedness of the show. The animation though has some drops in the later parts from its usually pretty good standarts, but in this case, they aren't so major they'd interrupt your enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTsuritamas soundtrack by a band called \"Kuricorder Quartet\" simply fits the show perfectly.\\n\r\nAnd while that may seem totally random, some parts reminded me of the music for the \u201clost woods\u201d in \u201cocarina of time\u201d and \u201ckirby air ride\u201ds OST, two of my all-time favorite videogames, so that is cool.\\n\r\n Most of the sound is really soothing and calm or supports the shows quirky atmosphere, but even when for example Natsuki's story arc reaches its dramatic climax, the OST can adapt to that. That said though, there aren't really that many pieces I'd listen to outside of the series, and in these more dramatic parts, the opening and ending can really easily feel out of place if you marathon the show. \\n\r\nMy personal favorite tracks would be #1 \u2013 \u201cTsuritama March\u201d and #19 - \u201cHajimete Tsuru\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say anything about the japanese dub though, as I have no complaints whatsoever, but also can't crown one of the voice actors for doing a job out of the ordinarily good you find in any well made show.\\n\r\nAs for the english dub, well, it's passable. If you don't tend to like dubs, this won't convince you otherwise, but if you don't feel like reading subtitles, you might as well consider it as long as you're not too picky.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the only question left: Is Tsuritama worth the watch?\\n\r\nYes, definetly, go for it. I wouldn't define it as a must-watch, but if you have the opportunity to see it, you'll most likely not be disappointed, as I think just about everyone can get something out of the show.",

            "content": "=================\r\n                  INTRO\r\n=================\r\nWow. I'm surprised how this gem passed under my radar for so long. I've forgotten how long it was since I watched a show so fun and relaxing that I always have a stupid grin on my face after each episode.\r\nTsuritama is simple (the studio knows it) and sometimes simplicity is good enough for a show about fishing.\r\n=================\r\n             THE REVIEW\r\n=================\r\nThe show starts with Yuki, a socially awkward boy, transferring to a new school. There hemeets Haru, who's a hyperactive self-proclaimed alien, and invites him to fishing. Sounds silly? Don't worry it gets more sillier! Haha. From there on, you will see an indian guy, an alien organization that worships ducks, hilarious dances, squirt gun madness, a cool grandma, etc. You can actually see that the studio is having a great time making this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe background visuals are well suited to the show. It's simple but the colors are crisp and vibrant. There are times when the backgrounds looks like painting out of a canvass and it's just a treat to watch. The meshing of the colors are really relaxing to the eyes and you would just want to sit back, get a cool drink, and relax.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was also pretty good. Some might find it a little slow but for a premise such as fishing you don't need an adrenaline pumping sequence. Truthfully, every scene has a purpose and builds character.\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n             CHARACTERS\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nThis is where tsuritama shines.  Our main characters feel so alive. Yuki starts off as an anxious boy who's had a difficult time making friends due to him and his Grandma moving places so frequently. Natsuki, the fishing prince, is a grumpy rebellious boy who has a family problem. Ya-maaaaa-dah, the indian guy, starts off as a stalker. Haru, the alien, is just there to annoy Yuki. Each episode always bring something to their characters and by the end of the show they have shown a new level maturity and growth.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are also engaging specially the Grandma, Natsuki's family, and Tapioca the duck. Yes...the duck. I can't count how many times I've laughed whenever Tapioca gets a screentime. And come on, it's name alone makes me crave for a bubble tea.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the symbolisms. From Yuki getting drowned whenever anxious, Haru carrying a fishbowl, Natsuki getting a haircut, the flowers in the garden, etc. It provides a nice contrast to the silliness of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also good, I find myself always looking forward to the ED. When that \"Hooo..Ho Ho..Ho Ho.\" starts to fade in, I find myself humming to the tune and singing it. It's a nice song to listen to when you're at the beach.\\n\\n\r\nFor a SoL show, there is actually an overarching plot that slowly gets develop with each episode so even with the \"compelling story guys\", they will have a hard time bashing the show.\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n             VERDICT\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nTsuritama tells a good story and message. Like fishing, we may find ourselves bored and exhausted with our everyday lives; but when we finally caught that elusive fish, friendship in Yuki's case, it makes all those difficult moments worth it. Thing is, we should always cherish the smallest things in our lives no matter the hardship because that's what living comes down to.\\n\\n\r\nThere a some flaws with the show and I'm pretty conflicted whether I should deduct it to my score. It could've been better to add more characters or show some character's backstory but at the same time it felt like the overall intention of the show might get lost if it was the case. So ultimately, I give it:\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10!\\n\\n\r\nTsuritama is one of the best on its genre. It's full of enjoyable characters and silly moments. Don't watch this show with the intention of getting an adrenaline pumping story. A good way is to watch it once a week, gather your snacks, and watch with a friend or family.",

There, Yuki encounters the cheerfully alien Haru and Natsuki, the fishing prince. The main reason why Haru and Yuki became friends is to save the world from the danger threatening the island of Enoshima. A mysterious organization \u2018DUCK\u2019 tries to capture Haru thinking he\u2019s the main cause ofthe danger, and there they meet up with Akira (I didn\u2019t like him at all but then he was wicked cool at the end!). And the only person who can save the world is Yuki, and that\u2019s by learning how to fish. Thanks to Natsuki and other secondary characters in the story, Yuki\u2019s confidence is built up and his determination to keep his friends close and saving the world kept me at the edge of my toes.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the characters and the art of the anime was quite different than the typical ones I watch. I enjoyed it though!\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I loved the most about this anime is that the 4 friends learn from each other and that Akira might have took too much time to shine but in the end it was Haru who saved the day. I laughed and cried in the same time, so that means this anime is sugoi sugoi!!\\n\\n\\n",

I wanted to see what all the hype was about and it all far exceeded my expectations that were already set high for  silly show about fishing. I was curious.\r\nThe show is visually gorgeous. The colors used, the art, the animation...everything sets such a lovely and unique tone that is used throughout the whole show. It was unlike anything I have seen in such a long time. Mixed with the music, it was allsuper gorgeous. I haven't heard a soundtrack I enjoyed that much from an anime in a while. It is all so calming. Everything kept you hooked even when I wasn't quite sure where the plot was going. Speaking of plot, no one ever seemed to know what was going to happen in the next episode of the show, but not in a bad way. It was all done so well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that makes this show so amazing is the characters. This show is great for any fans of real character development. I was so happy to see all the characters grow as people, and change so much over the run of the series. It couldn't help but bring a smile to my face, and feel so proud of Yuki and the others for overcoming their insecurities and troubles. I feel silly saying it like that, but it was like nothing I had ever seen for development in a show before.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are lovely, and everyone has an important part in the plot right down to the final scenes. This show, even through the rough times, gives off such a nice vibe and I always was so excited to see what would happen next. I really couldn't help but fall in love with each and every character. Even after watching the series a few times, I still could never pick just one favorite.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a roller coaster of emotions, but it is certainly one of the best anime I have seen in years and one of my favorite. It is going to be hard for any show to compete to this one in terms of overall enjoyment.",

            "content": "Tsuritama is a story about fishing first and foremost. This is pretty obvious on the outset given the title and synopsis, but I say this in a very straightforward way. Tsuritama is about fishing, and that becomes a strength as well as a weakness in the show. Let's \"dive\" right in.\r\nCharacters/Story\r\nTsuritama has four main characters, each with their own little quirks and personalities as well as goals throughout the story. The first half of the story is quite lovely and got my hopes up for the rest of the show to be just like that. The initial protagonist Yuki struggling to fit in and overcominghis social anxiety through fishing really felt like it was a show about how Haru's worldview and overall attitude changes as he discovers more about fishing. Unfortunately about half way through is when the side plot of the aliens kicks into full gear and almost quite literally swallows the show whole. By itself the alien plot isn't terrible, but it nearly completely overshadows any character development that Yuki gets and doesn't feel tied in with his struggles very well. It starts to course correct at the end, but by then it's hard to care as much as in the beginning. The neat visual metaphors and whatnot in the beginning are nearly gone by the end, making me wonder if this show would have worked better being two separate ones\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are generally fun, although if you dislike high pitched anime boy yelling you'll probably dislike Haru for the first few episodes before he calms down in pitch. The strongest character by far is Yuki, who receives a bulk of the overall development and really the one who has changed the most in the end. Natsuki is fun to see loosen up over time (even with some questionable moments near the middle). Yamada...honestly feels like such a waste in this story. His character is alright but they really force him into the trio of Y/H/N without giving him a ton to do until the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nTsuritama has a colorful, oceany palette and a pleasing artstyle overall. Characters appear off-model enough times to be noticed but this is balanced out by a few surprise sakuga scenes and interesting use of camera movements. The art and animation are generally serviceable (with props to the drawings of Haru's \"demon face\" which always felt like it conveyed that expression so perfectly for me). \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nTsuritama has quite a few lovely background tracks that really emulate a sort of small town beach vibe that blends great with the series. I would say at times I was even paying more attention to the background music than the show, at least enough to want to look up tracks later on. The op is bright and poppy, while the ed is a bit more melancholy, both which I think represent some of the feelings the show is going for and add to the beachy vibe. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nTsuritama is hard to recommend seriously. I admire the first half a ton for the themes it's trying to touch on and the visual metaphors it uses to portray them. Where is gets lost for me is when it decides to almost completely abandon those ideas in favor for a far less interesting and investing side plot. If you enjoy colorful and fun anime about the powers of friendship and fishing, you'll probably enjoy this one quite a bit. Otherwise, you don't really have to bother unless you want something to breeze through on a slow day. \\n\\n\r\n~Howl",

            "content": "Being able to relate to the main character on the basis of being a socially awkward individual, I decided to give this anime a chance. I was more than pleasantly surprised.\r\nI can understand why this isn't a top anime, it has its many, many flaws but the characters is not one of them. From the main character who is introduced as a young boy with the inability to hold social interactions and develop relationships, to his sick grandmother who supports him and provides the young boy with comfort and a honey coated tongue. All the characters are well thought out and have a great senseof depth as seen throughout the summer in which they are seen; we able able to see them grow and develop. These characters surprise us in more ways we can count, they are not predictable nor are they exactly alike other characters we have previously seen in similar genres. \\n\r\nThe way the characters interact with one another is entertaining and sometimes very realistic. They can be relatable in a way that you can link your own experiences to them and form a special type of bond as you can imagine yourself in their shoes, going through the same situations. Obviously with the supernatural themes it was harder to relate at some points, however the overcasting theme of the importance of friendship and good relationships was prevalent in many of these scenes which was another of its strong points as you could still understand where the characters where coming from.\\n\r\nHowever the actual story line was where the quality of the anime dropped considerably. Though it was well paced at most times, there were certain points where it really lacked in the art of story telling. Additionally, all the themes mixed together lead to a childish plot near the ending, one in which the viewer was unable to take the story seriously as it lacked depth. Despite this, there were some very high points where the story would bring tears to my eyes and warmth to my heart, though it was simplistic at times but this did not stop the message from coming across.\\n\r\nThe art was extremely appealing and was another factor that I was initially drawn to. It was simplistic in a way that was visually  pleasing and is recognisable due to the unique techniques used. The main setting was the sea and the way it was portrayed in this anime definitely didn't disappoint, everything from the fish to the reflection of the sun across the water made the visuals a great success for this anime, it was memorable and well done. It did a great job of adding to the story rather than taking away from it or being a distracting turn-off.\\n\r\nI particularly liked the opening and ending theme songs for this anime, they added very well to the story and they represented it very well with the opening being more upbeat and catchy and the ending more relaxing and soothing. The background music fit the situations well as they were not overly distracting, however they did not stand out well enough to be particularly noteworthy. The voices fit the characters well and was another strong point for the anime. They were each distinctive and portrayed the characters in their unique ways that gave them another layer of depth and realistic attributes.\\n\r\nOverall this story of overcoming hardships and anxiety, creating friends and having an adventure whilst fishing was a highly pleasing one that I would definitely recommend. It is a truly underrated anime that should be given more credit for its characters and development. It lingers on its main themes in a way that is intuitive and forces the viewers to reflect. This is an anime that would be enjoyed by most that gave it a chance.\\n",

            "content": "I decided to watch Tsuritama because I saw it on an anime magazine recommendation. I finished this anime in one day. To be honest, I have mixed feelings about this anime.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe premise is really enticing. After reading the introduction for this anime, my expectation for Tsuritama becomes very high. However, I was dissapointed for the first 6 episodes. The creators try to build up the relationship between our main characters, who are relationship-challenged teenagers, but this is done in a boring fashion. Basically, no major events happened in the first half of this anime. The second half of the anime becomes much better, though.The 4 companions overcomes their own emotional issues, and work together to save the world (i won't spoil further). This part is done much better, as the drama scenes are emotional, and all plot threads come together to make a somewhat dramatic and satisfying ending. Overall, the story is only acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIf you don't know yet, this anime is made in 2012. The movement sequences are smooth. That being said, there are no spectacular artwork in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nFrankly, I didn't like the sound in this anime. The opening song is bland. The sound tracks used in this anime is appropriate in some circumstances, but out of place in other places. The ending song, though, is sung  exceedingly beautifully with a relaxing tone that fits the end of each episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters portrayal in this anime is not bad. Although I disliked the 4 problematic boys at first, I admired how they have grown up in the process of fishing together by the end of the anime. Basically, each of the teenager, especially Yuki and Natsuki, has a major problem that he overcame in the end. The supporting characters are also pretty well portrayed. On the other hand, none of these characters leave a lasting impression on my mind.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI almost give up on this anime at episode 4 or 5. I didn't enjoy this anime's first half, and the second half's enjoyment is about 75%. I think if the viewers are in puberty, and especially have problems similar to the major characters in the anime, the viewers might relate to this anime. \\n\r\nAnother negative side to this anime is that it adds a lot of wacky elements that, in my opinion, destroys this anime (ie. Duck). Seriously, those wacky moments are not funny at all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5\\n\r\n6.5 is a really low score in my list (in my bottom 20% ranking). This anime had some potential, but most of it ends up not being realized. Still, the 4 hours (12 eps) spent watching this anime were not completely wasted, as it did provide some entertainment in the end.",

            "content": "I'm going to try and be as objective as possible, but with a show that's affected me so profoundly, it's going to be tough.\r\nThe thing about this show is it's almost subliminal, which is ironic because it is partially about mind control.  What on the surface just seems like a goofy show about aliens and fishing is actually very deep and explores important topics, such as making friends, learning a new skill, dealing with loss, learning to accept people...ah. And it does so with an aura that is not only vibrant but tranquil at the same time, somehow.\r\nI watched this anime during a prettyrough time and it just made my entire day to sit down and watch it and forget about my troubles...It's hard to be objective about a show I'm so attached to.  I guess it's one flaw would be that it is pretty confusing.  Some things are never fully explained, and some characters are left not quite as fleshed out as I would have liked.  But I guess what I like about the show is that it focuses on the \"everyday problems\" of the characters and less about the unrelatable aspects, like the aliens and the mind control and the secret agents.  It is a slice-of-life, after all, however it would have been interesting to see the other side of the plot.  \\n\\n\r\nI was going to make a stupid water pun but...nah.  Just watch this anime.  You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Story: The entire story is random. All of it, so don't try to logic through it and put things together. That said, as things go along you get caught up in the nonsense to the point that it all makes perfect sense! It's difficult to describe, but this is pretty much it. My first impression was that the show might be a slice of life like Nichijou or Azumanga but with males and fishing. Totally wrong. What seems like a non-existent plot quickly comes together to form an epic fight to save the world. At the same time Tsuritama manages to shine light on allaspects of life in a meaningful way, touching on life, death, friendship, finding yourself, growing up, family and departure. Sometimes it even surprised me with the seriousness that often arose within the most ridiculous of situations, it creates a very interesting juxtaposition, but it works. Overall, it all comes together to form a ridiculously enjoyable plot work. The only thing I could've wished would be that it had been longer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is refreshingly simple and colourful. At first I thought it wasn't that good but that was just because the simple art combined with the simple story at the beginning gave me a children's show vibe but that feeling is quickly negated.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music didn't stand out to me that much but I actually don't feel this anime needs too much going on with music while there are other elements that are already so exaggerated. Otherwise, the opening is very catchy and features more of the infamous Enoshima dance that you'll probably come to love. The ending was not as impactful for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are well-developed and each undergoes a great deal of growth throughout this short series. The four main characters are so compatible with each other and it's a joy to watch as they interact with each other and come to know each other. Their personalities eventually become very real and very relatable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Don't glaze over this anime without watching to at least episode three, then make your decision! It starts off confusing but it really does come together to be something great.  It's probably one of the most exciting things about fishing I've ever seen and left me with a warm feeling and a stupid grin after every episode, it's not the kind of show you'll finish watching and then quickly forget about.",

            "content": "After finishing Tsuritama, I felt compelled to write a review. This anime managed to grasp me more than any other sports anime I've watched so far (though all I've watched is Free! and part of Haikyuu!! currently). It has the same sequence as the others: people who have their odds but have to come together in the end for a common goal. But the characterization in this one made it special to me.\r\nStory and Character: 10\r\nI'm doing these together because I couldn't write about them apart. I liked that this wasn't some romantic relationship based show where the shy boy meets a girl who changeshim. The way it happened, not just by accident but by deliberate choice on the outgoing boy's part, was funny, The story wouldn't have unfolded the same if it had been up to fate or by accident due to the main character's (Yuki) stifling fear of interaction with people. Haru was this breath of fresh air because he wasn't just some outgoing, cute character who changed everyone in town. The way he struggled to interact with or like a human was different than the usual half animal struggles so it gave him a new special aspect and his goal of the show along with how he developed throughout and his interactions with Keiko, Yuki's grandma, gave him depth. \\n\\n\r\nNatsuki was the brooding character of the series but I think the best part about him was the family aspect of his character. He softened pretty quickly towards Yuki and Haru, even once in the first episode because of his sister around. But with him there was more for him to deal with than the fishing and that was dealing with loss and staying with his family. His growth was based here and that was the most important thing to him. \\n\\n\r\nYuki had all the personal growth of the series left to him. He had obstacles and hurdles and barrels of things to get past before he could be the greater person in episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nKeiko was really just cute and quirky and a great voice of wisdom throughout the series. She'd be the coolest grandma and I'm glad she was one of the main parental figures for both Haru and Yuki. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art in this one was cool and fun. It was super generic or cookie-cutter like many animes can be and they did something a little different that worked with the flow and feel of the story. The quirky style was a great addition to the whole package.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nThe music throughout was cute and went along with the show well. \\n\\n\r\nI felt overwhelmed, as I still do, with love for this series. It wasn't like the other sports animes I've watched where everything is really intense and emotional. It was an upbeat, funny chance and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I hope I can find more comedic sports animes like this one because it was just a nice feel good show that I would recommend to anyone. \\n",

(Note, there might be spoilers)\r\nSTORY: 10\r\nThe story is much, much different from your usual sports anime. Usually in sports anime, the goal is to become the best at whatever sport your doing. However, in Tsuritama, they are instead trying to fish up an alien, which is much different than I expected.\r\nART: 8\r\nI loved the art. It was different from your usual anime. However, there are somethings I didn't like. One of the major flaws for me is how, what I think it is, is the shine onobjects. To me, it looked like everything was wet and disgusting. The other thing is, sometimes the characters just looked really weirdly, mainly the fact characters will appear cross-eyed, like a lot. Overall, pretty good.\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nThis has my favorite soundtrack out of ANY anime I have seen. I haven't skipped the opening song or the ending song ONCE, which was something I always did after at least 3 episodes. The music fitted what was happening and it was darn beautiful.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the characters! Throughout the anime, you could see the characters change in their personality.\\n\r\nNow I would of given this a 9, if it wasn't for one character. Keito. This might be pretty weird, but I loved her character. She was sweet and caring even when things were rough. Funnily enough, she made this the second anime were I actually cried in (the other being Kotoura-san). I loved her conversations with Haru.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nI loved the anime through the whole thing. I don't know much to say on this section, but it was just really enjoyable.\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n\r\nIt was overall a wonderful experience. It had made its way as one of my favorites and would recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "It is rare to find a story that seems both entirely implausible and out-of-this-world, yet still manages to be easily grasped by the most average of players. Tsuritama is a diamond in the rough, indeed. As the story begins to unfold following Yuki, a boy who is both endearing and relatable, Tsuritama doesn't hold back its true colors. The art is bright and magnificent, the music is like rafting down a stream with a faithful companion, and the humor is unashamed, full of quirk--and the understanding that sometimes everyone feels like they're drowning in a sea. \r\nOn one hand, the story moves so effortlessly thatit is easy to forget that there is a wide-eyed boy claiming to be an alien running amok. Though, on the other hand, between a self-proclaimed alien and a mysterious man who talks to his duck, it can be just as easily forgotten that the story is, above all, about a few unlikely friends who are simply going fishing. The craft of story telling is mastered beautifully in Tsuritama. Even among the moments of concentrated fishing, there is never a feeling of doubt that this isn't just fishing--it's more, and that propels the story to move at an easy pace--ultimately too quickly by the series' end.\\n\\n\r\nWhat ultimately shines in Tsuritama are the characters. None are without fault, and all are able to experience evident growth throughout the series. In true coming-of-age fashion, the boys are confronted with real-life issues of death, family, and friendship. The interactions between Yuki's grandmother and innocent, self-proclaimed alien Haru are some of the most poignant, as he learns about the inevitability of goodbye and the frailty of the human spirit. \\n\\n\r\nTsuritama is an artistic gem. It is not by any means an \"average\" slice of life, nor is it too fantastical to be grasped. While it lends itself to be a coming-of-age, that is not easily won on the viewer who, at its end, longs to be forever young, surrounded by the best of companions, with a hook and rod in hand. Perhaps that is, after all, how to save the world.",

And one day he tranfers to a highschool located at Enoshima Island where he meets Haru that is calling himself an alien that suddenly says lets save the world...\r\nYeah... WHat is werid about this anime is its combination of the hilarous plots and how the fun characters handles it.\r\nNow this is the first sport(ish) anime i\u00b4veseen where it\u00b4s about fishing, proffesionall fishing. However it doesn\u00b4t solely focus on that, you also get involved in the main characters families situations(except Haru) and the classcial every day school life of a slice of life anime. \\n\r\nAlthough it has some kind supernatural elements or imagined thingies i am not sure it has a very enjoyable setting and characters. Its artstyle is great and fits perfect together iwth everything the anime is about.\\n\r\nThe sound fits in nice as well when it makes the background of the anime come more alive especially the ocean.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i find this a weird and enjoyable experience with its own humor and original story a nice anime.

At first I thought this was a way too colourful anime about nothing... maybe fishing, but it has a story (an odd one) and it has nice characters, AND the happy-go-lucky atmosphere is catchy!\r\nStarting with the story... a shy-almost-antisocial teenager, Yuki, starts hanging out (against his will) with Haru, a boy who says he's an alien. And they... go fishing. But that is not an easy thing to do so they train under Natsuki, the \"Fishing Prince\". What they don't know is that they are closely followed by a strange Indian and hisduck named Tapioca. And also, fishing might just be the only way to save the world! Except for Haru, the other main characters aren't really the friendly type, but they will soon learn the meaning of friendship. I truly enjoyed how the anime concentrated on developing the characters and teaching them lessons about life, friendship and fishing.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may know, art&sound reviews aren't really that good but I will try my best. The animation is really colourful, but it fits the atmosphere really well. The style suddenly changes to emphasize different feeling (sometimes they are really scary). As for the music, it's quite catchy and suitable for the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou won't find a deep story in Tsuritama, but it's not one of those anime with 10 episodes about nothing and 2 with the story. The first half of the anime concentrates more on the characters and fishing and... a lot of stuff that might make you curious about what the story is about. I am no salesman, really, and if Tsuritama is not your type then you shouldn't watch it, but if you have mixed feelings just watch one or two episode and it may just catch you too. I told you it's contagious!",

            "content": "Story: Tsuritama is a coming of age story about a boy name Yuki who moves to Enoshima with his grandmother and why you ask does this have anything to do with FISHING? Well, a lot actually. Through his time in this small town he not only learns to make friends but develop into a \"hero.\" Yes I said hero, because our main character Yuki somehow wound up saving the plant.\r\nArt: The art by far is quite interesting, and you can see this through the opening and the show during regular times. Nothing much to say in this department, so compliments to the design team. Forthe most part the art is well done with the use of bright colors emitting the surrounding and characters. One specific character... and that's Haru enthralled me especially with his outfits.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now this is what makes Tsuritama almost perfect... its music. With no negativity whatsoever the music is done well in that it does not fail to capture the feeling of hanging out on an island- if you get what I mean. Truth is, I've never been to enoshima nor have I ever went fishing, but the surrounding plus the music makes it all feel fresh and not boring... a good way pass time REALLY! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Yuki *Claps *Claps Sorry, its just so beautiful to see a character like Yuki grow almost like how beautiful it is seeing a plant sprout and grow into a beautiful flower. Weird metaphor but I wouldn't put it any other way. Yuki hands down might be my favorite character... that's probably enough to see the show, but I'll bring in another character. Haru, ah Haru is the perfect foil to the extremely quite Yuki in that he talks a lot for a guy and speaks his mind. If you could have two people who could read each other's mind I think it'll be Yuki and Haru; one is so dependent of the other. I didn't mention but the other characters also main characters as well are awesome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I gotta say that Tsuritama is an anime I always look to for good character development and world building. It's not great that the anime takes place in a rural town but this (Enoshima) is where the country kids are given a more broad look at... things like phones, computers, shopping malls aren't apparent on the countryside so they take fun in fishing! I love it. The theme is so real and inspiring, like I really want to go fishing now... thanks Tsuritama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Maybe try the anime out and see how it goes? One thing you won't miss for sure is the life that Tsuritama brings to both it's character and surrounding city of Enoshima. I desperately hope for a second season, but for now let's just dream. My impression of Tsuritama was that it was very good- not gonna lie I was clapping at Yuki's development in the end and smiling... yeah so that might make some intrigue. Peace out!\\n\\n",

I've found it.\r\nPerfectly executed, genuine, preposterous, ridiculous, surreal, funny, I love it.\r\nMy heart is still warm and fuzzy and happy.\r\nThis one has loads of the magic in it that I miss in most stories. Lots of moments, personality, sillyness, panache.\r\nFriendship: The anime.\r\nI still cannot quite believe this got made. If this can get made, then we haven't seen anything yet.\r\nThank you, Guardian Enzo of Lost in Anime! I found this via your Top 10 of 2012 and it did not disappoint.\r\nWho would have thunk that this director of all people would make such a happy, irreverentanime?\\n\\n\r\nHe was probably the only one who could do such a thing, actually.\\n\\n\r\nI want to buy this as a Download right now.

            "content": "=============================\r\n                        The story\r\n=============================\r\nAn excellent slice of life and comedy anime. It's for sure in my top 10 in this category. Tsuritama brought something new in the anime industry in 2012. Weither is for the art or the story. The story itself is something that we haven't seen a lot among other anime.\r\nBasically,Tsuritama is about fishing and aliens who have the power to control humans with water. Tsuritama is also about how important friendship is in our lives. Also, the story takes placein Enoshima,a beautiful island.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,I loved the originality of the story and how funny and cute it was. Another anime I'm adding on my must watch list anime. \\n\r\n=============================\\n\r\n                        Characters\\n\r\n=============================\\n\r\nIn Tsuritama, we are following the path of a new group of friends formed by unique boys. One called Yuki moved a lo,because of his grandma's lifestyle.  She likes to live and see different places. So,of course, Yuki had to change frequently of school and introducing himself to the class is extremely stressful for him. Everytime he is getting anxious about something, he makes a horrible face that scares people.\\n\\n\r\nThe second member of the group is Haru. He always introduces himself as an alien. He is cute and knows how to propagate happiness around him.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki is the one who taught to Yuki and Haru how to fish. He is well known for his participation in national fishing competitions. He owned his nickname there \"Fishing Prince\". He acts different when he is around his sister. An attentionate an protecting brother VS A cold,franc, distant and irritated boy. His attitude will change after passing more and more time with Haru and Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nAkira is the last one to join the group. He is a mysterious and stoic Indian prince working for the organization called \"Duck\". He is transfered in Yuki's class to investigate about the alien/Haru despite 25 years old. He is always with his duck named Tapioca.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well developped and the staff managed to keep things funny when someone struggles with anything social. At times,they kept things serious. They created a perfect balance between the serious and the funny.\\n\\n\r\n=============================\\n\r\n                              Art\\n\r\n=============================\\n\r\nIt's an art we don't see quite often,but you'll be used to if you aren't already familiar with it.\\n\r\nColorful not as much ad No game no life,but many bright collors are present.\\n\\n\r\nTsuritama is ,in my opinion, in my scale of how-detailed-the-anime-is, I would give it a medium-high. It's not the most detailed I have seen,but we can see they put a big attention on the water and the environment. If we look at the characters, they are drawn in a simple way. \\n\r\n=============================\\n\r\n                           Music\\n\r\n=============================\\n\r\nI'm in love with the opening. Just by watching it, you want to dance along with the characters. A catchy song with a dance that is pretty easy to learn and not too complicated. Maybe you can dance it in a convention with other otakus.\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the ost has nothing special or made me shiver, but it still not a bad ost. \\n\\n\r\nThe music they choose is appropriate for each scene and te sound effects are accurate. By accurate, I mean the sounds concord with the environment the characters are in. For example, during the typhoon,in the calm sea, at the top of the tower,etc. (Wind,waves...)\\n\\n\r\n=============================\\n\r\n              My final note is 9/10\\n\r\n=============================",

            "content": "I'll admit, the colour in the artwork got my attention first. I'd also seen tidbits of the anime and was really curlous about all that water, it looked so cool! I was also excited since it was only 12 episodes, I'd finish in no time right? I was expecting water, fish, and fishing. \r\nThe story? At first it seemed slice-of-life which I'm used to watching, but it also had lots of random parts when Haru entered the story, which was refreshing. The way the characters came together and interacted was pretty quick, and I liked that in a small-town setting.The best part is watching thecharacters warm up to each other and develop by solving their problems together, such as Natsuki with his family. Everything is relatively calm until around the 7th episode, and then I realized 'ok now it's getting serious'. As for Haru's gun-pointing, I understand that it might look 'cool' to some people; it doesn't promote violence because it was just a water gun but I just feel a little off about it. However, whenever Haru used it I imagined him as a spoiled child, but it is his weapon. Scenes where Natsuki taught them how to fish were interesting to learn too. Overall it was short, but I felt that every scene was important, either for plot or for enjoyment. I'm glad there wasn't anything too serious in here, like violence, death or any of that stuff, but you can still take it seriously. Happy endings are yay :)\\n\\n\r\nI instantly fell in like with Yuki. I could relate to his awkwardness so easily that I just wanted to cheer him on even though I laughed at his reactions to his moments. Haru was made a very likeable character because of his alien attitude and I really liked that. Seeing him learn from Keito was interesting too. I especially like how he brought Yuki out, from being a bit of a loner to a guy with a small group of good friends sharing a passion for fishing. The best part is that, although he isn't an alien, they don't make him a complete idiot either. THANK YOU. Natsuki was a little hard to understand; I thought he was a complete nerd but he was actually a serious guy. I understood how he felt  with his family's situation and I don't blame him. He's especially..funny when he's with his sister. I sometimes forgot Akira's age when he was hanging out with the others, but he was an ok guy too. His stiffness made him a little more interesting, and his relationship with Tapioca is just...cute. They're all fun characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound? That means the theme and ending song right? Both are equally awesome and I completely understand when people encourage you not to skip them..so don't! They both fit the mood - the beginning gets you all hyped as you anticipate the episode, and the end song completes it with a soothing finish. The music in the anime was good too~relaxing\\n\\n\r\nThe art - bright colours! I love bright colours! I normally find other animes bland because of their pale, pasty colours, but the colour done in here made everything more lifelike. Like Haru, I'm also fond of Yuki's hair, haha. The animation is great, things are always moving around...I can almost feel the effort as I'm watching it. I also have a strange satisfaction when I get to see the sky and the water in the anime..because it's blue! The characters' expressions were great as well (esp Yuki's face of course). And..fish!!! The last episode is the best episode to see fish ;D \\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing was amusing to watch. As for reactions, I was was biting my lip, squealing in despair, laughing out loud or just smirking. I didn't need to rely on to the humor or anything in particular to be interested, I was literally...hooked!! But mind you, I didn't pick an anime about fishing to inspire me to go fishing. Now I'm going to re-watch it again consecutively so that I can take it all in ^^\\n\\n\r\nHow is a fish supposed to feel when it goes fishing?",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that this is my first formal review and I chose Tsuritama because it is fresh in my mind, and there wasn't a single moment when I wasn't enjoying myself while watching it. No, I didn't give it mostly 10's across the board because I'm a generally positive person. I gave it almost all 10's because I honestly believe it deserved it.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe plot, concept, and originality.\r\nTsuritama has a plot that may originally come off as simple and not worth the time. An anime about fishing? Sitting on a dock, boat, beach and waiting for a fish to bite? If youthink about it that way Tsuritama may not be the most appealing to some people, but if you discovered it the way I did, the atmosphere it gives off is alluring. I went into watching it completely clueless as to what awaited me in these 12 episodes. The concept had me from the very beginning. Yes, there was fishing but it wasn't in the least uninteresting. It was actually quite exciting.  Now, combine that with aliens? For as long as I'm around, I would've never thought of an anime combining fishing and aliens. And not the stereotypical aliens either. There's nothing new under the sun, but combining this idea of extraterrestrial life and sport came pretty close for me. I wasn't at all expecting some of the twists thrown in there but they weren't jarring enough to be repelling. The originality of it was almost striking.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe colors, style, and animation.\\n\r\nI am one to love a nice bright variety of colors, so I may be a bit biased, but it really was this selection of colors that drew me in. Add that to the unique art style and it was almost hypnotizing. I was captivated by all the different shades and brilliant hues exercised within the art without being hard to look at. It was a very nice variation from the darker animes I watch that use mostly a pallet based off of varying shades of black or other ominous, shady colors. The coloring brightened the atmosphere and made it generally more comfortable and more enjoyable. As for the style, I, myself, have tried to mimic it without very much success which usually isn't the case. It is simplistic in a way, but also quite detailed when it comes down to the tack and gear. Now, I will say, it may just be my computer, but I did find the animation to be a bit choppy in some places. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes, soundtrack, and voicing.\\n\r\nI don't think there was even an episode where I dared to skip to the opening theme. Combined with the art, I'd say the theme song is perfection. I didn't pay too much attention to the end though, as I was eager to move on to the next episode. I did really get to enjoy the ending theme though on the last episode before the afterward. Usually, I pay much attention to the soundtracks playing in the background. In Tsuritama I found it difficult to do. The art, and subtitles distracted me from really giving it too much thought. That and the fact that it just blended right in with the anime. In this case, that's a good thing as it boosted the pleasant atmosphere and went very smoothly with the rest of the effects and voices.\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, I'd have to say it was average. My expectations weren't previously set by a manga version, so all the voices seemed to go with the characters nicely. The only thing thing that bothered me, and perhaps the sole reason this category received a nine was the fact that there'd occasionally be a scene where the voices were either not expressive enough or too expressive, more so the later. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe design and development.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the characters' designed as none of the main characters had a generic design. Haru has a unique appearance, background, personality, and wardrobe which I find to be pleasant. While there are other characters with similar personality traits out there, Haru does these little things that set him apart from those other characters, whether it be noise making or otherwise. And how many characters do you know like Yuki? Bright red hair, a troll face, awkward voiceovers and behavior, and the fact that he makes up these scenarios where he's drowning when socializing or being the center of attention. Other than his name, his character just radiating uniqueness. Now Natsuki may first appear like some generic student, serious, wears glasses but his grouchy attitude definitely spiced things up. Now we come to Akira. I have seen other characters similar to his, but what defines him is Tapioca, his duck. As for the character development, Tsuritama had a lot of it. A majority of the development was done by Yuki and Natsuki. Gradually Yuki became more comfortable and gained courage thanks to Haru forcing him into being social.  Natsuki too changed throughout the course of the anime, going from cold and grumpy to more open. The other characters grew too, just in less obvious ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAs I've said, after watching so many intense, depressing, and dark animes I thoroughly enjoyed Tsuritama. The characters were entertaining, funny, adorable and I felt like this anime was definitely worth my time. In fact I regret not watching it earlier! It's definitely my feel-good anime of the year. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nGreat, original story, great original characters, unique art, wonderful opening and by far one of the most satisfying animes. For an anime with only twelve episodes too, they really pulled it off well and ended it well without rushing it. It was so heartwarming it was impossible for me to not enjoy it. I look forward to re-watching it when I have the time.",

            "content": "*Contains a bit of spoilers*\r\nStory: 8\r\nWow... This anime turned out better than I expected. I expected this to be an anime about casual fishing but it went from cute and light hearted to something that's intense, a bit dark and has actual story plot. Tsuritama is an anime that teaches you about friendships and building trust you have with one another.\r\nHowever, there were some scenes I do not agree with which is that scene where it seems like Natsuki is at fault during his birthday.  \r\nLastly, ended off on a good and cute note showing what the characters are doing 6 months later anda mini flashback kind of scene from episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nYuki's face when he's nervous or scared really made me not want to watch the anime. But after he managed to overcome his anxiety problems and became more confident, I started to like him as a character as well.\\n\\n\r\nHaru was annoying me with his carefree attitude, commenting and bugging Yuki so much in the beginning. Later on, he's a very thoughtful, cute and caring character which my heart felt touched by him.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki, voiced by the seiyuu that voiced Tsukishima Kei from Haikyuu. Both of them even kind of resemble each other xD Seems like a douchey person at first does not take the viewer too long to like him as well as he turned out to be a great friend and kind person too.\\n\\n\r\nAhh Akira, my favourite character in this anime, voiced by the seiyuu which voiced for Gintoki in Gintama. I did not like him at first as well as I thought he might hurt Haru. But as he continues to follow and observe him, he's actually a kind, cute and smart person. \\n\\n\r\nTapioca is a cute and actually smart duck that's loved by everyone and only able to communicate with Akira.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters were such an enjoyment to watch with their cheerful and outgoing personality. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nPretty ok. Not that good, other than it having lots of bright colours. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe opening end ending song is too long. Plus some effect sounds they included into the anime hurt my ears a bit.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8/10\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were boring to me and I thought of dropping it. However, I endured and as it progresses, I'm glad I did not stop watching it. This is also one of the few animes that shows not all aliens are evil. There are cute moments, funny moments and sad moments throughout this anime. But sometimes, the anime breaks the serious moments with a small gag which I don't know if it's a good idea or not. Pretty refreshing and kind of weird anime but really underated and worth watching after all.",

            "content": "Tsuritama- 8/10\r\nGenres: Comedy, Slice of Life, Sci-Fi, Sports \r\nPlot-8/10: Tsuritama takes place in a small fishing community called Enoshima. Here, the main character, Yuki, makes three unique friends: an alien, a fishing prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and a member of a secret agency (and his duck, Tapioca). Over the course of 12 episodes, Yuki learns how to fish and for the first time experiences true friendship and pure fun. \r\nHaving never watched an anime about fishing, I enjoyed the unique premise. I appreciate that the anime takes its time to explain certain things about fishing (most times through dialogue), like the importance of using the right lure, howto get better accuracy, etc. This information isn\u2019t all thrown right in the audience\u2019s face, but dispersed throughout, avoiding long and boring info-dump scenes. \\n\\n\r\nNear the end of the anime, the atmosphere changes quite drastically. It feels more like an intense action anime than it does a slice of life anime. This change of pace does not come out of the blue, as it was built up with foreshadowing since the beginning of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 9/10: From the start, the art is what attracted me and had me glued to Tsuritama. Its bright colors and attractive character designs caught my attention. The backgrounds were drawn with simplicity, yet were very pretty and created a strong setting. The ocean was especially beautiful. The animation was also good, though great like the art. \\n\\n\r\nAudio- 8/10: The opening is very catchy and upbeat, setting the general mood of the anime. The ending is likewise cheerful. The voice actors put on compelling performances, especially Yuki\u2019s. With so much emotion put into each role, it is easy to get attached to the characters and get caught up in their moments of joy, melancholy, excitement, and anger. The soundtrack was nothing I\u2019d call memorable though it does accompany the animation and pacing of the anime quite nicely. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10/10: The main cast of characters is diverse and interesting. Each of the four main characters gets development and defining moments.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, there is Yuki, the socially awkward kid who is constantly moving from place to place. Because of this, he does not have any friends and is very shy. Despite being timid, he is a fast and adept learner and appreciates his newfound friends. Many can relate to his reserved nature, including me (though not as bad as his), making him a character we care for.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Haru, the alien who has a mission to carry out on Earth. Haru, not knowing anything about how humans work, is susceptible to making mistakes. He does not understand human emotions like anger, or ideas like trust. Still, Haru is always looking out for the people he cares about and makes an effort to keep them happy. \\n\\n\r\nNext is Natsuki, a native of Enoshima. Nicknamed \u201cFishing Prince\u201d, he is very skilled and disciplined. He at first seems arrogant and douchey, but develops as he spends time with Yuki and the others. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, there is Akira, a member of a secretive agency. There is not much to say about him without spoilers, other than he is of Indian descent and carries a duck named Tapioca everywhere he goes. \\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness- 8/10: Like all comedy anime, it is either a hit or a miss. I found some parts to be funny, while others were over the top or even \u201ccringy\u201d. A lot of the comedy comes from Haru\u2019s silly antics and curiosity. \\n\r\nThe pacing was on point for the majority if not all of the anime. The suspense and build up to the climax was great and had me eager for the next episode. No part of the anime feels wasted as each scene either moves the story forward or develops the characters. \\n\r\nEverything comes together to give the audience a unique viewing experience, filled with laughs, excitement, and even a few tears. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8.6/10: Tsuritama, an anime that conveys the importance and beauty of friendship through the sport of fishing, is one hidden gem. With stunning art, moving voice acting, and relatable characters, it is enjoyable from start to finish. \\n",

The characters able to develop as the story goes through. It has resolve unlike other anime. It also has a satisfying ending. I did enjoy watching this I will be bias since I love the color blue.

            "content": "Let me just start off by saying I don't normally do reviews. However, after just finishing the final episode I feel strongly compelled to do so. \r\nI seen this anime appear on recommended lists many of times, however based off of the sypnosis, I passed it off many times. Now that I've finished it, my only regret is the fact I never watched this sooner. You can read this as it contains no spoilers. \r\nCharacters:\r\nThe very first thing I noticed about this anime right off the bat was the characters. Not once was I ever bored with a single one of them. Infact, I foundmyself highly intrigued with every single one instead of just a select few like I do in most animes. What caught me off guard was how unique and quirky they all were. Most animes tend to do so in a way which I find annoying and repetitive, however in this one it wasn't bothersome at all and made me grow to love them even more. From Haru's usual antics, Yuki freaking out from his social anxiety, to Akira and Tapioca being downright ridiculous, they helped pull me out of my depression just for a while and laugh for the first time and days. I highly recommend this series if you need something to pick you up. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe music was great. I grew to love the opening as time went on, and by the end of the series I found myself singing the Enoshima dance song, and even wanting to do the dance myself! I didn't notice a flaw with it as I was so into the story and characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed right away was the anime style. Though I typically am not picky with that, I did like it and found it very pretty with how simple and relaxing it was. As far as I could tell the animation was fine, I saw no mistakes and again, was too enraptured in the characters and story to notice. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nI expected it to be a boring show solely about fishing. I never expected it to turn out the way it did! And when Haru was talking about certain things at the beginning I never actually took him seriously! Well boy was I proven wrong. I've never seen an anime like this, and I've watched over 200, so I'd say in my perspective it was quite original. The plot twists were unexpected and every episode just had me wanting more and more. If theres one thing that this anime has taught me, it's to not judge an anime based off of its sypnosis! In other words, things aren't always what they seem to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nI think it's quite obvious how much I enjoyed this! \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 10/10. I enjoyed it and there wasn't a second that I wasn't bored with it. I found myself ignoring messages just to keep watching more! This here is a hidden gem in the rough, that you'll never find unless you stumble upon it. Since you have now though, I hope you too can watch it without judgement, I promise it'll be worth your time!",

I was very impressed because it was a very \"colorful\" anime, but after some episodes I thought Haru was a very boring character, even though in the start he was the prettiest in my opinion. I was very surprised how Akira got very important during the story, but what made me finish this anime was how the characters were well developed, because the story didn't catch ME atall, I mean, it wasn't well done as the characters' personalities, in my opinion. After all, it's a really great anime that you could watch if you don't have anything better to do!",

You will definitely pick a favourite, but it will surely be a hard decision as they are all so good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Tsuritama to absolutely everyone, no matter of gender nor age as this is suitable for everyone. Anyone would find it very enjoyable! I assure you that this anime will leave you wanting more, and you will experience many emotions throughout watching it. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you find my review helpful and hope you consider adding Tsuritama to your list! \\n\\n\r\n-somesilentirony x",

            "content": "Story: A very original story about a very shy guy. Yuki who feels like he's rowning whenever he get's nervous, who meets an alien. Haru on Enoshima who turns his life upside down and invites him to go fishing with him. Well, not that Yuki wants to go fishing, but that water-pistol Haru has has some unique....power over humans.\r\nThe story is pretty original but a bit too over-the-top, that's why I 'only' give it a \"good\" 7/10.\r\nArt: The art is colourful and really suits the athmosphere of the anime. The island is depicted so beautifully that I really want to go on a vacation there\"Great\" 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: One song you will hear almost every Episode is the song of the Enoshima-dance. Haino haino haino~ yoisho yoishona~. The soundtrack is very heart-warming and befitting, I would not have it any other way. \"very good\" 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are outstanding. I escpecially loved the character developement of the main character Yuki, and Natsuki. At first you will probably hate Haru, and maybe you will do so until Episode 8 or 9...but in the end you should also come to know how valuable he really is. And Akira and his duck tapioca also give us a lot of comic relief. But maybe Akira and DUCK were the things that bothered me the most. Still, the characters were \"outstanding\" 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it a lot, and it didn't even take me a week to finish this Anime. I liked every Episode of it. \"Great\" 9/19\\n\\n\r\nOverall I will still 'only' give it an 8 \"very good\", because the story could have been less over-the-top, escpecially towards the end. Still I would recommend this to everyone who wants a heart-warming story of friendsship and family.\\n\r\n8/10",
