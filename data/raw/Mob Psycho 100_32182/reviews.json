            "content": "There\u2019s probably a million ways to describe Mob Psycho 100. One simple word is just exciting. How can it not be? It\u2019s by the same creator of one of the most talked about shows from 2015, One-Punch Man. As a reader of the source material, I can also firmly say that the show\u2019s trailers and hype is legitimate. Not in the legitimate way that it\u2019s the best anime of the century. It\u2019s more of legitimate excellency that represents classic supernatural entertainment.\r\nEven if you\u2019re unfamiliar ONE\u2019s work, you\u2019ll easily recognize that Mob Psycho 100 isn\u2019t just a show with traditional artwork. The visual follows the mangapretty closely while the action sequences are animated by a famed studio, Bones. Plus, we got director Yuzuru Tachikawa on board as part of the staff. Known for his work such as Death Parade, Terror in Tokyo, and Kill la Kill, it\u2019s definitely something to get excited about. Fans of the franchise will be also be pleased to know that Kawai Kenji is the sound director, known for famous works such as the Ghost in the Shell franchise, Gundam 00, and the more recent Joker Game. Still, Mob Psycho 100 is beyond what just the staff has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not always so simple to understand the visual representation of Mob Psycho 100. Taking a closer look at the storytelling will give you a better idea as we are introduced to the main characters. At its core, we have main protagonist Shigeo Kageyama, otherwise known as Mob. He is a 14 year old kid attending a school with an average life. However, it\u2019s immediately obvious that he is a special because of his ESP powers. Events in the story causes his powers to go unstable and Mob finds himself difficult to be \u201cnormal\u201d. The premise is pretty simple on paper, right? An ordinary kid who tries to live a normal life with abnormal ability is the basic idea. However, the series delivers many scenarios where Mob uses his powers way more than he should. For a kid who wants a normal life, he gets into many abnormal situations which puts himself at risk. Still, this isn\u2019t exactly the case as we\u2019ll see how powerful Mob is. While he isn\u2019t a Saitama 2.0, Mob\u2019s abilities are not to be underestimated. In many battles he\u2019s been in, Mob is able to overpower his opponents, sometimes without even realizing it. It\u2019s interesting to also see what often triggers Mob to get involved in such unusual events. Social peer pressure and bullying are a few factors. Mob also seeks admiration and even wants to impress a girl he likes so this leads to him making mistakes at times. I mean, he is still human and humans make mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nEven though he is the titular character, the show doesn\u2019t neglect its others especially with characters such as Reigen, Ritsu (Mob\u2019s younger brother), Teruki, and Dimple. Ritsu has really grown to me as a very interesting character. Unlike Mob, he is very clever and often uses trickery to get what he wants. Sometimes, he even treats life as if it\u2019s a game where playing the right cards will win. What most impresses me about Ritsu is his own self-awareness and how despite being powerless in the beginning, he is able to rise up as a leader. It\u2019s also shown that he has an inferiority complex compared to his brother (because he originally lacked special powers) and that causes himself to express doubt. This eventually also turns into guilt and there\u2019s reasoning for redemption. \\n\\n\r\nReigen is also an interesting character who is known as \u201cMob\u2019s master\u201d. He claims a lot of things and often speaks and lies with the truth. Despite being manipulative, he isn\u2019t a bad guy and often looks out after Mob\u2019 well-being. He also offers good advice to Mob including what really makes someone a \u201cbetter person\u201d.  One weakness that I do find about him though is his unwillingness to admit mistakes. Somewhere in between, there\u2019s Teruki (\u201cTeru\u201d). I have to admit though, this guy has one of the most ridiculous hair styles I\u2019ve ever seen from ONE\u2019s work. Unlike Mob, he freely uses his esper powers like if they are God\u2019s holy gift. What makes him interesting is how after meeting Mob, Teru undergoes a big change in his character. It\u2019s like a bully that reinvents himself after getting put to his place for the first time in their life. Quite iconic if you ask me. Finally, Dimple strikes to me as the most mysterious character. In fact, he isn\u2019t even human! He\u2019s actually a spirit who even at one time had his own cult. What makes him interesting is despite having a God-like complex and ego, Dimple also wants others succeed in particular Mob. With such a colorful character cast in this series, expectations are met especially when it comes to creativity. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the story looking complex, it really isn\u2019t. The first few episodes introduces our main characters while most episodes for the first half just follows Mob\u2019s life in his daily misadventures. The latter half focuses more on linear plot though as dangerous individuals are introduced that truly tests the strengths of our protagonists. This puts strains on Mob as he must overcome his personal demons. Because remember, Mob just wants to live a normal life and when he gets stressed, rage follows. When that rage explodes, we get Mob Psycho 100%, literally. And it\u2019s not a very pretty sight.\\n\\n\r\nAs a source reader, I am impressed at how they adapted the character relationships. Mob and Ritsu has one of the most complex relationship even as brothers. Teru\u2019s evolution from a bully to a sidekick/ally to Mob is both amusing and also impressive to see as changes aren\u2019t always easy for characters to accept. Reigen\u2019s relationship with Mob is also based on respect and trust. Mob genuinely cares about Reigen and in one episode, his rage level almost goes out of control after seeing his master being put down. On the other hand, I am slightly disappointed that the season is only a 1-cour of 12 episodes. Some episodes are rushed as I was hoping they would adapt more into the story. For most parts, the series is still directed with good faith. \\n\\n\r\nAh yes, the artwork and visuals. Even though I already talked about it before, it\u2019s really hard to ignore Mob Psycho 100\u2019s quality with its artistic style. It is very stylistic to the manga and unique in quality. When things get serious, the artwork really works with its hardcore cinematography. Violent scenes really do feel impactful while body movements never really suffers in the show as character designs are simple enough to avoid that. In addition, Mob\u2019s character is portrayed as pretty plain normal just as he should be. Other characters such as Teru and Dimple stands out with some unique physical traits; seriously, I still can\u2019t get over how ridiculous Teru\u2019s hair is at times. In retrospect, Bones did a fantastic job with the production for the show. With talented animators such as Yoshimichi Kameda and Matsumoto Norio involved in this project, Mob Psycho 100 stands out extravagantly in the artistic field.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t underestimate the soundtrack either. The OP and ED theme songs are also stylistic and as a whole. The OST is instrumental and often intense during many segments. Character voice expressions are also noticeable especially when Mob\u2019s mentality reaches 100%. And because the show is so filled with personality, the speech pattern and dialogues of the more prominent characters are often very memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe amazing thing about Mob Psycho 100 is the excitement while feeling less of an anime but more like a comic action flick. As an adaptation, the show is stuffed with action, personality, and creativity. I can\u2019t remember any episode where I was watching the clock and in fact often feel like episodes goes way too fast. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat? That episode felt like 5 minutes?!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s because of how entertaining it is that is more than just pure popcorn entertainment. Sure, this might not be a series that\u2019s suitable for everyone. However, Mob Psycho 100 stands on its own merits and is definitely not just a One-Punch Man-wannabee. Crafted by ONE, it\u2019s a show that\u2019s more than a supernatural character drama. It\u2019s just a damn good piece of greatness. \\n",

            "content": "Uninspiring, highly overrated, and cheap. Brilliance and creativity are the last things to come to mind while watching Mob Psycho 100.\r\nThe story is a complete joke. It is a major step-down compared to One's other work, One Punch Man. The entire story plays out like a tale a 5th grader would write and present. Of the many terrible presentations Mob Psycho 100 has to offer, One of the most bothersome reoccurring things is that the show lacks of creativity. The main character in particular, shares the same characteristic traits and personality of Saitama from One Punch Man. The plot and story always feature an overpoweredmain character that is socially awkward trying to save the day with his inexplicably obtained powers. The main characters in his works usually lack any motivation unless they're triggered more than the typical girl on Tumblr. Rinse & repeat for every this process for just about every episode and that my dear readers is the show.  If this continues as a re-occurring theme for his stories, One needs to do a better job with creating and introducing a story, plot, and characters that doesn\u2019t appear too similar to his other works. \\n\\n\r\nFun fact: Did you know that you can pretty much get an idea of what the plot is about for the rest of the series based upon the opening title sequence alone?\\n\\n\r\nOne was either sitting on the toilet or taking a shower when he thought about what was going to happen next for this series. The director could have easily changed specific things to make it more intriguing however; there were no signs of that happening. Now perhaps one of the interesting things involving the story was that certain episode's do like to focus on more serious matters. It wasn't all nonsensical fighting. To contradict what I said about the toilet thing earlier, there were a few moments in the story were the characters did try to improve their powers while trying to understand the most complicated things about their psychic powers and abilities.\\n\\n\r\nThere were multiple scenes featured within the story where tense emotional dialogue would temporarily take over action scenes. It made the show a little more \u201cdramatic\u201d however; I don\u2019t believe that most of the parts where these \u201cdramatic moments\u201d had taken place were proper. This was evident during many of the fights. The pacing of the story was pretty straight-forward. Often times there didn't seem to be a reason to go back and explain certain details within the story. Depending on how you perceived the show, I didn\u2019t thing that the story was as awful as others make it out to be. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the story could\u2019ve have definitely used some touching up! Plot developments lack excitement; it\u2019s constantly riddled with predictable moments, and lacks an interesting narrative. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation, character designs, quality and background settings. The following are the shows weak points in the art department. There were some pretty decent fighting and action sequences. The bad thing is that they are plagued with awful choices made in quality, setting, and special effects. I look back at earlier episodes like 4 & 5 prospectively, and believe that within the entire series 4 & 5 had the best fight scenes; this is me being nice by the way. Although the background setting featured in those particular episode were plain and dull. The school yard setting reminded me of old anime from the 70's, 80's, and 90's. In those days, background settings were not that important unless it had meaning.Of course it being 2016 at the time of this review, it is highly unacceptable by today\u2019s standards.. \\n\\n\r\nThe animators often times put a lot effort into the details of a fight. Characters muscles, facial reactions, and body reactions along with the well fitted dialogue, worked out pretty damn well. Sometimes, it made for more believable and intense fights. Not all fights were good though, I use episode 8 such as, during the time Mob is getting Rekt, the animation, facial expressions body movements looked a complete mess. While it may be fixed in the Blu-ray it still doesn't change the fact that it was terrible at first.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, special effects like the rain and the auroras surrounding characters while they are using their powers. It looked as if the animators just went into after effects or even Sony Vegas, created them, and put them into the final product. It seems safe to say that this series was on a budget. \\n\\n\r\nThis could be good or bad because if you're reading the manga then you can tell that the animators decided to stick with the original designs created by One. Bad thing is that, if you're like me, and care about seeing animators put a lot effort towards making an original work look better with upgraded character designs, special effects, and lots of great details in various scenes, you would be disappointed. Now I've seen many, many titles where the manga or LN designs look, and are much more beautiful than the anime however, now is not the time to discuss it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Mob psycho is a visual disaster!  Characters designs in the manga, as mentioned earlier lack any kind of beauty or aesthetics. But, I'm focused on the anime now. Getting back on the subject, anime character designs are a pain to look at. Every other character appears to look exactly alike in facial features. This ranges from the head shapes, eyes, along with facial structures and hair. The appearances of characters, background settings, clothing, and background objects seen within the series are poor in quality and design. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty decent. There were less than a handful of tracks and sound effects that made the show stand out. The music composed for certain scenes that express sadness, depression enhances the mood and atmosphere. Songs created for the fight sequences were lacking an edge to make the fight more engaging. The voice actors were \u201cokay.\u201d I didn't think the actors had the right attitude for the series. \\n\\n\r\nSome seiyuu\u2019s are dedicated to making their characters sound more realistic by remember something that made them angry in the past and expressing the anger they felt from that experience to make a more believable attitude or sound for their characters vocals. For the most part, I did not feel that the voice actors were putting forth all their potential.\\n\\n\r\nIn ONE's future work I hope that he introduces more original characters. The characters are too one-dimensional. I wanted to drop this show on episode 2 because of this. The main character Shigeo is a blatant, lazily copy & pasted Saitama. I had trouble trying to like Shigeo because he doesn't have the same appeal that Saitama does, despite being a rip off. Shigeo's most unappealing trait is his socially awkward and clueless demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes it's cute when girls in anime are shy and awkward, however guys, not so much. Side characters are a joke. You know, as I\u2019m writing this, I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a good word to describe them because they were not in any way funny. While some give a little entertainment others are so annoying. I found this true mostly with the antagonists. The so-called \"supportive\" characters are more like comic relief than anything else.ONE appears to lack the ability to create characters that have a more \u201cunique\u201d and \u201crich\u201d personality. His bad habit of copying and pasting the same characters from his different work is getting stale.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment during the span of this series ranged from \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cokay.\u201d I usually drop titles after four episodes however the fourth was a deal breaker. I gradually continued to hope that maybe a new development in the story and characters would come along to change my negative feelings for Mob Psycho. This simply was not the case. Some may argue that \u201cmost people fail to see the shows appeal\u201d or that \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t judge a show based upon appearances.\u201d I argue back that when it comes down to Mob Psycho, the show tosses away fluent story-telling, creative writing, lasting appeal, memorable characters, good character designs, creative background settings, quality animation and a soundtrack with songs you can keep on repeat.\\n\\n\r\nThe real question is why and how? How could a show that has such awful traits be so highly praised? The answer is simple. Simplicity is what the show builds its foundation upon. The entire show is simple enough for anyone new or old to anime understand easily and most importantly enjoy. Its\u2019 welcoming, the show doesn\u2019t need good character designs or a good introduction. Having high quality animation? Forget that! Everything is kept simple, and that\u2019s\u2019 actually a good thing. I think of it as an old Nintendo console. You play Super Mario bros 3. You\u2019re having a good time, sure the graphics aren\u2019t the best, but the important thing is that you\u2019re having a good time. You\u2019re having fun seeing the simplicity and joy of Mario flying around in a tanooki suit crushing goomba\u2019s and turtles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mob Psycho 100 really needed work in creativity. Mob Psycho would\u2019ve continued to do well \\n\r\nas just a manga title. As for whether I recommend this or not, I would actually say yes. Mob is a pretty good despite the fact that it lacks appeal, creative story-telling, and quality. Referring Mob, or even considering Mob Psycho 100 to be less than or equal to One-Punch Man is an insult.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts,\\n\\n\r\nI felt that Mob Psycho 100 deserved a solid 4/10 for trying\u2026 if you even want to call it that. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever watched an anime that had 12 episodes that had very interesting visuals, great characters (and development) and story that was charming in its own nature? No? Well Mob Psycho 100 is right here for you to watch! \r\nStory - 8/10 \r\nTo be entirely honest, I didn't think much with this series. I was going to skip over it and not even bat an eye at it--why? I heard it was by ONE and even though I enjoyed One Punch Man, it wasn't something I'd rewatch and go after again. I tend to steer away from \"stereotypical\" shounen series nowadays. I thought thisseries was going to be the same formula. I was wrong. Yes, the anime starts off slow--yes it appears to be recycled garbage at first. But it really evolves into something very charming.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of this series is pretty simplistic. Mob is the main character and he's a middle school boy who's an outcast from most of society, including social circles. What separates him from the norm is his psychic abilities. It's quite a quirky show with a lot of comedy elements. Each episode consists of Mob going after spirits and  performing an exorcism using his psychic abilities. Along the way you meet different characters that add to the comedy aspect of this anime.  With this said, story-wise. It's more of a character driven show, but honestly, I like the simple story and how it goes deeper and deeper into the world building. Conflicts arise later in the series and the way it's handled between the characters is nothing short of amazing. I don't know about you, but I'm really sick of melodramatic sequences in stories where characters act really stupid (i.e. romcoms) and it ruins the quality of storyline. \\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 doesn't do that--it propels a simple story with endearing characters. I'm honestly so surprised how much world building we got in 12 episodes without it feeling rushed (I'm an anime only so I do not know how well paced it was compared to the source material). \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nBones has done it again with another incredible job with animation! The art is probably what makes this anime stick out so much--and why people probably turned a blind eye to this series. Which is such a shame given the beautifully fluid animation; especially in action scenes! The style may come off more cartoony than the traditional \"moe\" anime style we are all used to, but I promise you that it's not a reason to overlook this anime. I personally think the style is unique and really sets a tone for the series. It's simple in nature much like the story. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe OP \"Mob Choir 99\" is such a catchy tune and you start counting with the song every week! The visuals that go with it is also very catching! You notice something new every time you look it. The ED song is very simple and mellow--this captures the easy going nature of the series (until the battles scenes though lol).  The OSTS are also very interesting to hear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've seen comedy series get 25 episodes and do absolutely nothing with the characters and shove repetitive rubbish in my face episode after episode. Whether you like the comedy or not is entirely subjective, but regardless, in 12 episodes I never once felt that rubbish shoving in my face. The characters manage to get more development in such a short amount of time compared to anime with 24 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Mob, starts off fairly easy to read. He's introverted in nature and isn't good with social interactions. The only thing he seems to be good at is his psychic abilities--he has deep admiration for his little brother who seems to be the top at everything except what Mob is good at. Later in the story, we see how Mob expresses his emotions and feelings. We see how complicated and powerful he truly is. But what separates him from most main shounen characters is his modesty--he doesn't want these powers and he never once in the 12 episodes ever desires to be stronger. He's never egotistic about it. He never shows it off. He's almost always kind to anyone who returns kindness to him. He tries his best and he's deeply supported by those around him. He's a misfit in theory, but he's managed to have so many people care about him and despite his struggle to express feelings, he's close to them as well. He never wants to hurt anyone unless it's a spirit. He'll do anything to protect his brother and friends even if it meant throwing away personal values. And even when he's been knocked down and defeated, he gets back up and though he may lose his way, he still tries. Maybe not with strength, maybe just maybe, in the end he will win without really winning. Maybe he'll succeed with only restoring those personal values and the faith others have given him. Mob, the main character of Mob Psycho 100.\\n\\n\r\nAnything else I say about the characters would be considered spoilers, and I wouldn't want to ruin it! But for the sake of summary, Ritsu (Mob's brother) has great development and beautiful characters bonding between brothers :') Reigen (Mob's Master) comes off as an asshole in the beginning and you come to think that he only uses Mob as a tool for his own personal gain. Later on however, you come to realize there's way more to him than at first though. He will also have his shinning moment! Ekubo (Mob's spirit friend) starts off evil but then develops a bond not just between Mob, but the other main characters and even some of the supporting characters. He went from bad to not so bad haha. \\n\\n\r\nAny other characters that have some sort of role are likable and charming to say the least. It's just all well balanced with a full set of cast without making it feel overwhelming! I'm just so impressed with how Bones handled this anime--so very impressed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThrough the comedy, stunning action, great characters, and unraveling plot, this anime didn't fail to assume me! I'm so excited to see a season 2 ASAP! I highly recommend this anime :) \\n",

            "content": "Funny, whimsical, charming, and oddly enough, thoughtful. \r\nMob Psycho 100 is another comedic/action endeavor brought to us by author ONE, the mind behind 2015's breakout hit, One Punch Man, and like that success story, this also carries with it his signature flare for cool action set-pieces, theatrical displays of goofball antics, an art presence that's immediately eye-catching, all while being peppered with an obtuse sense of humor that's interwoven to form the finished product. And while it started out in a manner that felt like a subsidiary of its much more recognizable older brother, as it ventured on, it has proven to be more thancapable in earning its own identity, deserving of the same level of respect as its predecessor. Where One Punch Man was all about being bullheadedly direct with everything it hits you with, Mob Psycho 100 instead chooses to blare the same kind of energy upfront, before coming in with a sneaky left hook; one that not only rattles off a few bells to the unexpected viewer but also lands the first blow of the show's claim to autonomy from unnecessary comparisons to determine its own self-worth.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd with that being said, let's get the obligatory comparisons out of the way first, if only for the sake of those viewers who simply came for just that. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022Both Mob and Saitama are characters with regressed emotions, but where Saitama's emotionless state comes from sheer boredom from a life with no true obstacles, Mob's state derives from a completely different reason. He's socially inept and insecure about his inability to make meaningful connections, while at the same time, mindful of his immense power, choosing to suppress them, and in the course of doing so, suppress his feelings as well. But when he could no longer keep those emotions in check, the show's namesake becomes clear as day, but we'll address that later, for now, hold on to that thought. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022They contain fights that are equal parts wacky and inventive. Where OPM chose a more polished look to exemplify everything, MP100 decided to go the opposite route, staying faithful to the source material, while maintaining the level of quality expected from a work of its stature.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Mob looks like Saitama with a wig.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, with the comparisons out of the way, on with the review!\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that would immediately jump out at you is the art itself, which could be described as a fever dream filtered through a barrage of psychedelia, along the lines of a visual interpretation of an acid trip. With neon reds and blues swirling around disproportionate character designs, and animators that look like they're trying everything within their power just to color within the lines, this anime could get quite intoxicating at times. An accomplishment in wacky cerebral distortion that hasn't been seen since 2008's Kaiba. And it's this very warped production that helps drive the narrative along, and for many, this aesthetic appeal would have already been enough to get them through all 12-episodes. But thanks to some meaningful passages being brought up to supplement this nutty art-style later on, to many, the presentation only became a secondary reason to stick around instead.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with a story as frenetic as this one, this style of presentation felt like one of those \"why haven't anyone done this yet?\" kind of moments. Mob Psycho 100 is X-Men meet Ghostbusters. \\n\\n\r\nShigeo \"Mob\" Kageyama, residential egghead and harborer of immense power, is our protagonist. As he bobs along with an expression that makes it clear that he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, he enters the office of his employer, Arataka Reigen. When he isn't busy stealing your wallet to sell it back to you, Reigen and Mob forms a ghostbusting duo that runs around town exorcising evil spirits for profit. And when I say they exorcise evil spirits, I mean Mob does the work while Reigen thinks of new ways of swindling some sap out of their hard earned paycheck. And had that been the only thing going on in the story, there wouldn't be much here to discuss, but thankfully, that's only a jumping off point to what's really important. \\n\\n\r\nA dive headfirst into easily digestible symbology and subtext.\\n\\n\r\nWhile adored the world over by critical thinkers and any reviewer worth their salt, allegorical content is usually received with mix reception by the general audience, in large part to the fact that said material requires a keen eye to make what's being digested more engaging. Indie films don't rake in big box office returns, the big brand-name Hollywood blockbusters do, and understandably so. The general audience simply wishes to be entertained, and where one requires more fixation on the details of the plot and what certain things may mean, the other promises none of that, instead offering an experience that's as straightforward as the images on the screen would have you believe. In a way, that's the difference between OPM and MP100; OPM makes bullet-point statements with no hidden agenda, while MP100 has fine print written into its spastic portrayal. And let's not make any quick assumptions here, that's not bad at all, simple programming is equally as needed as something with a bit more bite to it. One services everyone, while the other offers a second helping for those that want a bit more. \\n\\n\r\nBut then there's that weird breed of content. One that's as direct as the big blockbusters, but at the same time, manages to slide another layer in for those that pick up on it. Something that appears to be a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese, but when bitten into, has the texture and taste of something a bit more high-end. \\n\\n\r\nWe've seen it with anime titles such as Gurren Lagann, Gunbuster, Abenobashi, and FLCL, and now MP100 has seemingly stepped up on the mantle to join their ranks, if only on a scale that's not as far-reaching. \\n\\n\r\nThis unexpected layer is found in the humorous scenarios, quick \"blink and you'll miss it\" commentary, and the relationship Mob shares with his brother, Ritsu. \\n\\n\r\nBeing hidden within the folds of blaring orchestrated set-pieces, comedic jabs at the situations that the characters are placed in, and the occasional factoids pertaining to the state of certain issues, you'll find very quick cheeky retorts that draw into question the very nature of these kinds of narratives that are simply accepted by the masses. Where mini-boss battles are simply accepted as side conquests for smaller characters or obstacles that the protagonist has to plow through to meet the head honcho, in MP100, that very idea of thinking is sideswiped with a swift punch to the face and characters that are practically voicing the audiences' concern of \"just get to the boss battle already.\" Where the presence of a villainous organization full of henchmen being operated haphazardly is simply shrugged off as a byproduct of superhero stories, MP100 makes that very notion its reason for doing nothing short of walking through the front entrance without so much as a scuffle. And where we never questioned why megalomaniacs all come off as infuriatingly disturbed manchildren, MP100 doesn't even think twice about having someone say \"These guys who are seriously talking about taking over the world are children who failed to grow up.\" \\n\\n\r\nEvery jab towards these trends are delivered with pinpoint accuracy but never in a mean-spirited way that feels like the writers are cynically lampooning them. ONE has proven to be a fan of these accepted tropes and cliches but doesn't shy away from addressing it for what it is. I can go on and on about moments like these, but the point is, MP100 is fully aware of the lunacy populating the very landscape of contemporary trends it has become a part of, while still fully embracing it to tell its own kooky version of the same kind of story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while this very tongue-in-cheek manner that MP100 operates on is worth discussing in lengthier detail, the true heart of the show's content lies with Mob's mental state and the relationship he shares with his brother. \\n\\n\r\nMob, as a brother, is too dense to see the anguish felt by his little brother, Ritsu, while Ritsu himself is too focused on trying to surpass Mob that he loses focus on the fact that he's admired by him, for reasons even someone as powerful as Mob himself can't obtain. It's the \"grass is always greener on the other side\" saying, but instead of them being delegated as enemies, they're simply misunderstood. Each seeking a quality that the other has without registering the actuality of their own self-worth. Where Ritsu fosters all of the qualities of a well-acclimated socialite, his brother, unfortunately, possesses the charm of Bozo the Clown. A trait that's only worsened by the increasingly negative reception that his powers tend to draw from others. What was once seen as an astonishing gift to some, was now only registered with blas\u00e9 responses, or in worst case scenario, something that could endanger the lives of others. As a result, his already simple demeanor was reduced even further to a state that's almost autistic (and no, I'm not saying that in a joking manner), since the one thing that made him unique was now bastardized, effectively boxing him into a corner with nothing left to turn to. But where others shunned or ignore him, his brother saw otherwise. He saw a gift he yearned for but couldn't have. Despite being accepted by society, something his brother was robbed of, he still harbors a feeling of inadequacy when Mob levitates objects like it's no big deal or causes his dinner spoon to bend like playdough. \\n\\n\r\nJust the very duality between these brothers was enough to dissect already, this doesn't even address the elephant in the room; Mob's powers themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe title of Mob Psycho 100 quite literally refers to his power and what they mean, as it's shorthand for what's going on whenever he uses them. No one could suppress their emotions long enough before they hit a breaking point, and that's essentially the idea presented here. But where that \"final straw\" is usually only presented through someone emoting, in MP100, it's seen by a radiant burst of energy that exudes from every fiber of Mob's being. A burst of energy that's presented by a percentage scale that's occasionally flashed onscreen, when the number hits 100%, this power manifests itself upon release with the emotion he was suppressing. Whether that be the guilt he feels for putting others in harm's way or the animosity that boils over when someone dares to endanger his loved ones; every pent-up emotion is externalized into a colorful display of energy, feeling, and chaos. \\n\\n\r\nIt's simple ideas like this that adds a certain charming layer to MP100's content. It doesn't boast about its ideas nor does it tell you to take them seriously, it simply presents it for what it is and chooses to let the viewer take from it what they will. A kind of earnestness that goes a long way after witnessing other titles that flamboyantly boast their basic accomplishments. It's a small change in approach, yet it makes all the difference. And that's what this is as well; a simple idea but done so in a way that adds new meaning to what's at face value, another beat-em-up with superpowers. \\n\\n\r\nAnd with the understanding of these basic ideas, physical encounters become much more than empty fists clashing, they become a fight for something. Not all share in this quality, but for the ones that matter, there's a reason for the audience to be genuinely invested in the outcome. In the schizophrenic world of MP100, it's these very humanistic ideas that keep everything anchored behind the layer of jokes and satirical jabs. \\n\\n\r\nEven characters like Reigen that would usually remain pigeonholed as the sleazy money-grubbing con-artist types are given a surprising amount of humanity by the time everything comes to its final stop. This doesn't come from excessive showboating, it comes from observations made after seeing similar things play out. ONE's innate understanding of tropes has allowed him the ability to work them into something straightforward and fun, yet clever without the need to reinforce that fact. Don't get me wrong, this isn't to say that the show is subtle; on the contrary, it's very much on-the-nose 100% of the time. But what it is is humble about its ideas, not expressing some inherent birthright to be taken seriously just because it has something to say. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the kind of landscape that ONE seems to be paving with each new undertaking, helping give birth to a mini-cultural zeitgeist in the medium. One where not taking yourself too seriously could be a commendable approach, while still having ideas that could please those interested in them. Simplicity delivered with a new flare. A compromise that could give rise to fun, yet thoughtful, projects like this one. It may just be a direct response to the superhero genre that's dominating pop culture, but with results like this, I'm in full support for it. And with that in mind, Mob Psycho 100 is a welcomed addition to this blossoming trend.",

            "content": "Last year, One Punch Man rose to popularity and became of the most mainstream and popular anime of the current decade. However, the mangaka of One Punch Man also had another really good series that not many have heard about, Mob Psycho 100. With an adaptation for ONE\u2019s other series, Mob Psycho 100 was also able to generate a good amount of popularity, due to it living off of One Punch Man\u2019s brand. Though there might be some similarities between the two series, Mob Psycho 100 is quite different One Punch Man in a lot of ways. And it manages to create its own name,rather than relying on the popularity of what its being compared too. Mob Psycho 100 is more original, well-written and thought-provoking than it initially seems. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 is about an 8th grader psychic named Shigeo (also known as Mob) who tries his best to become a normal person by trying to fit into society. The story focuses on Mob and how he tries his best to control his powers and not cause any harm, while being in very risky situations. The story may seem a bit simplistic at first, and near the beginning it kind of is, but the series starts to get more complex and explores many themes like morality and what it means to be different. But the story just doesn\u2019t focus on Mob, but also other characters too, like his mentor (who is a scammer) and his brother (who has an inferiority complex). At first the series has more of an episode/slice-of-life structure, but in the second half, the main story gets introduced. And also, a lot of the omake chapters from the manga got adapted, so you\u2019ll be seeing some short stories revolving around Reigen and Mob throughout the series. The overall story doesn\u2019t really end, since the manga is ongoing, but the final arc of this series wraps up nicely, while teasing what\u2019s next to come. Hopefully it gets a second season to continue the series. \\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 looks and feels a lot different from your normal anime. The style is very over-the-top, exaggerated and weird, and it matches the tone of the series. It\u2019s supposed to be weird and quirky and its style isn\u2019t something you will see often. But the series just isn\u2019t a comedy as it is more than that. There are a good amount of moments in the series when things get a lot more serious and emotional. Unlike One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 expects you to take them seriously. However, they are handled in such a way that you as a viewer are aware that things aren\u2019t being played for jokes anymore. The series switches between its tones very well and not once did it ever feel drastic. The art style is quite unique too, and that will be mentioned later in this review. Bones did a good job in adapting the manga, though it\u2019s not the most perfect adaptation I\u2019ve come to expect from a studio like them. Near the middle of the series, the pacing got a little fast and the buildup was a slight bit underwhelming. And too many unnecessary omake chapters are adapted and they ruin the flow of the series. But those are only minor gripes to what is an outstanding anime.  \\n\r\nPresentation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nWhat is probably the most impressive and surprising thing about Mob Psycho 100 is its characters. For those who were expecting another One Punch Man, were probably shocked at how well-written the characters are. Even as a One Punch Man fanboy myself, even I admit that most of the characters in One Punch Man aren\u2019t really complex, they\u2019re just fun and entertaining. Mob, our protagonist, starts off as an apathetic school boy who\u2019s wants to fit in, but can\u2019t due to his powers. He\u2019s much more complex and well written than he seems. He can\u2019t express his emotions because releasing them releases his powers. He doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone with his powers, but accidents do happen. He has a hard time in deciding what\u2019s right and wrong or whether he should be selfish or selfless. The way he\u2019s handled is amazing. Then we have Mob\u2019s con-man mentor, Reigen. He may start off to be a little irritating, but his character is used well during comedic situations. And he\u2019s more than what he seems too. Then we have Mob\u2019s brother, Ritsu, who is also handled really well and his character change is believable. And there\u2019s a bunch of side characters that are all used well for comic relief. \\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to realize that Mob Psycho 100 has a really, really unique art style. ONE was never a good artist and his web manga don\u2019t look too good. Mob Psycho 100 was his best looking work, yet a lot of the panels can look cruddy or unorganized. However, this crude art added to the style of the series. Bones manages to adapt the art of the manga, while making it visually appealing. The crude look of the manga is still in the anime, but things look more detailed and organized. The zany art style adds to the comedic moments, and feels stylish during its action sequences. The backgrounds are pretty well done too. The character models look really unique, though they all have similar faces, just like the web manga. The art isn\u2019t the most detailed, but doing so would ruin the style. However, the lighting and colors used in the series and the shadows are really well done. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s nothing that interests you in Mob Psycho 100, there\u2019s always the stellar animations. Simply put, it\u2019s the most well animated TV anime series I\u2019ve seen, and yes, it\u2019s better than One Punch Man. When I mean better, I mean that it is more fluid. Since the art style isn\u2019t incredibly detailed, this lets the animators makes the animations as smooth as possible. During big fights, characters will be going all over the place and destruction would be happening very fluidly. The cinematography is also stellar and the way it moves during fights is very stylish. Sometimes the fights can feel overwhelming, due to how much is happening on the screen. And Bones extended most of the fights and made them longer, so they can have some more eye-candy visuals. \\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast do a great job in doing the comic relief and executing the more dramatic moments. Mob\u2019s seiyuu, Itou Setsuo, has barely done any voice acting before, as he only did one supporting role before and this is his first main role. But he doesn\u2019t sound like a newbie at all as he does an excellent job as Mob. He gets the apathetic tone of his voice right, but he really shines when he has to add emotions to Mob. He does his angry voice really well and his seiyuu delivers during emotional scenes too. Sakurai Takahiro (who is doing a lot of voice acting recently) does Reigen and he does him perfectly. It\u2019s well known that Sakurai\u2019s a really talented seiyuu and he gives all he\u2019s got as Reigen. He makes his character absurd, wacky, deceiving, and truly hilarious. Irino Miyu does a very good job as Ritsu and gets his emotional and strong-willed personality right. Matsuoka Yoshitsugu\u2019s really at his best when he does supporting characters and him as Teruki was a perfect choice. And all of the other seiyuu also do a good job in what they have to do. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Mob Psycho 100 is also really good and adds to the already amazing series. The OP, \"99\", is really good and catchy and I don\u2019t need to say much about how the lyrics are quite matching for a series like this. Never did I thought that counting up to 100 could be so fun and addicting. The ED, \"Refrain Boy\u201d, is also very good and it really matches the dramatic aspect of the series. The vocals, the lyrics and the music is great in that ED. The background music is also really good in the series, particularly the ones used during fights. The add more to the tension and make things more fun. The music used during a fight in the fifth episode was particularly good. \\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI knew I was going to enjoy Mob Psycho before it even aired. I really loved the web manga and the fact that Bones was going to animate it makes the chances of the anime being a good adaptation really high. And Bones surely did deliver. Though some of the omake chapters getting adapted ruined the flow, everything else was done perfectly well. The characters are really well developed and really well handled. They ended up being more complex than they originally seemed. The story itself is really good and manages to keep you interested most of the time. The way the humor and the seriousness is blended together makes sure that none of the tonal shifts feel jarring. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have this much fun again in a long time. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you haven\u2019t checked out Mob Psycho 100 yet, then seriously, what are you doing? This is the most fun you\u2019ll probably have this year, and it\u2019s not wise to skip on it. Even those who didn\u2019t like One Punch Man should definitely check this out because it\u2019s quite a different anime and it\u2019s much more complex than it originally seems. The characters are well developed and handled excellently. Mob\u2019s struggle to make the right choices is presented fantastically. The art style is unique and adds to the wackiness. But most importantly, the animations are simply stunning and some of the best I\u2019ve seen. Mob Psycho has all the ingredients to make an amazing anime and uses all of its potential. Mob Psycho 100 is easily a candidate for anime of the year, and if you haven\u2019t checked it out yet, you should do so soon. \\n\\n\r\n+ Handles its characters well and Mob is a really realistically done and complex character.\\n\r\n+ Amazing direction and conveys the style of the web manga perfectly. \\n\r\n+ Very unique art style and mind-blowing animations during major fights.\\n\r\n+ Properly blends its humor and wackiness with its emotional and dramatic scene.\\n\r\n+ Premise is simple, but the execution is really well done and the story starts to evolve in the second half.\\n\r\n- Pacing was a little fast in the middle and the adapted omake chapters break the flow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.1/10",

            "content": "As soon you hear the track \"99\" by MOB CHOIR, and see the amazing visuals from the OP, you immediately get the sense that this is going to be something special, it\u2019s nothing short of the hype. From the creator that brought you the 2015 sensation in \u201cOne Punch Man,\u201d Mob Psycho 100 has definitely helped cement the author ONE\u2019s position among the top creators of today, due to his trademark style; of creative storytelling, artistic flair and the knack for writing genuine, gut-busting comedy. Although there are similarities between the two, Mob Psycho 100 has its own identity and far from a carbon copyand paste.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the writing itself, it\u2019s fairly easy with both works to get caught up in the notion that these are gimmick series\u2014seemingly reliant on a hook to be interesting, e.g., defeating anyone with one punch, unleashing full power when emotion levels reach 100% etc.  What you realize with both series\u2014more so with Mob Psycho 100\u2014is that when paying attention to both the story being told visually and the story being told by the script, there\u2019s a lot of depth and subtlety to what ONE is doing. The madcap surrealism is important, but so are the characters and the social commentary. Everything about the main character asks the questions\u2014which are raised throughout different arcs and points of views\u2014that ultimately fall under one of the main themes of the story: with great power, comes great responsibility. In addition, other themes and core messages conveyed include empathy, integrity, self-control, self-reflection, perseverance, and courage. There is more than meets the eye with Mob Psycho 100\u2019s writing; the more you dig, the more you find.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why Mob Psycho 100 feels as special as it is\u2014when you get past all the visual brilliance, you\u2019re still left with an amazingly riveting story playing out on screen. This is a deeply human story that effectively melds all the pubertal symbolism and universality of emotion with the fantastical premise. The relationships in this series are both complex and compelling and defy easy categorization. None of them and none of the characters fall neatly into the pigeonholes we create for them based on first appearances\u2014there are always layers and sides there which only reveal themselves over the course of development. There are many things that contribute to the success of the show, but the main course is the characters, especially the main protagonist, Shigeo \u201cMob\u201d Kageyama, as well as his mentor and the highlight reel of the show's hilarity, Arataka Reigen. Their relationship defines good character chemistry seeing how much they have influenced each other throughout with this master-and-student type of bond. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Mob admires Reigen deeply, he doesn\u2019t realize that he is responsible behind other characters changing for the better. This is the case with Dimple, Teruki Hanazawa and Ritsu. It is very humbling to see an all-powerful person putting aside what makes him special and refusing to take advantage of others. Even Shinji Kamuro or Tenga Onigawara saw their character arcs fulfilled once they saw the error in their ways. They seem to be very minor players at first but they keep turning up, proving themselves to be important to the story, especially Ritsu. And of course, that the initial read we get on most of the cast is usually wrong or at the very least incomplete. It\u2019s a story that punishes jumping to conclusions and superficial judgments, and that can apply in any number of different ways. One of the effects of that, I think, is that it makes the lack of guile in Mob stand out that much more\u2014and all of this is ingeniously brought out in the casting.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, there are a lot of intriguing dynamics between the characters. Mob and Ritsu have this great misunderstanding of each other that plays into both characters growth. Reigen is a wonderful contradiction, a charismatic charlatan, yet someone who gives Mob the soundest possible advice and mentorship he gets from nowhere else\u2014he is Mob\u2019s moral compass and somehow, he usually manages to point him true North. These character dynamics and contrast go back to that theme that is famously said by Peter Parker\u2019s Uncle Ben. Reigen is the only one who tells Mob what he wants to believe in his heart is true. That he\u2019s a good person, that his powers don\u2019t make him special, that he not only doesn\u2019t have to hurt anyone but that he absolutely has a duty not to. Time after time when Mob is in darkness, Reigen pulls him back. These messages are very relatable for growing adolescents. \\n\\n\r\nAnd when you have such rich, multi-layered characters and dynamics, the comedy has a lot more authenticity behind it. Mob Psycho 100 is also, one of the funniest shows I have watched and it does a remarkable job of keeping things fresh and unexpected. No joke is overused, it\u2019s not a one-trick pony that is desperately hanging on a gimmick for cheap laughs, rather it uses escalation, gradually building up the events of the show while keeping a steady stream of the funnies. This makes punchlines, slapstick, gags and references feel unadulterated, earned and definitely more hilarious. Not only is the comedy more authentic but so is the action, what\u2019s to appreciate\u2014as much as the glorious way they\u2019re animated\u2014is how the big action sequences in Mob Psycho are character-driven. Like Hunter X Hunter, it features stupendous fight sequences at infrequent intervals, and never dishes up a throwaway\u2014all the fights are organic to the story and full of subtext when it comes to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the production of Mob Psycho 100, believe the hype. It soared to heights of sakuga that the best of the industry can produce. It seems almost unfair how different things are for premier studios like Bones. Not only does Yuzuru Tachikawa have the money he needs, but he can also call on the talents of guys like Yutaka Nakamura, Norio Matsumoto and Yoshimichi Kameda when episodes call for that extra dose of visual flash. The sheer brilliance of the cinematography is flawless, shot composition, special effects, the signature retro-neon-lights colour scheme and animation that is reminiscent of FLCL, Kill la Kill and OPM, turn these high-octane battle sequences into jaw-dropping spectacles. The visual gags, the character designs, the background art all play towards the creative aesthetics and humour of the show. The biggest showpieces in the series are reserved for when Mob\u2019s Emotional Meter reaches 100% and that is exactly when studio Bones are firing on all cylinders.\\n\\n\r\nNo less important was the score. The soundtrack was composed by Kenji Kawai, and it\u2019s probably one of his best works in recent years, it is instrumental focused. He is amazingly good at composing unsettling and mysterious melodies, most notably the signature theme when Mob goes berserk. As stated previously, \u201c99\u201d is outstanding and one of the best song choices for an OP I have heard as it perfectly sets the mood for both the show and the audience. It was originally written and performed by a choir formed by staff members of studio Bones and features trippy visuals that even reference future manga events. The ED, \u201cRefrain Boy\u201d by All Off was entirely made by Miyo Sato\u2019s paint-on-glass technique. The voice acting is some of the best, the way they performed made for more memorable characters, more believable personalities, the witty dialogue and comedic moments all the better.\\n\\n\r\nAs compared to its older brother OPM, Mob Psycho 100 is less a genre satire and social commentary and much more a character study and coming-of-age story\u2014and in many ways quite a conventional one. Mob\u2019s Esper powers are the MacGuffin in the premise, but it\u2019s the impact they have on him and others more than the powers themselves that matter. It\u2019s not a series about a ridiculously strong person who can one-shot anyone with psychic powers, but a highly symbolic take on adolescence, about a kid realizing that having a special ability does not make him better or worse than others with a whole lot of wildly imaginative fantasy and visual experimentation as the vehicle to get it where it\u2019s going. I am pumped for what studio Bones has in store for us with the sequel airing very shortly.\\n",

            "content": "Hype has always been a double-edged sword, Mob Psycho 100 (I\u2019ll use the abbreviation MP100 for the following) and One Punch Man (OPM) being an almost perfect example of that exact statement. MP100 never got that much attention since it started airing in the Summer Season 2016, being outclassed in popularity by shows like Orange, Shokugeki no Souma S2 and the ongoing Re:Zero in that respect, at least at the start of Summer season. It was never hyped as \u2018the best thing evar\u2019, nor did it receive much negative backlash because of that. Unlike MP100\u2019s relative lack of popularity, the author's other work One PunchMan did get flooded by it, scoring points with similar style and humour, but in a more straight-forward and 'blockbuster-like' way. While I think the hype and also the following negative backlash that OPM hit was a little excessive, MP100 does not deserve to stand in OPM\u2019s shadow, as it offers new ideas and a more creative story than One Punch Man does, hinting and actually executing several thematical aspects decently, giving the show a unique identity despite the similarities.\\n\r\nPossible MINOR SPOILERS can be encountered while reading this review, although I will try to avoid diving into the plot any more than it is really necessary.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho\u2019s story follows the seemingly mundane daily life of our protagonist Shigeo Kageyama, called \u2018Mob\u2019 during the series, with exceptional psychic power, nowhere near to be matched by any other character in the story at first. However, Mob has a problem we all have during Middle School, namely troubles in finding himself, his true strength, goals, and love in life. He seeks help from someone who can understand his problems he has with his uncontrollable psychic powers and lost purpose in his life and finds it in his master and fake spirit-exorcist and con-artist Reigen Arataka, who surprisingly is quite a bit of help for Mob\u2019s problems.\\n\\n\r\nWhen reading the synopsis it is virtually impossible to not think of ONE's more famous work, ringing a bell more than just about three times for people familiar with OPM's protagonist Saitama, which not even only share a lot of connection when scrolling through the main description, but their stature as well, yelling the word \"average\" out loud. Contrary to their initial looks, both shows feature an overpowered protagonist in its own right, both seek for appreciation, but fail to do so. If MP100 is able to develop its own identity and tries to not harp on the same (now pretty old) joke that OPM successfully capitalized on, remained an incredible big question mark in my mind, even after watching the first episode. However, I was incredibly surprised by how more unique the show got from episode to episode, seemingly increasing the quality constantly, which might also be caused by their exceptional build-up for another. Additionally, the story does not rely on the 'baseline-joke' for being funny, making it a more colorful and overall a little more enjoyable viewing experience in contrast to One Punch Man.\\n\\n\r\nDescribing how it felt watching and analyzing the overall events and themes is a really difficult one, to begin with. The closest thing I could think of to summarize it rather compactly is 'One Punch Man meets Yuasa'. The witty humour, quirky, expressive style and characters rich in contrast getting mixed up with the popular coming-of-age story in its essence definitely gets covered and presented very similarly by the famous director and undeniable genius Yuasa himself, who was responsible for works like 'Ping Pong' and 'Tatami Galaxy'. That being said, while it definitely isn\u2019t as good as the previous works, watching the first few episodes, it felt similar to some extent. Character/Thematic exploration isn't the main aspect of MP100 though since it's main focus is still on the action and thrown-in comedic elements, which works perfectly in its balanced combination, where off-timed comedy was a real rarity. It's more of a subtle reminder from time to time, but that does not feel forced in any way and only complements the specific style Mob Psycho beholds. At one point in the second half, I had the feeling the show would drift into the typical Shounen genericism like most shows do these days after initially promising starting episodes and would solve any problem in an uncreative manner, but I was utterly mistaken by how the show evolved afterwards, choosing an unexpected and yet fun way to bring the story further, leaving problems to be dealt with by the characters longer than to be expected, utilizing this said length to offer more thought-out and conclusive solutions to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe script itself can be seen as rather mediocre and does not expand on several aspects which could\u2019ve been dealt with in a deeper way and sometimes takes a little strange approach on flashing out different storylines like they did with the members of the student council. However, a ground-breaking script has never been the intention of MP100 in the first place and it certainly doesn\u2019t need one. The presentation is what makes the show what it is, a fun ride and lovable ride from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the presentation, the art style complements the storytelling and overall atmosphere splendidly, being yet another display of skill by the Animation-studio Bones. As the appeal of the show might not come through on the first episode, you\u2019ll surely develop a liking towards the unusual and kinda trippy art style while watching it, complementing the overall atmosphere splendidly. In terms of fluent and simultaneously creative Animation, Bones flexes their muscles another time, with the Animation almost earning itself the adjective 'perfect'. Nothing looks stiff and the fight scenes are unbelievably (!) well animated, making me wonder about how much budget they had actually spend. The backgrounds sometimes feel unlively, but as I\u2019ve already stated it doesn\u2019t bug me in the slightest and even adds to its overall unusual appeal.\\n\\n\r\nAnother appeal the show truly has on its side is the characters with their quirky, sometimes over-the-top and sometimes pretty humble appearance. It seems ONE has already made himself a trademark with making his overpowered as hell protagonist to look as plain as possible in comparison to everyone else. Mob is another prime example of that, basically having Saitama\u2019s design, but instead being of bald, he has the good ol' classic bowl-cut. Side characters like Teruki after the epic change in hairstyle, the bully of the 90's impersonation Onigawara and the 'Body Improvement Club' offer a good contrast to the modest appearance of all the other students, while the evil spirits obviously are still in a whole other league in terms of peculiar design compared to them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is written with a capital S in MP100, hence the characters don\u2019t feel dull at all, even incorporating actually subtle hints on which their development is based on, which is very true for Mob-kun himself. That being said, not every development has been executed successfully, mainly thinking of Mob\u2019s younger brother Shigeo. I acknowledge that his inferiority complex to Mob gets set-up decently, however, the actions which he decides to take and battle his inferiority seemed kinda forced to me, especially with the student council evolving in \u2018Gestapo 2.0\u2019, which was one of the weirdest things ever. It even breaks the loose boundaries MP100 set for itself, getting a little too eccentric, just thinking about how it would feel like in even little more down to earth show in terms of presentation would blow my mind. Also, he still remains rather shallow for all the development he gets during the series, making him be a mediocre character and a little let-down overall.\\n\r\nMuch on the contrary, Mob\u2019s development is executed well and doesn\u2019t seem artificial in any way. He gets influenced by both his master Reigen and his environment, having him to make decisions about his future, while he still doesn\u2019t know what he genuinely wants to do. This makes for some truly hilarious moments in his interactions with other characters, like for example his thought-process behind which club to join at school.\\n\\n\r\nOther side characters are likable in their own right, however, there\u2019s nothing too noteworthy about them. Also, while I did make this statement regarding the side characters in general, I'm screaming 'OBJECTION!' internally while saying this. Why? Because of Mob\u2019s master Reigen, who is just too damn hilarious and the best addition to MP100\u2019s witty and eccentric style in general, lifting the general appreciation I hold for MP100's characters by a lot all by himself. He almost always ends up as the top-pick in likeability for people completed the series, because even though he is absolutely unskilled in the arts of spirit exorcism which he pretends to teach his student Mob, he manages to raise Mob\u2019s self-esteem and courage in his actions, truly able to take over the role of a mentor for Mob.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values for this show are top-notch, so not only the Animation is fantastic, but also the department taking care of the sound did a magnificent job. The OP/ED are fantastic earworms, the OP even able to snatch a place in my top 10. Additionally, the soundtrack is of overall high quality, leaving me waiting the OST finally gets released, to look up a certain track which gets played during fight scenes, giving me One Punch Man vibes all over again.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 definitely takes the cake for me this Summer season, earning itself the title \u2018Anime of the Season\u2019 rightfully. Refreshing style, quirky characters, witty jokes, Reigen\u2019s special moves, great production values and overall solid, simple storytelling mixed with subtle thematic exploration make this Anime to what I consider a must-see for fans of the genre and skeptics alike. While it does have certain flaws regarding the script and some strange decision-making by key-characters, they remain rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things, maybe solely due to the magnificent entertainment-value Mob Psycho offers in its runtime.\\n\\n\r\nSo now it\u2019s time to say farewell with an ANTI ESPER-DROPKICK! Have fun with Mob Psycho!\\n\\n\r\nStory (6.5/10)\\n\r\nArt (9/10), Animation (9.5/10)\\n\r\nSound (8.5/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)",

            "content": "When I went into Mob Psycho 100, the only thing I tried to expect was that I'd be watching a good comedy series paired with good action. We all know that One is a competent writer, but I decided that comparing this series' quality to One Punch Man would most likely be unfair. Little did I realize that this series would not only match the quality of One Punch Man, but add the things I felt were missing in it. Now even though I didn't want to compare this series to One Punch Man, I'll be doing a fair bit of that inthis review, because I know anybody checking this review will be curious how it looks next to it. \\n\\n\r\n  One obviously made the decision when writing Mob Psycho 100 to have this series take itself a little more seriously. Because of this, I feel the characters are a lot more fleshed out than One Punch Man. We have serious character building arcs in this series, something I didn't expect in the slightest. Another refreshing thing is that (in my opinion) Shigeo isn't much like Saitama. Sure, he's overpowered, but he doesn't have much of Saitama's irreverence. Despite the series revolvling around Shigeo being emotionless, I feel he cares quite a bit. But this series doesn't just focus on him. For the most part, the entire cast gets some time to shine. Aside from Shigeo, the characters I feel stood out the most are Reigen, Ritsu, and Hanazawa. This series is not lacking at all in the character department. \\n\\n\r\n The artstyle to me came off like a mix of One Punch Man, and an adult swim late-night cartoon. It was trippy in all the right ways at times, and it's animation style lended itself to some great matches. The characters may not be as sharp looking as a series from Trigger or Gainax, but I feel I enjoy One's style just as much as those studios. It's also very consistent. I can't recall anytime I thought the animation looked poor. I think because they went with the exact style the manga must have, it made that very easy to accomplish. It's only flashy when it needs to be.\\n\\n\r\n The storyline among other things is about our protagonist's emotions and how much he conceals his powers. It's hard to describe it in depth without spoiling, but I can say they accomplish what they were going for very well. \\n\\n\r\n I believe that Mob Psycho 100 is the greatest anime of 2016. Not only did (in my opinion) it surpass One Punch Man in quality, but it also surpassed many of the series that I didn't think would be topped this year. I like this series so much in fact, it's surpassed many of my long time favorite series, and is currently number one on my profile. I can't give Mob Psycho 100 anything but a strong 10.",

            "content": "Living by the shadow of One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 is probably the best anime that aired this season.  People are always complaining about how anime is always the same: boys that can travel back in time, tsundere protagonists or MMORPG worlds.\r\nMob Psycho 100 tells the story of an overpowered boy who doesn't know he's overpowered.  About a boy that doesn't feel special just because he has powers.  He instead wants to become more popular and more fitting to other humans.  \r\nStory 10/10\r\nI thought MP100 was similar to OPM since the protagonists is an overpowered esper that can deal withalmost any evil spirit.  But after some episodes, the anime tells you the story of an underdog.  A guy who doesn't feel special just because he can defeat spirits.  He is a humble boy who wants to be better in other ways.   Mob is in love with a girl and he wants to impress her, but he knows his powers are not the way to impress a girl.  Mob is given the opportunity to join the \"esper club\" but he is not interested in that.  In conclusion, Mob is a boy who wants to overcome his own insecurities that happens to be a powerful esper.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are so funny and likeable.  Apart from Mob, we have Reigen (Mob's master), Ritsu (Mob's brother) , Dimple and some other characters that join later.  The story takes a lot of comedy twists and they totally work.  Reigen is a smart con man that always knows how to deal with every situation.  Also, he's very caring towards Mob.  Ritsu is a boy who feels overshadowed by his brother, but learns to overcome that during the plot development.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is impressive.  The fights look so damn great and epic.  Contrary to OPM, real fights actually happen and they look fine! The music is astonishing and the opening is not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 has a lot of perks: good animation, good story, good character development and it also comes as one of the best comedy shows out there.  If you liked One Punch Man, you will absolutely love Mob Psycho 100.  If not, I feel like Mob Psycho 100 can get a place in your heart.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 was LA's favourite anime of Summer 2016 and really it pulled it off, bringing in a two for two for ONE, the creator of One Punch Man, so what made Mob Psycho 100 another great like One Punch Man?, well it's a bit complicated to say the least...let's find out.\r\nMob Psycho 100 looks at both the stress of the youth, superiority and inferiority complexes and the look at how having powers isn't what is all that is cracked up to be...which is also becoming something of a trend these days like Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan this season to. Mob Psycho 100 allwraps this up under the notion of Kageyama Shigeo (a.k.a. \"Mob\") voiced by Setsuo Itou who holds his psychic power under check unless he literally explodes it in any manner of varying emotions and trying to find meaning in his ironically normal life.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100's plot pacing (and comedic timing) just feels like an bomb explosion with setup, exposition and character development as the long thread that is lit, Mob Psycho 100 for as much as a rather ironic anime (main protagonist suppressing his powers) it still has some profound meaning and character development which helps make this anime more than a typical shounen anime. Mob Psycho 100 isn't as much as a deconstruction of being a superpowered human like One Punch Man as it is a coming of age and \"what youth does to you\" and for the shounen element side of things, \"power isn't everything, be it if your a villain or a superpowered normy\".\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, we have our comedic foils to the main protagonist like the con-man mentor of Arataka Reigen voiced by Takahiro Sakurai to more serious characters like Ritsu voiced by Miyu Irino, Mob's little brother and Dimple voiced by Akio Ootsuka an evil spirit turned Mob's \"spiritual advisor\" with all his evil intentions still intact, don't worry he gets better. There was also Teruki Hanazawa voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka a rival to Mob who abuses his psychic powers, again he gets better. If there was a character who got the most development, it would go to both Mob and Ritsu as their developments were polar opposites in terms of how they used their powers and how they deal with their stress. Unfortunately, Mob Psycho 100's minor cast are cliche or support like Mob's love interest Tsubomi voiced by Uki Satake to the purist with evil intentions student council president Shinji Kamuro voiced by Kouji Yusa and Tome Kurata voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki the club leader of the Telepathy Club and just a slacker like the rest of club members. Overall, as much as the minor cast members were support, they at least somewhat helped move the pot forward, even indirectly. Where Mob Psycho 100's strengths comes in is in the majority of the main cast (Mob, Reigen, Ritsu, Hanazawa and Dimple) as they do get the majority of the screentime. What's better is that these character's chemistry as bizarrely disjointed they are, they actually meld together, be it comedically or dramatically (or more precisely be a catalyst to Mob's varying \"100%\" emotions). LA's favourite character easily goes to Reigen by the end of the anime, which comes unexpectedly for LA as LA just went with Mob due his badassness.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Studio Bones if anything was an experiment in the uncanny comic styling, LA can't quite put it into detail, but the animation is uncanny, but visually it makes it stand out for it's uniqueness. Where does the animation shine?...well when Mob uses his psychic powers (a la once he reaches 100%)...it is utterly GLORIOUS to the point and it's not only in Mob's battles, the battle scenes in general are GLORIOUSLY AMAZING, sure it's uncanny but it's unique to as the least. LA will say that Mob Psycho 100 was the best animation for Summer 2016.  \\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 goes into a more serious plotline further down the line and really, LA thought it compensated for the somewhat slow beginning and more meaningful episodes about youth to ramp it up by the last half by focusing more on a serious plot with numerous battles to test Mob and his \"friends\", and really it is a good compensation by the latter half, with less on the meaningful look at those with superpowers and youth to some awesome battles and sure you can complain that Mob would quite easily take down the threat that arose in the serious plotline and you'd be right...and wrong. Right as Mob can easily take down the \"strongest\" foe without trying, but mentally, he's a bit different from the typical \"OP protagonist\". Overall the serious plotline is a nice bonus to have and really it's just pointing out that Mob Psycho 100 ironically is having fun by making a serious plotline with some bombastic battles left, right and centre. This serious toned plotline however gets quickly back to it's tone in the earlier episodes once Reigen appears as well as make a realistic impression on the \"evil\" Claw 7th Division. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as this anime has contexts of being an \"OP main protagonist anime\", yes it is but it's one where the main protagonist knows about his own power and always tries to suppress it unless as a last resort to, if anything Mob Psycho 100 is a deconstruction of THIS trope and really we WANT to see Mob reach 100% and see him go batshit crazy with his powers which makes the \"OP main protagonist anime\" pitfalls almost nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, you'd kinda expect LA to bash the voice acting for it's rather lackluster voice acting especially coming from Mob himself voiced by Setsuo Itou, but you realize that he's SUPPOSE to repress his emotions to keep his emotions via powers in check. This diverse voice cast goes all over the board in terms of vocal toning and really LA actually enjoyed the voice acting VERY much, LA's favourite voice actor goes to  Takahiro Sakurai as the con-man Reigen for MANY reasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was unexpected to say to least and LA wasn't really expecting the \"big finale\" that One Punch Man did, sure it did a very cool \"final battle\" but the \"ending result\" was unexpected to say the least and ended as \"anti-climatically\" but LA didn't care. Firstly Mob Psycho 100 isn't the same as One Punch Man, secondly, it kinda the expected tone Mob Psycho 100 to have, it's not anti-climatic to say but it's was a great way to resolve the \"serious tone\" and still be \"Mob Psycho 100\". Sure the ending still has one plot thread that it brings up hinting at a second season, but for what this ending did, it was still greatly satisfying as much as it had an \"anti-climax\" final battle.\\n\\n\r\nLA said it before at the start of this review, Mob Psycho 100 was LA's favourite anime of Summer 2016 and it really shows, if One Punch Man was the thing for you, then Mob Psycho 100 is also a definite watch even if the anime is completely different from One Punch man with it's own meaning and collapse of \"superiority and power\" as well as \"youth and the stress of it all\" and of course, Mob Psycho 100's uncanny animation that was just utterly unique in the season 2016.",

            "content": "Wow... trying to come up with a compelling first sentence sure is hard... I'll just take a moment to myself before I start.\r\n...97, 98, 99, 100... *BOOM*\r\nStory: \r\nIf you're familiar with the original artist, you can basically guess that the story will be good. Mob psycho was no exeption. It doesn't have a clear plotline from the start (Though we do get that later) and has an episodic structure. For me, the story didn't really strike untill episode 6, when we actually get to the \u201dreal\u201d plot.\r\n\tThe story itself is very comical, filled with crazy situations and eastereggs for the audience to pick up. Butthat's not all the show has to offer, Mob psycho varies very smoothly from those comic situations to the deeper moments, inner dilemmas with the characters and the action sequences that were purely amazing. The comedy itself, is very \u201dONE\u201d if that makes sense. Simple, not too forced, though that depends greatly on your own sense of humor.\\n\r\n\tI would have loved giving Mob psycho a full 10 on the story, but the fact that the story took half of it's run time to really get the plot going, is something I can't ignore, so from story, i give it \\n\r\n8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is something that strikes me everytime, I've hear people dropping this show because of it's art. Fine, I can see, why people would dislike the art, but for me it was not the case.\\n\r\nFor me the art was amazing. Taken what the manga looks like, the animation was executed nearly perfectly. On the cheerful/comical moments the animation stays simple, harsh like the original material, but oh my God when it's time to battle, let me tell you, they pull all the stops. While sticking to its rather rough appearense, it manages to make the fight scenes flow smoothly, filled with epicness. It's very hard to describe. \\n\r\nFor me, the art was solid \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'll be honest. Other than the opening and ending songs, I don't remember much of the soundtrack. What I do remember is that one electrical riff that plays everytime shit is about to get real. But honesty, I don't think I have to remember anything else. \\n\r\n\tThe opening and ending songs fitted the show nicely, the opening gave me an exiting, explosive vibe, and the ending was a nice calm counter measure for that. \\n\r\n\tBut the fact that nothing else but those three stuck with me, bothers me so much, that I can't give the sound a full score, even though those three were on point. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMuch like the artist previous masterpiece, One punch man, Mob psycho has a rather large cast, but thankfully, the series doensn't even try to focuse on all of the. So for this review, I could point out 3 characters that get the most screentime and development, also known as the main characters. If you don't want to read those, my point is, that the cast is very much amazing, the characters (atleast the main 3) have development and each have their own psychological dilemmas to deal with, though some more than the others, but still, it's there.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama \u201dMob\u201d Shigeo: Mob, the obvious protagonist of the series. He is calm and collective, blank faced psychic user, though at times shy and a little naive teenage boy, so nothing we haven't seen before. For me, the most fascinating part of him, was to see the contrast of his character, how he could go from a wimpy goody-two-shoes character to a psychic rage monster in a matter of seconds. That gave some more sides to him, including his inner dilemma, not wanting to hurt anyone, but at the same time not being able to control himself.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama Ritsu: Mobs little brother, whom I unfortunately can't speak too much without going to spoilerific territory. Lets just say, he's the ideal brother character. Honorable student, polite to everyone and looks up to his older brother. Personally Ritsu was my favourite character in the show, atleast after episode 6, when they actually started to develop his character, (and boy did they develop) and the direction it took.  \\n\\n\r\nReigen Arataka: Mobs boss, a con artist, who runs an exorcism business. Do I have to say more? To me Reigen was a very interesting character. Jack of all trades, master of none. Being verbally skilled and a tad melodramatic, he managed to pull off quite the amazing show. And after those couple last episodes I would just like to do a quick salute by saying \u201dReigen, u da real mvp!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThere would be a couple of more characters that I could mention, but I won't.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the show must have seen through the whole review, but I'm going to say it once more. I definelty enjoyed Mob psycho 100. The fact that the plot started only halfway did bother me a bit, but taken that I still managed to like the first half, because if I truly hadn't liked it, I wouldn't have continued watching. So, being a generous person, I'm going to forgive the show for that. \\n\r\n\tONE has a habit of putting over powered characters in his series, and honesty I'm more than fine with that. For one, I happen to enjoy watching an op character go on a full on rampage much more than those where the main character struggles till the very end and then  manages to win because of \u201dthe power of friendship\u201d or something like that.  \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMob psycho 100 is a great show, with funny moments, deep thoughts and more than anything, epic battles, and I could easily recommend this show to anyone. \\n\r\nThe avarage that I got was 9 points, but I still decided to give it the grade of 10, because I think it truly deserves it.",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 is based off of a manga by ONE. Yes, the same manga artist behind One Punch Man. The anime came out last year and was brought to us by Bones. Yes, the Soul Eater, Heroman, Wolf's Rain, etc... Studio. So, is this one okay like One Punch Man, better or worse? \r\nStory:\r\nMob is a young man with psychic powers. His master, Reigen, is a con artist who pretends to have psychic abilities. Together, they get paid to go out and exorcise spirits. Shenanigans ensue and Mob's counter raises towards 100. What will happen when it goes all the way up? Will Mobever find others like himself? Will he ever discover that his master is a fraud?\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is the comedy. A lot of it is either really obvious or just random nonsense. There are very few funny moments to be found. The whole narrative is also similar to One Punch Man in that it likes to build up some kind of confrontation for Mob, but then he settles it with relative ease once he gets worked up enough to actually fight. The big difference is that it's considerably less competent here. \\n\\n\r\nThe best I can say about the story is that it has its occasional moment. It has a few funny scenes and some more serious parts that are pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this fall woefully short. Mob is mainly defined by being thick. His brother's main feature is his mix of admiration and jealousy towards Mob for his amazing psychic powers. There are a couple scenes that showcase the dynamic between Mob and Reigen that come close to making it decent. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork does have some good and bad elements. On one hand, a lot of the psychic power scenes are pretty visually creative. On the other hand, the character designs are boring and lazy. The backgrounds are usually weak and a lot of the action sequences are weakened by being a bit of a hard to follow mess. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that suffers from extremes in the acting. You get a lot of characters being really exaggerated and a lot of actors sounding completely uninvested. Itou Setsuo especially. There isn't much in terms of middle ground that allows the cast to show that they can actually act. Kawai Kenji's soundtrack for this isn't bad. It's not good either. It's a pretty average work. His tracks for Bakuretsu Hunters and Ghost in the Shell were definitely better. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any. The most we get in terms of romance is Mob having a crush on the most easily impressed girl ever. Which is weird because we only see her talk with her in flashback and even then it's about five lines. I guess when you're a dullard that's enough to create a fixation. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100  is pretty stupid, and not in an entertaining way. The story is dumb. The jokes are largely unfunny, stupid humour. The characters are morons. It's certainly not on par with One Punch Man and, frankly, it's the worst thing I've reviewed by Bones. If you liked One Punch Man you may want to give it an episode or two. Maybe it'll work better for you than it did for me. But, for myself, I give it a 3/10. Next week I'll look at Tales of Zestiria the X.",

I mean, it's really interesting to see how to show develops into a more character focused story and throws away your expectations of what you thought It would be like, even the big plots didn't turn out like you thought.\r\nArt - 9.5. I really loved the art, kinda reminded me of Soul Eater, avery loose and flexibel art-style that makes bad animation not really look that bad, and the parts where the animation shined, you could really tell they put alot of work to it, really well done!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8? I didn't really pay much attention to the soundtracks sadly, Ending theme > Opening theme though!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9.5. At first sight the main protaganist is a lame, booring, normal, casual child who seems kinda \"emotion-less?\" but as the show progresses you can see a wide and clear development which makes me so happy, spot on work.  The side- characters were extremely interesting to me at least the master, aswell as the brother. Well done!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10.9? :D. It's just pure entertainment which we are all here to see, a great show with perfect phasing in my opinion. 100% recommend to all who just want to see good entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10. It's just a so well made show that I can't put anything else then a 10. (YES THE START IS SLOW BUT WHEN IS IT NOT?)",

            "content": "[7.0/10]\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nMob Psycho 100 - Wacky, decisive, entertaining, subversive, and occasionally funny. With the constant influx of Shounen anime that pours out of the pores of the industry, you'd expect that a plethora of parodies would release every season. But no, for some reason parody is kind of rare. Even shows marketed as parody, like KonoSuba rarely actually do any substantial and biting parodying. While Mob Psycho doesn't really go the route of being a full-on parody, it does have satirical elements through subversion. \r\nFor the most part, it points out the ridiculousness of a lot of similar Shounen action through it's own storytelling. It lampoonsthrough doing something completely different, which, to its credit, is a very unique way to create a defining image for yourself. Mob Psycho 100 utilizes common Shounen tropes to enhance a theme that it builds on throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nSelf-improvement and actualization. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Dynamic Art]\\n\\n\r\nIf you simply want to watch some great action, then this show can suite your needs as well. Mob Psycho has one of the most impressive animation showcases I've ever seen in a television anime, with absolutely gorgeous and fluid animation throughout. It never felt as though the show had a dip in quality in that regard. Even if the the action itself may feel as though it's generic, as in, it has a formula that a seasoned action anime viewer has seen before, the animation elevates it. Before I even touch on the story itself, I want to make it clear that in animation, exceptional visuals really do create an entirely new appreciation for what you are watching.\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, if this show had average or below-average effort put into the action, which ends up taking up a big part of the whole show, then the amount of enjoyment I would've gotten would be substantially lower. This can be explained simply. If you want to have your show be action packed, then you better be ready to make that action a delight to look at. Whether through great direction, nimble audio design, or just spectacular animation.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, 100 has all of these things. The entire show is rough-looking and much less polished than a lot of battle anime, but what it doesn't have in standalone visuals, it makes up for in movement and fluidity. With simpler character designs, this show can contort and bend them to their will. They bend like metal spoons and create uncommonly dynamic action. \\n\\n\r\nThe direction is also solid. While it isn't particularly standout, it has moments of captivating imagery through engaging motion within the metaphoric camera that the director is working with. There are a lot of shots that have you, the viewer, move through the environments observing the unfolding action. Instead of giving you a more whole image of what's happening, you are thrust into a barrage of mid-shots and close-ups, which may have looked too confusing and headache inducing if the director didn't understand his craft. \\n\\n\r\nI was initially thrown off by the sound design. Mainly because the OP really didn't jive all too well with me. The opening itself is fine, i'd say it's above average for an anime opening, but the music in said opening is kind of silly. What with the corny English. But I will give credit where it's due and say that the opening does actually connect itself to the theme of the show, which i'll get into later. The audio overall though? Beautiful. The show has an aggressively awesome stinger track that it plays when shits really starting to go down that is really hype. Something about whining synths really gets me going. The sound design is also solid throughout. Since there's a lot of movement, there needs to be a lot of syncing with said movement. The action is fast and the sounds are crisp. Characters often smash face-first into brick walls, cracking them into rubble and it sounds great. \\n\\n\r\nArtistically, the show is spectacular. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Thematic Narrative]\\n\\n\r\nSo in most Shounen battle anime you have your protagonist. And he's cool and Kirito and broody and duel-wielding and edgy and spiky-haired and sexy and has a long black coat and has a non-caring but actually caring personality. We've seen it all before. These \"cool\" MC's are one of the main reasons I generally stay away from action anime. Their innocuous and banal entirety is a huge turnoff, especially since every bland cardboard cutout girl ends up draped over them like a wet tarp. \\n\\n\r\nShigeo, our protagonist, is similarly non-caring yet caring. He's distant. But all these tropes are acknowledged, not in the winking \"hey we know we are doing this stupid bullshit\", kinda way. But in a literal story kind of way. These are actually problems. For once, these battle Shounen aren't saying these traits are attractive. Early on in the series it's established that Shigeo is not only ridiculously powerful, but emotionally distant. He hates that about himself. His crush is more interested in athletic guys than she is in emotionally unavailable quite boys with crazy magic powers. \\n\\n\r\nBut instead of just saving her and getting the pussy, like what most of these shows would do. Shigeo acknowledges this and tries to improve himself. These aren't just traits you have to live with. These are flaws you can fix if you work hard enough. From the second episode the ongoing theme of this series becomes apparent. Self-improvement is awesome. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series he fights. If you've ever seen battle anime then you'd know that he'll be fighting increasingly powerful enemies with his crazy over powered abilities and then it leads to a out-of-this world climax. What Mob Psycho 100 does so intelligently is use that obvious buildup to have this theme not only be there in the background, but enter the foreground of this narrative. \\n\\n\r\nIt becomes clear that the enemies Shigeo is facing are powerful espers who, much like him, have social issues. Different social issues, but social issues nonetheless. But unlike him, they don't want to change or better themselves. So in a cathartic kind of way, Shigeo is fighting anime protagonists from other series'. Kind of. Especially towards the middle half of the show as he faces the first true esper he has come into contact with. This parallel is, put bluntly, really fun. \\n\\n\r\nThis self-improvement theme continues with Shigeo's mentor in telekinesis, Reigen, being nothing but a con-man. This con-man, however, is genuinely a nice guy who disperses nuggets of wisdom throughout his mostly comedy-focused act. He is dangerously charismatic and convincing and cool, which are all the things that Shigeo wants to be. This parallel continues with Shigeo's spouse, too, which plays a major role in this series.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this theme does get stretched thin, as in, becomes really really obvious as the show progresses. So much so that at one point towards the end it is explicitly explained to you. But in a way, that's alright, especially when i'm considering the demographic that this show really should flourish within. Teenagers. I feel as a teenager i'd be really into a show like this. In fact, i'd go so far as to say that this could be a very mandatory viewing to teenagers who are very into battle anime. Especially introverted kids who begin to think that their introverted-ness is due to some special power or hidden ability and the world will, at some point, hand all the answers to them. In reality, that's far from the truth and Mob Pyscho 100 could be that pill that breaks them free of those kinds of thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nThis genuinely smart, thoughtful, and refreshing message is perhaps this shows strongest narrative angle. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Cons of Being]\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the downside of being a show that lampoons through narrative are also in full effect. I do want to say that this shows entire point is not to make fun of Shounen action anime, as much as it is to tell a story that simply serves as a refreshing take on the genre. However, these connections need to be drawn regardless since critically, the stories aren't too different.  \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaws are that when this show isn't engaging you with these thematic narratives it really just follows the path of a generic Shounen. As I've said, this could be easily forgiven if I actually enjoyed Shounen. But the gauntlet-style action that really becomes the norm towards the end of the series gave me vibes that weren't really all too engaging. The subversive moments were fun, but they were far from the meat of the final episodes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, throughout its twelve episode run, there was a small dip in narrative tightness towards the later middle-half that impacted the shows flow. Especially beginning these corruption oriented stories that really didn't have reasonable or interesting conclusions. A lot of the side characters also never really played much of a role at all, which I was a little disappointed in. \\n\\n\r\nThere was also an annoying ghost side-character that generally served as comedic relief. The comedy in just about every Shounen action anime always ends up being more miss-than-hit for me, which kind of sucks. This show, surprisingly, did ring a few laughs out of me but for the most part, I really didn't care for the solely comedic scenes in the series. When it blended comedy with it's action it became much more palatable. \\n\\n\r\nThere were also a few moments in which there was some truly obnoxious character baits that didn't go anywhere. I despise when shows do this and it's very rare that they actually have any effect other than momentary surprise, only to realize that everything is just going to be fine in the end. This is because by the end of the show, the status quo is generally very samey. While some people definitely got powers, there were some cheap narrative shots taken to make sure everything wraps up a bit too neatly, setting up a potential second season. \\n\\n\r\nI wish this show took more risks with finishing it's story. Hell, kill off a character or two. This show, while comedic in nature, never really felt like it was beyond having powerful scenes. Especially since it does try and get you in the emotion-bone every so often with some of the flashbacks and heartfelt moments. Unfortunately... that's where the emotional attachment ends. The characters and their general characterization balances the line between generic and semi-creative, with some characters being genuinely fun and engaging, while other characters being a bit too generic for this shows premise. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mob Psych 100 is probably the best Shounen battle anime I've seen so far. I haven't watched the other series this creator has written, One Punch Man yet, but with how impressed Mob Psycho left me, maybe it's about time I check that out. I think for it's various flaws, Mob's strong themes and incredible visuals elevate it past a lot of action anime that I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some legitimately great moments here that unfortunately cluster around the first half more than they do the second half of this shows run-time. However, the show as a whole is so short that I felt like this wasn't as big of an issue as it could've been. The length really did do it a lot of favors. The breezy duration made even the less-than-interesting parts easy to get through. \\n\\n\r\nI think Mob psycho 100 is mandatory viewing for Shounen action fans. It brings an element of creativity in a genre that I feel, narratively, has been very stagnant and similar. Mob Psycho goes the extra mile with entertaining action, tying together crisp audio, solid direction, and great animation into a thematically resonant twelve-episode bundle. \\n",

            "content": "This show is an absolute treat. As many already know, Mob Psycho 100, based on the web manga by ONE, shares many aspects with his One Punch Man series and the subsequent adaptation. However, while OPM is immensely entertaining due to the overwhelming strength of its protagonist, Mob Psycho 100 takes a more refined look at its characters and produces a show that not only reaches but surpasses the heights of its sister series.\r\nStory: 6\r\nMob's story is nothing too special, and luckily it doesn't need to be. Mob is an awkward, dull, incredibly overpowered esper struggling his way through the social nightmare that is middleschool. In the meantime, he works for fraud exorcist-for-hire Reigen (a phenomenal character, but I'll get to that). The story ends up boiling down to Mob demolishing tougher and tougher opponents by becoming uncontrollably powerful any time he gets worked up. It works on a quickly paced arc-based structure that succeeds most of the time and feels a bit rushed at others like the arc that follows Mob's brother Ritsu. The final few episodes hit a great stride and are impeccably paced.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThis show looks absolutely stunning most of the time. Adapting from material as crudely drawn as ONE's works would take a massive amount of talent. BONES has just that talent. The art style hits a perfect sweet spot by utilizing rough looking character designs with rugged lines and a GOD-TIER level of polish in action sequences that makes for some of the most kinetic fights I've witnessed in animation. Seriously, some of the scenes in this show are jaw-droppingly awesome. The crew at BONES also isn't afraid to used mixed animation styles to convey a visual message. Some segments utilize a paint-on-glass style that looks amazing and unique. The entire ending animation is done in this style and is one of the most impressive ED's I've ever seen for that very reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nSpeaking of the ED, the music associated with this show is just too badass not to commend. The opening theme credited to a band simply named \"MOB CHOIR\" is a catchy driving techno rock track that hooked me instantly. The ED by \"ALL OFF\" is similarly great and sends off every episode perfectly. I have a feeling it will be a very nostalgic ED for me very soon.\\n\r\nNow the soundtrack. It's by Kenji Kawai. Kenji Kawai is an absolute boss. I needn't say anything else, but the man is a fantastic OST composer. His use of a variety of traditional instruments, electronics, a multitude of percussion instruments, and electronic instruments is always effective. The battle music is intense and kicks ass. The sullen moments are beautiful and emotionally written. Tracks can be used repetitively, but that is a common occurrence in anime. He's awesome. Quick plug for the Seirei no Moribito OST, another great score he wrote for another great show. Alright. Enough rambling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nMan, the characters in this show are so fun. I think the biggest takeaway I had from these characters was just how good-spirited they all were. Any character you thought could be written off as \"just some jerk\" ended up being really pleasant and like-able. The members of the Body Improvement Club could have been rude and unaccepting of someone as out of shape and traditionally \"uncool\" as Mob, but instead they openly welcome him and treat him with care and respect. Teru could have remained an uncompromisingly pompous prick, but instead turns into an honestly good guy who is willing to help Mob. Dimple, though seemingly bent on world domination, helps Mob and offers him advice after Mob defeats him.\\n\r\nAnd then there's Reigen. A fraud, con-artist, and outright liar who tricks people into paying for his services is virtually the coolest most genuinely good-hearted character in the whole show. He takes Mob, an insecure middle schooler struggling with his powers, under his wing and provides him with advice that inadvertently affects his entire world-view for the better. Reigen alone makes this show worth watching, and if you've read what I've written above, then you know there are MANY things that make this show worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nAs I've already said, this show is a treat. Studio BONES has crafted an exceptional adaptation of a story that may have flown well under the radar otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nAs exciting as One Punch Man and packed with fun and interesting characters, Mob Psycho 100 is the best show I watched this season. With only 12 episodes (but hopefully more to come), this fun ride is well worth your time. \\n",

They totally defeated everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a lot of impact in terms of the real life with comedic plot. The development of the characters shows it in the good way.\\n\\n\r\nTotaly, I give all around 10 out 10 for every thing. \\n\\n\r\nGood Job to the author and manga artist.

            "content": "With the success of One Punch Man, everyone was looking forward to the next ONE adaptation Mob Psycho 100. As it finally aired, it was initially met with mixed reactions. Maybe people set the bar too high and were met with a slight disappointment. However, I personally saw the show\u2019s potential and patiently witnessed the show progress which turned into a quite satisfying experience.\r\nThe show follows the story of Kageyama Shou a.k.a Mob who tries to avoid using his psychic powers with the intention of hurting others. He looks up to his master Reigen Arataka said who is actually a clever swindler that I personallycan\u2019t help liking because of his smooth nature. While Reigen often lacks screen time, focusing more on Mob\u2019s part of the story, they are the two core characters of the show. Other characters of interest include the cheeky spirit Dimple, the stylish Hanazawa who is another esper, and Mob\u2019s caring brother Ritsu. There are other interesting attention-grabbing characters present but the three of them have more significance due to their own story arcs. The overall approach of the story seems to gravitate towards a parody-styled zany comedy while trying to satirize the idea of possessing supernatural powers. The action is fast-paced and explosive. Shot and often manoeuvred at different insane angles, one can\u2019t help but be amazed despite that the animation is not as top-notch as OPM. The art looks rough and cartoony, but it fits the atmosphere well. There are elements of coming-of-age and drama present as it shows Mob\u2019s struggle of possessing psychic powers as he grows up. The dramatic effect is not too overblown and is just restricted to internal monologue but it does provide a good edge on presenting the conflict within the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one issue I have with the show, it is the direction of the story.  It started cool with introducing to us the everyday life of a boy with psychic powers working part-time for a scam business which I find really interesting. However, it would\u2019ve been great to see if Mob finally discovered or realized that Reigen is a fake supernatural expert. The story finds a way to solve that problem later on but it would have been a nice good character development if it went toward that path. As mentioned earlier, there are character arcs in the story where Mob finds himself involved in some way. Though I enjoyed all of them, one in particular sort of bothered me which was Ritsu\u2019s arc. I felt like the show has put way more time than necessary for it. It does try to develop Ritsu\u2019s character, but all the time I was thinking that Mob could have used that development more since he is the more important and interesting character. Mob was still struggling with conflicted feelings about using psychic powers when it was revealed that there\u2019s a villain organization. Basically, I liked that the show tries to take its story more seriously and not devolve into a redundant punch-line comedy. However, I feel like it doesn\u2019t want to harm the comedic nature of the show thus always choosing the easy way out of a conflict. It\u2019s a shame really, but maybe we can get more action if we can get a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mob Psycho 100 is a refreshing approach to action comedy, not too exaggerated and not too mediocre. Don\u2019t expect another One Punch Man, it\u2019s a show that can stand on its own without being associated to the author\u2019s more successful endeavor.\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s probably a million ways to describe Mob Psycho 100. One simple word is just exciting. How can it not be? It\u2019s by the same creator of one of the most talked about shows from 2015, One-Punch Man. As a reader of the source material, I can also firmly say that the show\u2019s trailers and hype is legitimate. Not in the legitimate way that it\u2019s the best anime of the century. It\u2019s more of legitimate excellency that represents classic supernatural entertainment.\r\nEven if you\u2019re unfamiliar ONE\u2019s work, you\u2019ll easily recognize that Mob Psycho 100 isn\u2019t just a show with traditional artwork. The visual follows the mangapretty closely while the action sequences are animated by a famed studio, Bones. Plus, we got director Yuzuru Tachikawa on board as part of the staff. Known for his work such as Death Parade, Terror in Tokyo, and Kill la Kill, it\u2019s definitely something to get excited about. Fans of the franchise will be also be pleased to know that Kawai Kenji is the sound director, known for famous works such as the Ghost in the Shell franchise, Gundam 00, and the more recent Joker Game. Still, Mob Psycho 100 is beyond what just the staff has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not always so simple to understand the visual representation of Mob Psycho 100. Taking a closer look at the storytelling will give you a better idea as we are introduced to the main characters. At its core, we have main protagonist Shigeo Kageyama, otherwise known as Mob. He is a 14 year old kid attending a school with an average life. However, it\u2019s immediately obvious that he is a special because of his ESP powers. Events in the story causes his powers to go unstable and Mob finds himself difficult to be \u201cnormal\u201d. The premise is pretty simple on paper, right? An ordinary kid who tries to live a normal life with abnormal ability is the basic idea. However, the series delivers many scenarios where Mob uses his powers way more than he should. For a kid who wants a normal life, he gets into many abnormal situations which puts himself at risk. Still, this isn\u2019t exactly the case as we\u2019ll see how powerful Mob is. While he isn\u2019t a Saitama 2.0, Mob\u2019s abilities are not to be underestimated. In many battles he\u2019s been in, Mob is able to overpower his opponents, sometimes without even realizing it. It\u2019s interesting to also see what often triggers Mob to get involved in such unusual events. Social peer pressure and bullying are a few factors. Mob also seeks admiration and even wants to impress a girl he likes so this leads to him making mistakes at times. I mean, he is still human and humans make mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nEven though he is the titular character, the show doesn\u2019t neglect its others especially with characters such as Reigen, Ritsu (Mob\u2019s younger brother), Teruki, and Dimple. Ritsu has really grown to me as a very interesting character. Unlike Mob, he is very clever and often uses trickery to get what he wants. Sometimes, he even treats life as if it\u2019s a game where playing the right cards will win. What most impresses me about Ritsu is his own self-awareness and how despite being powerless in the beginning, he is able to rise up as a leader. It\u2019s also shown that he has an inferiority complex compared to his brother (because he originally lacked special powers) and that causes himself to express doubt. This eventually also turns into guilt and there\u2019s reasoning for redemption. \\n\\n\r\nReigen is also an interesting character who is known as \u201cMob\u2019s master\u201d. He claims a lot of things and often speaks and lies with the truth. Despite being manipulative, he isn\u2019t a bad guy and often looks out after Mob\u2019 well-being. He also offers good advice to Mob including what really makes someone a \u201cbetter person\u201d.  One weakness that I do find about him though is his unwillingness to admit mistakes. Somewhere in between, there\u2019s Teruki (\u201cTeru\u201d). I have to admit though, this guy has one of the most ridiculous hair styles I\u2019ve ever seen from ONE\u2019s work. Unlike Mob, he freely uses his esper powers like if they are God\u2019s holy gift. What makes him interesting is how after meeting Mob, Teru undergoes a big change in his character. It\u2019s like a bully that reinvents himself after getting put to his place for the first time in their life. Quite iconic if you ask me. Finally, Dimple strikes to me as the most mysterious character. In fact, he isn\u2019t even human! He\u2019s actually a spirit who even at one time had his own cult. What makes him interesting is despite having a God-like complex and ego, Dimple also wants others succeed in particular Mob. With such a colorful character cast in this series, expectations are met especially when it comes to creativity. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the story looking complex, it really isn\u2019t. The first few episodes introduces our main characters while most episodes for the first half just follows Mob\u2019s life in his daily misadventures. The latter half focuses more on linear plot though as dangerous individuals are introduced that truly tests the strengths of our protagonists. This puts strains on Mob as he must overcome his personal demons. Because remember, Mob just wants to live a normal life and when he gets stressed, rage follows. When that rage explodes, we get Mob Psycho 100%, literally. And it\u2019s not a very pretty sight.\\n\\n\r\nAs a source reader, I am impressed at how they adapted the character relationships. Mob and Ritsu has one of the most complex relationship even as brothers. Teru\u2019s evolution from a bully to a sidekick/ally to Mob is both amusing and also impressive to see as changes aren\u2019t always easy for characters to accept. Reigen\u2019s relationship with Mob is also based on respect and trust. Mob genuinely cares about Reigen and in one episode, his rage level almost goes out of control after seeing his master being put down. On the other hand, I am slightly disappointed that the season is only a 1-cour of 12 episodes. Some episodes are rushed as I was hoping they would adapt more into the story. For most parts, the series is still directed with good faith. \\n\\n\r\nAh yes, the artwork and visuals. Even though I already talked about it before, it\u2019s really hard to ignore Mob Psycho 100\u2019s quality with its artistic style. It is very stylistic to the manga and unique in quality. When things get serious, the artwork really works with its hardcore cinematography. Violent scenes really do feel impactful while body movements never really suffers in the show as character designs are simple enough to avoid that. In addition, Mob\u2019s character is portrayed as pretty plain normal just as he should be. Other characters such as Teru and Dimple stands out with some unique physical traits; seriously, I still can\u2019t get over how ridiculous Teru\u2019s hair is at times. In retrospect, Bones did a fantastic job with the production for the show. With talented animators such as Yoshimichi Kameda and Matsumoto Norio involved in this project, Mob Psycho 100 stands out extravagantly in the artistic field.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t underestimate the soundtrack either. The OP and ED theme songs are also stylistic and as a whole. The OST is instrumental and often intense during many segments. Character voice expressions are also noticeable especially when Mob\u2019s mentality reaches 100%. And because the show is so filled with personality, the speech pattern and dialogues of the more prominent characters are often very memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe amazing thing about Mob Psycho 100 is the excitement while feeling less of an anime but more like a comic action flick. As an adaptation, the show is stuffed with action, personality, and creativity. I can\u2019t remember any episode where I was watching the clock and in fact often feel like episodes goes way too fast. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat? That episode felt like 5 minutes?!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s because of how entertaining it is that is more than just pure popcorn entertainment. Sure, this might not be a series that\u2019s suitable for everyone. However, Mob Psycho 100 stands on its own merits and is definitely not just a One-Punch Man-wannabee. Crafted by ONE, it\u2019s a show that\u2019s more than a supernatural character drama. It\u2019s just a damn good piece of greatness. \\n",

            "content": "Uninspiring, highly overrated, and cheap. Brilliance and creativity are the last things to come to mind while watching Mob Psycho 100.\r\nThe story is a complete joke. It is a major step-down compared to One's other work, One Punch Man. The entire story plays out like a tale a 5th grader would write and present. Of the many terrible presentations Mob Psycho 100 has to offer, One of the most bothersome reoccurring things is that the show lacks of creativity. The main character in particular, shares the same characteristic traits and personality of Saitama from One Punch Man. The plot and story always feature an overpoweredmain character that is socially awkward trying to save the day with his inexplicably obtained powers. The main characters in his works usually lack any motivation unless they're triggered more than the typical girl on Tumblr. Rinse & repeat for every this process for just about every episode and that my dear readers is the show.  If this continues as a re-occurring theme for his stories, One needs to do a better job with creating and introducing a story, plot, and characters that doesn\u2019t appear too similar to his other works. \\n\\n\r\nFun fact: Did you know that you can pretty much get an idea of what the plot is about for the rest of the series based upon the opening title sequence alone?\\n\\n\r\nOne was either sitting on the toilet or taking a shower when he thought about what was going to happen next for this series. The director could have easily changed specific things to make it more intriguing however; there were no signs of that happening. Now perhaps one of the interesting things involving the story was that certain episode's do like to focus on more serious matters. It wasn't all nonsensical fighting. To contradict what I said about the toilet thing earlier, there were a few moments in the story were the characters did try to improve their powers while trying to understand the most complicated things about their psychic powers and abilities.\\n\\n\r\nThere were multiple scenes featured within the story where tense emotional dialogue would temporarily take over action scenes. It made the show a little more \u201cdramatic\u201d however; I don\u2019t believe that most of the parts where these \u201cdramatic moments\u201d had taken place were proper. This was evident during many of the fights. The pacing of the story was pretty straight-forward. Often times there didn't seem to be a reason to go back and explain certain details within the story. Depending on how you perceived the show, I didn\u2019t thing that the story was as awful as others make it out to be. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the story could\u2019ve have definitely used some touching up! Plot developments lack excitement; it\u2019s constantly riddled with predictable moments, and lacks an interesting narrative. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation, character designs, quality and background settings. The following are the shows weak points in the art department. There were some pretty decent fighting and action sequences. The bad thing is that they are plagued with awful choices made in quality, setting, and special effects. I look back at earlier episodes like 4 & 5 prospectively, and believe that within the entire series 4 & 5 had the best fight scenes; this is me being nice by the way. Although the background setting featured in those particular episode were plain and dull. The school yard setting reminded me of old anime from the 70's, 80's, and 90's. In those days, background settings were not that important unless it had meaning.Of course it being 2016 at the time of this review, it is highly unacceptable by today\u2019s standards.. \\n\\n\r\nThe animators often times put a lot effort into the details of a fight. Characters muscles, facial reactions, and body reactions along with the well fitted dialogue, worked out pretty damn well. Sometimes, it made for more believable and intense fights. Not all fights were good though, I use episode 8 such as, during the time Mob is getting Rekt, the animation, facial expressions body movements looked a complete mess. While it may be fixed in the Blu-ray it still doesn't change the fact that it was terrible at first.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, special effects like the rain and the auroras surrounding characters while they are using their powers. It looked as if the animators just went into after effects or even Sony Vegas, created them, and put them into the final product. It seems safe to say that this series was on a budget. \\n\\n\r\nThis could be good or bad because if you're reading the manga then you can tell that the animators decided to stick with the original designs created by One. Bad thing is that, if you're like me, and care about seeing animators put a lot effort towards making an original work look better with upgraded character designs, special effects, and lots of great details in various scenes, you would be disappointed. Now I've seen many, many titles where the manga or LN designs look, and are much more beautiful than the anime however, now is not the time to discuss it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Mob psycho is a visual disaster!  Characters designs in the manga, as mentioned earlier lack any kind of beauty or aesthetics. But, I'm focused on the anime now. Getting back on the subject, anime character designs are a pain to look at. Every other character appears to look exactly alike in facial features. This ranges from the head shapes, eyes, along with facial structures and hair. The appearances of characters, background settings, clothing, and background objects seen within the series are poor in quality and design. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty decent. There were less than a handful of tracks and sound effects that made the show stand out. The music composed for certain scenes that express sadness, depression enhances the mood and atmosphere. Songs created for the fight sequences were lacking an edge to make the fight more engaging. The voice actors were \u201cokay.\u201d I didn't think the actors had the right attitude for the series. \\n\\n\r\nSome seiyuu\u2019s are dedicated to making their characters sound more realistic by remember something that made them angry in the past and expressing the anger they felt from that experience to make a more believable attitude or sound for their characters vocals. For the most part, I did not feel that the voice actors were putting forth all their potential.\\n\\n\r\nIn ONE's future work I hope that he introduces more original characters. The characters are too one-dimensional. I wanted to drop this show on episode 2 because of this. The main character Shigeo is a blatant, lazily copy & pasted Saitama. I had trouble trying to like Shigeo because he doesn't have the same appeal that Saitama does, despite being a rip off. Shigeo's most unappealing trait is his socially awkward and clueless demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes it's cute when girls in anime are shy and awkward, however guys, not so much. Side characters are a joke. You know, as I\u2019m writing this, I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a good word to describe them because they were not in any way funny. While some give a little entertainment others are so annoying. I found this true mostly with the antagonists. The so-called \"supportive\" characters are more like comic relief than anything else.ONE appears to lack the ability to create characters that have a more \u201cunique\u201d and \u201crich\u201d personality. His bad habit of copying and pasting the same characters from his different work is getting stale.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment during the span of this series ranged from \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cokay.\u201d I usually drop titles after four episodes however the fourth was a deal breaker. I gradually continued to hope that maybe a new development in the story and characters would come along to change my negative feelings for Mob Psycho. This simply was not the case. Some may argue that \u201cmost people fail to see the shows appeal\u201d or that \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t judge a show based upon appearances.\u201d I argue back that when it comes down to Mob Psycho, the show tosses away fluent story-telling, creative writing, lasting appeal, memorable characters, good character designs, creative background settings, quality animation and a soundtrack with songs you can keep on repeat.\\n\\n\r\nThe real question is why and how? How could a show that has such awful traits be so highly praised? The answer is simple. Simplicity is what the show builds its foundation upon. The entire show is simple enough for anyone new or old to anime understand easily and most importantly enjoy. Its\u2019 welcoming, the show doesn\u2019t need good character designs or a good introduction. Having high quality animation? Forget that! Everything is kept simple, and that\u2019s\u2019 actually a good thing. I think of it as an old Nintendo console. You play Super Mario bros 3. You\u2019re having a good time, sure the graphics aren\u2019t the best, but the important thing is that you\u2019re having a good time. You\u2019re having fun seeing the simplicity and joy of Mario flying around in a tanooki suit crushing goomba\u2019s and turtles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mob Psycho 100 really needed work in creativity. Mob Psycho would\u2019ve continued to do well \\n\r\nas just a manga title. As for whether I recommend this or not, I would actually say yes. Mob is a pretty good despite the fact that it lacks appeal, creative story-telling, and quality. Referring Mob, or even considering Mob Psycho 100 to be less than or equal to One-Punch Man is an insult.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts,\\n\\n\r\nI felt that Mob Psycho 100 deserved a solid 4/10 for trying\u2026 if you even want to call it that. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever watched an anime that had 12 episodes that had very interesting visuals, great characters (and development) and story that was charming in its own nature? No? Well Mob Psycho 100 is right here for you to watch! \r\nStory - 8/10 \r\nTo be entirely honest, I didn't think much with this series. I was going to skip over it and not even bat an eye at it--why? I heard it was by ONE and even though I enjoyed One Punch Man, it wasn't something I'd rewatch and go after again. I tend to steer away from \"stereotypical\" shounen series nowadays. I thought thisseries was going to be the same formula. I was wrong. Yes, the anime starts off slow--yes it appears to be recycled garbage at first. But it really evolves into something very charming.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of this series is pretty simplistic. Mob is the main character and he's a middle school boy who's an outcast from most of society, including social circles. What separates him from the norm is his psychic abilities. It's quite a quirky show with a lot of comedy elements. Each episode consists of Mob going after spirits and  performing an exorcism using his psychic abilities. Along the way you meet different characters that add to the comedy aspect of this anime.  With this said, story-wise. It's more of a character driven show, but honestly, I like the simple story and how it goes deeper and deeper into the world building. Conflicts arise later in the series and the way it's handled between the characters is nothing short of amazing. I don't know about you, but I'm really sick of melodramatic sequences in stories where characters act really stupid (i.e. romcoms) and it ruins the quality of storyline. \\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 doesn't do that--it propels a simple story with endearing characters. I'm honestly so surprised how much world building we got in 12 episodes without it feeling rushed (I'm an anime only so I do not know how well paced it was compared to the source material). \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nBones has done it again with another incredible job with animation! The art is probably what makes this anime stick out so much--and why people probably turned a blind eye to this series. Which is such a shame given the beautifully fluid animation; especially in action scenes! The style may come off more cartoony than the traditional \"moe\" anime style we are all used to, but I promise you that it's not a reason to overlook this anime. I personally think the style is unique and really sets a tone for the series. It's simple in nature much like the story. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe OP \"Mob Choir 99\" is such a catchy tune and you start counting with the song every week! The visuals that go with it is also very catching! You notice something new every time you look it. The ED song is very simple and mellow--this captures the easy going nature of the series (until the battles scenes though lol).  The OSTS are also very interesting to hear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've seen comedy series get 25 episodes and do absolutely nothing with the characters and shove repetitive rubbish in my face episode after episode. Whether you like the comedy or not is entirely subjective, but regardless, in 12 episodes I never once felt that rubbish shoving in my face. The characters manage to get more development in such a short amount of time compared to anime with 24 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Mob, starts off fairly easy to read. He's introverted in nature and isn't good with social interactions. The only thing he seems to be good at is his psychic abilities--he has deep admiration for his little brother who seems to be the top at everything except what Mob is good at. Later in the story, we see how Mob expresses his emotions and feelings. We see how complicated and powerful he truly is. But what separates him from most main shounen characters is his modesty--he doesn't want these powers and he never once in the 12 episodes ever desires to be stronger. He's never egotistic about it. He never shows it off. He's almost always kind to anyone who returns kindness to him. He tries his best and he's deeply supported by those around him. He's a misfit in theory, but he's managed to have so many people care about him and despite his struggle to express feelings, he's close to them as well. He never wants to hurt anyone unless it's a spirit. He'll do anything to protect his brother and friends even if it meant throwing away personal values. And even when he's been knocked down and defeated, he gets back up and though he may lose his way, he still tries. Maybe not with strength, maybe just maybe, in the end he will win without really winning. Maybe he'll succeed with only restoring those personal values and the faith others have given him. Mob, the main character of Mob Psycho 100.\\n\\n\r\nAnything else I say about the characters would be considered spoilers, and I wouldn't want to ruin it! But for the sake of summary, Ritsu (Mob's brother) has great development and beautiful characters bonding between brothers :') Reigen (Mob's Master) comes off as an asshole in the beginning and you come to think that he only uses Mob as a tool for his own personal gain. Later on however, you come to realize there's way more to him than at first though. He will also have his shinning moment! Ekubo (Mob's spirit friend) starts off evil but then develops a bond not just between Mob, but the other main characters and even some of the supporting characters. He went from bad to not so bad haha. \\n\\n\r\nAny other characters that have some sort of role are likable and charming to say the least. It's just all well balanced with a full set of cast without making it feel overwhelming! I'm just so impressed with how Bones handled this anime--so very impressed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThrough the comedy, stunning action, great characters, and unraveling plot, this anime didn't fail to assume me! I'm so excited to see a season 2 ASAP! I highly recommend this anime :) \\n",

            "content": "Funny, whimsical, charming, and oddly enough, thoughtful. \r\nMob Psycho 100 is another comedic/action endeavor brought to us by author ONE, the mind behind 2015's breakout hit, One Punch Man, and like that success story, this also carries with it his signature flare for cool action set-pieces, theatrical displays of goofball antics, an art presence that's immediately eye-catching, all while being peppered with an obtuse sense of humor that's interwoven to form the finished product. And while it started out in a manner that felt like a subsidiary of its much more recognizable older brother, as it ventured on, it has proven to be more thancapable in earning its own identity, deserving of the same level of respect as its predecessor. Where One Punch Man was all about being bullheadedly direct with everything it hits you with, Mob Psycho 100 instead chooses to blare the same kind of energy upfront, before coming in with a sneaky left hook; one that not only rattles off a few bells to the unexpected viewer but also lands the first blow of the show's claim to autonomy from unnecessary comparisons to determine its own self-worth.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd with that being said, let's get the obligatory comparisons out of the way first, if only for the sake of those viewers who simply came for just that. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022Both Mob and Saitama are characters with regressed emotions, but where Saitama's emotionless state comes from sheer boredom from a life with no true obstacles, Mob's state derives from a completely different reason. He's socially inept and insecure about his inability to make meaningful connections, while at the same time, mindful of his immense power, choosing to suppress them, and in the course of doing so, suppress his feelings as well. But when he could no longer keep those emotions in check, the show's namesake becomes clear as day, but we'll address that later, for now, hold on to that thought. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022They contain fights that are equal parts wacky and inventive. Where OPM chose a more polished look to exemplify everything, MP100 decided to go the opposite route, staying faithful to the source material, while maintaining the level of quality expected from a work of its stature.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022Mob looks like Saitama with a wig.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, with the comparisons out of the way, on with the review!\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that would immediately jump out at you is the art itself, which could be described as a fever dream filtered through a barrage of psychedelia, along the lines of a visual interpretation of an acid trip. With neon reds and blues swirling around disproportionate character designs, and animators that look like they're trying everything within their power just to color within the lines, this anime could get quite intoxicating at times. An accomplishment in wacky cerebral distortion that hasn't been seen since 2008's Kaiba. And it's this very warped production that helps drive the narrative along, and for many, this aesthetic appeal would have already been enough to get them through all 12-episodes. But thanks to some meaningful passages being brought up to supplement this nutty art-style later on, to many, the presentation only became a secondary reason to stick around instead.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with a story as frenetic as this one, this style of presentation felt like one of those \"why haven't anyone done this yet?\" kind of moments. Mob Psycho 100 is X-Men meet Ghostbusters. \\n\\n\r\nShigeo \"Mob\" Kageyama, residential egghead and harborer of immense power, is our protagonist. As he bobs along with an expression that makes it clear that he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, he enters the office of his employer, Arataka Reigen. When he isn't busy stealing your wallet to sell it back to you, Reigen and Mob forms a ghostbusting duo that runs around town exorcising evil spirits for profit. And when I say they exorcise evil spirits, I mean Mob does the work while Reigen thinks of new ways of swindling some sap out of their hard earned paycheck. And had that been the only thing going on in the story, there wouldn't be much here to discuss, but thankfully, that's only a jumping off point to what's really important. \\n\\n\r\nA dive headfirst into easily digestible symbology and subtext.\\n\\n\r\nWhile adored the world over by critical thinkers and any reviewer worth their salt, allegorical content is usually received with mix reception by the general audience, in large part to the fact that said material requires a keen eye to make what's being digested more engaging. Indie films don't rake in big box office returns, the big brand-name Hollywood blockbusters do, and understandably so. The general audience simply wishes to be entertained, and where one requires more fixation on the details of the plot and what certain things may mean, the other promises none of that, instead offering an experience that's as straightforward as the images on the screen would have you believe. In a way, that's the difference between OPM and MP100; OPM makes bullet-point statements with no hidden agenda, while MP100 has fine print written into its spastic portrayal. And let's not make any quick assumptions here, that's not bad at all, simple programming is equally as needed as something with a bit more bite to it. One services everyone, while the other offers a second helping for those that want a bit more. \\n\\n\r\nBut then there's that weird breed of content. One that's as direct as the big blockbusters, but at the same time, manages to slide another layer in for those that pick up on it. Something that appears to be a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese, but when bitten into, has the texture and taste of something a bit more high-end. \\n\\n\r\nWe've seen it with anime titles such as Gurren Lagann, Gunbuster, Abenobashi, and FLCL, and now MP100 has seemingly stepped up on the mantle to join their ranks, if only on a scale that's not as far-reaching. \\n\\n\r\nThis unexpected layer is found in the humorous scenarios, quick \"blink and you'll miss it\" commentary, and the relationship Mob shares with his brother, Ritsu. \\n\\n\r\nBeing hidden within the folds of blaring orchestrated set-pieces, comedic jabs at the situations that the characters are placed in, and the occasional factoids pertaining to the state of certain issues, you'll find very quick cheeky retorts that draw into question the very nature of these kinds of narratives that are simply accepted by the masses. Where mini-boss battles are simply accepted as side conquests for smaller characters or obstacles that the protagonist has to plow through to meet the head honcho, in MP100, that very idea of thinking is sideswiped with a swift punch to the face and characters that are practically voicing the audiences' concern of \"just get to the boss battle already.\" Where the presence of a villainous organization full of henchmen being operated haphazardly is simply shrugged off as a byproduct of superhero stories, MP100 makes that very notion its reason for doing nothing short of walking through the front entrance without so much as a scuffle. And where we never questioned why megalomaniacs all come off as infuriatingly disturbed manchildren, MP100 doesn't even think twice about having someone say \"These guys who are seriously talking about taking over the world are children who failed to grow up.\" \\n\\n\r\nEvery jab towards these trends are delivered with pinpoint accuracy but never in a mean-spirited way that feels like the writers are cynically lampooning them. ONE has proven to be a fan of these accepted tropes and cliches but doesn't shy away from addressing it for what it is. I can go on and on about moments like these, but the point is, MP100 is fully aware of the lunacy populating the very landscape of contemporary trends it has become a part of, while still fully embracing it to tell its own kooky version of the same kind of story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while this very tongue-in-cheek manner that MP100 operates on is worth discussing in lengthier detail, the true heart of the show's content lies with Mob's mental state and the relationship he shares with his brother. \\n\\n\r\nMob, as a brother, is too dense to see the anguish felt by his little brother, Ritsu, while Ritsu himself is too focused on trying to surpass Mob that he loses focus on the fact that he's admired by him, for reasons even someone as powerful as Mob himself can't obtain. It's the \"grass is always greener on the other side\" saying, but instead of them being delegated as enemies, they're simply misunderstood. Each seeking a quality that the other has without registering the actuality of their own self-worth. Where Ritsu fosters all of the qualities of a well-acclimated socialite, his brother, unfortunately, possesses the charm of Bozo the Clown. A trait that's only worsened by the increasingly negative reception that his powers tend to draw from others. What was once seen as an astonishing gift to some, was now only registered with blas\u00e9 responses, or in worst case scenario, something that could endanger the lives of others. As a result, his already simple demeanor was reduced even further to a state that's almost autistic (and no, I'm not saying that in a joking manner), since the one thing that made him unique was now bastardized, effectively boxing him into a corner with nothing left to turn to. But where others shunned or ignore him, his brother saw otherwise. He saw a gift he yearned for but couldn't have. Despite being accepted by society, something his brother was robbed of, he still harbors a feeling of inadequacy when Mob levitates objects like it's no big deal or causes his dinner spoon to bend like playdough. \\n\\n\r\nJust the very duality between these brothers was enough to dissect already, this doesn't even address the elephant in the room; Mob's powers themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe title of Mob Psycho 100 quite literally refers to his power and what they mean, as it's shorthand for what's going on whenever he uses them. No one could suppress their emotions long enough before they hit a breaking point, and that's essentially the idea presented here. But where that \"final straw\" is usually only presented through someone emoting, in MP100, it's seen by a radiant burst of energy that exudes from every fiber of Mob's being. A burst of energy that's presented by a percentage scale that's occasionally flashed onscreen, when the number hits 100%, this power manifests itself upon release with the emotion he was suppressing. Whether that be the guilt he feels for putting others in harm's way or the animosity that boils over when someone dares to endanger his loved ones; every pent-up emotion is externalized into a colorful display of energy, feeling, and chaos. \\n\\n\r\nIt's simple ideas like this that adds a certain charming layer to MP100's content. It doesn't boast about its ideas nor does it tell you to take them seriously, it simply presents it for what it is and chooses to let the viewer take from it what they will. A kind of earnestness that goes a long way after witnessing other titles that flamboyantly boast their basic accomplishments. It's a small change in approach, yet it makes all the difference. And that's what this is as well; a simple idea but done so in a way that adds new meaning to what's at face value, another beat-em-up with superpowers. \\n\\n\r\nAnd with the understanding of these basic ideas, physical encounters become much more than empty fists clashing, they become a fight for something. Not all share in this quality, but for the ones that matter, there's a reason for the audience to be genuinely invested in the outcome. In the schizophrenic world of MP100, it's these very humanistic ideas that keep everything anchored behind the layer of jokes and satirical jabs. \\n\\n\r\nEven characters like Reigen that would usually remain pigeonholed as the sleazy money-grubbing con-artist types are given a surprising amount of humanity by the time everything comes to its final stop. This doesn't come from excessive showboating, it comes from observations made after seeing similar things play out. ONE's innate understanding of tropes has allowed him the ability to work them into something straightforward and fun, yet clever without the need to reinforce that fact. Don't get me wrong, this isn't to say that the show is subtle; on the contrary, it's very much on-the-nose 100% of the time. But what it is is humble about its ideas, not expressing some inherent birthright to be taken seriously just because it has something to say. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the kind of landscape that ONE seems to be paving with each new undertaking, helping give birth to a mini-cultural zeitgeist in the medium. One where not taking yourself too seriously could be a commendable approach, while still having ideas that could please those interested in them. Simplicity delivered with a new flare. A compromise that could give rise to fun, yet thoughtful, projects like this one. It may just be a direct response to the superhero genre that's dominating pop culture, but with results like this, I'm in full support for it. And with that in mind, Mob Psycho 100 is a welcomed addition to this blossoming trend.",

            "content": "Last year, One Punch Man rose to popularity and became of the most mainstream and popular anime of the current decade. However, the mangaka of One Punch Man also had another really good series that not many have heard about, Mob Psycho 100. With an adaptation for ONE\u2019s other series, Mob Psycho 100 was also able to generate a good amount of popularity, due to it living off of One Punch Man\u2019s brand. Though there might be some similarities between the two series, Mob Psycho 100 is quite different One Punch Man in a lot of ways. And it manages to create its own name,rather than relying on the popularity of what its being compared too. Mob Psycho 100 is more original, well-written and thought-provoking than it initially seems. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 is about an 8th grader psychic named Shigeo (also known as Mob) who tries his best to become a normal person by trying to fit into society. The story focuses on Mob and how he tries his best to control his powers and not cause any harm, while being in very risky situations. The story may seem a bit simplistic at first, and near the beginning it kind of is, but the series starts to get more complex and explores many themes like morality and what it means to be different. But the story just doesn\u2019t focus on Mob, but also other characters too, like his mentor (who is a scammer) and his brother (who has an inferiority complex). At first the series has more of an episode/slice-of-life structure, but in the second half, the main story gets introduced. And also, a lot of the omake chapters from the manga got adapted, so you\u2019ll be seeing some short stories revolving around Reigen and Mob throughout the series. The overall story doesn\u2019t really end, since the manga is ongoing, but the final arc of this series wraps up nicely, while teasing what\u2019s next to come. Hopefully it gets a second season to continue the series. \\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 looks and feels a lot different from your normal anime. The style is very over-the-top, exaggerated and weird, and it matches the tone of the series. It\u2019s supposed to be weird and quirky and its style isn\u2019t something you will see often. But the series just isn\u2019t a comedy as it is more than that. There are a good amount of moments in the series when things get a lot more serious and emotional. Unlike One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 expects you to take them seriously. However, they are handled in such a way that you as a viewer are aware that things aren\u2019t being played for jokes anymore. The series switches between its tones very well and not once did it ever feel drastic. The art style is quite unique too, and that will be mentioned later in this review. Bones did a good job in adapting the manga, though it\u2019s not the most perfect adaptation I\u2019ve come to expect from a studio like them. Near the middle of the series, the pacing got a little fast and the buildup was a slight bit underwhelming. And too many unnecessary omake chapters are adapted and they ruin the flow of the series. But those are only minor gripes to what is an outstanding anime.  \\n\r\nPresentation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nWhat is probably the most impressive and surprising thing about Mob Psycho 100 is its characters. For those who were expecting another One Punch Man, were probably shocked at how well-written the characters are. Even as a One Punch Man fanboy myself, even I admit that most of the characters in One Punch Man aren\u2019t really complex, they\u2019re just fun and entertaining. Mob, our protagonist, starts off as an apathetic school boy who\u2019s wants to fit in, but can\u2019t due to his powers. He\u2019s much more complex and well written than he seems. He can\u2019t express his emotions because releasing them releases his powers. He doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone with his powers, but accidents do happen. He has a hard time in deciding what\u2019s right and wrong or whether he should be selfish or selfless. The way he\u2019s handled is amazing. Then we have Mob\u2019s con-man mentor, Reigen. He may start off to be a little irritating, but his character is used well during comedic situations. And he\u2019s more than what he seems too. Then we have Mob\u2019s brother, Ritsu, who is also handled really well and his character change is believable. And there\u2019s a bunch of side characters that are all used well for comic relief. \\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to realize that Mob Psycho 100 has a really, really unique art style. ONE was never a good artist and his web manga don\u2019t look too good. Mob Psycho 100 was his best looking work, yet a lot of the panels can look cruddy or unorganized. However, this crude art added to the style of the series. Bones manages to adapt the art of the manga, while making it visually appealing. The crude look of the manga is still in the anime, but things look more detailed and organized. The zany art style adds to the comedic moments, and feels stylish during its action sequences. The backgrounds are pretty well done too. The character models look really unique, though they all have similar faces, just like the web manga. The art isn\u2019t the most detailed, but doing so would ruin the style. However, the lighting and colors used in the series and the shadows are really well done. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s nothing that interests you in Mob Psycho 100, there\u2019s always the stellar animations. Simply put, it\u2019s the most well animated TV anime series I\u2019ve seen, and yes, it\u2019s better than One Punch Man. When I mean better, I mean that it is more fluid. Since the art style isn\u2019t incredibly detailed, this lets the animators makes the animations as smooth as possible. During big fights, characters will be going all over the place and destruction would be happening very fluidly. The cinematography is also stellar and the way it moves during fights is very stylish. Sometimes the fights can feel overwhelming, due to how much is happening on the screen. And Bones extended most of the fights and made them longer, so they can have some more eye-candy visuals. \\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast do a great job in doing the comic relief and executing the more dramatic moments. Mob\u2019s seiyuu, Itou Setsuo, has barely done any voice acting before, as he only did one supporting role before and this is his first main role. But he doesn\u2019t sound like a newbie at all as he does an excellent job as Mob. He gets the apathetic tone of his voice right, but he really shines when he has to add emotions to Mob. He does his angry voice really well and his seiyuu delivers during emotional scenes too. Sakurai Takahiro (who is doing a lot of voice acting recently) does Reigen and he does him perfectly. It\u2019s well known that Sakurai\u2019s a really talented seiyuu and he gives all he\u2019s got as Reigen. He makes his character absurd, wacky, deceiving, and truly hilarious. Irino Miyu does a very good job as Ritsu and gets his emotional and strong-willed personality right. Matsuoka Yoshitsugu\u2019s really at his best when he does supporting characters and him as Teruki was a perfect choice. And all of the other seiyuu also do a good job in what they have to do. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Mob Psycho 100 is also really good and adds to the already amazing series. The OP, \"99\", is really good and catchy and I don\u2019t need to say much about how the lyrics are quite matching for a series like this. Never did I thought that counting up to 100 could be so fun and addicting. The ED, \"Refrain Boy\u201d, is also very good and it really matches the dramatic aspect of the series. The vocals, the lyrics and the music is great in that ED. The background music is also really good in the series, particularly the ones used during fights. The add more to the tension and make things more fun. The music used during a fight in the fifth episode was particularly good. \\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI knew I was going to enjoy Mob Psycho before it even aired. I really loved the web manga and the fact that Bones was going to animate it makes the chances of the anime being a good adaptation really high. And Bones surely did deliver. Though some of the omake chapters getting adapted ruined the flow, everything else was done perfectly well. The characters are really well developed and really well handled. They ended up being more complex than they originally seemed. The story itself is really good and manages to keep you interested most of the time. The way the humor and the seriousness is blended together makes sure that none of the tonal shifts feel jarring. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have this much fun again in a long time. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you haven\u2019t checked out Mob Psycho 100 yet, then seriously, what are you doing? This is the most fun you\u2019ll probably have this year, and it\u2019s not wise to skip on it. Even those who didn\u2019t like One Punch Man should definitely check this out because it\u2019s quite a different anime and it\u2019s much more complex than it originally seems. The characters are well developed and handled excellently. Mob\u2019s struggle to make the right choices is presented fantastically. The art style is unique and adds to the wackiness. But most importantly, the animations are simply stunning and some of the best I\u2019ve seen. Mob Psycho has all the ingredients to make an amazing anime and uses all of its potential. Mob Psycho 100 is easily a candidate for anime of the year, and if you haven\u2019t checked it out yet, you should do so soon. \\n\\n\r\n+ Handles its characters well and Mob is a really realistically done and complex character.\\n\r\n+ Amazing direction and conveys the style of the web manga perfectly. \\n\r\n+ Very unique art style and mind-blowing animations during major fights.\\n\r\n+ Properly blends its humor and wackiness with its emotional and dramatic scene.\\n\r\n+ Premise is simple, but the execution is really well done and the story starts to evolve in the second half.\\n\r\n- Pacing was a little fast in the middle and the adapted omake chapters break the flow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.1/10",

            "content": "As soon you hear the track \"99\" by MOB CHOIR, and see the amazing visuals from the OP, you immediately get the sense that this is going to be something special, it\u2019s nothing short of the hype. From the creator that brought you the 2015 sensation in \u201cOne Punch Man,\u201d Mob Psycho 100 has definitely helped cement the author ONE\u2019s position among the top creators of today, due to his trademark style; of creative storytelling, artistic flair and the knack for writing genuine, gut-busting comedy. Although there are similarities between the two, Mob Psycho 100 has its own identity and far from a carbon copyand paste.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the writing itself, it\u2019s fairly easy with both works to get caught up in the notion that these are gimmick series\u2014seemingly reliant on a hook to be interesting, e.g., defeating anyone with one punch, unleashing full power when emotion levels reach 100% etc.  What you realize with both series\u2014more so with Mob Psycho 100\u2014is that when paying attention to both the story being told visually and the story being told by the script, there\u2019s a lot of depth and subtlety to what ONE is doing. The madcap surrealism is important, but so are the characters and the social commentary. Everything about the main character asks the questions\u2014which are raised throughout different arcs and points of views\u2014that ultimately fall under one of the main themes of the story: with great power, comes great responsibility. In addition, other themes and core messages conveyed include empathy, integrity, self-control, self-reflection, perseverance, and courage. There is more than meets the eye with Mob Psycho 100\u2019s writing; the more you dig, the more you find.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why Mob Psycho 100 feels as special as it is\u2014when you get past all the visual brilliance, you\u2019re still left with an amazingly riveting story playing out on screen. This is a deeply human story that effectively melds all the pubertal symbolism and universality of emotion with the fantastical premise. The relationships in this series are both complex and compelling and defy easy categorization. None of them and none of the characters fall neatly into the pigeonholes we create for them based on first appearances\u2014there are always layers and sides there which only reveal themselves over the course of development. There are many things that contribute to the success of the show, but the main course is the characters, especially the main protagonist, Shigeo \u201cMob\u201d Kageyama, as well as his mentor and the highlight reel of the show's hilarity, Arataka Reigen. Their relationship defines good character chemistry seeing how much they have influenced each other throughout with this master-and-student type of bond. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Mob admires Reigen deeply, he doesn\u2019t realize that he is responsible behind other characters changing for the better. This is the case with Dimple, Teruki Hanazawa and Ritsu. It is very humbling to see an all-powerful person putting aside what makes him special and refusing to take advantage of others. Even Shinji Kamuro or Tenga Onigawara saw their character arcs fulfilled once they saw the error in their ways. They seem to be very minor players at first but they keep turning up, proving themselves to be important to the story, especially Ritsu. And of course, that the initial read we get on most of the cast is usually wrong or at the very least incomplete. It\u2019s a story that punishes jumping to conclusions and superficial judgments, and that can apply in any number of different ways. One of the effects of that, I think, is that it makes the lack of guile in Mob stand out that much more\u2014and all of this is ingeniously brought out in the casting.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, there are a lot of intriguing dynamics between the characters. Mob and Ritsu have this great misunderstanding of each other that plays into both characters growth. Reigen is a wonderful contradiction, a charismatic charlatan, yet someone who gives Mob the soundest possible advice and mentorship he gets from nowhere else\u2014he is Mob\u2019s moral compass and somehow, he usually manages to point him true North. These character dynamics and contrast go back to that theme that is famously said by Peter Parker\u2019s Uncle Ben. Reigen is the only one who tells Mob what he wants to believe in his heart is true. That he\u2019s a good person, that his powers don\u2019t make him special, that he not only doesn\u2019t have to hurt anyone but that he absolutely has a duty not to. Time after time when Mob is in darkness, Reigen pulls him back. These messages are very relatable for growing adolescents. \\n\\n\r\nAnd when you have such rich, multi-layered characters and dynamics, the comedy has a lot more authenticity behind it. Mob Psycho 100 is also, one of the funniest shows I have watched and it does a remarkable job of keeping things fresh and unexpected. No joke is overused, it\u2019s not a one-trick pony that is desperately hanging on a gimmick for cheap laughs, rather it uses escalation, gradually building up the events of the show while keeping a steady stream of the funnies. This makes punchlines, slapstick, gags and references feel unadulterated, earned and definitely more hilarious. Not only is the comedy more authentic but so is the action, what\u2019s to appreciate\u2014as much as the glorious way they\u2019re animated\u2014is how the big action sequences in Mob Psycho are character-driven. Like Hunter X Hunter, it features stupendous fight sequences at infrequent intervals, and never dishes up a throwaway\u2014all the fights are organic to the story and full of subtext when it comes to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the production of Mob Psycho 100, believe the hype. It soared to heights of sakuga that the best of the industry can produce. It seems almost unfair how different things are for premier studios like Bones. Not only does Yuzuru Tachikawa have the money he needs, but he can also call on the talents of guys like Yutaka Nakamura, Norio Matsumoto and Yoshimichi Kameda when episodes call for that extra dose of visual flash. The sheer brilliance of the cinematography is flawless, shot composition, special effects, the signature retro-neon-lights colour scheme and animation that is reminiscent of FLCL, Kill la Kill and OPM, turn these high-octane battle sequences into jaw-dropping spectacles. The visual gags, the character designs, the background art all play towards the creative aesthetics and humour of the show. The biggest showpieces in the series are reserved for when Mob\u2019s Emotional Meter reaches 100% and that is exactly when studio Bones are firing on all cylinders.\\n\\n\r\nNo less important was the score. The soundtrack was composed by Kenji Kawai, and it\u2019s probably one of his best works in recent years, it is instrumental focused. He is amazingly good at composing unsettling and mysterious melodies, most notably the signature theme when Mob goes berserk. As stated previously, \u201c99\u201d is outstanding and one of the best song choices for an OP I have heard as it perfectly sets the mood for both the show and the audience. It was originally written and performed by a choir formed by staff members of studio Bones and features trippy visuals that even reference future manga events. The ED, \u201cRefrain Boy\u201d by All Off was entirely made by Miyo Sato\u2019s paint-on-glass technique. The voice acting is some of the best, the way they performed made for more memorable characters, more believable personalities, the witty dialogue and comedic moments all the better.\\n\\n\r\nAs compared to its older brother OPM, Mob Psycho 100 is less a genre satire and social commentary and much more a character study and coming-of-age story\u2014and in many ways quite a conventional one. Mob\u2019s Esper powers are the MacGuffin in the premise, but it\u2019s the impact they have on him and others more than the powers themselves that matter. It\u2019s not a series about a ridiculously strong person who can one-shot anyone with psychic powers, but a highly symbolic take on adolescence, about a kid realizing that having a special ability does not make him better or worse than others with a whole lot of wildly imaginative fantasy and visual experimentation as the vehicle to get it where it\u2019s going. I am pumped for what studio Bones has in store for us with the sequel airing very shortly.\\n",

            "content": "Hype has always been a double-edged sword, Mob Psycho 100 (I\u2019ll use the abbreviation MP100 for the following) and One Punch Man (OPM) being an almost perfect example of that exact statement. MP100 never got that much attention since it started airing in the Summer Season 2016, being outclassed in popularity by shows like Orange, Shokugeki no Souma S2 and the ongoing Re:Zero in that respect, at least at the start of Summer season. It was never hyped as \u2018the best thing evar\u2019, nor did it receive much negative backlash because of that. Unlike MP100\u2019s relative lack of popularity, the author's other work One PunchMan did get flooded by it, scoring points with similar style and humour, but in a more straight-forward and 'blockbuster-like' way. While I think the hype and also the following negative backlash that OPM hit was a little excessive, MP100 does not deserve to stand in OPM\u2019s shadow, as it offers new ideas and a more creative story than One Punch Man does, hinting and actually executing several thematical aspects decently, giving the show a unique identity despite the similarities.\\n\r\nPossible MINOR SPOILERS can be encountered while reading this review, although I will try to avoid diving into the plot any more than it is really necessary.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho\u2019s story follows the seemingly mundane daily life of our protagonist Shigeo Kageyama, called \u2018Mob\u2019 during the series, with exceptional psychic power, nowhere near to be matched by any other character in the story at first. However, Mob has a problem we all have during Middle School, namely troubles in finding himself, his true strength, goals, and love in life. He seeks help from someone who can understand his problems he has with his uncontrollable psychic powers and lost purpose in his life and finds it in his master and fake spirit-exorcist and con-artist Reigen Arataka, who surprisingly is quite a bit of help for Mob\u2019s problems.\\n\\n\r\nWhen reading the synopsis it is virtually impossible to not think of ONE's more famous work, ringing a bell more than just about three times for people familiar with OPM's protagonist Saitama, which not even only share a lot of connection when scrolling through the main description, but their stature as well, yelling the word \"average\" out loud. Contrary to their initial looks, both shows feature an overpowered protagonist in its own right, both seek for appreciation, but fail to do so. If MP100 is able to develop its own identity and tries to not harp on the same (now pretty old) joke that OPM successfully capitalized on, remained an incredible big question mark in my mind, even after watching the first episode. However, I was incredibly surprised by how more unique the show got from episode to episode, seemingly increasing the quality constantly, which might also be caused by their exceptional build-up for another. Additionally, the story does not rely on the 'baseline-joke' for being funny, making it a more colorful and overall a little more enjoyable viewing experience in contrast to One Punch Man.\\n\\n\r\nDescribing how it felt watching and analyzing the overall events and themes is a really difficult one, to begin with. The closest thing I could think of to summarize it rather compactly is 'One Punch Man meets Yuasa'. The witty humour, quirky, expressive style and characters rich in contrast getting mixed up with the popular coming-of-age story in its essence definitely gets covered and presented very similarly by the famous director and undeniable genius Yuasa himself, who was responsible for works like 'Ping Pong' and 'Tatami Galaxy'. That being said, while it definitely isn\u2019t as good as the previous works, watching the first few episodes, it felt similar to some extent. Character/Thematic exploration isn't the main aspect of MP100 though since it's main focus is still on the action and thrown-in comedic elements, which works perfectly in its balanced combination, where off-timed comedy was a real rarity. It's more of a subtle reminder from time to time, but that does not feel forced in any way and only complements the specific style Mob Psycho beholds. At one point in the second half, I had the feeling the show would drift into the typical Shounen genericism like most shows do these days after initially promising starting episodes and would solve any problem in an uncreative manner, but I was utterly mistaken by how the show evolved afterwards, choosing an unexpected and yet fun way to bring the story further, leaving problems to be dealt with by the characters longer than to be expected, utilizing this said length to offer more thought-out and conclusive solutions to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe script itself can be seen as rather mediocre and does not expand on several aspects which could\u2019ve been dealt with in a deeper way and sometimes takes a little strange approach on flashing out different storylines like they did with the members of the student council. However, a ground-breaking script has never been the intention of MP100 in the first place and it certainly doesn\u2019t need one. The presentation is what makes the show what it is, a fun ride and lovable ride from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the presentation, the art style complements the storytelling and overall atmosphere splendidly, being yet another display of skill by the Animation-studio Bones. As the appeal of the show might not come through on the first episode, you\u2019ll surely develop a liking towards the unusual and kinda trippy art style while watching it, complementing the overall atmosphere splendidly. In terms of fluent and simultaneously creative Animation, Bones flexes their muscles another time, with the Animation almost earning itself the adjective 'perfect'. Nothing looks stiff and the fight scenes are unbelievably (!) well animated, making me wonder about how much budget they had actually spend. The backgrounds sometimes feel unlively, but as I\u2019ve already stated it doesn\u2019t bug me in the slightest and even adds to its overall unusual appeal.\\n\\n\r\nAnother appeal the show truly has on its side is the characters with their quirky, sometimes over-the-top and sometimes pretty humble appearance. It seems ONE has already made himself a trademark with making his overpowered as hell protagonist to look as plain as possible in comparison to everyone else. Mob is another prime example of that, basically having Saitama\u2019s design, but instead being of bald, he has the good ol' classic bowl-cut. Side characters like Teruki after the epic change in hairstyle, the bully of the 90's impersonation Onigawara and the 'Body Improvement Club' offer a good contrast to the modest appearance of all the other students, while the evil spirits obviously are still in a whole other league in terms of peculiar design compared to them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is written with a capital S in MP100, hence the characters don\u2019t feel dull at all, even incorporating actually subtle hints on which their development is based on, which is very true for Mob-kun himself. That being said, not every development has been executed successfully, mainly thinking of Mob\u2019s younger brother Shigeo. I acknowledge that his inferiority complex to Mob gets set-up decently, however, the actions which he decides to take and battle his inferiority seemed kinda forced to me, especially with the student council evolving in \u2018Gestapo 2.0\u2019, which was one of the weirdest things ever. It even breaks the loose boundaries MP100 set for itself, getting a little too eccentric, just thinking about how it would feel like in even little more down to earth show in terms of presentation would blow my mind. Also, he still remains rather shallow for all the development he gets during the series, making him be a mediocre character and a little let-down overall.\\n\r\nMuch on the contrary, Mob\u2019s development is executed well and doesn\u2019t seem artificial in any way. He gets influenced by both his master Reigen and his environment, having him to make decisions about his future, while he still doesn\u2019t know what he genuinely wants to do. This makes for some truly hilarious moments in his interactions with other characters, like for example his thought-process behind which club to join at school.\\n\\n\r\nOther side characters are likable in their own right, however, there\u2019s nothing too noteworthy about them. Also, while I did make this statement regarding the side characters in general, I'm screaming 'OBJECTION!' internally while saying this. Why? Because of Mob\u2019s master Reigen, who is just too damn hilarious and the best addition to MP100\u2019s witty and eccentric style in general, lifting the general appreciation I hold for MP100's characters by a lot all by himself. He almost always ends up as the top-pick in likeability for people completed the series, because even though he is absolutely unskilled in the arts of spirit exorcism which he pretends to teach his student Mob, he manages to raise Mob\u2019s self-esteem and courage in his actions, truly able to take over the role of a mentor for Mob.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values for this show are top-notch, so not only the Animation is fantastic, but also the department taking care of the sound did a magnificent job. The OP/ED are fantastic earworms, the OP even able to snatch a place in my top 10. Additionally, the soundtrack is of overall high quality, leaving me waiting the OST finally gets released, to look up a certain track which gets played during fight scenes, giving me One Punch Man vibes all over again.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 definitely takes the cake for me this Summer season, earning itself the title \u2018Anime of the Season\u2019 rightfully. Refreshing style, quirky characters, witty jokes, Reigen\u2019s special moves, great production values and overall solid, simple storytelling mixed with subtle thematic exploration make this Anime to what I consider a must-see for fans of the genre and skeptics alike. While it does have certain flaws regarding the script and some strange decision-making by key-characters, they remain rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things, maybe solely due to the magnificent entertainment-value Mob Psycho offers in its runtime.\\n\\n\r\nSo now it\u2019s time to say farewell with an ANTI ESPER-DROPKICK! Have fun with Mob Psycho!\\n\\n\r\nStory (6.5/10)\\n\r\nArt (9/10), Animation (9.5/10)\\n\r\nSound (8.5/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)",

            "content": "When I went into Mob Psycho 100, the only thing I tried to expect was that I'd be watching a good comedy series paired with good action. We all know that One is a competent writer, but I decided that comparing this series' quality to One Punch Man would most likely be unfair. Little did I realize that this series would not only match the quality of One Punch Man, but add the things I felt were missing in it. Now even though I didn't want to compare this series to One Punch Man, I'll be doing a fair bit of that inthis review, because I know anybody checking this review will be curious how it looks next to it. \\n\\n\r\n  One obviously made the decision when writing Mob Psycho 100 to have this series take itself a little more seriously. Because of this, I feel the characters are a lot more fleshed out than One Punch Man. We have serious character building arcs in this series, something I didn't expect in the slightest. Another refreshing thing is that (in my opinion) Shigeo isn't much like Saitama. Sure, he's overpowered, but he doesn't have much of Saitama's irreverence. Despite the series revolvling around Shigeo being emotionless, I feel he cares quite a bit. But this series doesn't just focus on him. For the most part, the entire cast gets some time to shine. Aside from Shigeo, the characters I feel stood out the most are Reigen, Ritsu, and Hanazawa. This series is not lacking at all in the character department. \\n\\n\r\n The artstyle to me came off like a mix of One Punch Man, and an adult swim late-night cartoon. It was trippy in all the right ways at times, and it's animation style lended itself to some great matches. The characters may not be as sharp looking as a series from Trigger or Gainax, but I feel I enjoy One's style just as much as those studios. It's also very consistent. I can't recall anytime I thought the animation looked poor. I think because they went with the exact style the manga must have, it made that very easy to accomplish. It's only flashy when it needs to be.\\n\\n\r\n The storyline among other things is about our protagonist's emotions and how much he conceals his powers. It's hard to describe it in depth without spoiling, but I can say they accomplish what they were going for very well. \\n\\n\r\n I believe that Mob Psycho 100 is the greatest anime of 2016. Not only did (in my opinion) it surpass One Punch Man in quality, but it also surpassed many of the series that I didn't think would be topped this year. I like this series so much in fact, it's surpassed many of my long time favorite series, and is currently number one on my profile. I can't give Mob Psycho 100 anything but a strong 10.",

            "content": "Living by the shadow of One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 is probably the best anime that aired this season.  People are always complaining about how anime is always the same: boys that can travel back in time, tsundere protagonists or MMORPG worlds.\r\nMob Psycho 100 tells the story of an overpowered boy who doesn't know he's overpowered.  About a boy that doesn't feel special just because he has powers.  He instead wants to become more popular and more fitting to other humans.  \r\nStory 10/10\r\nI thought MP100 was similar to OPM since the protagonists is an overpowered esper that can deal withalmost any evil spirit.  But after some episodes, the anime tells you the story of an underdog.  A guy who doesn't feel special just because he can defeat spirits.  He is a humble boy who wants to be better in other ways.   Mob is in love with a girl and he wants to impress her, but he knows his powers are not the way to impress a girl.  Mob is given the opportunity to join the \"esper club\" but he is not interested in that.  In conclusion, Mob is a boy who wants to overcome his own insecurities that happens to be a powerful esper.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are so funny and likeable.  Apart from Mob, we have Reigen (Mob's master), Ritsu (Mob's brother) , Dimple and some other characters that join later.  The story takes a lot of comedy twists and they totally work.  Reigen is a smart con man that always knows how to deal with every situation.  Also, he's very caring towards Mob.  Ritsu is a boy who feels overshadowed by his brother, but learns to overcome that during the plot development.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is impressive.  The fights look so damn great and epic.  Contrary to OPM, real fights actually happen and they look fine! The music is astonishing and the opening is not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 has a lot of perks: good animation, good story, good character development and it also comes as one of the best comedy shows out there.  If you liked One Punch Man, you will absolutely love Mob Psycho 100.  If not, I feel like Mob Psycho 100 can get a place in your heart.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 was LA's favourite anime of Summer 2016 and really it pulled it off, bringing in a two for two for ONE, the creator of One Punch Man, so what made Mob Psycho 100 another great like One Punch Man?, well it's a bit complicated to say the least...let's find out.\r\nMob Psycho 100 looks at both the stress of the youth, superiority and inferiority complexes and the look at how having powers isn't what is all that is cracked up to be...which is also becoming something of a trend these days like Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan this season to. Mob Psycho 100 allwraps this up under the notion of Kageyama Shigeo (a.k.a. \"Mob\") voiced by Setsuo Itou who holds his psychic power under check unless he literally explodes it in any manner of varying emotions and trying to find meaning in his ironically normal life.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100's plot pacing (and comedic timing) just feels like an bomb explosion with setup, exposition and character development as the long thread that is lit, Mob Psycho 100 for as much as a rather ironic anime (main protagonist suppressing his powers) it still has some profound meaning and character development which helps make this anime more than a typical shounen anime. Mob Psycho 100 isn't as much as a deconstruction of being a superpowered human like One Punch Man as it is a coming of age and \"what youth does to you\" and for the shounen element side of things, \"power isn't everything, be it if your a villain or a superpowered normy\".\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, we have our comedic foils to the main protagonist like the con-man mentor of Arataka Reigen voiced by Takahiro Sakurai to more serious characters like Ritsu voiced by Miyu Irino, Mob's little brother and Dimple voiced by Akio Ootsuka an evil spirit turned Mob's \"spiritual advisor\" with all his evil intentions still intact, don't worry he gets better. There was also Teruki Hanazawa voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka a rival to Mob who abuses his psychic powers, again he gets better. If there was a character who got the most development, it would go to both Mob and Ritsu as their developments were polar opposites in terms of how they used their powers and how they deal with their stress. Unfortunately, Mob Psycho 100's minor cast are cliche or support like Mob's love interest Tsubomi voiced by Uki Satake to the purist with evil intentions student council president Shinji Kamuro voiced by Kouji Yusa and Tome Kurata voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki the club leader of the Telepathy Club and just a slacker like the rest of club members. Overall, as much as the minor cast members were support, they at least somewhat helped move the pot forward, even indirectly. Where Mob Psycho 100's strengths comes in is in the majority of the main cast (Mob, Reigen, Ritsu, Hanazawa and Dimple) as they do get the majority of the screentime. What's better is that these character's chemistry as bizarrely disjointed they are, they actually meld together, be it comedically or dramatically (or more precisely be a catalyst to Mob's varying \"100%\" emotions). LA's favourite character easily goes to Reigen by the end of the anime, which comes unexpectedly for LA as LA just went with Mob due his badassness.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Studio Bones if anything was an experiment in the uncanny comic styling, LA can't quite put it into detail, but the animation is uncanny, but visually it makes it stand out for it's uniqueness. Where does the animation shine?...well when Mob uses his psychic powers (a la once he reaches 100%)...it is utterly GLORIOUS to the point and it's not only in Mob's battles, the battle scenes in general are GLORIOUSLY AMAZING, sure it's uncanny but it's unique to as the least. LA will say that Mob Psycho 100 was the best animation for Summer 2016.  \\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 goes into a more serious plotline further down the line and really, LA thought it compensated for the somewhat slow beginning and more meaningful episodes about youth to ramp it up by the last half by focusing more on a serious plot with numerous battles to test Mob and his \"friends\", and really it is a good compensation by the latter half, with less on the meaningful look at those with superpowers and youth to some awesome battles and sure you can complain that Mob would quite easily take down the threat that arose in the serious plotline and you'd be right...and wrong. Right as Mob can easily take down the \"strongest\" foe without trying, but mentally, he's a bit different from the typical \"OP protagonist\". Overall the serious plotline is a nice bonus to have and really it's just pointing out that Mob Psycho 100 ironically is having fun by making a serious plotline with some bombastic battles left, right and centre. This serious toned plotline however gets quickly back to it's tone in the earlier episodes once Reigen appears as well as make a realistic impression on the \"evil\" Claw 7th Division. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as this anime has contexts of being an \"OP main protagonist anime\", yes it is but it's one where the main protagonist knows about his own power and always tries to suppress it unless as a last resort to, if anything Mob Psycho 100 is a deconstruction of THIS trope and really we WANT to see Mob reach 100% and see him go batshit crazy with his powers which makes the \"OP main protagonist anime\" pitfalls almost nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, you'd kinda expect LA to bash the voice acting for it's rather lackluster voice acting especially coming from Mob himself voiced by Setsuo Itou, but you realize that he's SUPPOSE to repress his emotions to keep his emotions via powers in check. This diverse voice cast goes all over the board in terms of vocal toning and really LA actually enjoyed the voice acting VERY much, LA's favourite voice actor goes to  Takahiro Sakurai as the con-man Reigen for MANY reasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was unexpected to say to least and LA wasn't really expecting the \"big finale\" that One Punch Man did, sure it did a very cool \"final battle\" but the \"ending result\" was unexpected to say the least and ended as \"anti-climatically\" but LA didn't care. Firstly Mob Psycho 100 isn't the same as One Punch Man, secondly, it kinda the expected tone Mob Psycho 100 to have, it's not anti-climatic to say but it's was a great way to resolve the \"serious tone\" and still be \"Mob Psycho 100\". Sure the ending still has one plot thread that it brings up hinting at a second season, but for what this ending did, it was still greatly satisfying as much as it had an \"anti-climax\" final battle.\\n\\n\r\nLA said it before at the start of this review, Mob Psycho 100 was LA's favourite anime of Summer 2016 and it really shows, if One Punch Man was the thing for you, then Mob Psycho 100 is also a definite watch even if the anime is completely different from One Punch man with it's own meaning and collapse of \"superiority and power\" as well as \"youth and the stress of it all\" and of course, Mob Psycho 100's uncanny animation that was just utterly unique in the season 2016.",

            "content": "Wow... trying to come up with a compelling first sentence sure is hard... I'll just take a moment to myself before I start.\r\n...97, 98, 99, 100... *BOOM*\r\nStory: \r\nIf you're familiar with the original artist, you can basically guess that the story will be good. Mob psycho was no exeption. It doesn't have a clear plotline from the start (Though we do get that later) and has an episodic structure. For me, the story didn't really strike untill episode 6, when we actually get to the \u201dreal\u201d plot.\r\n\tThe story itself is very comical, filled with crazy situations and eastereggs for the audience to pick up. Butthat's not all the show has to offer, Mob psycho varies very smoothly from those comic situations to the deeper moments, inner dilemmas with the characters and the action sequences that were purely amazing. The comedy itself, is very \u201dONE\u201d if that makes sense. Simple, not too forced, though that depends greatly on your own sense of humor.\\n\r\n\tI would have loved giving Mob psycho a full 10 on the story, but the fact that the story took half of it's run time to really get the plot going, is something I can't ignore, so from story, i give it \\n\r\n8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is something that strikes me everytime, I've hear people dropping this show because of it's art. Fine, I can see, why people would dislike the art, but for me it was not the case.\\n\r\nFor me the art was amazing. Taken what the manga looks like, the animation was executed nearly perfectly. On the cheerful/comical moments the animation stays simple, harsh like the original material, but oh my God when it's time to battle, let me tell you, they pull all the stops. While sticking to its rather rough appearense, it manages to make the fight scenes flow smoothly, filled with epicness. It's very hard to describe. \\n\r\nFor me, the art was solid \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'll be honest. Other than the opening and ending songs, I don't remember much of the soundtrack. What I do remember is that one electrical riff that plays everytime shit is about to get real. But honesty, I don't think I have to remember anything else. \\n\r\n\tThe opening and ending songs fitted the show nicely, the opening gave me an exiting, explosive vibe, and the ending was a nice calm counter measure for that. \\n\r\n\tBut the fact that nothing else but those three stuck with me, bothers me so much, that I can't give the sound a full score, even though those three were on point. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMuch like the artist previous masterpiece, One punch man, Mob psycho has a rather large cast, but thankfully, the series doensn't even try to focuse on all of the. So for this review, I could point out 3 characters that get the most screentime and development, also known as the main characters. If you don't want to read those, my point is, that the cast is very much amazing, the characters (atleast the main 3) have development and each have their own psychological dilemmas to deal with, though some more than the others, but still, it's there.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama \u201dMob\u201d Shigeo: Mob, the obvious protagonist of the series. He is calm and collective, blank faced psychic user, though at times shy and a little naive teenage boy, so nothing we haven't seen before. For me, the most fascinating part of him, was to see the contrast of his character, how he could go from a wimpy goody-two-shoes character to a psychic rage monster in a matter of seconds. That gave some more sides to him, including his inner dilemma, not wanting to hurt anyone, but at the same time not being able to control himself.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama Ritsu: Mobs little brother, whom I unfortunately can't speak too much without going to spoilerific territory. Lets just say, he's the ideal brother character. Honorable student, polite to everyone and looks up to his older brother. Personally Ritsu was my favourite character in the show, atleast after episode 6, when they actually started to develop his character, (and boy did they develop) and the direction it took.  \\n\\n\r\nReigen Arataka: Mobs boss, a con artist, who runs an exorcism business. Do I have to say more? To me Reigen was a very interesting character. Jack of all trades, master of none. Being verbally skilled and a tad melodramatic, he managed to pull off quite the amazing show. And after those couple last episodes I would just like to do a quick salute by saying \u201dReigen, u da real mvp!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThere would be a couple of more characters that I could mention, but I won't.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the show must have seen through the whole review, but I'm going to say it once more. I definelty enjoyed Mob psycho 100. The fact that the plot started only halfway did bother me a bit, but taken that I still managed to like the first half, because if I truly hadn't liked it, I wouldn't have continued watching. So, being a generous person, I'm going to forgive the show for that. \\n\r\n\tONE has a habit of putting over powered characters in his series, and honesty I'm more than fine with that. For one, I happen to enjoy watching an op character go on a full on rampage much more than those where the main character struggles till the very end and then  manages to win because of \u201dthe power of friendship\u201d or something like that.  \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMob psycho 100 is a great show, with funny moments, deep thoughts and more than anything, epic battles, and I could easily recommend this show to anyone. \\n\r\nThe avarage that I got was 9 points, but I still decided to give it the grade of 10, because I think it truly deserves it.",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 is based off of a manga by ONE. Yes, the same manga artist behind One Punch Man. The anime came out last year and was brought to us by Bones. Yes, the Soul Eater, Heroman, Wolf's Rain, etc... Studio. So, is this one okay like One Punch Man, better or worse? \r\nStory:\r\nMob is a young man with psychic powers. His master, Reigen, is a con artist who pretends to have psychic abilities. Together, they get paid to go out and exorcise spirits. Shenanigans ensue and Mob's counter raises towards 100. What will happen when it goes all the way up? Will Mobever find others like himself? Will he ever discover that his master is a fraud?\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is the comedy. A lot of it is either really obvious or just random nonsense. There are very few funny moments to be found. The whole narrative is also similar to One Punch Man in that it likes to build up some kind of confrontation for Mob, but then he settles it with relative ease once he gets worked up enough to actually fight. The big difference is that it's considerably less competent here. \\n\\n\r\nThe best I can say about the story is that it has its occasional moment. It has a few funny scenes and some more serious parts that are pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this fall woefully short. Mob is mainly defined by being thick. His brother's main feature is his mix of admiration and jealousy towards Mob for his amazing psychic powers. There are a couple scenes that showcase the dynamic between Mob and Reigen that come close to making it decent. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork does have some good and bad elements. On one hand, a lot of the psychic power scenes are pretty visually creative. On the other hand, the character designs are boring and lazy. The backgrounds are usually weak and a lot of the action sequences are weakened by being a bit of a hard to follow mess. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that suffers from extremes in the acting. You get a lot of characters being really exaggerated and a lot of actors sounding completely uninvested. Itou Setsuo especially. There isn't much in terms of middle ground that allows the cast to show that they can actually act. Kawai Kenji's soundtrack for this isn't bad. It's not good either. It's a pretty average work. His tracks for Bakuretsu Hunters and Ghost in the Shell were definitely better. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any. The most we get in terms of romance is Mob having a crush on the most easily impressed girl ever. Which is weird because we only see her talk with her in flashback and even then it's about five lines. I guess when you're a dullard that's enough to create a fixation. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100  is pretty stupid, and not in an entertaining way. The story is dumb. The jokes are largely unfunny, stupid humour. The characters are morons. It's certainly not on par with One Punch Man and, frankly, it's the worst thing I've reviewed by Bones. If you liked One Punch Man you may want to give it an episode or two. Maybe it'll work better for you than it did for me. But, for myself, I give it a 3/10. Next week I'll look at Tales of Zestiria the X.",

I mean, it's really interesting to see how to show develops into a more character focused story and throws away your expectations of what you thought It would be like, even the big plots didn't turn out like you thought.\r\nArt - 9.5. I really loved the art, kinda reminded me of Soul Eater, avery loose and flexibel art-style that makes bad animation not really look that bad, and the parts where the animation shined, you could really tell they put alot of work to it, really well done!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8? I didn't really pay much attention to the soundtracks sadly, Ending theme > Opening theme though!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9.5. At first sight the main protaganist is a lame, booring, normal, casual child who seems kinda \"emotion-less?\" but as the show progresses you can see a wide and clear development which makes me so happy, spot on work.  The side- characters were extremely interesting to me at least the master, aswell as the brother. Well done!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10.9? :D. It's just pure entertainment which we are all here to see, a great show with perfect phasing in my opinion. 100% recommend to all who just want to see good entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10. It's just a so well made show that I can't put anything else then a 10. (YES THE START IS SLOW BUT WHEN IS IT NOT?)",

            "content": "[7.0/10]\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nMob Psycho 100 - Wacky, decisive, entertaining, subversive, and occasionally funny. With the constant influx of Shounen anime that pours out of the pores of the industry, you'd expect that a plethora of parodies would release every season. But no, for some reason parody is kind of rare. Even shows marketed as parody, like KonoSuba rarely actually do any substantial and biting parodying. While Mob Psycho doesn't really go the route of being a full-on parody, it does have satirical elements through subversion. \r\nFor the most part, it points out the ridiculousness of a lot of similar Shounen action through it's own storytelling. It lampoonsthrough doing something completely different, which, to its credit, is a very unique way to create a defining image for yourself. Mob Psycho 100 utilizes common Shounen tropes to enhance a theme that it builds on throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nSelf-improvement and actualization. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Dynamic Art]\\n\\n\r\nIf you simply want to watch some great action, then this show can suite your needs as well. Mob Psycho has one of the most impressive animation showcases I've ever seen in a television anime, with absolutely gorgeous and fluid animation throughout. It never felt as though the show had a dip in quality in that regard. Even if the the action itself may feel as though it's generic, as in, it has a formula that a seasoned action anime viewer has seen before, the animation elevates it. Before I even touch on the story itself, I want to make it clear that in animation, exceptional visuals really do create an entirely new appreciation for what you are watching.\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, if this show had average or below-average effort put into the action, which ends up taking up a big part of the whole show, then the amount of enjoyment I would've gotten would be substantially lower. This can be explained simply. If you want to have your show be action packed, then you better be ready to make that action a delight to look at. Whether through great direction, nimble audio design, or just spectacular animation.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, 100 has all of these things. The entire show is rough-looking and much less polished than a lot of battle anime, but what it doesn't have in standalone visuals, it makes up for in movement and fluidity. With simpler character designs, this show can contort and bend them to their will. They bend like metal spoons and create uncommonly dynamic action. \\n\\n\r\nThe direction is also solid. While it isn't particularly standout, it has moments of captivating imagery through engaging motion within the metaphoric camera that the director is working with. There are a lot of shots that have you, the viewer, move through the environments observing the unfolding action. Instead of giving you a more whole image of what's happening, you are thrust into a barrage of mid-shots and close-ups, which may have looked too confusing and headache inducing if the director didn't understand his craft. \\n\\n\r\nI was initially thrown off by the sound design. Mainly because the OP really didn't jive all too well with me. The opening itself is fine, i'd say it's above average for an anime opening, but the music in said opening is kind of silly. What with the corny English. But I will give credit where it's due and say that the opening does actually connect itself to the theme of the show, which i'll get into later. The audio overall though? Beautiful. The show has an aggressively awesome stinger track that it plays when shits really starting to go down that is really hype. Something about whining synths really gets me going. The sound design is also solid throughout. Since there's a lot of movement, there needs to be a lot of syncing with said movement. The action is fast and the sounds are crisp. Characters often smash face-first into brick walls, cracking them into rubble and it sounds great. \\n\\n\r\nArtistically, the show is spectacular. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Thematic Narrative]\\n\\n\r\nSo in most Shounen battle anime you have your protagonist. And he's cool and Kirito and broody and duel-wielding and edgy and spiky-haired and sexy and has a long black coat and has a non-caring but actually caring personality. We've seen it all before. These \"cool\" MC's are one of the main reasons I generally stay away from action anime. Their innocuous and banal entirety is a huge turnoff, especially since every bland cardboard cutout girl ends up draped over them like a wet tarp. \\n\\n\r\nShigeo, our protagonist, is similarly non-caring yet caring. He's distant. But all these tropes are acknowledged, not in the winking \"hey we know we are doing this stupid bullshit\", kinda way. But in a literal story kind of way. These are actually problems. For once, these battle Shounen aren't saying these traits are attractive. Early on in the series it's established that Shigeo is not only ridiculously powerful, but emotionally distant. He hates that about himself. His crush is more interested in athletic guys than she is in emotionally unavailable quite boys with crazy magic powers. \\n\\n\r\nBut instead of just saving her and getting the pussy, like what most of these shows would do. Shigeo acknowledges this and tries to improve himself. These aren't just traits you have to live with. These are flaws you can fix if you work hard enough. From the second episode the ongoing theme of this series becomes apparent. Self-improvement is awesome. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series he fights. If you've ever seen battle anime then you'd know that he'll be fighting increasingly powerful enemies with his crazy over powered abilities and then it leads to a out-of-this world climax. What Mob Psycho 100 does so intelligently is use that obvious buildup to have this theme not only be there in the background, but enter the foreground of this narrative. \\n\\n\r\nIt becomes clear that the enemies Shigeo is facing are powerful espers who, much like him, have social issues. Different social issues, but social issues nonetheless. But unlike him, they don't want to change or better themselves. So in a cathartic kind of way, Shigeo is fighting anime protagonists from other series'. Kind of. Especially towards the middle half of the show as he faces the first true esper he has come into contact with. This parallel is, put bluntly, really fun. \\n\\n\r\nThis self-improvement theme continues with Shigeo's mentor in telekinesis, Reigen, being nothing but a con-man. This con-man, however, is genuinely a nice guy who disperses nuggets of wisdom throughout his mostly comedy-focused act. He is dangerously charismatic and convincing and cool, which are all the things that Shigeo wants to be. This parallel continues with Shigeo's spouse, too, which plays a major role in this series.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this theme does get stretched thin, as in, becomes really really obvious as the show progresses. So much so that at one point towards the end it is explicitly explained to you. But in a way, that's alright, especially when i'm considering the demographic that this show really should flourish within. Teenagers. I feel as a teenager i'd be really into a show like this. In fact, i'd go so far as to say that this could be a very mandatory viewing to teenagers who are very into battle anime. Especially introverted kids who begin to think that their introverted-ness is due to some special power or hidden ability and the world will, at some point, hand all the answers to them. In reality, that's far from the truth and Mob Pyscho 100 could be that pill that breaks them free of those kinds of thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nThis genuinely smart, thoughtful, and refreshing message is perhaps this shows strongest narrative angle. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Cons of Being]\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the downside of being a show that lampoons through narrative are also in full effect. I do want to say that this shows entire point is not to make fun of Shounen action anime, as much as it is to tell a story that simply serves as a refreshing take on the genre. However, these connections need to be drawn regardless since critically, the stories aren't too different.  \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaws are that when this show isn't engaging you with these thematic narratives it really just follows the path of a generic Shounen. As I've said, this could be easily forgiven if I actually enjoyed Shounen. But the gauntlet-style action that really becomes the norm towards the end of the series gave me vibes that weren't really all too engaging. The subversive moments were fun, but they were far from the meat of the final episodes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, throughout its twelve episode run, there was a small dip in narrative tightness towards the later middle-half that impacted the shows flow. Especially beginning these corruption oriented stories that really didn't have reasonable or interesting conclusions. A lot of the side characters also never really played much of a role at all, which I was a little disappointed in. \\n\\n\r\nThere was also an annoying ghost side-character that generally served as comedic relief. The comedy in just about every Shounen action anime always ends up being more miss-than-hit for me, which kind of sucks. This show, surprisingly, did ring a few laughs out of me but for the most part, I really didn't care for the solely comedic scenes in the series. When it blended comedy with it's action it became much more palatable. \\n\\n\r\nThere were also a few moments in which there was some truly obnoxious character baits that didn't go anywhere. I despise when shows do this and it's very rare that they actually have any effect other than momentary surprise, only to realize that everything is just going to be fine in the end. This is because by the end of the show, the status quo is generally very samey. While some people definitely got powers, there were some cheap narrative shots taken to make sure everything wraps up a bit too neatly, setting up a potential second season. \\n\\n\r\nI wish this show took more risks with finishing it's story. Hell, kill off a character or two. This show, while comedic in nature, never really felt like it was beyond having powerful scenes. Especially since it does try and get you in the emotion-bone every so often with some of the flashbacks and heartfelt moments. Unfortunately... that's where the emotional attachment ends. The characters and their general characterization balances the line between generic and semi-creative, with some characters being genuinely fun and engaging, while other characters being a bit too generic for this shows premise. \\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mob Psych 100 is probably the best Shounen battle anime I've seen so far. I haven't watched the other series this creator has written, One Punch Man yet, but with how impressed Mob Psycho left me, maybe it's about time I check that out. I think for it's various flaws, Mob's strong themes and incredible visuals elevate it past a lot of action anime that I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some legitimately great moments here that unfortunately cluster around the first half more than they do the second half of this shows run-time. However, the show as a whole is so short that I felt like this wasn't as big of an issue as it could've been. The length really did do it a lot of favors. The breezy duration made even the less-than-interesting parts easy to get through. \\n\\n\r\nI think Mob psycho 100 is mandatory viewing for Shounen action fans. It brings an element of creativity in a genre that I feel, narratively, has been very stagnant and similar. Mob Psycho goes the extra mile with entertaining action, tying together crisp audio, solid direction, and great animation into a thematically resonant twelve-episode bundle. \\n",

            "content": "This show is an absolute treat. As many already know, Mob Psycho 100, based on the web manga by ONE, shares many aspects with his One Punch Man series and the subsequent adaptation. However, while OPM is immensely entertaining due to the overwhelming strength of its protagonist, Mob Psycho 100 takes a more refined look at its characters and produces a show that not only reaches but surpasses the heights of its sister series.\r\nStory: 6\r\nMob's story is nothing too special, and luckily it doesn't need to be. Mob is an awkward, dull, incredibly overpowered esper struggling his way through the social nightmare that is middleschool. In the meantime, he works for fraud exorcist-for-hire Reigen (a phenomenal character, but I'll get to that). The story ends up boiling down to Mob demolishing tougher and tougher opponents by becoming uncontrollably powerful any time he gets worked up. It works on a quickly paced arc-based structure that succeeds most of the time and feels a bit rushed at others like the arc that follows Mob's brother Ritsu. The final few episodes hit a great stride and are impeccably paced.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThis show looks absolutely stunning most of the time. Adapting from material as crudely drawn as ONE's works would take a massive amount of talent. BONES has just that talent. The art style hits a perfect sweet spot by utilizing rough looking character designs with rugged lines and a GOD-TIER level of polish in action sequences that makes for some of the most kinetic fights I've witnessed in animation. Seriously, some of the scenes in this show are jaw-droppingly awesome. The crew at BONES also isn't afraid to used mixed animation styles to convey a visual message. Some segments utilize a paint-on-glass style that looks amazing and unique. The entire ending animation is done in this style and is one of the most impressive ED's I've ever seen for that very reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nSpeaking of the ED, the music associated with this show is just too badass not to commend. The opening theme credited to a band simply named \"MOB CHOIR\" is a catchy driving techno rock track that hooked me instantly. The ED by \"ALL OFF\" is similarly great and sends off every episode perfectly. I have a feeling it will be a very nostalgic ED for me very soon.\\n\r\nNow the soundtrack. It's by Kenji Kawai. Kenji Kawai is an absolute boss. I needn't say anything else, but the man is a fantastic OST composer. His use of a variety of traditional instruments, electronics, a multitude of percussion instruments, and electronic instruments is always effective. The battle music is intense and kicks ass. The sullen moments are beautiful and emotionally written. Tracks can be used repetitively, but that is a common occurrence in anime. He's awesome. Quick plug for the Seirei no Moribito OST, another great score he wrote for another great show. Alright. Enough rambling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nMan, the characters in this show are so fun. I think the biggest takeaway I had from these characters was just how good-spirited they all were. Any character you thought could be written off as \"just some jerk\" ended up being really pleasant and like-able. The members of the Body Improvement Club could have been rude and unaccepting of someone as out of shape and traditionally \"uncool\" as Mob, but instead they openly welcome him and treat him with care and respect. Teru could have remained an uncompromisingly pompous prick, but instead turns into an honestly good guy who is willing to help Mob. Dimple, though seemingly bent on world domination, helps Mob and offers him advice after Mob defeats him.\\n\r\nAnd then there's Reigen. A fraud, con-artist, and outright liar who tricks people into paying for his services is virtually the coolest most genuinely good-hearted character in the whole show. He takes Mob, an insecure middle schooler struggling with his powers, under his wing and provides him with advice that inadvertently affects his entire world-view for the better. Reigen alone makes this show worth watching, and if you've read what I've written above, then you know there are MANY things that make this show worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nAs I've already said, this show is a treat. Studio BONES has crafted an exceptional adaptation of a story that may have flown well under the radar otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nAs exciting as One Punch Man and packed with fun and interesting characters, Mob Psycho 100 is the best show I watched this season. With only 12 episodes (but hopefully more to come), this fun ride is well worth your time. \\n",

They totally defeated everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a lot of impact in terms of the real life with comedic plot. The development of the characters shows it in the good way.\\n\\n\r\nTotaly, I give all around 10 out 10 for every thing. \\n\\n\r\nGood Job to the author and manga artist.

            "content": "With the success of One Punch Man, everyone was looking forward to the next ONE adaptation Mob Psycho 100. As it finally aired, it was initially met with mixed reactions. Maybe people set the bar too high and were met with a slight disappointment. However, I personally saw the show\u2019s potential and patiently witnessed the show progress which turned into a quite satisfying experience.\r\nThe show follows the story of Kageyama Shou a.k.a Mob who tries to avoid using his psychic powers with the intention of hurting others. He looks up to his master Reigen Arataka said who is actually a clever swindler that I personallycan\u2019t help liking because of his smooth nature. While Reigen often lacks screen time, focusing more on Mob\u2019s part of the story, they are the two core characters of the show. Other characters of interest include the cheeky spirit Dimple, the stylish Hanazawa who is another esper, and Mob\u2019s caring brother Ritsu. There are other interesting attention-grabbing characters present but the three of them have more significance due to their own story arcs. The overall approach of the story seems to gravitate towards a parody-styled zany comedy while trying to satirize the idea of possessing supernatural powers. The action is fast-paced and explosive. Shot and often manoeuvred at different insane angles, one can\u2019t help but be amazed despite that the animation is not as top-notch as OPM. The art looks rough and cartoony, but it fits the atmosphere well. There are elements of coming-of-age and drama present as it shows Mob\u2019s struggle of possessing psychic powers as he grows up. The dramatic effect is not too overblown and is just restricted to internal monologue but it does provide a good edge on presenting the conflict within the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one issue I have with the show, it is the direction of the story.  It started cool with introducing to us the everyday life of a boy with psychic powers working part-time for a scam business which I find really interesting. However, it would\u2019ve been great to see if Mob finally discovered or realized that Reigen is a fake supernatural expert. The story finds a way to solve that problem later on but it would have been a nice good character development if it went toward that path. As mentioned earlier, there are character arcs in the story where Mob finds himself involved in some way. Though I enjoyed all of them, one in particular sort of bothered me which was Ritsu\u2019s arc. I felt like the show has put way more time than necessary for it. It does try to develop Ritsu\u2019s character, but all the time I was thinking that Mob could have used that development more since he is the more important and interesting character. Mob was still struggling with conflicted feelings about using psychic powers when it was revealed that there\u2019s a villain organization. Basically, I liked that the show tries to take its story more seriously and not devolve into a redundant punch-line comedy. However, I feel like it doesn\u2019t want to harm the comedic nature of the show thus always choosing the easy way out of a conflict. It\u2019s a shame really, but maybe we can get more action if we can get a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mob Psycho 100 is a refreshing approach to action comedy, not too exaggerated and not too mediocre. Don\u2019t expect another One Punch Man, it\u2019s a show that can stand on its own without being associated to the author\u2019s more successful endeavor.\\n",

            "content": "Peter Parker is the actual identity of the superhero known as Spiderman. As a teenager, Peter was bit by a radioactive spider which gave him super powers, which he first used for personal gain. Due to a tragic event indirectly caused by his unwillingness to intervene for someone in trouble, one thing led to another and then his uncle, the person he looked up most to in the world. And as a result of such, he then learned that with great powers, comes great responsability and that he can make the world a better place. A lot of Spiderman's stories focus on him trying tobalance his teenage personal life with his superhero responsabilities. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main character of this story is not a superhero, yet he does have supernatural powers. And while he also thinks he should be responsible about his own power, it is not in the same way as that of the character above. \"With great power, comes great responsibility\" becomes \"Having special abilities might make you capable of changing the world, but said abilities won't make you a better person.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of this story, Mob, was taught that everyone is equal, and that nobody is superior or inferior in the face of society, regardless of whether or not they have a capacity far beyond or far below the norm. Mob's goal as a character is not to harness his powers and become someone great through them. Rather, Mob's goal is for personal growth, and managing to grow as a person through other means, as psychic powers aren't something needed to lead a normal life.\\n\\n\r\nSome may think that Mob has the potential to do anything out of this. That he chose the most boring goal possible for a person that has something others don't have. But he does have a reason for his desire to be normal. And that is alienation. He sees himself as worthless and a nobody when stripped away of his power. He sees his power as a detriment that creates a wall between himself and everyone around him. And I agree with him. Mob, is just a kid, but it's true when stripped away of his most prominent feature, he is just... a forgetable kid. I enjoy his character quite a lot. Because he's the person who got bit by the radioactive spider, got superpowers, and thought that only makes his life more difficult. He wants to live a normal life. He wants to fit in, not stand out. He's a character who was given something other people would use to their full advantage, and instead this person couldn't grow properly due to it. I like that a lot, and I enjoy the superhero parallels I can draw between ONE's concepts for main characters and western mainstream superheroes. I hope he keeps this up, somehow.\\n\\n\r\nBack on topic, this is what Mob Psycho 100 is about, a child trying to achieve personal growth. But its first few episodes did mislead me quite a bit. I thought it was going to try to be a consistent comedy, where Mob, an actual psychic, helps his master, a crook to claims to be the greatest psychic alive, into scamming people out of their money and exorcising actual real ghosts. Like, I might be fucking stupid, but that's what I expect after an introduction where the main focus is the dynamic of two characters and their highjinks. While I wasn't completely dumbfounded by it, since I watched and read ONE's other work that got animated, because I knew that it would start with something showcasing a regular day for the main character and that the series will keep building up to something, I still couldn't sparkly see the theme of the anime because the series focused a bit more on being humorous. But other than the first few episodes of the series, Mob Psycho 100 stays on point to its theme.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of action, it is actually quite decent. A lot of the fights in Mob Psycho are actually about Mob's inner conflict with himself and just like in One Punch Man, the fights help you understand a lot more about the characters and give them more depth. And because Mob is a kid and because if he doesn't let his emotions loose, he's as much of a pacifist as possible so people can exploit that, but when he does, he can only act based on what he's feeling,  andwhile he is more powerful than every other character, other characters can just get the better of him if they act the right way or plan around it right. Which is an intriguing thing too, because that doesn't create a solely dependent strength scale based combat and it means things can vary and the action can bring some interesting moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy mostly consists of Reigen scamming people out of their money and the way he does it, some of Mob's awkwardness and the fact that he is just your average socially inept kid and some degree of slapstick. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Mob Psycho 100 mostly serve the purpose of building up Mob's character, but they do present some interesting facets to Mob's personality. But describing these characters would be like describing the exact characters arcs Mob is going to go through, and since I've already described enough about what type of character Mob was, it's better if you go in dry for this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and pretty simple, whilst somewhat goofy due to the overall designs of the characters. The intro might mislead you that a lot of things will happen all at once on the screen, since it seems to have literally tried to have crammed in every piece of the 12 episodes of the anime it possibly could've. But no, the drawings mostly look simplistic yet lively enough, their movements are fluid and the art does stand out due to how goofy it can be due to it being adapted from poor drawings. The sound design is overall good, it serves its purpose and it fits the fight scenes quite well. I personally enjoy the song of the OP a lot, and it's the more fitting part of the intro regarding the fact that it actually completely represents what the anime is about to bring. Nothing to really criticize in any of these departments. I usually have a problem when the animation feels too flashy and there's a constant ambiance of colors on screen to signify power, but given the type of powers, I was actually surprised by the fact that it seems through and through quite well color balanced.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 is a good choice for you if you'd enjoy watching a story about personal growth, with action set up to develop its characters and a bit of humor to make things not to be taken too seriously. Mob Psycho might be not a satisfying choice for you if you might dislike the type of average joe Mob is represented as, and his lack of willingness to not shine out of the mundane. What Mob tries to do and what he is might be boring to you. The humor might also be a problem, since everyone is amused by different things. I've enjoyed Mob Psycho all in all and thought it was a good anime, because it created an interesting character and thought it did a well job representing who he is and what he wants. So I think a lot of how you will take in Mob Psycho 100 is how you will take in Mob's character. So I don't advice starting if what I said about Mob sounded uninteresting, but otherwise, I recommend it if there's nothing else that might've particulary bothered you about the anime.",

            "content": "It is, unfortunately, almost impossible to write this review without mentioning One Punch Man. I wish that it were, but you are going to see parallels and compare them when you watch this show. This isn't a bad thing, ONE is an incredibly talented mangaka and his work deserves praise. Where One Punch Man was a parody of manga and anime tropes, Mob Psycho 100 seems to be the more serious work. I might be wrong because I am not familiar with the Mob manga.\r\nWhat I love and pity ONE for is that I recognise a theme in his work; loneliness. Saitama and Mob areboth extremely powerful characters who are lonely because they do not know how to interact with the world around them. Whereas Saitama doesn't really seem to care, Mob does. Mob, also known as Shigeo, is one of the most powerful psychics in the show and possibly the world. Despite his brilliance, he just wants to be a normal kid. He wants friends and the girl he has a crush on to notice him. I enjoyed that we never get any interaction between him and his crush; in her world he simply does not exist. Many of us have been there and I thought that it was a good way to portray Mob's feelings of isolation.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main characters are also quite good. Reigen Arataka was of particular noteworthiness. A conman who has a genuine interest in Mob's happiness, he provides a young Mob - and by extension, the viewer - with a shocking amount of wisdom and encouragement. Reigen has a strict moral code, which is amusing because his job is screwing people out of money. Ultimately he...helps everyone. Even those clients that are deluded and think their real life issues are due to malignant spirits, Reigen is there to help (of course he makes a profit).\\n\\n\r\nEkubo, or Dimple, is one of these malignant spirits who was once powerful but had the misfortune of upsetting Mob. Greatly weakened after their fight, he seems to exist as a morally grey character who aids Mob but also assists Mob's brother, Ritsu, going down a darker path of his own. Ritsu was also a really good character. Constantly feeling inferior to his brother due to psychic abilities, he experiments and eventually awakens his own abilities. His inferiority complex led him to excel in areas that Mob is below average in, such as school and extracurricular activities. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's pretty much the main cast. Teru is worthy of a mention as well. A reformed gangster who tries to be a good guy after he realised what destruction true ESP power could bring. This show excels in it's interwoven story lines. While not complex, everything follows a logical progression which makes everything seem connected. Heroes and villains are introduced properly and in memorable ways, before they have a huge impact on the story. I prefer this to randomly throwing people into the mix and seeing what happens. Having a unique looking character in the back of your mind for a few episodes and wondering what they are going to do is very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were very good. Excellent opening song and downright amazing ending artwork. If you haven't seen the artwork for the ED, check it out on YouTube before watching. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this a 10/10 because other than the story being a little predictable, there isn't much wrong with it. It is a good piece about being unable to relate with the world around you.",

            "content": "\"One Punch Man\" was a phenomenal success overnight and there is no denying the fact that its deserve all of it,works like this set a benchmark for an author, \"Mob psycho 100\" is from the same author so it's obvious that our expectation would be high but it turn out to be one step behind its predecessor.\r\nAlthough,there are quite a few similarities between the two but it'll be unfair to judge on the basis of that.\r\nOn one hand when \"OPM\" was eye captivating from the first episode itself,\"MP100\" is paced bit slowly and takes the time to develop but once its reach the peak,it's quiteenjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n-PLOT-\\n\r\nThe story revolves around 'MOB' a middle school boy who is gifted with psychic power from childhood but as he grew up he realized how dangerous his power can be if misused,so he started working under a fraud self-proclaimed psychic known as Reign Arataka who takes advantage of him, to earn quick cash and this is how MOB's adventures goes on,he also got a crush on his classmate and tries his best to impress her but being socially inept,all his effort end up in futile.\\n\r\nThe story is pretty decent and gets better with each episode and despite how we feel about the animation,the action sequences are top notch and one of the trait mark of \"ONE\" works but the comedy aspect is a big let down,all I have experience is cockroach,porn and all sort of lame and body shaming jokes.\\n\r\nA bit of them was humorous but the majority of them aren't funny at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTERS-\\n\\n\r\nMob- The main protagonist of the show,a boy who wants a just little bit more from life and doesn't feel proud of his gifted psychic strength.\\n\\n\r\nReigen Arataka- Mob's mentor,a cunning businessman and 100% troll to remember the name.\\n\\n\r\nHanazawa teruki- With the introduction of this character,it gave a major boost to the show overall.\\n\r\nWho doesn't love a friendly rivalry?Kanazawa is like Vegeta of this show.\\n\\n\r\nKageyama Ritsu- Mob's younger brother who looks almost identical to him, the only thing that separates him fro, Mob is his spiked hair.\\n\r\nDespite having all the things a boy would want at his age,he's always having an inferior complex to his Mob\\n\\n\r\nFew of the characters, in the beginning, were really annoying and they still are but after the addition of characters like Kageyama and others,it's really got entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n-ART-\\n\r\nAt first glance,the art may not be appealing to all eyes and there is no wrong in it,you may still admire or despise it and that's got nothing to do with having a bad taste as each individual is different,\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND-\\n\r\nThere's nothing much to talk much about this section,the opening is quite dynamic and the tone in each episode is fine.\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT-\\n\r\nDue to the nature of the show,I got a bad impression after watching the first couple of episodes but when I continue with the later episodes,I was amazed to see how much better it can get.\\n\\n\r\n-OVERALL-\\n\r\nIt's a pretty good show but its got the flaws too so if we can keep that aside,it's worth watching",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that when I first decided to watch this anime, I had very, very low expectations.\r\nI always saw One Punch Man as an overrated gem. The action direction and comedy execution are almost flawless, but I'm very picky with anime and OPM gets no more than a 8/10 from me because there wasn't a very strong focus on the story aspects. I'm a huge fan of Hunter x Hunter, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Attack on Titan, Deathnote, among others; that's the kind of anime I enjoy. Ones with captivating plots and character development. It strengthens my connection with the anime andhelps me relate to the material. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it came to Mob Psycho 100, I was expecting it to be no more than a carbon copy of OPM, but I wanted to watch it for the comedy and action sequences, since I am a sucker for well-animated anime battles. As I skimmed through the episodes, I noticed a major change in its style. It ended up hooking me from top to bottom. The main idea of the anime is almost very similar to OPM, but executed in a nearly polar opposite fashion. It concentrates heavily on character development, and gives viewers some of the most fluid anime characters I've seen in a long time. Mob was an insanely relatable character, mainly for teens like me. Most of us don't even know exactly what we want in life, and it's not easy to find out. Mob represents that common life decision that can manipulate a teenager's mind to become interested in such a character, and the people around Mob enhance it, creating a very straightforward and strong plot device.\\n\\n\r\nIts novelty areas are what I call \"classic ONE quality.\" In other words, expect something badass. The art direction and design is very rough and simplistic. It looks like a child's first good drawing, which many people didn't like about the anime, but I found it amusing since I've never seen this kind of style used before, and it's always fun to see something unique. The animation behind it also lands in \"classic ONE quality\" and takes up the majority of mind stimulation when it comes to craving something awesome. The animation is so fluid that there are even small details in some aspects that you most likely won't see the first few times. This is a simple but costly aspect that easily makes battles extra exciting, and it's one of the major things I adore in anime. Well-animated fights don't come often, so treasure every epic moment in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to make this review short, since there's really not too much to say about it. It has everything you could possibly want in an anime, bar none, and I feel very privileged to take part in one of these rare times when an anime gets this good. Best anime of the year? Not only that, but probably one of the best anime in the last 5 years.",

The story and art were phenomenal. The author was amazing as to how he did conceal the main character. The action was superb!!! I was satisfied with the battle scenes and how it is wrapped up. Still craving for that. Oh Please Season 2! The opening song was in English. Somehow I find it funny it was my first time encountering a song that's counting numbers but it is good. The seiyuu was definitely best.In that particular scene where the Master of main character said the word \"Idiot\" was full of feelings. Clap, clap, clap! The characters are all likable I was predicting one character's gender there, but to my surprise it turns out different. Hahaha Overall, I really, really did I type that twice enjoy it.

The music, colorful animation, and the overall energetic vibe definitely adds to this. The actions and the appearances of some characters are just so funny that it's hard not to enjoy the show.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, I believe that Mob Psycho 100 is better than One Punch Man. You're probably wondering why so I'll just come right out with it. It's the characters! It's much easier to get to like the characters in this anime. You'llfeel for them when things go bad or you'll want to yell at your screen when they do something dumb. In my opinion, One Punch Man lacks this.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Mob Psycho 100 just seems to do everything right. It makes you want to see more of Shigeo, Reigen, and the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (I'd give it an 11 if I could.)\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10 (Both the opening and ending songs are good and memorable.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 (It's interesting, vibrant, and colorful.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 (They're funny and have enough personality to them.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10 (It's not very complex but still very fun.)",

            "content": "TL;DR \u2013 A refreshing take on the special snowflake teenager who wants a normal life style of power fantasy, but it is held back from being something special by a few weak episodes in the third act, when it becomes hobbled by the very tropes & clich\u00e9s it seemed such a welcome break from. \r\nThe power fantasy has been a staple of anime since kids tuned in to watch a wide eyed robot boy fight villains by shooting bullets out of his arse. Indeed, it's one of the purposes of fiction to take any sentence that begins with \u201cI wish I...\u201d & answer what itmight be like. & we, as viewers of all ages, seek the vicarious thrill of seeing people we wish we could be, visit places we wish we could go & do things we could only wish to, or would never dare to if we could.\\n\\n\r\nThe Light Novel boom, despite the lamentations of some, did not suddenly cause anime to become awash with these power fantasy stories, particularly ones with protagonists who are soon to exclaim \"I wish I was normal\". Yet in recent years one gets a sense that the stories being told in this style have become more self-indulgent, more focused on escapism than introspection, certainly more smug. We still get to see people get the girl, beat the bad guy & prove they're awesome, but there doesn't seem to be the interest in asking why, for example, a twenty something year old would want to be a high schooler again, or whether being transported to a fantasy world is the best solution to your problems.\\n\\n\r\nIn that context, Mob Psycho 100 comes as a breath of fresh air. Mob, the titular main character, is a middle school kid who was born an esper, with the ability to do pretty much anything that can be explained by \u201cbecause he's psychic.\u201d Yet rather than seeing this as the gift that keeps on giving, Mob instead resents it as a danger to others & a burden, not least because the girl he likes is more interested in sporty guys than dweebs who can make objects float.\\n\\n\r\nRather than wallow in self-pity or act out until she & others have to notice him, however, Mob instead seeks to move on from his life revolving around his power; under the guidance of mentor & business partner Reigan, an exorcist & scam artist. As an early example, when picking an after school club he is initially approached by the Telepathy club, who sound like a natural fit for an esper but in practice are just a bunch of dossers who are interested in little more than playing games & eating. Instead, Mob opts for the Body-Improvement club, attracted to their pursuit of physical & self-improvement, despite their appearing ill suited to his fragile figure.\\n\\n\r\nSelf-improvement is the name of the game in Mob Psycho 100. Reigan, despite exploiting Mob's abilities for his own business (is it still a scam if spirits are actually being exorcised?) sees it as his responsibility to help Mob grow into a well rounded individual who can move on from the anxieties his powers cause. Indeed, one could argue he doesn't so much use Mob as give him a safe space in which to use his powers without harming others. Reigan in many ways is the Fool as well as mentor figure of Mob Psycho 100, a comic who has good intentions even towards his customers & a fountain of wisdom you might want to think twice before drinking from.\\n\\n\r\nIf Reigan is the one encouraging Mob to better himself, the Body-Improvement club show that you don't need to already be amazing to get respect. Despite looking like a sapling among trees, his club mates quickly come to respect him as one of their own, not because he is already physically strong but because he is determined to improve himself as a person, a goal their intense physical regimen is a constant pursuit of (it's not without reason that their leader is called Musashi).\\n\\n\r\nThis side of Mob is contrasted against the often shallow, selfish & conceited motivations of the shows antagonists. The Body-Improvement club & their pursuit of physical perfection is an end in itself are set against the city's many school delinquents for whom physical strength is a tool to intimate others & give them a sense of power & respect that they crave. Teru, the first other esper that Mob encounters, shares mobs anxiety about his powers, but whereas fears the harm his powers can cause if he loses control, Teru uses his as a front to keep others & himself from realising that without them, he'd have nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThat anxiety, of not being special or not being treated as special by others, is something Mob Psycho 100 ultimately suggests is immature. As Reigan says, \u201cwhat use is being special if you can't get what you want?\u201d Nobody Mob encounters can really be said to be happy with themselves, instead seeking simple fixes to what they perceive as their failings, ways to avoid confronting the real cause of their unhappiness or things they feel they deserve but don't want to to earn the hard way. That's not to say that the series rejects the uniqueness of individuals, but rather that fixating on your problems & seeking simple, fantastical solutions to them is, in a sense, childish. Getting what you want, what you need, is difficult, & understanding that, as well as how measuring yourself only in terms of what others have that you don't ultimately gets you nowhere, is a mark of maturity. \\n\\n\r\nInevitably, comparisons to ONE's other adapted work, One Punch Man, have been all over the internet. There are certainly some parallels & contrasts, which have been used mostly to prove which one is supposedly better. Saitama is a normal guy who wanted to be super-powered. Mob is a super-powered guy who wants to be normal. While looking very different \u2013 OPM looks like the best of modern anime while Mob Psycho 100 looks like the best anime the 1990s never made \u2013 both are visually gorgeous & are a wet dream for people who use the word sakuga. Both characters personal conflict stems in part from their being too powerful in their worlds, Saitama unable to be what others actually consider a hero, Mob to feel comfortable around others when his powers can do serious harm. Most importantly, Saitama becomes the mentor to a blonde guy, while a blonde guy mentors Mob. It's like they're the same show! What a rip-off.\\n\\n\r\nBut if we're comparing anime, I would suggest there are more similarities with Natusme's Book of Friends. Here me out. Both Mob & Natsume resent & feel unfulfilled by their powers, Mob because of the harm he could cause others, Natsume because of the bullying & isolation it has caused him. Despite this, both are inherently, some might say annoyingly, good people who will put themselves in harms way to help others or to avoid hurting those who'd wish them harm. Both of them are able, seemingly for the first time, to make friends, their power no longer a complete hindrance to their living a normal life. Many of those Mob encounters are causing trouble because of their resentment towards others or themselves. Many of the Yokai Natsume encounters are causing trouble because they're lonely or misunderstood. Most importantly, both of them have a spirit buddy who is fooling nobody when they say they don't care what happens to their human companion. It's like they're the same show! What a rip-off.\\n\\n\r\nExcuse that tangent. The point being that were it not for its underwhelming music, there wouldn't be much to say against Mob Psycho 100's first half. Actually, even that's unfair, as the OST contains one of the best battle tunes in ages. It's really just the OP & ED that disappoint. It is nice that they wrote a theme song for the OP, rather than just using whatever rubbish King or Lantis wanted to flog. The same can't be said about the ED, which is a piece of utterly disposable Jrock, complete with a \u201cdubstep\u201d breakdown because apparently it's still 2010 in Japan. But while the OP is original, it's a bit of an unimpressive mess that certainly doesn't match OPM's OP.\\n\\n\r\nStill, if that was the biggest issue with Mob Psycho 100, it would have been a serious AOTY contender. But then, in episode 8, the generic evil esper organisation show up & things take a turn for the worse.\\n\\n\r\nIf one criticism can be leveled at both OPM & Mob Psycho 100, it's that at some point they come to rely on the same tropes & clich\u00e9s that they seemed to be parodying or purposely avoiding. The arrival of Claws, & the Scars who form it's leadership, mark that point. Its almost as though a different writer took over, as the pacing goes out the widow & we're rushed through a muddled & confused third act. \\n\\n\r\nA new theme of being able to overcome individual weakness by working together (shown by a couple instances of minor characters combining their powers) comes from nothing & is discarded just as quickly. Mob suddenly suffers a case of power creep, able to defeat without blinking a character who he'd had to go 100% (which refers to the point where he loses control) barely an episode earlier. Said opponents are a a group of one dimensional bores who are quickly rushed through, their motivations boiling down to their being a bunch of man-children. \\n\\n\r\nBut worse then that, they interrupt what was setting up to be a much more meaningful confrontation between Mob & his younger brother, Ritsu. Despite being an all round nice guy who wants what's best for people, this could have highlighted one of the hypocrisies in Mob & similar characters \u2013 that it's easy to want to be \u201cnormal\u201d when you're anything but. Mob's younger brother initially lacks his esper powers & deeply resents the almost sanctimonious & (to him) condescending way Mob & his parents talk about his achievements. When those esper powers awaken, Ritsu goes down a similar path that Teru was, using his new powers to take out his inferiority complex on others. \\n\\n\r\nMob having to resolve the dilemma of needing his esper powers to face off against the very person he most feared harming with them could have been the climax that might have made Mob Psycho 9-10/10 material. Instead we got a series of rushed fights against uninteresting opponents , all apparently for the sake of making Act 3 a bigger spectacle. Fortunately, Reigan shows up to save both the day & the show, ending on a decent note that reinforces the overarching message while leaving the door open for another series (or reason to read the manga). But the damage is done & those few episodes in the final act drag down what otherwise was a great series.\\n\\n\r\nDragged down, but not sunk. Despite a couple of weak episodes, Mob Psycho 100 is otherwise strong enough to stand as a recommendable series. An engaging story, entertaining characters, gorgeous artwork that manages the seemingly unusual feat these days of making the background art match the characters. Perhaps most importantly, Mob is a rare anime protagonist whose claim to want a \u201cnormal\u201d life is one you actually believe because of his efforts to achieve it. Even if he's an esper who can blow up buildings & speak with spirits, he's still a teenage boy who likes girls, obsesses about silly things, wants to be noticed & needs a hand from time to time. In other words, a pretty normal one.",

            "content": "The more time passes, the more clear it becomes to me that I am a lone man on a lone island who people can't hear because they're too busy jerking off to the latest \"best girl\", a term that has become about as meaningless as the word \"Final Fantasy\". Pretty much every anime fan that matters seems to have watched one of the brightest gems to have come from the Japanese animation market since the one from last season, but I watched an anime that I would have only considered going back to in five years is if I was stranded on an island withnothing but this show and a bunch of ecchi crap to pass the time with before my laptop ran out of batteries. I think similar to Re:Zero, a big part of my problem with Mob Psycho 100 is that I'm not an anime nerd. Every single praise I've seen for this show always glorifies the \"nerd\" stuff, with the only one I appreciate being the actual animation. Unfortunately, most animation nerds seem to judge the art based on the actual technical quality or the style whilst I judge it based on what emotions are successfully conveyed through the art and I have high standards when it comes to emotions. For starters, the emotions that the characters cannot be dripped in nerdiness.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 is the latest manga adaptation from ONE, author of the hit webcomic-turned-anime series, One-Punch Man, and brought to life with the production values from Bones and the directorial talent of that guy who made Death Parade that only smarmy elitists would remember the name of. Unlike the instant hit of what's apparently the best superhero series in a year where every single medium was trying to cash in on the boom, Mob Psycho initially churned out a mixed response for its artsy visual style (because apparently, the anime community is composed of nothing but teenagers who misuse the word \"pretentious\") and had to win people's hearts the hard way aka by keeping a consistent quality and going through heavy promotion from all the big-name nerds. Obviously it succeeded, because the show quickly rose up in popularity to the point that it's considered amazing, let alone the best anime of the summer. Definitely going to be showing up on many top whatever anime lists by the time this year ends. And obviously I have to stomp on some sycophantic heads, because the word \"amazing\" is not something you want to throw around lightly in regards to anime. It's something you should only reserve for something that'd be in your top 40, or more accurately, your top 20.\\n\\n\r\nIt's no secret that a large part of why people paid attention to Mob Psycho at the very start (for good or for bad) is because of its visual style, which in a community that's getting increasingly sakuga-obsessed is like posting a Youtube video on the Net for all those losers who still think \"lolcats\" is funny. The real draw though comes from Mob himself, a psychic boy who uses his powers for a local con man in order to make money whilst trying to rely on skills that us powerless humans have to get by in his every day life, despite him being as athletic and social as a donkey in the middle of this year's dragon-hatching festival. Whether you prefer One-Punch Man or this show, you'd be hard-pressed to deny that Mob is a much more relatable character than Saitama considering he actually \"can\" fail and has goals in life, even if said goals are pretty standard for the superpower genre and teenagers as a whole. Become more social. Join a club. Win over that attractive girl who doesn't have any physical screen time. Take care of your younger brother. Defeat a bunch of evil psychic-users. We've all been there before. Okay, not so much the psychic-user part, but shut up. I'm trying to make a point.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Mob Psycho probably could have helped alleviate the negativity from the non-sakuga crowd if it had established a more clear direction at the start. The show's primary genre is shonen comedy, and like most American sitcoms and Shonen Jump products, it has a bit of trouble working out the quirks and the characters early on because the writers are either experimenting to see what sticks or are looking so far ahead that they forget that there's no time like the present. The first episode in particular is completely divorced from the overall plot and only exists to establish who Mob and his boss are, which could have easily been accomplished in a way that didn't involve that goddamn \"salt splash\" meme and only exists because ONE is just that quirky. And the rest of the first half mostly just exists to introduce new characters whilst spouting out lessons regarding how psychic powers should not be used for evil, which could have only been more cliched if they added \"thou must not kill\" into the mix. Not that you have to worry about anyone dying, because ONE's works run on toon physics and thus getting hit with a Kamehameha is the equivalent of getting hit with a girl's megaton punch. Still hurts mind you, but you'll live.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things you have to keep in mind with Mob Psycho is that a large part of your enjoyment will come from how much you can get into its unique brand of humor. A guy I know who's really into the show claims that it's basically Earthbound: The Anime, and without game play to back it up, Earthbound doesn't have much to its narrative beyond the fact that the protagonists are a bunch of kids who name their pets \"Vagina\" and fight weird-looking aliens with frying pans and sticks of butter presumably shoved up the ass. As such, even when we get more of an overall plot later on and the storytelling improves, the actual story doesn't grow along with them. All that happens when Mob's brother takes his \"why does my nii-san get the powers and I don't\" jealousy too far and other psychic users get in the mix is test Mob's resolution regarding when it's acceptable to use his powers to hurt people, as well as provide more convenient excuses for Bones to show off their visual prowess. This does lead to a kinda funny final resolution that's been getting some flak for its anti-climactic nature, but that just goes to show how much Mob needs to make you laugh in order to work.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, whilst it got a smile from me every now and then, I don't recall ever flat-out laughing at anything Mob Psycho did. If this show was an American cartoon, it'd be more alone the lines of something like The Amazing World of Gumball or current-day Adventure Time rather than something like Steven Universe or The Loud House. Okay, Steven Universe isn't exactly a riot either, but the point is that at the end of the day, Mob Psycho feels like a Japanese version of one of the lesser cartoons on Cartoon Network rather than the amazingly brilliant ones. As I said, the animation is awesome, but so is The Loud House's, and most people wouldn't call that show the revival of Nick's animation block just based on that. All of the morals Mob Psycho imparts are too universal to be hard-hitting unless you have low standards and want to ignore all the evolution that superpower stories and animation in general have accomplished in the last few years. And whilst they're all executed well, there's a limit to how much good execution can achieve when your elements are only slight less base than a Ridley Scott film.\\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn't help that by the end of the show, nothing really changes other than a few characters not taking psychic powers quite for granted, which is about as progressive as a harem story that ends with the main character slaying a dragon, which would make him come off as less of a loser but it doesn't help in choosing a girl unless they're repulsed by the smell of dragon guts. Mob is still living his life the way he wants to, everyone else's plotlines get resolved cleanly, and it ends on a cliffhanger foreshadowing a Noragami Aragoto-esque sequel that isn't guaranteed to deliver on the same level that Aragoto did. Oh, and there's a two-minute skit at the end that's completely irrelevant to the plot and only exists because Bones realized they had a few extra minutes left to animate and let ONE do whatever the hell he wanted. It wasn't the least bit funny, so let's not dwell on it, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nI definitely wouldn't call Mob Psycho 100 boring. But there's no denying that as far as superpower/psychic stories are concerned, it still plays in the kiddy pool regarding how to handle its elements, and there's nothing in it that makes me want to buy the blu-rays when they eventually come out. It's just a \"fun\" show at the end of the day, and Bones has proven in the recent past that they're capable of so much more than that, so I'm not sure why I should be satisfied when this is all they have to offer. I'm already looking forward to putting this show behind me after I finish this review. Got to free up some room in the excitement chamber for Luke Cage, bruhs.",

            "content": "Mob's anime is simply put the best of two sides that seem to be drifting apart dramatically nowadays. All around the world smart and talented artists have no means to express themselves with desired sophistication. Anyone familiar with ONE should know One Punch Man's original webmanga was merely a way for him to practice using a manga-creating software. He was caught off guard when people suddenly started loving his style and humor. So basically the man is a genuine content creator who does things his way and happened to catch the world's eye in the process. That is one side. The other consists of passionateanimators all across the industry who crave for good ideas yet find only piles upon piles of recycled and uninspired storytelling around. Their talent will likely be wasted on you-name-it light novel adaptation to fill space in post-midnight television and that no one will remember in a year or two. Needless to say it is things like this that make me stick around. Rare as they are, as long there is chance they will eventually arise. Now, about Mob itself, it seems to be a perfected version of ONE's humor, which relies on exaggeration and creativity above all. Equal parts witty and nutty, it doesn't pull its insanity back even during dramatic bits. That is something I honestly missed in OPM as there were numerous sequences I couldn't care less about what was happening and wished the highlight to come asap. There are no such intervals in Mob, at least not for me. The whole show is a highlight. As far as animation is concerned, I'm happy the staff gives a shit. One of the most cinematic one cour series out there, brimming with visual style and fearless expressiveness in the form of rough drawing and thick outlining. As much as I wanted to personally thank every person involved in the Opening, the man himself director Yuzuru Tachikawa storyboarded such masterpiece, so I just had to give him proper credits. He's also responsible for season two which so far has been nothing short of amazing. Outstanding from beginning to end, Mob begs the question of why fruitful premises and talented production can't bond more often. In a dying industry, a speck of light.",

Usually when I watch anime, even if I like the series some episodes are either boring or piss you off, because of lack of progress. While watching Mob Psycho 100 it was just pure enjoyment from my end. I totally LOVED the humor this show threw at me. I know that this show was written from the same author from OPM, I'm surprised that this show didn't receive as much hype as OPM.  9/10\r\nArt: Art was amazing, how they put in manga styled art as well as webcomicart. To me Art was what really made this show funny and so exciting. Each episodes were so colorful and full of life. 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nSound: Good music, idk what much to say. Sound was always on point and it always matched the mood of the scene or it was even amplifying it. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: How they develop every character was just amazing. Unlike most other popular anime, characters in this show weren't one dimensional and showed multiple personalities or changed their attitude. Every character in the show has his/her personal quality and traits that differentiates them from each other, and the variety of characters were just purely amazing. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: of course for this this is an easy 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to ANYONE as it has very minimal fan service, with good plot, amazing humor, great art and characters. \\n\r\nTo me this show was the definition of anime Very colorful, while being immature at times also being mature with good messages.",

            "content": "Ok, I won't mince words on this one.\r\nMob Psycho is one of the most ambitious anime I've ever seen. Now, I may not be one of these die hard Otaku that's apparently seen everything but out of 3500 episodes I can speak for; these 12 were among the top 100. Mob is on my top anime on MAL's top 100 as of 2018.\r\nA lot of negative reviews of this show I feel come from the show being misunderstood, and I hope my review is helpful in clarifying a few things.\r\nAs we saw in One Punch Man, ONE's work seeks to tackle real world problems thatare both complex and relatable. The brilliance of these stories is they use simple characters and a dash of satire and dry humor to get a point across, which is something that's lacking in television, both live action and animated. If you've ever sat there watching the walking dead, or game of thrones and wondered 'Why did they make this? what's the point?' then you know EXACTLY what I'm getting at here. They lack a straightforward premise. ONE's work has direction, its purpose driven in a way that 99% of what we see is not. That said lets break it down:\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nA Hallmark of this mangaka, Mob Psycho 100 is the story of an unremarkable middle school aged bow who possesses remarkable psychic abilities. As a psychic mob is so overpowered that the universe itself would bow to his will should he so choose. Aside from this power Mob is in every other way completely unremarkable, he's not terribly intelligent, he's not athletic and he's cursed with a mediocre physical appearance. When he's not in school, he's working from his 'teacher' and supporting character 'Reigen', a paranormal investigator who has convinced mob and his clientele that he's a powerful psychic/medium capable of banishing ghosts and curing a wide range of ailments. he is of course a complete fraud.\\n\\n\r\nAs Mob develops we very quickly learn that despite his tremendous power mob has a problem. Mob has a crush on a girl, and said girl is unimpressed by psychic powers. Herein we delve into the real plot of Mob Psycho, it is the story of self improvement. Whereas many shows focus on showing you characters that are really good at something getting even better at what they're naturally good at, Mob is a character that's stuck in the same boat as the rest of the world. The reality of life is that the things we need to get better at are often the things that we're NOT good at. I may be the best player on the football team, but if what I truly want is an advanced degree I have to crack the books and study. The show expands on this by complicating Mobs situation with conflicts in which external forces in Mobs life are convinced that by choosing to improve upon something that does not involve his psychic powers is a waste of his innate talents. \\n\\n\r\nThis theme of self improvement carried over when we take a look at Reigens clientele, people who seek an easy way out and turn to the paranormal for answers, when in reality they already have the answers they seek. Whenever our point of view shifts back to Reigen we see the other path we can take in our lives and inevitable ignorance it spawns. Despite being a conman by trade Reigan makes every effort to use his charade to legitimately help his clients as well as Mob through some good ole fashion psychological therapy, ultimately teaching them that they don't need a psychic to gain the closure or stability they seek.\\n\\n\r\nIll stop here cause this review is long winded enough, but trust me, I could write a paper on this show if I wanted to.. that's just the kind of story Mob Psycho is... contrary to the complaints of it having dull characters and no plot as I've seen in some of the negative reviews.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like the art that's a matter of opinion.. however in terms of animation there is a strong case that this is the best in a decade. The paont on glass ED alone took close to 2 months to create!  I mean for gods sake these guys used PAINT.. as in ACTUAL PAINT. They witheld episodes from finishing and animated unfinished shadowing, they were mad scientists. French New Wave of animation. In terms of diversity of art style Mob Psycho sets a record of all time. The animation is smooth and flowing with one thing morphing into another and scenes bending into each other seamlessly. Each key animator was unique and left his mark for the discerning eye.\\n\\n\r\nYes it's weird, and crude in its designs, however that's the way the original material was designed. Its different; a breath of fresh air.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe effects and OST were just appropriate.. that's really the only word. As were the OP and ED.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've beaten it to death enough already ;) If you don't sit down and watch it, you're missing out.",

            "content": "English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes, anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review.\r\n- This review contains spoilers -\r\nMob Psycho 100 tells the adventures of the hustler Arataka Reigen and his student Shigeo Kageyama, know also as Mob, who has psychic powers while his master says he has but he doesn't, the story is set in a world where some people has psychic habilities which can be used for interfering both: the spiritual and the material dimension. It seems simple, and it can be considered as that, but the show's soul it's in the internal conflict ofour characters, and when this is well done, it makes something that seems simple special, and that's the case of this show.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 is a slice of life, consequently, the story sometimes is very soft in a narrative way, a good part of the series bases it's plot in seeing Shigeo day a day, his life in the school, his life in the house, his life in the job, you got the idea; it's in this slice of life section that we can get an approach to the conflict that Mob tries to reach: although he is really (really) powerfull and has no problem with his psychic jobs, he's really insecure, he's shy and socially clumsy, furthermore, he is prudent with his powers because he knows that, when unleashed, those powers are dangerous. Based on ths conflict, the story puts Shigeo in a variety of situations, most of them with a comic tone, where he is compromised by his insecurity and absence of confidence, but these situations are prretty normal, something that practically everyone has had to be in front of; this is a curious aspect because, altough he has this rare power and is very good with it, he's a normal guy, someone who has a normal life and who consider his psychic powers just as one hability more. But when the story wants to go further, it does it with a very good level, it can easily pass from a comic moment to a dramatic and vice versa, one example is episode 5, when Mob has to confront to Teruki, in this episode we pass from some jokes to action to dramatic moments to tension, etcetera, and it does it with a good rhythm and a nice use of transicions. The slice of lice aspect is very strong through the series till episode 8, at the end of it begins the Claw Arc, here we left aside the slice of life and we get already in a linear story, this is an interesting twist but the transition between the anterior arcs and this one feels a bit rushed, but after it begins, it goes in a nice way and finish with a good note.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the anterior paragraph, Shigeo as a characther is built around a conflict, the balance between his normal life and his psychic life, meanwhile he is completely overpowered as a psychic, he's relatively normal as a guy, even it could be said that he's a bit behind the average, so through a great part of the series Mob is in a search for getting normal habilities as physic resistance or sociability, motivated by the thinking that his powers are just an hability as any other; this is the center of the Shigeo character, but the rest of the characters have also some interestings treatments.\\n\r\nLet's begin with Reigen, he's a hustle, he states that he has psychic powers and he's the best that anyone could find, but he's a normal guy, he uses this lie as a fount of money, the jobs he does he does it for money, and he's not cheap, instead, he's really expensive, this reveal a vague morality, he doesn't care about lying to everyone in his seeking for money; but he has also some principles, for example, he was the person who teached to Mob that he must be prudent with his powers and musn't use it for damaging other people, in addition, although he uses Mob as a tool for getting money, he cares about him and people in general, a good example is in episode 1 when he is worried for Mob's integrity and yells him to leave the job, he was disposed to loss money for guarantee the life of Mob. In conclusion, he's someone avaricious, with some vagues concepts of morality, but someone who is disposed to don't hurt to anyone and protect to their close people.\\n\r\nAnother characther with a great weigth in the series is Ritsu, Shigeo's little brother, he is a nice guy who works as a support for Mob, but who is also afraid of what Mob is able to become when his powers are unleashed, although this fear to Mob's powers, he has wanted to have them since he was a child, he also wants to be a psychic, and when he finally get it, he loss the control and is consumed by the power; another aspect is that he sometimes won't worry about making unmoral things to get his objectives, although he's a nice guy, he's also cold and calculator, and if necessary, he will make aside his principles for get what he wants, one example would be the case in which he and the council's president conspired for blame to Onigawara and take him out of the equation, another one would be when he decided to join the psychic investigation with his brother's identity. Instead of the image of nice guy that he has, he take some questionable actions for his own good, but with the time he learns to redeem himself and fix the problem he caused; that's basically his arc in this season, someone who seems to be a good guy but who makes unmoral things, and after some kind of events, decide to redeem himself and leave aside his personal pretentions.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast has different treatments, like Ekubo, this spirit who was introduced as an enemy but decided to stay beside Mob; or Teruki, who begins as a complete opposite to Mob who thinks that his powers are everything he needs, but finish as an allied; or Tome, this strange girl who don't see anything special in him, but ask him for help, after knowing that he's a psychic, in the seeking of making reality her strange wishes; or the body builder club, who don't see any potential in Mob but decide to make him part of their club anyway; and a lot of supporting characters with a great amount of differences among them. I can say that all of them are interesting and pretty good, being for me the strongest point of the show: it's characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the points that I've saw more often, sometimes as a negative point for this show, is a comparison between Mob Psycho 100 and One Punch Man, two great works from author ONE, the similarities are obvious at a first look, but the differences between them are more than the similiraties; the most prominent resides in the main conflict: Saitama wants to feel more emotions because he feels that his life is too monotonous, while Mob wants to suppress his emotions because they can become him in a danger for the people around him; a simple difference but an important one when we talk about character development and execution. Along this one, there are much more differences which make each one of the shows to have an identity for itself, even if it's origin as works from the same author is visible.\\n\\n\r\nIn the technical aspect, Bones gave us a very good job with the animation, a great work which use an amount of different styles for emphasize the ideas it's presenting in the moment, all this below a style which is pretty recognizable and a bit psychodelic, giving it a more abstract atmosphere in addition to the supernatural nature of the story, maybe it has a little dye of cartoon style, but it manages to give it a good essence to the series. The work with sound was equally good, the OST is, as the animation, characterized by an amount of diferent styles, going from some instrumental pieces to a more synthetic melodies, all of them working together to give a sound that fits very well with the style of the series; the opening song \"99\" is pretty catchy, the animation has a psychedelic style and is very well done, to count from 1 to 100 never had been so exciting, personally, although it took some episodes for get me, this opening has become in one of my favourites; at the other side, we have the ending, \"Refrain Boy\", a good piece of rock which is pretty catchy also, accompanied by a really outstanding animation which has a unique visual style; the work of the seiyuus is excellent and give to the characters all the personality that the script has required from them.\\n\\n\r\nAll the aspects mentioned before let us enjoy this series without any major problem, the conjunction of all these aspects give us a series that is very enjoyable and, very probably, will let you hoping for more. A great experience through this twelve episodes which gave me a sunrise at the end of the journey.",

            "content": "I created an account just to write this review.\r\nStory: The story, while slightly analagous to one punch man, is not the same. Please take note that just because two stories have strong protagonists with muted emotions, it doesn't make it uncreative nor the same. Also, mob is not emotionless. He is a fleshed out character with motives that are clearly communicated with the audience. The core question being asked in the two stories are also vastly different. That being said, the story is well structured and paced. There is satisfaction in all the episodes that are directly related to having a premise that is wellset up and being followed through. It builds tension where it belongs and adds humor where it belongs. Well balanced and thoroughly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Please note that if you pause during action scenes, those snaps are not an indicator of the level or artwork in any given anime. Often times when trying to animate something fast, the frames in between need to be distorted in order for the personality/speed of the movement to come to life. The art in Mob Psycho is beautiful. There are things that are difficult to express through a physical medium. Particularly so for a character that feels a lot of emotions, but cannnot express them. The use of mixed mediums to express the less tangible ideas in the anime is brilliant. Like any given anime, there is a budget. I always pay attention to the decision making that must go behind the scene like where they choose to spend their budget. You can feel the weight of all the important/crucial moments and they were expressed in visually creative ways. From camera movement to choice of medium, everything feels with purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Solid, Sick OVA.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Everything about this anime feels deliberate and with purpose. If a character looks plain, there's a reason. If a character looks different, there is a reason. And these reasons go beyond needing to budget and spending precious character money on the main protagonists. Every single creative choice about the characters are deliberate and well designed. They take the time to go through different characters and to flesh them out in creative ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The best part about this anime is the level of satisfaction after watching it. You feel like you watched something different, creative, funny, dramatic and well balanced. I would highly recommend watching this series. It's a bop\\n\\n\r\nOverall: a well balanced show. If looking for something moody, avante garde, super conceptual, dark. Look elsewhere. This is a funny enjoyable series + character study. Those who like the feeling of not having their time wasted, should watch this show.",

When should I begin...\r\n. The story: I think the story in general is clear, original and super funny. I really enjoy the fact that the story mixed fantastic and slice of life. It's not super serious but it's not super funny either. It's the middle of the two, and it's great. \r\n. Art: I think the most characteristic point of this anime is the drawing of the characters. We have acontrast between the background, which is well draw, and the characters. The art of this anime is quite original and it's understable that some people don't really like this type of draw. For me, it doesn't really shocked me. In reality, i think that is original and well found. And i found a connection between those two types of art: the anime itself is a mx of serious and funny stuff, so the draw too. \\n\\n\r\n. Characters: I LOVE the characters of this anime! Mob is super cute and really attaching! He is calm, serious but so pure and innocent! I really like the fact that he didn't use his power to anything. He try to do something by himself, without his power and this... this is really good! I really enjoy the others characters like Reigen or the little brother of Mob! \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, i really loved this anime for all this reasons, and i recommended for all who likes adventure, funny and serious moments and action! \\n",

Of course, people will respect your opinion, but some will not. So when I first watched this show, it felt like I was forcing myself to enjoy the show. But deep inside, I knew that I wasn't enjoying it as much as I thought. And I don't know why. I hadn't done that before, so it was very confusing. \r\nBut that was it. I said that I loved watching the show when I really wasn't. \r\nSo, thenwe go forward 6 months, and it is the day before school starts after Christmas break. My mind didn't get over that I could accidentally wake up late, and that it would ruin the whole year. So I really wanted to go to sleep. And eventually, it happened. \\n\r\nBut then I woke up again.  I saw that there wasn't any sunlight coming through the curtain, but that is common for Sweden in January, so I just thought it was 6 am or something. But I looked at the clock, and it was 2 am. \\n\r\nI immediately panicked and didn't know what to do. Should I go to sleep, where there's a possibility that I wake up late? Or should I stay up and hope that I don't fall asleep. \\n\r\nAnd eventually, I decided to stay up. I know it was stupid, but I couldn\u00e4t risk waking up late.\\n\r\nSo I had to watch something to keep me awake. I knew I couldn't watch youtube all night, cause I knew I would run out of videos eventually. Then I got an idea. Since Mob Psycho 100 was getting another season, and I hadn't watched the first episode yet, I decided that I could rewatch the first season. And it was a really good experience.\\n\r\nIt is one of the first shows in a long time that I could watch 10 episodes of in a row. And that's where I noticed more of the themes in the show. Always striving for self-improvement. And that's something that was really interesting about the show. Cause in many shounen shows, the main character is born with powers, and that's how they save the world. They might change throughout the show, but they rarely try to become better people. And that's where Shigeo from Mob Psycho differs. Cause rather than using his powers to become popular, he tries to become something more. Cause inside, he feels that if his powers weren't there, then he wouldn't be anything. So that's kind of what the show is about IMO. How Shigeo tries to not use his powers and to become a better person. And that's what makes his character so powerful. That's what makes him unique. \\n\\n\r\nBut there was also another aspect that was handled as well. But I would recommend watching the show before reading this part.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the show, we are introduced to Reigen. He is a con-artist, and at first, we believe that he manipulates mob and uses his powers for money. Even though he gives Shigeo a wage, it is very small. He tricks him into believing that he also has powers. That \"I have different power, so you can't sense it\", or that \"I can't sense the ghost cause it's too small\". \\n\r\nBut as the series goes, Reigen is probably the best person on the show. He is the one that tells Shigeo to not use his powers on other people. Or that it's okay to run away if you're scared.\\n\r\nAnd it is at the very end that we see how important Shigeo and Reigens relationship is. How Reigen made Shigeo think that he had powers so that he could relate to someone. So that he could talk to someone, without feeling weird\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the best thing about Mob Psycho 100. How human the characters feel, even though the show doesn't look like it would give you that\\n\\n\\n\r\nSolid 9/10",

But the show pokes fun at the trope of the \"special one\", while still being a pretty cool representation of it. \r\nThere is a particular vision and theme that comes across well right till the very end. The show was immensely enjoyable while still having a clear message to give. \r\nThe protagonist, although possessing awesome power, is purposefully written to be uncharismatic and designed to look bland. It can be tricky pulling off this kindof character but he is likable and you can't help respecting him by the end. \\n\\n\r\nWhat also deserves mentioning is the gorgeous artwork, which is reason enough to like the show. \\n\\n\r\nI'll probably watch it again someday. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I love that my review was taken down, Thank you MAL. I'm reposting it for anyone who hasn't read it .\r\nAt first glance Mob Psycho 100 is another brilliant comedy written by ONE, the same author of One Punch Man, however, upon further viewership, there is much more to be seen. Mob Psycho is actually a character driven story supplemented by humor and the occasional action sequence. I recommend Mob Psycho to everyone on this planet and encourage them to watch and to be surprised, just as I was when they realize they are no longer watching a simple comedy, but complex character story.\r\n--Story\r\n9/10\r\nFor thefirst four or so episodes, the element of plot in the show is reminiscent of One Punch Man, where we follow our protagonist and watch as he must handle encounters with spirits ,in OPM it was monsters, and along the way comedic situations take place. As we watch further however the show becomes much more psychological. An underlying story about insecurity and self-worth is set up. We see characters struggle with how others define them, and how the define themselves. I was quite surprised by this transition myself, thinking it would only be a phase in the show, however, I greatly welcomed it. With the focus shifting to a character driven story, and an almost existential one at that, Mob Psycho 100's story will make you laugh one second, and then have you engaged in a serious emotional scene the next.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100's story is still an enigma , there is no underlying A to B story , as of yet, however, the current state of the show implies a main character driven story, with conflict arising out of interpersonal discoveries soon to come.\\n\\n\r\n--Art\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe the art in one word it would be , eccentric.\\n\r\nThe art is intentionally designed in such a way to stay faithful to the manga's style, which serves the show well. The translation of the character design and backgrounds from manga to anime are quite impressive, managing to make what some may call an ugly or rustic art style, look clean and modern. The animation is not always fluid, however, this was done intentionally not only to preserve authenticity to the manga for authenticates sake but for comedic purposes as well. The somewhat choppy animation style is pivotal for the comedy of the show. Constantly cutting in and out between close-ups and reactions, and the surrounding area supplies the joke. Mob Psycho 100 is also able to supplement its unique art style with vivid colors which add to the outlandishness of the shows comedy and the visceral nature of its emotional sequences. Characters emotions are displayed with colors, anger and malign are shown with blacks swirling through a myriad of blue and red. The viewer is subconsciously told based on the color, and the art what a character is feeling. During the action sequences, Mob Psycho 100 becomes a whole different beast. The animation easily rivals OPM in these segments, it is just incredible.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 adapts the manga's art style in the best way possible, making it bright, flashy, and at times chilling. During action sequences, the animation is some of the highest quality I have seen.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the art, the sound of the show builds up comedic timing. In a moment the soundtrack will switch from tense to slapstick.\\n\r\nThe OP of the show is great. It's upbeat and almost psychedelic nature really prepare the viewer for the show to come.\\n\\n\r\n--Character\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nI consider Characters the most important part of any show, and we do have some interesting characters. Arataka is a huckster of exorcisms and a teacher figure to Mob. Arataka maintains a confident persona on his exterior in order to influence those around him. Arataka is also not afraid to mislead or lie to others . He makes an interesting foil to Mob, an innocent , and naive, a boy who is neither athletic nor intelligent. The one thing that he has confidence in are his psychic powers. Proclaiming that spirits who frighten Arataka, are not strong at all. Unlike with Saitama in OPM, Mob has a personality. He is shy and insecure about himself. Characters in Mob Psycho 100 feel genuine, they struggle, they display emotion, and they actually seek development. This is the most incredible part of the show. That, as of now, the show revolves around characters who want to change.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nIn the first rendition of this review, I wrote that you will not be challenged to think while watching this show, I was wrong. Mob Psycho 100 may not be as intellectually taxing as Shakespeare, but the character development and interaction definitely warrants your full attention. The comedy is hilarious, the action is jaw dropping, and the characters are not only interesting but inspiring. You will enjoy all 20 minutes of this show, and you may even learn something from it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nMy updated rating for Mob Psycho would be a 9.5.\\n\r\nA show that sucks you in with comedic genius and stunning action sequences, and keeps you around with genuine characters that the audience becomes inextricably attached to, that is Mob Psycho 100.\\n\\n",

Maybe that's why mob looks up to him like that.

            "content": "Oooh. This one isn't going to be easy one.\r\nHello everyone, ladies; gents; people; phantoms; espers etc.  (see what I did there?)\r\nWelcome, to a new review. \r\nNow, usually when it comes to (my) reviews, I usually score the anime first before going straight into review to get a good enough idea of how exactly I should write it out. However, at the time of writing this review, I have no score I can give to Mob Psycho 100 because of one simple reason; I have no idea how to feel about this series.\r\nLet me explain.\r\nPlot:\r\nMob Psycho 100 revolves around a young boy (apparently a 14year old child), Kageyama Shigeo (a.k.a \"Mob\"), who has psychic powers. Yes, when I say psychic powers I do indeed mean the bending spoon trick we all wanted to master at one point in our life. Ever since childhood, he was capable of bending spoons and lifting objects in the air. However, one day an accident occurred, which caused Mob to hide his powers and try to live a normal life as a normal kid. Along with his mentor, Reigen Arataka (who is a normal human being btw), Mob lives his life as a normal 8th grader and works alongside of Reigen to help him exorcise yokai because...you know, Reigen is pretty useless. That is, until Mob's younger brother (Kageyama Ritsu), accidentally gets himself involved into some awful shit. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the story is pretty straight forwards and can seem pretty bland to anyone who have seen animes with similar synopsis, however, there is just a bit more to that. By the time this review is up, Mob psycho 100 has ended, but there's possibility that more will come. Let\u2019s all hope that more WILL come or I\u2019m sure we will all lose our minds. \\n\\n\r\nOriginal author of the comic (ONE), seems to have way more in store for us than the anime left us with (also I'm pretty sure the manga is still on-going but I don't read mangas), making me believe that there is way more to this plot than what we were left with on episode 12.\\n\\n\r\nSee, this is where my problem begins; last time I've watched an anime like this (meaning it ended on a cliff-hanger), it left me with exactly same feeling as I felt for MP100 (that anime was Bungou stray dogs and S2 is already here to save us), it felt kinda rushed and unfinished, but at the same time it felt like the anime completed something. It\u2019s like you've played a video game, won and had ability to go back to your normal routine before the action of the game started. Its looping back on itself but it\u2019s rewarding at the same time, it gives you an idea that you've gone a long way and now it\u2019s time for you to live your life like it was before, with a small changes or something like this.  \\n\r\nOf course, a lot of people will call this cheap and/or very unoriginal. I can see where these people would come from, as this seems like an awful ending to something that might\u2019ve took them 6 episodes to really get into (which is a huge negative but I will get into that later), it doesn\u2019t feel rewarding them and that is all ok. Not everyone is going to like this type of ending, it really is hard to like the anime after that, and makes you feel like you just wasted few hours (or maybe days) watching this anime only to have a middle finger thrown at you.\\n\r\nHowever, as much as I would like to say that I agree with these people, I cannot. Here\u2019s why:\\n\r\nI personally  spent two days to finish this anime, getting up to episode 8, as soon realising that I was in love with it so much that it felt awful for it suddenly end on me. And I would like to underline that I went into this anime knowing I will love it yet my expectations were already low. The reason behind it is because of the fact that if the anime is highly hyped, it usually makes people who really aren't hyped about feel like this anime is really just overrated. That\u2019s basically how I felt when first starting this anime. \\n\r\nAt the very beginning of this whole thing, I literally sat and had stared at the screen before putting my hands on my face. I really didn\u2019t want to watch it. So why did I watch it in the end? The plot honestly pulled me in, and I really didn't except for it to do, and maybe this is why I cannot agree with people who said that it\u2019s cheap and/or basic. MP100 gave me something I really needed for a while and that is a stable Anime Plot.\\n\r\nVisuals/sound track: \\n\r\nTo anyone who never watched One Punch man but watched Mob Psycho 100 (or vice versa), ONE is the author of the two animes/mangas. Of course, his style isn't the best and it seems like an amateur work when looked by art critics, but ONE managed to create quite good webcomics. Of course, his style is still visible in the animes themselves, at times even looking exactly like ONE's style, but of course with wonderful magical hands of Bones studios; we get a decent looking animes with a decent animation.\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to be 100% honest though, the animation style reminded me so much of MADHOUSE that I almost said that this anime was created by MADHOUSE. Please forgive me Studio Bones, you make great animations but you and MADHOUSE really have similar styles in some cases //SOBBING.\\n\r\nOf course, when it comes to animation, at times it can get so smooth it doesn't seem to fit the style itself, those occasions are rare however. It is very difficult to have a pleasing style and good animation to work with it, especially when the original style doesn't exactly look like something you would see a professional animator do (I apologize for criticizing ONE so much, please don't kill me, but he really does need to improve). \\n\\n\r\nOf course, I gave the art/animation a 6 out of 10 as it was pleasing to the eyes and managed to make my blood pump so hard I thought I'm gonna have a stroke. The animation was able to make my head hurt as so much adrenaline was running through it, and believe me when I say that not many animes are able to do that. Sure, there was some good action in Tokyo ghoul; attack on titan and FMA brotherhood (to name few popular ones), but I don't think these were able to give me the same vibe as MP100 did.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever it comes to sound track, I usually rely on my bad music tastes to help me out, but so far I couldn't listen to any of the tracks and let my music taste take over as some of the soundtrack sounded better than the other. And I'm saying this after hearing the OST in the anime itself (I really need to listen to real OST, don't I?). Problem with me is that I hate to listen to OST outside of the anime as it seems out of place. Without characters talking or some sound effects breaking in to muffle the sound track, it just feels weird. It might just be, but it\u2019s better for me to judge a soundtrack while its playing in the background as the anime goes, rather than listen to it separately. If I were to judge it however, I would say that OP; ED and OST were good. I wouldn't have rated it otherwise- That is, really all I can say about this part.\\n\r\nCan we just say how the OP is literally by MOB CHOIR and it\u2019s called \u201c99\u201d?\\n\r\nLike, only time this number is said is at the very end. \\n\r\nEh, whatever, the op is catchy enough to keep me glued to it even as I am writing this review.\\n\r\n//JAMS TO OP\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\n//BREATHES\\n\r\nTHIS ONE IS GONNA BE DIFFICULT.\\n\\n\r\nMob.\\n\r\nOmfw, I will sound like a worst fangirl ever, but I fucking love Mob. Like that episode WHEN HE WORE PINK HOODIE, HE LOOKED SO CUTE LIKE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Also, he is like the cutest Cinnamon Roll that gets serious only when he wants to, and he\u2019s been raised by a fucking faker to be a gentleman, HE DIDN'T WANTED TO FIGHT A WOMAN. Little baby needs hugs I swear to World. Oh, don\u2019t piss him off though, he will fight you and fuck you up. Like, stay on his good side and hope to all that you love that his explosion meter didn't hit 100% (or that he didn't pass out on you, not even God will save your ass once he\u2019s out). If I do this meme with 3 fictional characters being used as a description of me, I would totally use him. ALSO HE APPARENTLY HAS ANEMIA, I NEVER FELT LIKE I CAN RELATE TO A CHARACTER SO MUCH BEFORE!\\n\r\nMy heart is killing me, omfw. \\n\r\n//DEAD\\n\\n\r\nOk, Fangirl mode is off.\\n\\n\r\nOk I am 100% serious now, I did like seeing Mob being that naive little kid that forgives way too easily and follows his mentor like a lost puppy (I can't, I just imagined this jfc Kira stay focused). And of course, I loved to see Dimple (Ekubo to those who didn't have his name translated) trying to act all high and mighty when in reality he was weaker than me (that joke will never get old). But there were some problems with other main characters (at least with one of them), and that problem was that although there was some strong character interaction and improvement, there wasn't much screen time for one main character. For those who already watched the show, I'm pretty sure you know who I'm on about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as a person who usually bonds with characters within span of few episodes, it was hard for me to really like that character because of how little screen time he had. At times I even forgot he was a thing, and for those who are still scratching their heads as to who tf I'm on about, it\u2019s Reigen. I'm talking Reigen. I do like the fact that he is voiced by the same VA who voiced Osomatsu\u2026.I like this trash of an anime. I can relate to them, because I am such huge trash myself. I like trash. \\n\r\nAlso, is it me, or does Sakurai mostly voices trashes? No? Only me? Ok.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I loved how different the characters looked compared to the usual typical looking characters. The style gave them this unique look which usually doesn't change much as their designs are flat and all, but in this case the art style really saved everything. Just to clarify something, I am not referring to the first \"villain\" or the rest of the villains; I'm mostly talking about our main characters and few background ones. Please don't come at me with knives and guns, please, thank you.\\n\\n\r\nCan we just talk about how much time it took Ritsu to finally accept that this brotherly act wasn't a fucking act? Like seriously dude, you feared him, ok, but you loved him too\\n\r\nStfu now.\\n\r\nGo bend some spoons or something.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I have to admit, Ritsu wasn't (and still kinda isn't) my favourite and I didn't disliked him even though that he has good reasons to be jealous of his older brother and fear him (I mean, come on, DUDE CAN BEND SPOONS; YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN HE MIGHT SNAP AND BEND YOU LIKE A FUCKING SPOON), I guess I was just too overprotective over Mob. I will say this though, I'm glad he got some of his brain back that he lost. I'm really glad.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure you all are waiting for me to shut up and just finally give this anime a score so you can go ahead and watch it. Well, like I said earlier, this is where my problem beings. I've said everything I needed to say about this anime, I even reviewed it as best I could, but I am still left with this awful feeling that Bungou stray dogs left me with (until my friend told me about season 2). I cannot exactly rate it as gives me a feeling that this anime isn't even finished. Because it isn't, and as a person who rarely reads mangas (I am planning on changing that though), I really cannot feel complete until I see season 2 of this bitch or maybe even a fucking season 3.\\n\\n\r\nBut, if you were to ask me: \"is this show even worth watching?\u201d even with me feeling conflicted about the ending of it and whether or not I want to rate it 10 or 1, I would answer; go fucking watch it.\\n\r\nBecause it really is, worth watching. This anime is a piss take, but believe me when I say it\u2019s a good piss take. That doesn't sound right but it\u2019s my review. I can say almost anything I want here as long as it stops you or encourages you to either read the manga or watch this anime. So go and fucking watch it, you can hate me later <3\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helped a least a little.\\n\\n\r\nThis is IKira-n\\n\r\nSigning out.\\n",

            "content": "After finishing One Punch Man I didn't know what to do with my life. So imagine my delight when I saw there was another series out by the same author. And dare I say I've been enjoying it even more than One Punch Man!\r\nMob Psycho 100 follows the story of Shigeo, nicknamed Mob, a young boy who for as long as he can remember has had psychic powers. Mob just wants to be a regular middle schooler, but having psychic abilities and being \"normal\" don't really mix.\r\nStory: \r\nI was drawn in from the very first minute of episode 1. There's never a boring moment inthis show, from exorcising spirits to the main character's amusing/kind of adorable attempts to become popular. The show actually becomes much deeper as well, on the onset it might seem like just another comedy but psychological themes start to take birth as the story progresses. Just know you'll find yourself sucked into the world of Mob Psycho 100.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art might take some getting used to. When I first saw it my initial thought was, \"What the hell is this crap?\" I still don't think it's the best but now I view it as one of the things that makes this show so unique. Also whenever there's a fight or an exorcism be prepared to have an eyegasm from all the colors.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAt first Mob might seem like a monotonous character but you'll soon find out there's so much more than meets the eye (He literally goes from 0 to 100). All the characters are engaging and well thought out from Reigen, the main character's con psychic mentor who's not even psychic to the mc's little brother who starts to become resentful of him because of his psychic powers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThis is definitely a one of a kind anime and I recommend it to everyone. So what are you waiting for? Quit reading this and go watch episode 1!",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 is written by the same mangaka of One Punch Man, ONE. That doesn't say much, because what matters is who adapts this story rather than knowing the original creator. Madhouse did a very awesome job at adapting One Punch Man, but I think the best possible case of adapting ONE's story has been done by anime studio Bones.\r\nThis comedy anime started as a pretty nice slice-of-life adventure of Mob and his spiritual mentor, Reigen Arataka. We see how they do their exorcism job and their daily life, all filled with misfits traits of these duo . It's cool to see something actuallytakes it pace slowly before building up until the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what I mean by building up is still not something that grandeur. The show still makes fun of self even at the finale, but at the same time still weirdly conveys a good message such as lean on to your friends and how to accept reality as it is. Reigen is still so light-headed as usual and maybe one of my favorite character throughout my watching history. My only bother with the whole series is when the side-plots are concluded in such a brief manner, but still, I have soft spot for the character progressions shown in the epilogue. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, besides seeing Mob and Reigen being funny, we were also introduced by characters such as Ritsu, Ekubo, and Teru. They have their own episode to actually construct their characters as why and how those people were made that way. To do this in 12 episode series needs a pretty good insight about the story, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nAll and all, even when it ended conclusively, a sign of wider plot was projected at the finale episode. While OPM got their second season, I also want to believe that this underrated anime was appreciated enough to get its sophomore season.\\n\\n\r\nFunny dry jokes, sensible characters, and mix of pretty creative artwork are some of the reasons of this anime's greatness, but the most importantly is how they adapt it into something that feels coherent and to make sure that most episodes do really have point instead of just fooling around with the gimmicks.",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100.... When i first watch this anime. I thought that the 100%, or the percentage thing is suppose to represent the moment when our MC (shigeo kageyama) gone psycho or something. But it was alot more interesting than just that. This is like the typical anime's transformation thing in an anime. Like Eren turning into a titan, goku going super fucking saiyan, or the typical rage mode, or character's god mode or some shit. But this anime has done it differently, uniquely and interesting. The moment when our MC reached the 100%, that's just the outburst of emotions that our MC has keptenclosed (to not use his power at all in order to live a normal life). It could be anger, guilt, sadness, and all of the other potential emotions out there, with different latent abilities that has yet to be animated, or has already been.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may not be able to tolerate this anime's art style because it looks kinda sloppy, drawn by kids, drawn for kids, and some other non artsy artstyle because you usually came to watch an anime for em arts, rather than just solely the story. But for this anime, it fits. The good thing about this anime, aside from its terrible looking art that doesn't really bother me when i personally watched the anime, the fucking animation is insanely good. And btw the mangaka, or the main artist for mob psycho is the same dude who drew the manga for the original one. In which a fucking better artist (Yusuke Murata) decided to re draw it into a better quality. But all of that aside, that should pretty much tells you the reasons as to why the artwork for mob psycho is like that. But the thing that i like the most about this anime's artstyle is the paint brush, or just a very detail drawing of the character's face when it's not meant to be in color. It just makes this anime even more funny and so unique, that i personally like this artstyle alot. \\n\\n\r\nThe structure of the story follows a very clear indication of trying to introduce the characters, setting, personality of various characters, and showcase mob's insane psychic ability before the actual arc comes up. \\n\\n\r\nOn the outside, this may seem like a typical comedic anime but really, this anime has some of the deepest and logical argument in them. It's an argument that go against delusional beliefs of superiority just because you surpass at doing a certain things, in comparison to others that can't. And that changes once the people of the same talent came into your world of self delusion. And that's what i like about this anime's philosophy. And one of them of them included people who fail to grow up as an adult. One of the example that supports this would be those people in prison. Check out \"Gordon Ramsey prison ep 1\", type that on youtube. It's legitly educational in term of what we should identify em prisoner that hasn't actually committed murders, or charged for rape as. And it does add up to that belief that there are those people who abuse their power against the weaker individuals, still acts like a kid mentally despite being such a growth up. This applies to normal, or people in our society that hasn't commited crime as well. One of those being the singers, idols, business owner of a very big company, and those that fail to mature, or grow up through the period of time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd btw this anime is fucking lit, the action is amazing (animation and character's facial expression on the art style is insanely hyped), comedy is pretty fun (though may seem like the anime is buying time, or isn't really that necessary for the anime to progress), and the 100% hype is awesome. Give it a go if you haven't even watched this anime yet.",

Perhaps the art looks like something you wouldn\u2019t vibe with.  Or maybe it just sounds like something you\u2019ve seen done before. Whatever the reason, you cast it aside to the ever-growing graveyard of \u2018maybe if I\u2019m bored enough,\u2019 knowing full well that day may never come. For me, Mob Psycho 100 had fallen prey to that category. If it wasn\u2019t for a recommendation from a close friend, I probably would have never given Mob Psycho 100 the timeof day. When I finally got around to giving it a chance, I was blown away. What I had originally dismissed to be a One Punch Man knock-off turned out to be one of the most brilliantly innovative shows I\u2019ve seen in quite a while. In fact, I\u2019d go as far as saying that Mob Psycho 100 transcends the Shounen genre its often prescribed to. It is a show that avoids the pitfalls and tropes that often cripple Shounen narratives with a strong, colorful cast of unpredictable characters that all act consistently according to their motives and beliefs. It didn\u2019t take me long to realize that Mob Psycho 100 is the gem of 2016.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, we\u2019ve heard the story of Mob Psycho 100 before. The protagonist, Shigeo Kageyama (who also goes by Mob), is an average middle schooler who just wants to live a comfortable middle school life. Except as it turns out, he\u2019s actually not so normal. In fact, he\u2019s a powerful Esper whose skills are unrivaled. Rather than showcasing his skills to gain leverage against his peers, he actively hides them in hopes to live a normal life. If this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it literally parallels the story of Saitama in One Punch Man.  It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone to know that they\u2019re both made by the same creator, One. However, the similarities stop there.\\n\\n\r\nAfter being introduced to Mob\u2019s boss (and mentor), Reigen Arataka, it quickly becomes apparent that unlike Saitama, Mob is rather na\u00efve to the world. You see, Reigen poses as a powerful psychic for his own company, but he actually can\u2019t even see low level ghosts. Instead, he lures unsuspecting clients with his quick-tongue and bag of tricks to secure a job, only to have Mob finish the ghost extinguishing. Throughout the entire series, it\u2019s unclear whether Mob knows his mentor is a phony, but it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. Reigen isn\u2019t a one-dimensional gag character. He actually shows a surprising amount of compassion for his pupil, attempting to guide him onto the right path (on his own terms). After the first episode, It doesn\u2019t take long to realize that for all the comedic moments Mob Psycho 100 has, it\u2019s surprisingly serious.\\n\\n\r\nEvery scene in Mob Psycho 100 is purposeful, falling under a strong overarching narrative that propels the plot forward. When a character\u2019s ideals or beliefs come into question, it means something in the grand scheme of things. There are no coincidences. The characters constantly re-evaluate and reshape themselves, shifting the narrative in clever and often unforeseen ways. When Mob meets the evil spirit Dimple and vanquishes him, I would\u2019ve never guessed he would come back as a likable character. But he does and it\u2019s in a way that\u2019s consistent with the character\u2019s beliefs. As time goes on, we see Dimple reassess his values and, to our surprise, show a compassionate side for Mob. The best part is Dimple is only one of the many characters that shows an immense amount of emotional growth. There\u2019s so much more to the characters than they let on and that\u2019s what makes the series so awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThere is never a dull moment in Mob Psycho 100. When a battle erupts, the tension is felt consistently from the pulsating music, to the raw, expressive lines used to render the scenes.  The art alone is reason enough to watch this anime, if nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation should come to no surprise once you know that Studio Bones was behind it. They\u2019re known for such titles such as Space Dandy, Cowboy Bebop, Boku no Hero Academia, Soul Eater, and Full Metal Alchemist. It should also be mentioned that the art director was Ryou Kouno, who has worked on Space Dandy and Kaiba. Studio Bones did an outstanding job with the art, staying stylistically true to its Manga roots. There\u2019s a certain pencil-like quality present that gives the artwork a life of its own. This especially stands out during fights, when the lines begin to merge with a vibrant color palette. The fights are utterly breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\nIt should also be mentioned that the OP and ED of Mob Psycho are awesome jams. The remix at the end of episode 12 was among one of my favorites of the year.\\n\\n\r\nWhether you like beautiful animation, fun characters with over-the-top moments, or a story with a lot of substance, there\u2019s something in Mob Psycho 100 for everyone. If you were like me and had dismissed Mob Psycho 100 as a cheap imitation of One Punch Man, do yourself a favor and just give the series a try. You might just find yourself with a new favorite.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014 Palpable\u30fd(\u00b4\u25bd`)/\\n\\n\r\nFor more reviews like this, I review current and past animes at palpableemotion.wordpress.com",

            "content": "To shortly describe Mob Psycho 100, it is unique, due to the original graphic style. It looks like  a manga-animated style, but upgraded, with one of the best ways to animate it.\r\nThere are several reasons to like this anime:\r\nThe pacing: In Mob Psycho 100, you do no have any fast, or slow pacing, which brings the fact that it is nicely done. For 12 episodes, you have a great developpement of the story, compared to some other anime.\r\nThe characters: Every character has its own particularity, some may look alike, but they will always act differently. Some of the characters are very funny, other veryserious which gives a charm to every character, even for the secondary characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation: The animation is GREAT, for its style, it is well done. You won't find any bad animated scenes. You just have to see the fighting scenes to see the greatness of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is a good way to introduce yourself into this type of animation, with good characters, a good pacing, and a bit of humor.",

            "content": "Warning: the following review may contain spoiler.\r\nMob psycho 100 is a hard review for me to write, not because I won't do it justice (that's a given) but because it's just hard to explain. But I'll try to explain it to the best of my abilities and hopefully no one will want to crucify me.\r\nThe story is hard to explain, the show has a lot of different small plots, a lot of subplots and no main plot (at least in the beginning) the subplots all come together eventually to form a bigger plot, which leads to some more subplots which all eventually come together again,and through all of these we end up with a situation of Psychics invading a base of an organization made up of other Psychics known as claw, specifically there 7th division I belive. \\n\r\nEvery small thing and subplot leads to this much grander plot which takes up the later end of the show and i really like that everything matters and it's not just a case of subplots stay as subplots and never really amounting to the main plot in any real way.\\n\r\nEvery character (that gets a name) is also important and tons of the supporting cast actually have something to and do and help move the plot forward in some way shape or form.\\n\r\nNow as I said it's hard to talk about mob psycho and we would be here all day if I had to explain all the gears that make this plot machine run but it's very good and I like the connecting stories it also helps build the world and make it feel more alive and real, it\u2019s very well written.\\n\\n\r\nNow the presentation is easily Mob Psycho\u2019s strongest point. It uses a variety of different styles throughout the show one of which is extremely hard to do and very rare.\\n\r\nThe presentation is great because even when it's just being itself it doesn't look like your average anime. You see ONE isn't the best artist, in fact his art isn't really that good at all, he can't draw well, he's getting better over time but it's not good.\\n\r\nStudio bones went to great lengths to make sure his style was recreated well, they were able to make it look nice while still keeping the simple and slightly off drawing of the characters.\\n\r\nThis is further helped by the constantly changing art style, while it sometimes goes really detailed and dramatic but it can also get worse, lose colour and go into a much less detailed and well drawn face, think Nichijou.\\n\r\nIt's really hard to explain just how many styles there are and how much of an impact they have, plus the animation is so freaking smooth, I love smooth animation and let me tell you\u2026 This is smooth.\\n\r\nWith so many people jumping around and psychic powers flying all over the place it would be really obvious and really bad if the animation wasn't nice and smooth and had bad flow. Luckily the animators knew what they were doing and the fights and psychic powers look great in action.\\n\r\nHeck Mob Psycho won best fight scene for the anime awards 2016. It really is an amazingly animated show, I can't believe it didn't win best animation either, that was some bullshit, but that's getting off track.\\n\r\nNow let's get into the music, now I took way too long to write this review and so that might be part of the reason why I don't remember any of the background music, but yer I don't remember any of it which is the very opposite of memorable, so I'm gonna say it's unmemroable.\\n\r\nThat's just how it is but I will admit that it took me ages to write this so that could be apart of the problem. It's definitely not gonna help me remember it that's for sure. The opening and ending on the other hand, *deep breath* BOI!\\n\\n\r\nThey good.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for mob psycho 100 is easily one of the best anime openings ever made, it's greatly animated and is done in just a few shots, what I mean by that is that there are very little hard cuts, things morph and transform into different objects and move around to make for some great flow.\\n\r\nAlso it is absolutely packed with manga references which is a neat thing for fans of the manga to see and it also gives some nice foreshadowing, however this will only pay off if there are more seasons, which there needs to be.\\n\r\nAlso you don't need to know everything about the manga to enjoy the opening either, as I said I really enjoy it and I don't know shit about the manga, all that stuff I mentioned before is just cause  I do my research.\\n\r\nNow the ending is super important for a very specific reason and that's the style that it's done in. It's done with paint on glass animation which is done by using slow drying oil paint on a sheet of glass and then smearing it over and over in different ways to make all the individual frames.\\n\r\nIt's an extremely hard style of animation to pull off and it's also extremely rare as only one person in all of Japan is working and professionally trained in it, hence the rarity of it. \\n\r\nI wanna take a quick side note to say that it's a style used in the show to great effort on stuff like the spirits however I waited till now to talk about it since the entire ending is done like this and it looks amazing.\\n\r\nNot only is it extremely hard to do but it's also takes a very long time to do. But Mob Psycho blows it out of the water and the style of it along with the dynamic movement that comes of it makes it look really amazing. \\n\r\nThe ending also has a lot of small character moments, it focuses on Reigen a character we\u2019ll get to in a bit, in the morning, getting up and doing all the morning stuff before leaving for work and eventually running into mob on the way and that's where it ends.\\n\r\nThe character moments I was talking about are simple things like Reigen drinking some water before pouring the rest into the pot of a plant he has in his house, how he puts his shoes on and how color is restored when he runs into mob. There's also a great shot of mob slowly growing up, as he has been getting mentored by Reigen from a young age.\\n\r\nIt's a simple yet touching moment as it shows that despite Reigen kinda being a con artist he does actually solve people's problems and does really care about mob as well. Which helps further push that he only cons people so that they don't end up falling for a real con that won't help them, he just helps them and lie about how he did it.\\n\r\nIt's a really good ending and even if you decided not to watch the show I'd say try to find it on YouTube (a little hard since a Bones has been cracking down on Mob Psycho 100 content on YouTube.)\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also great, they each feel so right and fit the characters perfectly. Itou Setsuo hasn't done much but he did Mob really well, he was able to have that monotone vibe he has while also having strong moments where he shows great disdain and rage towards people, mainly the claw members after his brother is kidnapped.\\n\r\nSpeaking of his brother, Ritsu\u2019s voice actor Irino Miyu who has done a whole lot of work but is  currently on hiatus for studying. He did a really good job on Ritsu, Ritsu has a big important character arc within the show and he changes emotions and feeling a lot, he has a serious complex and Irino did a great job with it.\\n\r\nHe was able to cover the huge range he needed to in order to play this boy who has so many angles to him due to his ever changing situation and power complex, but more on ritsu later just know that the voice acting for him was spot on and very strong.\\n\r\nLastly I also wanna give special mention to Reigen\u2019s voice actor Sakurai Takahiro, an extremely well versed voice actor and if you haven't heard of him his props been in something you have seen if you have seen a good range of anime.\\n\r\nHim as Reigen is perfect, he is able to pull off the laid back tone that Reigen has while also giving off a vibe of authority and importance. He is the perfect fit for Reigen seeing as Reigen is basically a con man who has a kind heart and acts like he doesn't care about anything so much to a level where people just think his important.\\n\r\nThat might not sound like it makes much sense but just wait till I talk about him and you'll see what I mean.\\n\r\nWell, the presentation section ran a bit long but it really is where mob psycho shines the most and where it shines the second most is in its characters and after all the small info I've been dropping I'm sure you want to learn some more about these guys, so let's go, characters.\\n\\n\r\nMakes sense to start with Mob or Shigeo Kageyama. It's a bit hard to talk about Mob because he has a very monotone voice and doesn't really do too much. His whole thing is that he's a psychic and a very powerful one at that.\\n\r\nMob didn't have to train or work hard to get good either, he is just extremely talented with psychic abilities, Mob however doesn't believe that he is extremely special because of these powers, his had them his whole life and he's had Reigen as a mentor since he was young.\\n\r\nReigen has taught him that he's just very good with psychic powers, however everyone is good at something, people are just good at different things and there is no one thing that can make someone more special than anyone else.\\n\r\nMob also refuses to use his powers in order to harm anyone, at first, he later ends up retaliating at some people and he does also do it sometimes unconsciously when he gets a huge amount of stress put on him.\\n\r\nBut the point is that due to Reigen's teachings mob is a stand up guy who believes in not harming anyone and that just because he is good at something unique that doesn't make him special.\\n\r\nMob is basically an inside look on the idea of someone extremely talented who doesn't think they are and the way that plays on them, for instance Mob actually thinks that his brother Ritsu is extremely special and amazing since Ritsu is able to do all kinds of things and figure out all kinds of issues without having any psychic powers. I could go on but this review is already long and there's still a lot to go so I\u2019ll move on now.\\n\\n\r\nNow Ritsu Kageyama, Mobs brother. Ritsu is my favourite character from Mob Psycho, he has many layers of depth and a very strong character arc. Very early on he just seems like a perfectly normal and nice brother however he actually has a very serious inferiority complex.\\n\r\nThis is because he has no psychic abilities at all, he is good at other things, in fact his good at a lot of things, most things, but he has an issue with his lack of psychic abilities which are none as far as he knows.\\n\r\nRitsu stresses over this idea and eventually with help from Dimple he is able to awaken to his psychic powers, turns out he was simple just a late bloomer of sorts and always had the powers however he needs Dimple to control the output for a while but Ritsu eventually gets a feel for it and is able to use his powers on his own however they are weak compared to someone like Mob or Teruki although strong against just normal humans.\\n\r\nRitsu, unable to handle this kind of power becomes an eadg lord, this isn't helped by the fact that the student council president (Ritsu\u2019s the Vice President) makes a plan to frame a thug within the school in order to be able to get rid of him and hopefully improve the overall rating of the school and has Ritsu help, it works. Which leads Ritsu into a dark space.\\n\r\nDue to a series of events a bunch of gangs around town start to search for mob under the code name \u2018White T Poison\u2019 this is all very hard to explain without doing way too much story telling cause as I've stated the plot is very closely interwoven and every event matters. \\n\r\nBut basically they wanna fight him, however Ritsu ends up confronting gangs under this name and with his psychic abilities beats the crap out of them and this leads to a case of misunderstood identity and he gets kidnapped by claw as they think his Mob. Which leads to Mob and Teruki going to save him.\\n\r\nRitsu also leads a band of other people with weak and small psychic abilities to break out and then in the end help out with the overall fight, however they are mostly useless with only Ritsu, Mob, Teruki, Reigen, and Dimple doing anything of value.\\n\r\nRitsu however is someone like Teruki who believes that using psychic powers in order to harm others is okay as long as there is a good reason unlike Mob and Reigen who believe there is never a reason that validates harming another human with psychic abilities.\\n\r\nRitsu is easily the deepest character within Mob Psychos first season, all the others have great death it's just that Ritsu has a very clear and strong character arc throughout the whole of the season which is important and critical to propelling the plot forward. \\n\r\nRitsu also eventually learns that he doesn't need to be better than mob in psychic powers to satisfy his complex as once Mob, Teruki and himself get trapped in a room that invalidates psychic powers Mob says there is nothing to worry about since Ritsu is there and that Ritsu is so amazing that he will find a way out of it since Ritsu can figure anything out despite not having psychic powers.\\n\r\nRitsu is an extremely talented and smart young man who is held back by the belief that psychic powers make Mob better and worth more than him. Once again it all comes back to that central theme.\\n\\n\r\nTeruki Hanazawa is a boy who I believe is the same age as Mob who goes to a different school and at first believes that he is a huge hot shot and extremely special and important due to having psychic powers.\\n\r\n(It's almost like this show has good writing and a consistent tone, plot and theme. Imagine that, a well written anime.)\\n\r\nEventually he ends up facing Mob however Mob refuses to respond or retaliate in any way.\\n\r\nMob instead ties to convince Teruki that his powers don't make him any better than anyone else however all this does is agitate him further and eventually Teruki just goes absolutely berserk smashing mob through walls and punching him over and over, endlessly abusing him all the time yelling for him to fight back.\\n\r\nMob stays strong and true to his morals until he ends up unconscious and on the ground however due to the extreme stress of the situation and losing consciousness and thus control of himself he goes into his ???% mode which is even more powerful than his 100% mode. \\n\r\nHe ends up absolutely wiping out Teruki and the school they are in however in his last moments he puts it back together and this is the event that gains him the codename of \u2018White T Poison\u2019 due to the white tee he was wearing at the time.\\n\r\nSo Teruki obviously starts of as a bad guy and this whole event helps him see things differently, he still believes that people with psychic powers are better than mere normal humans however he can see that no matter how good someone is there always someone better and thus he is able to feel and act more like a normal human since he can see that he is nowhere near close to the best and most special person ever.\\n\r\nHis hair also suffered damage from his fight with Mob and now he has a wig that goes way too high, it's ridiculous and it's great, by end of the season his hair is back to normal since all the extra hair gets cut off during the invasion of the claw division hideout. \\n\r\nAs mentioned before Teruki believes that harming others with psychic abilities is justifiable, even after he becomes a good guy he still holds this belief and does so multiple times however all directed at enemies. Teruki is the one who notices something wrong with Ritsu and goes to get Mob and after Ritsu is kidnapped and Mob beaten, Teruki decides to help Mob out with getting Ritsu back and the two invade the claw division hideout and this is where Mob spends sometime actually harming others with his abilities before Reigen shows up and stops him from doing it anymore despite both Ritsu and Teruki screaming for him to fight back as it's the only way they are going to win since Ritsu is getting easily beaten and Teruki can only hold his own without making any ground. \\n\r\nTeruki is a strong character, like that's any surprise in mob psycho 100s case. Terukis character arc does basically end once he changes sides and then it's thanks to this arc that he then helps out and is a part of the rest of the season however in the final episode we can see the beginning of a new arc for him as he decides to help train the group of psychics that got trapped with Ritsu who are extremely weak, weaker even then Ritsu is and he does this in order to help them be able to fight back the next time another division of claw shows up.\\n\r\nWhich will definitely happen considering they showed up and wiped out an entire division, they have all made enemies with claw now. The group agree saying they don't just want to have Ritsu do all the work next time.\\n\\n\r\nReigen is simply put an awesome character, he\u2019s Mobs mentor and he\u2019s absolutely amazing, he's also technically a con artist but he's a con artist for all the right reasons. He helps people out with their problems in a way that actually helps them so that they can't get conned by a real con man who will just take there money and not even solve their problem.\\n\r\nFor example at one point a woman comes in with an issue and after asking a few questions Reigen knows it's just a simple back problem however this woman believes in spirits and such so she is only going to get conned if Reigen try's to tell her the truth which she won't truly believe, so Reigen gives her a massage saying that it's a way to drive out the spirit and then she feels better after wards, and thinks the spirit is gone plus Reigen gets payed, it's a win win situation.\\n\r\nHe lies to people however he is really helping them out and in the few situations where he does have to deal with a spirit he has Mob to sort that kind of thing out.\\n\r\nReigen as I'm sure you're aware by now lives by a very strong moral code about not harming other and not believing you are better then anyone for any reason but simply better at just one specific skill. \\n\r\nReigen also greatly cares about Mob. Since Mob was young he has been going to see Reigen regularly after one day showing up, saying, and then showing off his powers to Reigen.\\n\r\nReigen's greatest moment and something that just shows how good he is, is while mob and Teruki are raiding the claw base Reigen shows up out the front of the base and when the goons questions him he simply says he's here to see his associates.\\n\r\nDue to the wording and the fact that Reigen is extremely casual and clearly doesn't care that these people are questing him the goons think it\u2019s the main overall leader of claw who was planning to visit soon anyway so they thought he simply decided to show up early.\\n\r\nThe funny thing is that after going through the facility and Reigen pointing out the horrible morals at play and then helping Teruki, Mob and Ritsu to get out of the anti-psychic chamber he has all but gained the loyalty of the goons legitimately and so when the division leaders find out that they were all mistaken he tries to take his anger out on them but Reigen being the guy he is tells them all to run and genuinely cares about if they're okay and basically destroys the divisions lower ranks all together as they would all much rather follow Reigen.\\n\r\nThis also isn't the only case of Reigen being the one to save everyone, in reality Reigen is the true hero, of this first season at least.\\n\r\nWhich helps further emphasis his teachings when they turn out to be right, in fact he beats the higher ups of the division by simply showing that they're acting like children and not accepting the real world for how it is, with some help from Mob he\u2019s able to withstand their attacks.\\n\r\nSaying how he doesn't have powers and able to easily take what they're doing really helps drive the point home and that Reigen was right in saying that you don't have to use violence to handle these kind of situations, he simply out logics them only using psychic powers given to him from Mob in order to help hammer that point home to them and after all he doesn't attack any of them, the Psychic power only acts as a shield.\\n\r\nAfter having been given Mobs powers for a brief while Reigen is now able to see spirits however that's it and overall the psychic powers he got are all but gone unlike Ritsu who actually awoke to powers and has them naturally.\\n\r\nOverall Reigen is an awesome character who drives a lot of themes and points of the show and is great at hammering them home and being the main true hero of the story by taking apart the organisation by just being the guy he is and using absolutely no violence on his part.\\n\\n\r\nNow Dimple is an interesting character who I didn't see becoming important at all, at first he's someone who's running an underground cult that, like all cults, more or less tricks people into joining, however this is more like hypnosis.\\n\r\nEither way the trick used isn't able to work on mob at all and mob can see that the cult leader is actually being controlled by an evil spirit and so mob ends up fixing things and then leaves and everyone awakes from the cult they fell into and start to praise mob as they're God although this hasn't really been fully explored yet.\\n\r\nAfter Dimple is taken out he survives and then joins up with Ritsu. He tries to get Ritsu to consent to handing over his body to Dimple so that he can take over and from there eventually work to take over Mob however he didn't know that he was so weak that he can't even actually take over Ritsu at all and so instead he does help him out by controlling the output of his powers.\\n\r\nThat is until Ritsu decides he wants to pick a fight with mob and Dimple wants no part in that knowing how strong Mob is. Dimple ends up helping mob and Teruki in the claw division attack. After they take out someone Dimple is able to take control of them and uses that to sneak around the facility.\\n\r\nI have to say that Dimple has some pretty funny lines, I wouldn't say he's a pure comedic character because most of his quips and responses are just him being him and aren't exactly funny however at one point he wants to go through a door but some goons find it wierd and his excuse is just that he's never been through that door before and so he'd like to.\\n\r\nEventually dimple ends up running into a division leader who captures and has control of evil spirits, Sprite which seem much stronger then Dimple. I gotta say that Dimples fight with this guy is pretty fun and I wish they had done some more with it, hopefully we can get some more next season.\\n\r\nBut basically Dimple goes in and out of controlling the guy he was using as a vessel as well as going through the roof and wall at different points for some great manipulation of the battle and it's really neat to see, even if he does lose at first. I say at first because this guy just ends up locking Dimple in a jar with a bunch of the other spirits and his whole thing is that he keeps whoever wins the battle as another one of his spirits.\\n\r\nDimple wins and when his let out of the jar he just takes the guy out right away which I like, Dimple like Teruki starts out as a bad guy and in his heart he may still be one, however through a series of circumstances it almost feels like Dimple cares for Mob and Ritsu.\\n\r\nHe also did help take out at least one person in claw and so it feels like he's part of this team of heros.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy watching Mob Psycho 100 and while I can admit that the show is extremely well made and has very high production value, I didn\u2019t enjoy it nearly as well as I enjoyed something like New Game!\\n\r\nMob Psycho is amazingly written and presented and everyone who was a part of it clearly put in a very strong effort and churned out a show that's amazing in objective terms. However my reviews are subjective and it\u2019s more about my personal experience with a show and so enjoyment accounts for 50% of my score.\\n\r\nNow I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t enjoy it a lot, I think back on it and the show was really good and I understand the great value behind it and as you\u2019ve seen I\u2019ve done nothing but heap praise upon it, but something about it limited my enjoyment and the worst part is that I\u2019m not sure what that limiting factor is.\\n\r\nI think it might just be the lack of fun in the show, like I said all the quips didn't really seem funny to me and while the great writing is a huge plus for someone like me and I love the characters. It\u2019s all a bit too serious, you saw how often I mentioned the themes of the show and the message it was trying to push, maybe it just spent too much time on that.\\n\\n\r\nOr maybe I\u2019m just pure weeaboo trash who only like shows with moe girls being adorable and gay, who knows.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said guys I have to give Mob Psycho 100 an 8/10 please don\u2019t tell me to kill myself, cause I\u2019m not gonna do it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nStory - Extremely well written story where every moment a character has weight and importance and everything is tightly interwoven in the clear and careful ways, really well written guys.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation - Ho boi! The presentation is amazing, a nice blend of different styles from poorly drawn minimalist to highly detailed strong set pieces and everything in between and a whole ED made in one of the rarest art forms around and strong voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Absolutely stellar characters, each have strong character progression even if not full arcs, each character feels very real and are all extremely well written, one of the strongest anime casts ever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The show is either lacking fun witch limited enjoyment or I\u2019m just a worthless weeb who can\u2019t appreciate this great show as much due to a lack of gay moe girls.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I was in the fourth grade, I wanted to do what no other kid had done before: multiply together two really huge numbers.\r\nMy task was daunting, my obstacles numerous. For both my multiplier and multiplicand, I chose the number 777,777,777,777. My reasoning made sense: I wanted to practice writing out multiplication by hand and working on my sevens. I wasn\u2019t doing this project for school, and I wasn\u2019t getting any reward. I simply wanted to flex my mathematical skills as best as I could.\r\nI failed many times along the way. Carrying the wrong remainder,adding up the totals incorrectly, not giving myself enough room on the paper. Eventually, though, I succeeded. The answer? 604,938,271,603,728,395,061,729. (I wish I had memorized it.) And the byproduct of my product? A tight grasp on my multiples of seven and a sincere appreciation for the existence of calculators.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 does not deal with huge numbers, but that one hundred in the title signifies that it cares about digits to at least some extent.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 finds Mob, an overly timid and entirely too meek middle-school boy, with unimaginable psychic powers. Reigen, his \u201cmaster,\u201d is a spiritual guru and fraud, but watches over Mob as they take part in various supernatural phenomena. And as Mob\u2019s powers ramp up, he finds himself facing more than just misplaced emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThis debut season for Mob Psycho 100 means a lot. The first chance to entice audiences, prove itself, and generally show what it has got. And, for the most part, the anime does just that.\\n\\n\r\nFour arcs make up the narrative this time around: Introduction, Black Vinegar, Ritsu, and Claw. In the first arc, the different characters are presented and the premise is detailed. In the second arc, Mob\u2019s character conflict and the existence of other espers appear. In the third arc, Ritsu takes center stage. And in the fourth arc, the evil organization is confronted and defeated.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout all these arcs, the anime takes on the standard comedy, drama, and action fronts.\\n\\n\r\nFor its comedy, jokes heavily rely on exaggeration. Caricatures, screaming, ridiculous events, hyperbolic reactions. This contrast between the exaggerated jokes and the everyday depiction of Mob\u2019s life holds parallels to Mob\u2019s powers and himself. That is, the comedy adopts the \u201csame\u201d format as Mob\u2019s characterization, fitting within the show\u2019s overall intentions.\\n\\n\r\nFor its drama, the anime plays mostly on Mob and his relationship to Ritsu. Multiple flashbacks of Mob\u2019s childhood, the unfortunate incident that occurred, and nearly the entire second half of the season. Like the comedy, the drama holds close ties to Mob\u2019s powers since emotions drive his outbursts. In doing so, the drama not only serves to fill the plot but also acts as a key factor in supporting this vital aspect of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor its action, the anime has the advantage of imagination. \u201cPsychic powers\u201d leaves a lot of room to work with, and the anime uses that space as much as it can when it hurls projectiles, bounces enemies around a hallway, and produces gravity-defying death balls. Just as it was with the comedy and the drama, the action holds a higher purpose. In this case, it\u2019s the culmination of the two, allowing the characters to test their ideologies and conflict with or against one another.\\n\\n\r\nHaving each of the higher-level parts of the show connected to its overall premise demonstrates some writing chops. However, to be honest, this content as is does not come off as anything special. The kooky comedy, the brotherly drama, and the psychic action are fine for what they are but lack certain worthwhileness.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Mob Psycho 100 becomes worthwhile through the premise itself.\\n\\n\r\nMob\u2019s tale is an underdog one. Coupled with the select moments where he goes as all out as possible, the anime strikes a chord with its audience in showcasing a story filled with rooting and intensity. But, more than these qualities, the premise involves a lot of meaning.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s seen right in the show\u2019s title: 100. The anime often alludes to this number or at least the lead up to it. Mob\u2019s mental state creeps ever closer to that 100% breaking point, forcing him over the edge emotionally. It also serves as a comedic tool such as when the anime describes Teruki\u2019s new wig. But, again, it\u2019s mostly for Mob\u2019s mental state.\\n\\n\r\nOne way to describe Mob\u2019s build up is through a single term: potential. As is regularly seen, Mob has the most potential out of anybody alive thanks to his immeasurable powers. But it\u2019s more than just his powers; he has a wealth of potential as a human being. He trains his body in a club that doesn\u2019t suit him whatsoever. He befriends an esper like him despite the differences in ideology that they hold. He fights to save his brother Ritsu regardless of how the little bro treated the older.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost the entire season explores potential in some form. And not just with Mob. Reigen\u2019s potential as an adult and mentor. Ritsu\u2019s potential as a psychic and brother. The members of Claw and their potential as not-so-evil henchmen.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, the anime argues that everyone has the potential for greatness. While Mob may not be able to fully control his powers, Reigen may be a fraud, and Ritsu may lose sight of what truly matters, they prove that anybody has the potential to reach beyond their current state. That people really have no limits \u2013 except the ones they place on themselves.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 does not go without its own set of problems, though. Tsubomi, despite having a certain modicum of relevancy, gets oddly ignored. Unnecessary narration plagues some of the show\u2019s scenes. And Ritsu arguably earns way too much focus in the second half even though this anime is Mob\u2019s (title and all).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when the anime follows through on its events with satisfaction, like with Mob\u2019s duel against Teruki or the second \u201cfight\u201d between Mob and the kidnapper from Claw, it alleviates some of these issues. Coupled with its solid comedy, drama, action, and thematic exploration, the anime makes it hard to talk down on its story.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100\u2019s visuals are quite charming in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nNormally speaking, its style follows a polished roughness that capitalizes on simplicity, pushing forward its mechanisms for greater animated fluidity. However, the anime loves its over-the-top depictions.\\n\\n\r\nReigen\u2019s \u201cspecial abilities,\u201d many of the jokes, and the different reactions of the characters rely on extreme exaggeration to achieve their separate effects. Whether the scene shows a white page with just a few squiggly black lines drawn together into a face or the guys of the Body Improvement Club turn into statues with an intimidating glare, these more involved moments get at the show\u2019s brand of comedy as well as its focus on extra details.\\n\\n\r\nBut the show\u2019s best examples come from Mob\u2019s explosions. Upon breaking that 100% threshold, the anime takes on a new life of its own, showcasing some incredible artistry and attention to animation. The location crumbles around Mob, he moves with extraordinary speed, and his various actions take on hyper, imaginative outcomes. Often, all three are shown simultaneously. Indeed, Mob\u2019s everyday look combined with his incessant refusal of violence turn these contrasting scenes from simple entertainment to pure spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other designs of the characters, they work. Teruki\u2019s large wig gives him a comedic standing. Reigen\u2019s suit simultaneously masks his unprofessional career and highlights his adulthood. And Dimple\u2019s dimples are eponymous, but it\u2019s his green, gaseous form that reflects his equally smelly personality.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nMob is an uninteresting fellow. Less than average in all walks of life. He doesn\u2019t have very many friends, he doesn\u2019t take part in extracurricular activities, and he certainly cannot talk to girls without quaking in his sneakers.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what Mob lacks on a social level he makes up for on a psychic level. Mob can exorcise spirits, bend spoons, and control the space around him with undue ease. Reigen understands how incredible his powers are, so he took Mob in as an \u201capprentice\u201d to help him with these \u201cdifficult\u201d tasks.\\n\\n\r\nDespite his powers, he has never managed to obtain the life he has wanted. Part of that comes from his own characteristics. Part of that comes from Reigen and his teachings. Part of that comes from a bad accident involving Ritsu that he (subconsciously) holds in the back of his mind.\\n\\n\r\nThus, he has always kept his powers within himself, refusing to use them even when he can. In turn, this self-containment has led to his expressionless behavior. More specifically, it has kept his emotions corked, locked up inside him and ready to burst forth.\\n\\n\r\nBut they do more than just burst; they explode. In a torrent of hyperbole, Mob\u2019s feelings uncork, pushing him and his powers to their absolute limit. Rage, sadness, animosity, rejection, gratefulness. His emotions dominate his very person when he can no longer keep them in check, leading to dazzling displays of psychic mastery.\\n\\n\r\nMob does not like either extreme. He does not like how his bland personality prevents him from socializing with those around him, and he does not like the uncontrollable outbursts that overwhelm him. Thus, he tries his best to change himself. He joins the Body Improvement Club to make himself more fit and more confident (especially so that he can speak with Tsubomi). He looks up to his younger brother Ritsu as a role model. He seeks guidance from Reigen.\\n\\n\r\nThrough Mob\u2019s challenges and the people he interacts with on his way to improving his very being, a singular question is asked: What is one\u2019s self-worth? Mob Psycho 100\u2019s story tackles potential, a concept that holds close ties to self-worth. Where the former targets what someone can be, the latter targets what someone already is.\\n\\n\r\nTake Reigen. He has zero powers whatsoever and is the butt end of many jokes throughout the season. Essentially, Reigen is \u201cworthless.\u201d But, in actuality, he is the adult that gives wisdom to Mob. That is, Reigen\u2019s worth is not his job at \u201cSpirits and Such Consultation\u201d or the constant lies he makes about his nonexistent abilities. His worth comes from the fact that he helps Mob understand himself that much more, giving him the confidence and support he needs as a maturing teenager.\\n\\n\r\nThe same approach can be seen when discussing both Ritsu and Teruki but to a much greater degree since, with these two boys, their self-worth is directly explored, forming the basis for their conflicts and their eventual development.\\n\\n\r\nIn Ritsu\u2019s case, he does not feel as if he has reached his peak because, despite his success everywhere else, he does not have psychic abilities and therefore cannot compare to his older brother. His jealousy and his want to be like Mob spurs his negativity, leading to his subsequent obtainment of powers and his spiral downwards towards immorality.\\n\\n\r\nWhile he follows a dangerous path for a time, he thankfully corrects his behavior. Mob\u2019s prostration before the other thugs, Ritsu\u2019s leadership during the escape from the facility, and the reunion between the two prove to Ritsu that he already has power. That is, he understands that his self-worth stems from his reliability and penchant for always doing what\u2019s right no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nIn Teruki\u2019s case, he never felt below himself but instead priceless. His psychic powers allowed him to always get what he wanted whenever he wanted, inflating his ego as the head of the Black Vinegar School\u2019s gang, as the attention of the girls, and as the unopposed brawler.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when Mob appears, Teruki\u2019s worldview gets challenged. Mob contradicts Teruki\u2019s outlook, advocating nonviolence and passiveness in contrast to arrogance and aggressiveness. Their ideologies clash, and, in the end, Teruki gets put in his place. He comes to think less highly of himself, and, in doing so, discovers that his self-worth derives not from his \u201cgodly\u201d skills but instead his potency as a crucial friend.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Ritsu and Teruki, many of the side characters follow this theme on self-worth, too. Dimple represents what happens when self-worth is ignored altogether. The lesser psychic users who work with Ritsu to escape the facility represent that self-worth comes in all shapes and sizes. Tenga, the delinquent who Ritsu (unfairly) frames, represents that self-worth goes beyond surface-level descriptions and depictions.\\n\\n\r\nThese examples are not huge points or even overly important, but having even the extra cast members following the same direction makes for not only grander thematic exploration but also a higher level of execution overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about Mob?\\n\\n\r\nAs expected, Mob also highlights this theme on self-worth quite well. Many of those around him try to place value on him in different ways. Ritsu wants to be him. Teruki sees him as his rival. Reigen needs him for his abilities.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, Mob doesn\u2019t place any value on himself whatsoever. Where the others find worth in him in some form, he views himself as worthless. To him, his abilities have brought nothing but problems for these guys and everyone else he has encountered. And because he thinks he has nothing left to offer, his sense of self-worth plummets further.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as the audience understands, Mob does have self-worth. More so than anybody else around him, Mob has a determined sense of sincerity \u2013 both for himself and the ones he cares for. He does what he can to better his person, and he makes sure to be there for his friends and family. If nothing else, his refusal to use his abilities all willy-nilly and his loyalty to Reigen\u2019s teachings (don\u2019t use powers against people, don\u2019t hit women) highlight his sincere personality.\\n\\n\r\nTaken together, Mob and the rest of the cast capture the spirit of Mob Psycho 100 itself. A thoughtful mentor. A doting brother. A kind friend. A sincere boy. That is, one\u2019s self-worth comes not from some random psychic powers but rather from themselves. The actions made, the words shared, and the ideas upheld.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, self-worth is not defined by one\u2019s strengths \u2013 but instead by one\u2019s heart.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nOne of the better parts of Mob Psycho 100\u2019s sound direction is in the original soundtrack. It contains a lot of Egyptian, exotic influences that establish feelings of otherworldliness, coinciding with the psychic-power backdrop quite well. Other tracks, like the grating, foreboding piece that plays before Mob goes psycho and the guitar-laced, fast-paced piece that plays during, round out the OST to a fine sheen, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nEqually as impressive is the opening track. The various forms of counting provide progression and weirdness, the guitar riff in the first half is catchy, and the long, held notes of the vocalist add grandiosity where needed. Some of the English lyrics don\u2019t fit the tempo of the piece (\u201cIf everyone is not special\u2026\u201d), but the trailing instruments at the end and the general quickness of the song itself make the OP more than fun.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the ending track is worse than the OP, it has its strengths. Specifically, the guitar riff played at the beginning and the end stand out, and the uplifting nature of the song is undeniable. Unfortunately, much of the middle of the piece blurs together as the vocalist and the drums compete for the audience\u2019s ears.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting performances, nobody has anything too noteworthy. The only one is Setsuo Itou as Mob in his first main yet only second role ever. Mr. Itou performed nicely, voicing Mob with apathy throughout the season, unleashing those rare emotions whenever required.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe best way that I can personally describe this anime is that I recognize and appreciate what it did, but I would not call myself a fan. I don\u2019t hate the show; I\u2019m not that into it either.\\n\\n\r\nI like Mob for his underdog qualities and the awesome psychic powers he wields, but he is not too interesting to me. Same goes for Ritsu and Teruki. These two are not quirky or fun enough to make me care for them to any noticeable extent. And that\u2019s my biggest beef with the show; the main cast members lack appeal. Like any anime, not liking the characters makes for a less-than-favorable time.\\n\\n\r\nYet the worst offender was Reigen. His can-never-do-any-wrong attitude gets on my nerves, his \u201cabilities\u201d are not funny, and his fakeness, how he basically lies to Mob and uses the poor kid, turns him into an annoying character with ease. Reigen at least guides Mob with some nice wisdom, and his final fight against the members of Claw is a faux-berserk-Mob battle, so he isn\u2019t completely insufferable. But, if I had the option, I would remove Reigen from the anime entirely.\\n\\n\r\nThe high points for me were definitely Mob\u2019s wicked battles. Whenever he went berserk, the music started playing, and the effects were in full swing, I couldn\u2019t help but find it all impressive. His battle against the Claw kidnapper in the alleyway was easily my favorite of the bunch. Snapping concrete. Quick spooky frames. A Charizard-esque Seismic Toss freefall into slow-motion.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately (and understandably), the anime could not always show off Mob in a tirade. Instead, it often leaned back on its comedy which, sadly, was not to my liking either. Its over-the-top roots contained too many overreactions and obscenely goofy stylizations that rarely made me laugh. I preferred the more subdued moments, like when Mob\u2019s head was replaced with the drawing of him from the wanted poster. These comedic points were more natural and not blatant attempts at trying to get me to laugh.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 may not reach its favored percentage, but it does come together as an interesting show thanks to its solid narrative foundation, its artistic flair, and its theme on self-worth. Multiplied by its exotic-sounding soundtrack, this anime equates to a cool experience.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, action, drama, and comedy are supported by a theme on potential, but a few plot elements are noticeably weak\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, charming visuals in their own right, and incredible segments filled with lush movement, attention to detail, and intriguing artistry\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Mob, Reigen, Ritsu, and Teruki explore the concept of self-worth to a strong level\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, good OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, indifference to the plot and most of the cast, Reigen was more than annoying, the comedy was tiresome, but Mob\u2019s berserk moments were awesome\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "So I have watched this season two times now, and I just have to say that it is as great as the first time that I saw it! It's sooooo good and I can't help but to love and adore this series! The characters are so great and complex and I just enjoy them all. The people making this anime could just make episodes of the characters everyday life without a lot of action and I would love it all the same! \r\nFirst, Kageyama Shiego, also referred to as Mob, is one of our main characters and I love him sooo much! He is shouldseriously be referred to in the dictionary as the ultimate best boi. He is a middle schooler who is a bit socially awkward but he is getting better and it's so nice and he also has so much support from other characters in the anime, and it's so precious! Oh yeah, and he has physic powers and the animation that is used when he uses his powers are soooo good!! I love every singel moment that Mob is on screen! I just want to hug him and mush his cheeks and he is just so wholesomeeeee. \\n\\n\r\nThe second main character is Reigen Arataka, a very charismatic con-man. (I know that I have used this word a lot already but) I love him too because he really can talk himself out of EVERYTHING. He gets in so much trouble but he can get out of it just by talking and bullshitting his way out and he will leave without a scratch. And I got to say too that he is hilarious and the anime is really pulling a lot of jokes on him. People make fun of Reigen in the series and he is the only person to really have to go through that (since he can take it and won't really be bother by it. Everyone is usually very kind and polite to everyone else so :/ ).\\n\\n\r\nI think all characters are great but I can't really bother talking about EVERY character. But I just have to express my love for the body improvement club because they are so positive and encouraging and are just some really great people! Just btw.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now... the animation... Studio bones are doing such a great job with the animation! The intro is so great and the animation is so fluid and it's such an enjoyable time to just watch it all. They draw Reigen so good and everything is just GREAT and awesooooome!!\\n\\n\r\nI'm too tired to write more oops, bye! If you haven't watched Mob Pshycho 100 yet, you better! Because it's great!",

I loved that I got to see it 12 times, it was a mix if psychedelic and that white background style with Tokyo rock that reminds me of JSRF from my childhood. \r\nAnyways, we have a series that correctly utilizes the overpowered protagonist. There's a lesson learned here where you may have a skill set that won't match what you want out of life, yet you have to deal with it. This show does well in consistency, in humor and in all seriousness, meaning. It's a short storybut with a cookie crumb to another season I hope I get to see 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned how much I love the intro but the intro is just sprites from the whole show, I loved the art style here. They conveyed not only emotions well but comedy, and even if it's unintentional I enjoyed the psychedelic theme to all of this. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI have the song on my phone now I loved it, don't judge me 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were variant, the brothers were well contrasted. Every character was unique and interesting; I can't even say I disliked a character. I can't praise the design here enough, usually characters is where I have a huge issue in Anime so far but this is well done and artistic. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this Anime, I don't understand why I took so long to watch it though. Usually I binge watch a show overnight but this was one or two episodes a day deal. I wanted to savor it sort of, and I'm upset it's already over.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this gets 8 dimples of 10.",

Pens\u00e9 que era comedia pura y dura y dado que este no es de mis g\u00e9neros favoritos, no me animaba a darle una oportunidad.\r\nNada m\u00e1s lejos de la realidad, Mob Psycho 100 me sorprendi\u00f3 gratamente. Probablemente sea porque no ten\u00eda ninguna expectativa del anime, tambi\u00e9n. La trama me gust\u00f3 bastante, los cap\u00edtulos se me pasaban muy r\u00e1pido y me encontraba ri\u00e9ndome cada dos por tres a carcajadas (suele ser dif\u00edcil que me pase eso con un anime). No fue hasta mitad de la primeratemporada que me enganch\u00e9 por completo. No quiero entrar en spoilers pero Mob Psycho tiene personajes muy carism\u00e1ticos a los que les coges mucho cari\u00f1o (al menos en mi caso) y evidentemente tiene muchas m\u00e1s cosas que ofrecen a parte de echarte unas risas. Cuando quieres darte cuenta ya te has acabado la primera temporada.\\n\\n\r\nEn resumen, es un anime que le recomiendo a todo el mundo. En mi caso, pensaba cosas que no ten\u00edan nada que ver con la realidad y me sorprend\u00ed gratamente, a algunas personas les gustar\u00e1 m\u00e1s que a otras pero creo que vale la pena darle una oportunidad.\\n\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nI started this anime blindly, on the recommendation of a friend. Honestly I never had the intention to see it, it didn't attract my attention. I thought it was a pure and lasting comedy and since this is not my favorite genres, I was not encouraged to give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nNothing could be further from reality, Mob Psycho 100 pleasantly surprised me. Probably because I hadn't expectations of it, too. It wasn't until the middle of the first season that I was completely hooked. I don't want to enter into spoilers but Mob Psycho has very charismatic characters and obviously has many more things that offer a part of having a few laughs. When you want to realize you have already finished the first season.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's an anime that I recommend to everyone. In my case, I thought of something that had nothing to do with reality and I was pleasantly surprised, some people will like it more than others but I think it's worth giving it a try.",

However, this is not what makes Mob Psycho 100 so good. Mob Psycho 100 is hilarious and it's characters are all superb. Even some of the least significant characters, such as the ones in the Body Enhancement Club manage to make me laugh episode after episode. Just like in One Punch Man (made by the same people), the main character is incredibly powerful and as such, the main focus is rarely on the actual fighting and more on the comedy. Some peoplemay not like that every battle is basically a foregone conclusion, however it allows for more time to develop characters. Both the OP and the ED are superb, and the art in both the OP and whole story is both impressive and adds to the comedy. Finally, Mob is one of the most awesome yet pathetic characters you will ever see, which is why he is so likeable. Just do yourself a favour and find some time to watch this.",

            "content": "Rejoice, peasants, for you are fortunate enough to have 12 whole episodes of Mob Psycho 100 to watch.\r\nLet those who demand legitimization of this show\u2019s mastery look no further than these names: Yuzuru Tachikawa and Yoshimichi Kameda. That is all I need say. If just reading their names has not unequivocally convinced you of Mob Psycho\u2019s grandeur, then fear not, for all those who seek shall receive answers. Those who strive shall be rewarded. And those who accept shall find comfort and lasting happiness.\r\nYet for some, this knowledge is not enough.\r\nThey require strict adherence to the rules of propriety and demand things such as \u201cgoodplot\u201d and \u201cwell-developed characters\u201d. Dear peasants, I now say to you that while these things are certainly admirable, it is through faith in the sakuga gods and the blessings of their freely given graces that we are able to have such narrative elements in the first place. Therefore, any benefit or enjoyment derived these things is only secondary and made manifest by the glory our eyes feast upon.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, fear not, for \u201cgood plot\u201d and \u201ccharacters\u201d can be found here. Experience has evinced that it is unnecessary to repeat narrative details here when they have been expounded upon elsewhere. Therefore, I shall not belabor you with trivial specifications. The main character, Mob, provides a convincing look into psyche of genuinely kind-hearted individual who does not wish to be defined by his psychic powers, or rather, the burdensome expectations of a hierarchical society. His mentor Reigen portrays the nuanced dilemma of being a hypocrite who cares for others. At one point he says that someone who cons other is the worst kind of person, and because he is actually talking about himself, this is a very deep remark. Further important characters include a proud esper who learns how to truly live his life, and Mob\u2019s little brother who comes to realize the dangers of ardent longing and abuse of power. The amount of character development Mob Psycho plows through in it\u2019s short run is truly commendable. Exemplified here are just small pieces of the \u201cgood\u201d narrative elements found in the show. As for plot, the entire thing is a coming of age story (probably) interlaced with complex metaphors for the corrupt societal standards by which most individuals are bound nowadays.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI shall now endeavor to address several grievances which have been brought to my attention.\\n\\n\r\n1.  The story is scattered and takes a while to get going. \\n\r\nA valid concern. However, it would seem that the individuals who hold this opinion harbour an untoward bias redgarding shows with strong beginnings and therefore would give a better impression of their candor by waiting to see how the pieces fit together before making judgements. Often expectation are ill-founded, illusory, and detrimental to one\u2019s viewing experience. It is recommended that such preliminary opinions be set aside.\\n\\n\r\n2. Mob is emo and overpowered.\\n\r\nAt this point, we have degenerated into obstinacy. To hold this view, one must have decided that he or she will simply NOT enjoy this show. They are now dedicated to disseminating menial trivialities in an attempt to justify their perversity.\\n\\n\r\n3. It\u2019s over-animated or, conversely, it looks like crap.\\n\r\nThere exists an unfathomable abyss of bad opinions, and upon entering this domain one passes beyond the reach of reason. There is no more that must be said on this topic.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I oblige all peasants to consider the following: if a show has been bestowed upon us by the higher powers of sakuga, will not true visual satisfaction and awe-inspiring animation be its natural concomitants? Candid inquirers of truth will gain cognizance of true talent, and those who seek to believe will find that the door is open for those who wish to enter. Our faith in the beings behind this show will carry us through the mountains of mediocrity we face as we continue to view Japanese cartoons. This is greatness. This is anime.\\n\\n",

The latter half was also pretty good, I think I didnt really enjoy the villain characters as much but the hero characters make up forit\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very enjoyable show.

            "content": "Warning:\r\nMinor spoilers for Mob Psycho 100 and One Punch Man are possible\r\nI was flabbergasted when I found out ONE made another anime. Well Bones studio made it but you get the gist of it cause you are a good lil' boy, or a girl or whatever gender came up in the last few days.\r\nWhat is immediately obvious is that ONE has done a bit of recycling from One Punch Man. Main character has an emotionless face and is sort of emotionless himself. This coming from main characters extremely dangerous supernatural powers. However there are pretty big differences in how both work and what the showfocuses on, more about this later. For now I have to say that this anime focuses more on the character and his struggles rather than action,tho that might be due to less side characters who usually participated in fights in One Punch Man.\\n\\n\r\nAlright so art style. Now this is one of those cases where art style and animation are, I assume, supposed to look like manga. I love it by the way. Of course I could go and pick every part I like about it and talk about them for hours, okay maybe few dozen minutes, but instead I'll just mention a few. There are pretty hilarious facial expressions that have good comic timing, which is the key. Main characters powers look like a fast forwarded rave party, really colorful and flashy. For the first few episodes there aren't as many buildings reduced to smithereens as was the case in OPM but they do come to the point where cement gets destroyed easier than child's dreams. There's also moments where art style just goes an extra mile and looks almost exactly as a manga. Add to that some bizarre imagery that pop up and you've got visually pleasing anime. I gotta add that opening is bloody awesome visually and made me feel emotions again that I've squeezed out of my body trough excessive wanking over ONE and Araki's work.\\n\r\nThis anime gets an 8 only because I doubt everybody will consider this art as intriguing and enjoyable as I did, cause for me it's a 10.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound this anime doesn't go too far with it. There's an effect or two here and there but nothing extreme. The opening was a-ok ,tho the song on it's own isn't as good as it is in conjunction with the video part of opening. Here's a 7 cause english in the opening was actually decent, who would've seen that comin'.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get into that story sonny. Story revolves mostly around young Mob, it's a nickname but it's shorter and time sparing so shut it, and his struggles. I'll talk more about Mob as a character next but for now the thing that the story focuses on is Mob's lack of skill in anything but his telekinetic powers. Even tho main character sometimes gets called to exorcise ghosts Mob Psycho 100 feels pretty relatable.Apart from occasional ghosts popping up there's other espers such as himself who confront Mob. Overall I heavily enjoyed the story and there's some other elements in it I do not wish to spoil but are certainly interesting. Story gets a 9 cause it's not so much about ,,saving the world,, as it is a story about personal hardships. Now I'd give it a 10 but I felt there needed to be a bit more substance and if I'm anything it's nitpicky.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are pretty interesting. There's Mob's boss who exploits him but also teaches Mob some pretty useful life tips. There's a plethora of characters to find in this anime that I could talk about but that'd be spoiling a lot of anime, seeing how you can't talk about them without talking about parts of the story they show up in. Mob's somebody I ought to talk about a bit more, what with him being the main character and all that. This will be more of a difference between Mob and Saitama, from ONE's other work. See in Saitama the main character wasn't born with his powers he earned them trough ,,hard,, training while Mob is born with his powers. While that isn't much of a difference the reasons for them being almost devoid of emotions, which is something that is focused on in both cases, are. Saitama is simply bored, nigh limitless physical power isn't that fun when it removes all challenges in front of you it seems, while Mob has to constrain himself from using his super duper insta genocide powers cause he might hurt others which lead to him being extremely introverted. This time the core isn't that character is too strong but rather character being incompetent in everything else. For my finishing words on this matter I have to add that there's multiple characters that go trough some development and it was quite enjoyable following their journey, here's a 9 but that's mostly because what I've been treated to lately were completely boring characters that can't even be called stereotypes cause that require them to have any character. Tho others characters might rank lower, objectively I'd go for an 8 cause there most definitely are some that do not intrigue as much.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every single bit of Mob Psycho 100. In my eyes it's better than OPM in every aspect except maybe action, as there is very little of it overall. It made me laugh at times with it's basic but fun comedy. I mustn't forget some quotable paragraphs spoken out by Mob's boss that hold quite a lot of truth.The action was neat and overall design was everything I'd want from an anime. Here's a 10 cause my butthurt is gone now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime is neat,sweet and kept me in my seat. Here's a 9 and a recommendation although I wouldn't recommend it if you like romance and jittery crap bollocks like that cause there isn't any of that gobshite here.",

This is something that comes in every 5 years, something that blows everything else away.\r\nArt Style:\r\nSo why did I love it? Because of the art style for beginners, it doesn't stick with the mainstream style but instead creates it's own and doesn't even stick with that but uses it for the base and surrounds itself with other styles to bring out more emotion in certain places. Kudos to the art department.\r\nCharacters:\r\nEvery single character is charming in their own way. Mob, themain character is unique, he is a pacifist but you can see him change through episodes. His brother seems like a chill dude who Mob looks up to but as show progresses, we are being shown how he actually feels about everything. It's like every character is unique, even the side-side-characters are memorable.\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\r\nNothing goes as you have come to expect from animes, the climax isn't just some power show off contest, the actions aren't predictable over exaggerations of normal reactions but the plot itself is still quite average if you look at it as a whole. An evil organisation wants to take over the world and the main characters have to stop them. What makes it special is just how they do it, how they all come to be where they are, I seriously don't want to spoil anything, just go watch the anime for gods sake, please!\\n\\n\r\nYou can also check out anime reviews on my YouTube channel at MudanTV where I go deeper into the animes themselves. Any feedback is appreciated <3",

            "content": "\u201cSubdued\u201d is one of the last words I\u2019d usually attribute to a shonen/adventure anime series, but summer season standout Mob Psycho 100 exudes more than enough coziness to earn the descriptor. From the show\u2019s diluted color pallet to the ovoid curves of its Schulz-ian character design, there\u2019s enough invitation to ease comfortably into each episode while still having room to enjoy its supernatural subject matter and decidedly unsubtle sense of humor. \r\nConceived by One, (the pseudonymous creator of One Punch Man), Mob Psycho stems from the mangaka\u2019s penchant for overpowered protagonists whose respective crises of confidence often trump their limitless physical abilities. In the caseof the former title, One Punch Man\u2019s Saitama is a veteran vigilante superhero. Able to decimate any opponent with a single swing, he grows weary of effortless victory and sets off in search of a worthy challenger to little avail. For the latter series\u2019 titular Mob, a lack of assurance is the only obstacle standing between his current self and his boundless potential. Despite harboring a mastery of psychic powers, we find out early on that the Salt Middle School student works part time as an ill-paid assistant to quack clairvoyant Reigen. Unable to recognize his boss\u2019 obvious ineptitude, Mob seeks training and counsel from Reigen, who in turn happens to be a decent mentor. Aside from the unfortunate fact that he\u2019s exploiting the kid\u2019s power for profit, Reigen espouses a philosophy of humility and pacifism that his pupil takes to heart: even when provoked, Mob refuses to uses his extrasensory abilities. \\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s content to lead the quiet, overlooked life that he\u2019d afford subtracting his powers \u2013 though metaphysical intervention could help him pass a test or catch the attention of a crush, he remains firm in his abstinence from warping space and time. \\n\\n\r\nThough One Punch Man is an immensely enjoyable watch in its own right, it amounts to little more than a cosmic punchline with a 5-hour setup. Mob Psycho packs just as much self-aware fun as is predecessor, but does so with a greater sense of sincerity. Mob may be able to accomplish any task he can (literally) put his mind to, but his self-doubt is humanizing. \\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Studio Bones skillfully balances professionalism with the lo-fi clumsiness of its source material. Though I would have enjoyed a bit more evidence of One\u2019s rough, childlike artwork, the characters in Mob Psycho exude a warm sense of simplicity. They may resemble cut-and-pasted Habbo Hotel avatars with minor variations in hair or shape, but it is this subtlety that brings out the cast\u2019s individual personalities more than great detail might have. \\n\\n\r\nThe most pressing issue I have with the series lies in its main theme. Its cluttered J-Rock bombast clashes with the soundtrack\u2019s Animal Crossing sense of off-kilter twang. Luckily, the math-rock riffage of Mob\u2019s credit roll, accompanied by some lovely penciled animation, makes amends for the disappointing opener. \\n\\n\r\nThough not in my usual anime wheelhouse, Mob Psycho is an adventure series done right: light on the action, heavy on character development and world-building.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 is excellent, no question about it.  It's a wonderfully animated comedy that jumps between dry and dark humor without ever losing it's levity.  Most \"dark comedy\" anime I've seen eventually lose their humor, and you realize that you're just watching a character make jokes while they're slicing their way through a horde of innocents.  Mob Psycho 100 is an actual comedy, with a sense of absurdity that separates the real life dark elements from the genuine characters and weird situations.\r\nSpeaking of the characters, god damn are they great.  Shigeo is an adorable protagonist.  He nails the typical\"weird shy nerd\" stereotype and comes off as lovable - if not odd - rather than creepy.  Teruki is a true con man, and while a \"heart of gold\" Marie Sue at times he's enjoyable nonetheless.  And when Ritsu is introduced as Shigeos brother, you feel a genuine sadness from him.  He looks, acts, talks, sounds, hell even smells like a brother that feels he'll never be as good as Shigeo.\\n\\n\r\nBut, let's get to the main gimmick of Mob Psycho 100.  Shigeo is an absurdly powerful psychic, despite being a child.  And for the most part, he hides his ability.  However throughout the series there's a meter that builds whenever he's frustrated, sad, anxious, etc.  And when it hits 100 he lets everything out in a huge psychic burst.  And my god, it *feels* like a break when it happens.  Everything swells perfectly, the animation ramps up, the music starts blaring, it feels like a super saiyan \"You've fucked up now\" moment.  Very few shows manage to capture a real feeling of emotionally breaking, but Mob Psycho just nails it so well.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I can't say anything critical about the show.  It's a nine and not a ten mostly because it wasn't a life changing watch, but it doesn't need to be.  I'd recommend Mob Psycho 100 to anyone with a pulse and a sense of humor, and prepare to strap in for what will likely be an all night binge.",

            "content": "First of all, one punch man is not my favorite show. Though I liked that show very much but I don\u2019t think it was the best anime ever. For me it\u2019s just a good show watch when you are feeling bored, it\u2019s really enjoyable. But after the critically acclaimed and commercially successful OPM comes Mob psycho 100 by the same author. May be that\u2019s the reason for the hype. Even I was intrigued to watch this show. But does the anime live up to the hype? Let\u2019s find out.\r\nSTORY-  The story of mob psycho is not difficult to understand. It revolves around a teenageboy \u201cKageyama\u201d, who has strange psychic power and with the help of his mentor reigen we seen his day to day life struggle to control his power and gain respect and recognition from his peers without using his powers. As I told you before, the story of mob psycho 100 is simple yet powerful, we see kageyama who has destructive psychic power; try to live like a normal human whereas other people who have same powers use them for their own benefits.  But a powerful story does not imply that the show will be good, a good concept also needs a good execution. Now, let\u2019s find out he performance of mob psycho 100 in other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS- Most of the characters in mp100 is likeable, except for the few but I will talk about that later. First our lead character, \u201ckageyama shigeo\u201d, he has a calm attitude with an expressionless face. He has immense psychic power but always reluctant to use them because unlike other people with psychic powers he wants to prove his worth by his hard work and may be he is not much of a looker and he is not a good athlete and he is not good in studies either but he works really hard to improve himself. And that\u2019s the thing I liked about shigeo, not depending on his psychic powers and working his butt off to change himself, that is the difference between shigeo and other anime protagonists.  He is easily the most likeable character in the whole anime. Next Is Arataka Riegen, he is the mentor of shigeo and helps him to control his psychic powers. Though he is not a psychic himself in fact he is a con artist. He deceives his customers by making them believe that he is a psychic but he relies mostly on mob\u2019s psychic powers and some of his massage techniques but again he is not a bad guy because he does cure his employee\u2019s illness by one way or another. And the relationship between him and mob is the best part of the anime. Even though he is not a psychic he tries really hard to help mob.  He is clearly the most diverse and realistic anime character ever. And now we have shigeo\u2019s brother kageyama ritsu, Ritsu being shigeo\u2019s brother is total opposite of him. He is good in studies and also have good looks but he is jealous of his brothers psychic powers. From the outside he is shigeo\u2019s sweet little brother but from the inside he envied shigeo. But we see good development in ritsu in the end. At last we have Hanazawa teruki, who has also psychic powers like mob but he enjoys using his powers against others and inflicting pain on them. His battle with Mob is epic and hilarious. Then we have ekibo a.k.a Dimple, who is used as a comic relief but also serves as an important character. The only character I didn\u2019t like are the members of claw gang, till episode 9 it was a great show but suddenly mangaka created a villain out of nowhere. The members of claw  are the  bunch of  people having psychic powers whose goal is world domination. They are really clich\u00e9d and stereotypical shonen anime villains. Their leader is the most annoying of them all he reminds me of the second villain in sword art online.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION-  Well when I heard that mob psycho is being adapted by studio BONES, I was skeptical, and it is because the last few adaptations from bones were not that great. Though, those anime had good source material but when it comes to adaptation, we see a great drop in the quality if you compare it to their manga counterparts, whether it is my hero academia or snow white with a red hair. But this time bones did a great job, not only with the animation but also with the overall story telling. They didn\u2019t use any bright colors and gave a slightly dark atmosphere to the anime. But it actually fits and visually appealing. And when it comes to art style. It\u2019s  O.K, there\u2019s nothing special about it. We see uncanny similarity between MP100 and One punch man. Some fight scenes are well animated but sometimes we see fast moving camera angles and couldn\u2019t follow what\u2019s actually happening and I encountered the same problems with one punch man. But overall mob psycho 100 has a decent animation considering the budget involved but no way it is comparable to one punch man.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- The soundtrack of the anime is amazing, whether it is epic batltle music or the emotional one, it fits the anime completely but the opening of mob psycho 100 is one of the best openings of all time. The mob choir-99 written and composed by junichi sasaki is epic. Not only the music of the song is great but also visually it is well animated, again I have to thank studio bones for that. The ending \u201c All off- refrain boy\u201d is also good, it has a nice J-pop tune to it. Overall the music of Mob psycho100 is really good and it is something worth listening in a jukebox. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL \u2013 Overall , mob psycho is a very entertaining show. But is also has a deep meaning. We can actually see how kageyama struggles to find a place in the society. It tells us we don\u2019t need special powers to be special, , everyone has something but not everyone has everything and It teaches us an important lesson in life without being preachy and it\u2019s really hilarious . And thus for me, mob psycho 100 is the best anime of the year and it is the best shonen anime of all time. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

I had already expected that Shigeo would share similar characteristics with Saitama-- a naive yet strong, almost unsurpassed, character who cared nothing about their powers.\r\nTo be straight, I hated how the animations were made that I almost lost my interest for it . Maybe because I was used to the high class animations in other animes I had watched. After watching the anime, more mysteries surfaced and it gave me cravings for the next season. It is a masterpiece in its own sense and it would not hurtto wait for the next season. \\n\\n\r\nI love the characters and their developments. Just wanting to know how will they develop as the plot complicates and why was it that it seemed that the son of the Claw's Leader is still after Ritsu even after revealing that the real strong Kageyama was never him but Shigeo? It is worth anticipating, right?",

            "content": "From the same creator of One Punch Man, now we have Mob Psycho 100. \r\nThe title refers our \"hero\" Shigeo \"Mob\", a guy who works so hard to maintain the control of his powers that his personality was pratically erased. As ONES's previous work, the world of Mob Psycho is well set( we have espers and they are know, as those espers have diferent habilities), a main character who is absolutely overpowered, it have comedy on it, so, it was a huge success right?!?! WRONG!!! It's all because of one word... charisma... this show just lacks charisma... Mob is boring, his \"boss\" is boring, hisparents are boring  the storyline, boring, the girl that Mob likes... boring, the only light that i saw on the whole show, was his brother Ritsu, and Mob's interaction with him, there was i time, during the show that i even forgot that Mob was the mc(during his brother arc), because Shigeo is absolutely forgetable.\\n\r\nI'm not complaining about the cheesy characters, because that was definitely the author's intention, and it was funny.... sometimes.... but, it had no counterpoint... awesome action with cheesy characters with bad jokes, this is what this show is all about.\\n\r\nStory - Ok, ONE KNOWS how to make a story about a overpowered character, it makes you want to watch more, because the world that he created is interesting...\\n\r\nArt - I do like simple art, not every anime has to have that gorgeous animation with nice looking girls to do the job, the color concept, how he treated emotions through colors it was all nice...\\n\r\nSound - It's studio freaking BONES that we are talking about here, so, it is awesome, since the opening theme, from power sound effects, voices, it all mixes well with the show feel...\\n\r\nCharacter - Here is where the anime biggest flaw, i got the intention on make Mob kind of \"flat\", and i even agree with that, but, every character on the show was TOO MUCH, maybe that's why i liked the brother that much, it has depth, can't talk much about him otherwise i'll spoil the best part of the show.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - A fair story, with an interesting art, awesome sound from the creator of One Punch Man!!!! It was supposed to be a huge hit, right? Nope :( When it was good, man, it was AWESOME, but i was looking asside the incredible fight scenes something else that is good to talk about the show, but.. i couldn't find any... everything else was... \"meehhhh\".. whatever... ok...\\n\r\nOverall - If you are looking for a show with incredible fight sequences, this is for you, it have a lot of action, but, if you take this aspect and compare it with the rest, the show lacks a lot... I know that a lot of people gave incredible high rates for this show, and it is a must see, but if you like a good story along with your action show don't hold your expectations too high",

            "content": "Now here is an anime that I really, really enjoyed.  As I'm sure you are already aware, Mob Psycho 100's source material shares the same creator as the infamous One Punch Man... and if you enjoyed OPM I feel very confident you will like this one as well.  As for me... I think I prefer Mob Psycho.  I think the concept, while not as inherently comedic as OPM, goes a little bit deeper and has more of an interest factor.  However, my task here is to write a review for Mob Psycho itself, and not necessarily compare it to its \"animecousin\".\\n\\n\r\nIf I'm going to be honest, I saw this very page for Mob Psycho 100 before it aired, and while the synopsis was interesting to me I didn't much care for the animation style that the cover picture showed.  Even in the first episode, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it.  As the show went on, I found that the only reason I felt this way was that the animation was \"different\"... and even if it would never grow on me, I have to respect it when an anime sticks truly to its own style.  These days, animation quality is better than it ever has been, but styles seem to blend together in a \"cookie-cutter\" way that tends to make a lot of modern anime look \"alike\".  Mob Psycho 100 does not look like anything else.  Now that I've found an overly complicated way of telling you that it is \"unique\", I'd like to add that it DID grow on me... a lot.  By the end of this season, I LOVED the animation.  The intro itself is one of my all-time favorites for this reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the music... Wow, when it starts to hit the fan in this series, the music gets seriously awesome.  Unlike many other shows, I can specifically recall certain soundtrack pieces to mind in a very positive way.  The music seriously adds a lot to this show, and this is something that is always really enjoyable to witness in a good anime.  What else can I say, the music is pretty epic here.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for a comedic anime, the plot is actually somewhat \"serious\".  The majority of the humor comes from the characters rather than the situations they find themselves in.  Sometimes, the situations can actually get kind of dark and serious, and this was something I found myself enjoying quite a bit.  The story revolves heavily around the complex conflict within Mob, and the outside forces of the later story serve more to provoke this specific theme than anything in this first season.  I will say that every element the plot brought up from the first episode to the last episode remained very interesting to me... but the real story here is the characters and their relationships. And I really loved the characters in this anime.  As I said earlier, they provide most of the comedy in this show (and some of it had me seriously cracking up), but they also remain deep enough as characters that you can feel for them; you also learn to recognize each of their individual strengths and weaknesses, not in terms of power but in terms of personality, and this is something that always strongly appeals to me in watching a story in any medium.  \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, you may notice that I haven't really said anything negative about this anime yet.  There is a reason for this... I'm really hard-pressed to think of anything.  When I try to critique something, I feel it is important to explain both what people may like and DISLIKE about it... but I'm actually having a hard time with doing this right now.  I think the decisive factors to make someone dislike this anime would come down to something stylistic, in that the show's tone and even visual style just might not appeal to everyone.  And of course, everyone is different and of course there are people out there who don't like this anime for their own personally valid reasons.  This is my review though, and I guess I'm here to tell you that there isn't anything I disliked about this anime.  Honestly, it came very close to being a full 10/10 for me... and I think the only thing holding it back from that is the simple fact that I'd like to see it go a bit further.  Apparently there is enough material for another season, though, and if we get one and the show continues to ramp up the way it has been, it really could achieve that perfect rating from me.  I really loved and enjoyed this show thoroughly, and not only would I love another season but I am seriously motivated to try out the source material.  \\n\\n\r\nTry this anime if you like the concept of ESP or general sci-fi/supernatural anime, and expect a funny comedy with a lot of actual emotion and serious tones to go along with it.  Also a good watch for people who like characters they can get attached to... not to mention some good action with some very stylistic fights.  I highly recommend this one; it's a standard 12 episode season, and it's worth your time to give it a 3 episode trial to see if you end up liking it as much as I did.",

The story is endearing and interesting, a second-year middle school student, The Anime provides a meter that shows Shigeo's progress towards an explosion, in which all of his emotions that are bottled up show. It is fun to see when Shigeo's emotion(s) overflow and showcase a new side of him. The art and sound were decent. The character development was lacking due to the Anime only having 12 episodes.\r\nThis Anime is perfect for people who are just getting into the genre. It's not that complex to understandthe story and characters, and it's only 12 episodes. I definitely recommend this Anime to Novice and Experienced Anime viewers.\\n\\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It manages to be humorous, well directed, and well animated and just a gorgeous festival of eye candy.\r\nFirst, the elephant in the room. Mob Psycho 100 has an extremely ugly aesthetic for its artwork. I'm not the biggest fan of it, but after watching several episodes it grew on me.\r\nThe true heart of the show lies in the animation and its story. It follows the young Mob and his attempts to becomemore popular while working for his con artist boss Reigen. While he's busy liberating money from suckers, Reigen is still a pretty nice guy and has a good life philosophy of being a pacifist and an \"adult\". But then the show goes off into hilarious trolling moments of Reigen's \"special abilities.\" I also had quite a bit of respect for the way the show ended in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas the artwork isn't the greatest, the animation will go into wonderful sequences utilizing different angles for the camera and fluid movement. It's a real treat to watch.",

The quirky yet simplistic nature allows for the comedic moments to shine while also adding a raw, emotional flair to action sequences and more serious moments. I have immense respect towards the people who chose to adapt this series with such an unconventional style. It was an artistic risk that paid off greatly, in my opinion. \r\nAnimation, needless to say, is top-tier. \r\nSound: \r\nI don't have much to say here,other than I found it very enjoyable and, again, suitable to the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons I love this series and its writing so much is for the characters. I feel that characterization is handled with much care and thought. Character relationships and interactions are written with a touching realism. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, to me, feel very believable and human in their struggles and I truly enjoyed watching them grow. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nI wrote a lot about the more serious aspects of this series, but at the end of the day, Mob Psycho is just a lot of fun to watch!! There are a lot of great jokes, great fights, and plenty of excitement overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this series truly special is its light-hearted and comedic approach to sharing its themes. It wants you to have fun, while also giving you some useful, real-world advice. \\n\\n",

He however, doesn't just use his powers for nothing, but does exorcisms of evil spirits along with his master, Reigen. \r\nIn the show we watch Mob as he goes through all sorts of experiences dealing with evil spirits and other physics.

            "content": "For a spoken version, follow the link to my Youtube review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfz06IgGuDk\r\nSo Mob Psycho 100 is a new show that has generated a lot of talk amongst the anime community and its very understandable why. It's a show that, to me, played it incredibly safe which is something that can never hurt an anime. But it's art style, animation, and comedy allow it to just ooze with style. But we're going to talk about all that and more in my review of the anime Mob Psycho 100.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story for Mob Psycho 100 is slightly above average. It starts of in an episodic style for thefirst few episodes. I'm not too fond of episodic series because I feel like a formula that allows you to skip any episode in a given show and be fine is inherently flawed. And I even accidentally skipped episode 4 without realizing until midway through episode 5 witch proves my point. I was worried there would be an extreme lack of focus in the show, kind of just wandering aimlessly without a purpose not really knowing what it wants to be or a set goal in mind. But luckily it drops the episodic nature and interesting things start to develop. Story elements are introduced, and it finally starts to develop an underlying story. But a huge problem I found was that Mob Psycho 100, once it found its underlying story, really lacked the scale it needed to be great, and honestly left the watcher with lots to be desired. This entire evil organization called \"Claw,\" but only one division is showcased. 11 members of the upper echelon, but most are defeated in a matter of seconds. Which is what I mean by the lack of scale. It introduces story elements, but doesn't place much importance on the implifications of them. But honestly, all this really does is keep a good show from being amazing. Mob Psycho has enough to allow the watcher to have a blast with some amazing fight scenes, intense moments, and hilarious comedy. Although it lacks the scale, it doesn't do much to deter ones enjoyment and inhibit the natural charm the art style and comedy allow this show to provide. So the story is one that lacks focus in the beginning, but soon finds its goal only to lack the scale it needed and could have thrived off of. But that doesn't do much to detract from the anime's merit as a very enjoyable show, still retaining some great moments that are sure to be highlights of anime watchers despite this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are yet another slightly above average aspect. As I said before, the show plays it very safe, and because of this the characters are very cookie cutter, but they feel very genuine in their desire to get better. But when a show has art like this, it\u2019s ok to stay inside the lines sometimes. Mob is probably the highlight of the show. The poster boy for average motivations, he\u2019s the type to not want to rely on his psychic powers and not use them on people, but once provoked is an unstoppable monster. He seeks a lot of personal growth within the show, which is a definite plus, but what makes Mob stand out is his inverse relationship with his brother. This does enough to propel Mob forward and really make him stand out. Mob's brother, Ritsu, is actually a very interesting character especially in his dynamic with Mob, but the one thing holding him back is some empty words said in the middle episodes. The core of Ritsu's character is explored, but never really followed up on. They were some pretty powerful words to, but just lacked any follow-up. But his saving grace is his dynamic with Mob. What makes Mob's character more than your average protagonist works to help Ritsu's character as well, setting up some great moments in the anime. Reigen is Mob's mentor. He has a role within the story, so he's not completely useless, but really lacks a character to back him up. He gives Mob some advice that fuels his character and motivation, and this is where his significant role comes in, but he just doesn't have a ton of development. But what he does do is become a very enjoyable character in regards to comedy, and in this regards makes him incredibly lovable in his own right. Lastly is Teruki. He's a driving factor for Mob and helps him along the way. In terms of a character, he\u2019s given something of an episode to really show off his character, but not much more is known. The characters for Mob Psycho 100, play it very safe and by the book, which isn't really ever a bad thing especially with the charm to back it up. The cast is good, with the Kageyama brother's stealing the show and the rest to back them up. Their personalities work to amplify the comedy, and increase the show's enjoyment that much more.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThe art and animation is where Mob Psycho 100 gets its charm. The intensity of the art works, not only to supplement the comedy, but also works to make the moments in Mob Psycho 100 even more memorable. Characters emotions are shown through the use of colors such as blacks swirling through blues and reds to display anger. The viewer is told how the characters are feeling based on the art. The animations during the fight scenes is incredibly fluid and uses a large, psychedelic color pallet that is sure to stick in your brain. The character designs are also all eccentric and show the characters personalities and fit incredibly well with the setting and backgrounds. The art and animation are what you watch this anime for, and is where most of its charm and enjoyment are derived from. With an art style that complements the manga incredibly well with its use of psychedelic colors, eccentric and intense character expressions that amplify comedic scenes, and animation that leaves you in awe and makes the show\u2019s action scenes incredibly memorable. Bones did an incredible job with this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSoundtracks are something I don\u2019t take too much notice in when it comes to watching anime unless they are incredibly noticeable and stick out to me. With that in mind, Mob Psycho 100\u2019s soundtrack is one that fits the bill for this. The OST for this show doesn\u2019t have many tracks, if any, that demanded my attention upon watching, but it did its job. A really stand-out OST could have greatly increased the quality and enjoyment of this show, so it\u2019s kinda sad to say it left no lasting impressions on me aside from the opening, which was great, upbeat, and really prepared you for the episode to come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 is an anime that I would definitely green light when it comes to recommending it. While it plays it safe in its story and characters, which is never a bad thing, its art and animation are enough to give the show the charm it needs to be an incredibly enjoyable watch. The story is fairly cookie cutter, starting off slow but picking up in the latter half. It really lacked the scale it needed in regards to its story elements, but had a ton of moments to leave a lasting impression on the watcher. The characters stayed inside the box as well, with some outstanding factors. They were a joy to watch interact on screen, and the comedy they provide further increases enjoyment. The art and animation, with its intensity and psychedelic color pallet, are what gives the anime its charm and is the main reason why this show is one to remember for most anyone who watches this anime. The sound, however, I didn\u2019t take much notice of, and was the only thing about this show that won\u2019t leave a lasting impression on me. So, as I said, I would definitely recommend this show. It oozes with charm and works to be an anime experience that won\u2019t soon be forgotten.",

            "content": "By the creator behind the 2015 mega hit One Punch Man and animated by the studio that brought us Full Metal Alchemist, we get one of the most decent anime to come out of summer 2016 which is Mob Psycho 100. This was pretty much in all honesty one of the shows I was most excited about before season started. I was at one point going to read the manga but decided to leave greatness for when the actual show came out and I am glad I did as Mob Psycho is one of those shows that should have surprises waiting for the viewer. \r\nMobPsycho tries to take what made One Punch Man good and re skin it for something different to the superhero genre. The Re Skin gives us instead of a guy with ultimate strength we get someone with a strong capabilities for psychic powers in a world where psychics exist. The story follows a character nicknamed Mob who is likely the most powerful Psychic in the world by the looks of things and is capable of exorcizing evil spirits with ease. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of MP100 introduces us to the life of Shigeo Kageyama (Mob) who was raised holding very powerful psychic abilities that made him different to the normal kids. In the present he works with Reigen Arataka who runs a business for exorcizing evil spirits. Reigen acts as Mobs master despite having no Psychic abilities while Mob still goes to school. In the first half of the show we see Mob try to develop his own character without the use of psychic powers by only using them to in his exorcism jobs and not in school as he wants to be good at something normal. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a couple of episodes we get to learn the true nature of Mob and his goals in life which leads us into the second half where there is an actual plot. The actual plot involves Mobs encounters with other Psychics. I won't go into too much detail but it can be quite an interesting thing to watch. The whole show like one punch man is an overpowered character try to solve ordinary problems while handling the task of being more than human. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters like One Punch man, MP100 has a colourful cast of characters that provide a sense of seriousness and humour. Mob is character that faces a dilemma of lowing his strengths for a chance at normality. Throughout the show he is conflicted by this and it shows multiple times where Mob is at his most stressed. He is an interesting character at the times he does show emotion towards other characters which makes it so he is not only a emotionless slate. The other Character that plays centre stage Is Reigan Arataka who is in truth a Con Artist. When you hear he is a Con artist you would expect a character that is a scumbag which is kind of right. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing about Reigan is that fans are conflicted about liking his Character at first. As the show moves forward Reigan can turn into a true meme lord and is extremely supportive of Mob which is where people get to like him. In some episodes you could even say he is the best bro in the show. Another Major Character in the Show is Mobs brother Ritsu who is basically the perfect brother/student in terms of personality. Despite being perfect this character is also conflicted and it plays into the main story later on but overall he is likable. The last character of interest is and evil spirit called dimple whose role is just to be a punching bag for a number of really funny jokes played on his character. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters include students among those the muscle club who are basically best bro squad are considering how they treat Mob. The other characters are general clowns Reigan trolls and the psychics that are either good or bad. Like One Punch Man all the characters are very colourful and are made victim for decent humour.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art in MP100 is rather unique for as it looks a lot like a webcomic being animated. The whole style is similar to Concrete Revolution which is another one of Bones shows. The whole thing looks in a way hand drawn. The best thing to come out of this very style is the interesting visuals and effort shown to be put in the fight scenes. The visuals looked really cool at times especially in moments where Mob goes all out with his powers. Some of the greater fights remind me of the subterranean fight in one punch man. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I got to like this art style which not many shows would dare attempt in the fear of poor results. We do not get poor results here we just get the great animation bones are known to produce with their studio. The character designs are good and are distinguishing, what I mean by that is the likes of student characters who wear uniforms stand out amongst each other while are central characters can standout themselves despite their normal  appearances they carry where they were pretty average clothing. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty suitable for this series, it\u2019s not memorable as the OST for one Punch Man but the OST used during the show is mainly used to fill an atmosphere. I really liked the opening and ending for the show both songs 99 and Refrain Boy are great choices. The sequences they are used in especially Refrain Boy are really great. I have to say the ending using Refrain Boy is really beautiful and would love to see more ending sequences like that. In terms of voice acting I watched in subs. I have to appreciate the emotion given off in the voice of some characters especially Reigan who is funny to listen to even if I can\u2019t fully understand Japenese tongue.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved this show and it was likely my go to Anime of Summer 2016. I hope there is a season two in the future as I would like to see this show have an eventual conclusion.  \\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nIt's funny how when you give Saitama Hair, make him a kid and change his powers you get another fantastic anime to watch.\r\nThe story centres around Shigeo Kageyama or Mob for short who is an Esper that has Psychic powers and together with Reigen he uses his powers to Exorcise spirits from the human word.\r\nThe main difference between OPM and Mob Psycho is that Mob Psycho concentrates a little more on the story and it is pretty fantastic, it was interesting seeing Mob trying to live his life with his powers as they could actually be a hindrance for him at times whichwas very funny when something went the wrong way for him.\\n\r\nSeeing Mob and Reigen do their Exorcism's against spirits was also a of fun because Reigen has to entirely rely on Mob to destroy the spirits and whenever Reigen is in a bad position it was always funny seeing his reaction or how he got out of the situation.\\n\r\nThere was also an interesting feud between Mob and his brother Ritsu since they had different views on the powers of an Esper and this feud eventually led to them fighting each other.\\n\r\nAt some points in the story especially towards the end there is moments where it gets pretty dark like a secret organisation using child Espers for their experiments or when Mob hits his 100 limit which turns him into a different person which can be pretty terrifying.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really funny, weird and random because you have no idea what they'll do next.\\n\r\nMob the MC was an interesting character because even though he looks like Saitama they really are different, Mob is a very socially awkward person and it can be funny when this awkwardness gets the better of him when he is talking to someone and when it comes to fighting he does destroy spirits, but when it comes to fighting people he tries his best to avoid fighting people because he doesn't want to hurt people because he knows how destructive his power is, but despite being physically weak and awkward he is definitely a character you want to support because all he wants is to live in peace.\\n\r\nEven though Mob is the MC Reigen is the true star of the show despite lying to Mob that he is a powerful Psychic he actually cares a lot for Mob's well being and gives him a lot of advice which also included not using his powers to hurt people and this shows that his character does have very big heart even though he is a con-man and his wise personality definitely shows itself during the final episodes.\\n\r\nMob's brother Ritsu is another character that stands out because he didn't have Esper powers when he was born (But they manifest halfway through) which creates a rift between him and his brother because Mob respects Ritsu because he excels at everything without powers yet Ritsu respects Mob because of his power and his jealousy of those powers get the better of him when he eventually gains them which in turn lead him to fight his brother until thinks about what he did which made him realise his mistake and helps out in the end when he is captured be the secret organisation.\\n\r\nThe other characters Ekubo and Teruki were also fun, random characters because Ekubo was a spirit defeated by Mob and becomes his sidekick afterwards however his plans to rule the world never fade and his sly, distrustful personality make him fun entertainment especially when he overreacts to situations that are incredibly dangerous for him, Teruki is another Esper like Mob and starts out as his enemy, but when he experiences Mobs's full powers he gains new found respect for him and considers him a friend when they fight against the secret organisation and it is funny when he overconfidence backfires on him when he finds enemies more powerful than him.\\n\r\nThe villains in this anime can range from destructive to weird because there is a lot of villains around, but you won't see them for long because they usually get their asses kicked by Mob or the other Espers so it was always funny seeing them praise their powers then get destroyed a second later.\\n\\n\r\nThe Artstyle may look bad, but it definitely fits the style of this anime and holds true to the way it is represented in the manga though there are moments that look really good when the Espers are using their powers or fighting each other like when Mob reached his 100 limit when he was fighting Teruki at Black Vinegar Middle School which looked amazing, another thing that sort've creeped me out was the fact that like 4 or 5 characters looked a lot like Saitama or had his bland face which just felt weird at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe action was great the fighting sequences were definitely fun to watch and they got better and better throughout the show and during the moments Mob reaches his 100 limit you can really see the true destructive capability of his powers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this was a great show that even throwed in a few OPM easter eggs which was nice to see and if you're someone who saw and enjoyed OPM then I'd recommend this because it is very similar, but concentrates a little more on the story aspect.",

            "content": "What can I say about Mob Psycho? Well, I'll start from the start. I hated this anime when it just realized, I saw like 2 episodes and I said: \"what is this? The same as One Punch Man, not at its level\". Time after, I decided to give it an oportunity. And what oportunity! \r\nNo, it's not the same as One Punch Man. While that one is focused on a guy who is bored and wanting to search for a good rival, Mob Psycho is the opposited, is based on a guy who doesn't want to fight, that's the main difference. Yes, both have thesame idea: \"a invencible guy\", but the fantastic thing is how animes, starting from the same idea, takes two different ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs in One Punch Man, the story isn't its great point, but what I mostly enjoy of this animes, is how they are based on the shonen genres, but taking them to their extreme point, we are tired of the same hero progress: \"he a guy with a simple level, at the end of the anime he is the strongest guy forever and ever\", that's the point where 'One' breaks with the shonen genre, which is simply ridiculous and beatiful, because there's not a hero progression, the character is the strongest at the start of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie you, this is not a master piece, but is a powerful and enjoyable serie. Its greatest point it is its characters. All have something hidding inside, all have their own personality, all have their own fears, and all have their own evolution.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favourite character of this serie is the Mob's Master. He is funny, he is a lier a swindler, but despite all, when we thought he had no powers, we discover that he has the strongest power ever, the power of being a leader.",

            "content": "Review #1: Mob Psycho 100\r\nStory: 7/10 -- Seems like psychological powers has been an underused genre in anime lately. What makes Mob a good story is the whole atmosphere of the anime. There isn't a lot of big talk arrogant heroes in this show like in other animes, it focuses more on the deep calm understanding nature of what it means to have psychic powers and be different from everyone else. I think what's unique here as well is that you see normal humans truly witness the terror of these powers and acknowledge the fear of abuse people with them have towards others. The Plotis okay, not a great one, as the villains weren't really memorable in this first season, but the brother complex I felt was the best thing going in the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 -- I really like this style of art where the characters are more drawn out then animated. Studio Bones uses many, many colors in this show as well, and I thought it meshed well together in the battles/conflicts. The scenery wasn't shown much, but there was a lot of effort shown in damages during the main battles.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 -- Honestly the music didn't really click with me. I think it would of been better if it was either more darker, or deeper tones. This anime only uses sound mainly in the background though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 -- Mob's character is unique to MC's these days. He's very quiet, physically insufficient, and very shy towards others. I think he grows out of it a little bit, because him going to 100% mode several times, is a sign to me that he's learning how to express his emotions quicker, although usually unstable. Reigen is the best character in this series, this quirky con artist has an arsenal of moves that put most heroes to shame. He also mentors Mob into controlling his powers, and teaches him that even people with psychic powers are still human, and not different then normal hard workers in society. He's a great teacher when he's honest, but also very sly when he's working.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 -- If you like superpower anime, this will most likely be in your top 5. It takes a different angle and explores the feelings inside yourself when you know you're gifted, and brilliantly exposes those feelings in raw battle action. Eat some popcorn and binge through this. Keep your eyes peeled for a Season 2 or a movie as well, it's a popular series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 -- If the story and plot was better, I'd rate this an 8.5 maybe. But I think this anime is a great standard for what very good anime is. This would be my benchmark for standard 8 rated animes, that aren't influenced by how much you enjoy a certain part of the series.\\n\\n\r\n~Castawayz",

But I gave it 9 only for one reason because of the character of Reigen, Arataka. His character, sense of humor, his fake make up of having psychic powers is just amazing and he is one of the best characters I have ever seen in a long time. The way the story goes at the first 3 episodes it just mightbe boring, but later on the action, art, development is something you would look forward to every time.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if you found this review small cause its my first time, but next time gambaru kara na?",

The art and animation are amazing especially how new and refreshing the art felt to me, the soundtrack was well done with the highlight being the OP but at some points I expected it to do more for me. The soundtrack did a lot of things well, but it did not blow me away like how I would expect a Yoko Kanno or Yuki Kajiura soundtrack to sound like. The story was great as well as the mini-arcbased set up let it fully explore its themes without them feeling rushed by the amount of time available to them. And finally the characters were the stand-out of the series, as the not only felt genuine but added a lot of soul to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style here is one of my favourite from recent anime. Studio Bones returned back to old form with this entry, as the art style seemed expressive and fresh. The anime felt like it was conceived by a crop of new animators as some of the techniques that were used and animation choices that were made were new to me. The animation quality still felt consistent throughout the 12 episode run, and the expressive art style didn\u2019t suffer because of it.",

            "content": "ONE has proven to be one of the greatest contemporary manga authors. Mob Psycho certainly is a point out of the curve when it comes to the shonen genre. If you have ever underestimated this anime because of the eery looks of the manga, please reconsider. \r\nSpeaking of the art style, it fits very well the atmosphere the show passes. Filled with nonsense humor and fantasy, you don't bother the distorted look of the drawings, as it actually adds to the uncompromising feeling of the anime. Bones studio did an amazing job with the art direction, keeping the core of ONE's iconic loose character designwhile managing to make everything look professional at the same time. The angle variations, fluid animation, well paced direction, stylized coloration, among other things, makes the show look great. I'm personally not much of a fan of ONE's character design, but I can't argue that they did an incredible job with the art direction. \\n\r\nThe story to me was the biggest surprise. I started watching Mob Psycho not expecting much other than an unpopular kid passing through puberty while also struggling with his paranormal powers. In fact, the course of the storyline is way more original as it portrays much deeper subjects, such as how Mob perceives himself as an outcast for having super powers, feeling that it compromises his self esteem as he's not even close to be special without them. This makes him admire his brother, who has much better social skills and cleverness than him. On the other hand, Ritsu, his brother, envies Mob, as he always wanted super powers to get a spotlight. This interpretation of what it means to be special and how each one deals with power and low self-esteem is actually very interesting. Even episodes that are not connected to the core plot of the anime makes you reflect about what meaning it's trying to pass... the one where dimple (Ekubo) was introduced is a great example, as it criticizes social behaviors such as the imposition of looking happy at all times when you're in public, hiding your true sensations while faking to be \"okay\". All of these \"deeper meanings\" got me off guard, I was just expecting some nonsense comedy, but Mob Psycho has proven to be much more daring than it firstly seemed. The main plot of the first season, which starts halfway through it, is very simple but enjoyable. The story itself is not where Mob Psycho shines the most, but the very entertaining narrative that makes you hooked, intercalating top notch nonsense comedy with fluid animated action scenes and even some tense, more dramatic sequences. The pace is marvelous, the show knows how to transition from comic to serious scenes and it feels natural.\\n\r\nThe characters are extremely charismatic. ONE's creativity to write characters is very surprising. You simply end up liking everyone, no matter how secondary and unimportant to the story they are. Each one has some iconic and original personality traits. Mob is extremely enjoyable, relatable, very easy to support and he carries the weight of a protagonist with ease. It was actually Reigen, though, who I enjoyed the most. His profiteer personality and rhetoric skills felt very cool, specially when you realize he cares for Mob, besides exploring him.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great, the op looks very nice as it embraces this colorful, almost psychedelic stylized art style. The ed is nice, although it felt to me a little disconnected to the main concepts of the anime. Anyway, Mob Psycho 100 is too great to be judged merely by its looks. Definitively one of the most original and well written shonens of recent years, can't recommend it enough.",

It mesmerizes you with its transformative artwork, gets you invested with its deep cast and then it pours some salt on your wounds with well timed humor.\r\nThe artwork is weird but slick, immersive yet jarring and at times it is absolutely flat out breathtaking! \r\nReigen, Mob, Dimple, Ritsu and Hanza are a cast of complex and compelling characters.  Each one could stand on their own, but together, they bring the show to life with their unique personalities.  The balance between each member's screen time, fight time and development is wellhandled for a show that only has 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nJealousy, brotherhood, friendship, cowardice, ego, independence and so many more topics are introduced throughout the show's run but I simply cannot forget the most important topic covered -- BANISHING SALT PUNCH! The story's humor is well woven into the heart and soul of the show.  It takes a moment that might become too sappy or preachy and turns it into comedic gold.  It also reminds you that sometimes you have to laugh a little... even during the most difficult situations you'll have to experience. \\n\\n\r\nDon't take all of life's events so seriously or else you'll have to get an Anti-Esper Dropkick to the left testicle. \\n\\n\r\nWith all of that said, two evil spirits caused this show to get a 9 instead of a 10.  The first spirit being known as Not-a-memorable-soundtrack-sama.  Most will definitely disagree with me here, but I felt as if Mob lacked an essential theme or a track that said, \"Oh yeah, get your salt out!\".  \\n\\n\r\nThe other being that so much is introduced into the second half of the show; therefore the ending, while satisfying, does feel ever so slightly rushed.  There were so many great characters, but it was difficult to experience closure on such short notice.  \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, go watch it and put some Himalayan salt on your popcorn!",

Definitely identical, but you'll find yourself tempted to watch it.\r\nKageyama Shigeo as main character is really plain but that's the charm... An anime where the hero or heroine are actually losers or typically self-centered. He's naive and don't even realize that Reigen only used him to do business but yah, he's not the villain so that's okay.\r\nFor someone who has watched hundreds anime, I find the animation has nice appeals in it. It's not like an ordinary anime which the visuals are really pretty, neat, cleanbut still only 3 from 10 of them that actually interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nJust SIMPLY EXCITING and ENJOYABLE :)\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs are good and harmoniously just right for this anime. I think I have a great expectations every time I begin to watch some anime, that's why I can't give the score higher than 8 this time.",

            "content": "TL;DR: Mob is a visually stunning, wonderfully written show about self-improvement and reconnecting with others, and you owe it to yourself to watch it.\r\nI adore this show.\r\nUnlike it\u2019s visually impressive, but (comparatively) shallow older brother, One Punch Man, Mob is brimming with personality. ONE\u2019s vision comes together into a somehow deeply nostalgic whole, where every part seems integrated to tell a story of self-improvement and the denial of egoistic solipsism. \r\nThe art style and animation is breathtaking, all rendered in thick, luxurious linework which flows with a cartoonish smoothness that can be goofy when the show wants to land a joke and frighteningly crisp whenit wants to deliver the dynamism and weight of a fight or the terror of a mental state, frequently both at the same time. It very much feels like what ONE\u2019s art would look like, if he was \u2013 uhh \u2013 good at drawing. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing, much in the same vain, is loaded with humor, sincerity and flow. It bleeds directly into the lovable characters, that all have sharply distinguished personalities and beautiful character designs. We get an intimate sense of many of these characters\u2019 inner lives, desires, delusions, and narrative arcs, which are masterfully spun without getting too contrived or overdone. It is not the painfully deep dive into characters that a show like Evangelion might offer. But it does not need to, as there is an underlying levity to Mob, that is willing to look at life at some of its tough parts, without ever dipping into the overly dark. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters\u2019 deeper selves are still left mostly unexplored, ripe for a deeper examination in material to follow \u2013 which handles this masterfully as well (see my review on season 2 if you are interested in hearing more). Not least is Mob, who slowly emerges from his stoic self during season 1, with much self-discovery still left on the plate for our deeply lovable socially stunted MC.\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho will not necessarily leave you with any major revelations about the nature of reality or life. Some minor revelations, maybe. But that is its thing, it is not about big shouty egos, main characters going Super Saiyan as they ascend from small earth below and their bold proclamations of ideals and heroism. Mob is not interested in all that, but in small interactions, small attempts to empathize, small attempts to improve. That, if anything, is the general, and wonderful takeaway from Mob. The quiet rejection of Ego. In that way, I really wish someone had shown me Mob in my early teens.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you want a highly enjoyable show that will stick with you a long time, go watch Mob already.\\n",

            "content": "Can a person with superpowers overcome the ordinary human? Mob Psycho 100 develops its message well, but leaves everything else aside.\r\n\u2013\r\n1. Originality: 8\r\nAlthough the topic of super powers has already been used a lot, becoming something that is mostly a second place subject in many series, Mob Psycho 100 has a different point of view about it (and at the same time, one that has been seen already).\r\nIn the universe of Kageyama Shigeo, our protagonist, people with psychic powers are common and at the same time extraordinary, like those people who can roll their tongues in the form of a three. And in fact, thatsilly example represents quite well the message that the series wants to convey about superpowers throughout the story: in a world where superpowers exist, having them is just another peculiarity as any other, and people with superpowers are not really better than nobody out there. In fact, blindly trusting in your superpowers is the worst mistake you could ever make.\\n\\n\r\n2. Story Development: 6\\n\r\nI know what you're thinking, \"Wait, if this series conveys such a profound message, how can its development be so regular?\" Well, it's the last episodes' fault basically. From an objective point of view, the story has some \"errors\", or I'd rather say, problems.\\n\r\nThe most annoying thing about the story is that its development takes you towards a great finale, to then crash against a big disappointment, in the style of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.\\n\r\nI will continue talking about this in the Characters section, which is where it corresponds.\\n\\n\r\n3. Characters: 6.5\\n\r\nI think you've already noticed who interfered with this note remarkably.\\n\r\nReigen is undoubtedly a seesaw as a character, something not very good if this continues until the last episodes. Although his analytical and cheating behavior has helped Mob at times, we can never forget that his behavior towards him is based mostly on one of utilization. Their relationship literally began when the \"lost Mob\" found the office of the \"wise Reigen\", which decided to take advantage of the situation of the innocent little one and began a new situation of advantage over him. Because c'mon, that situation only favors Reigen in whatever way you see it. Even Ekubo, to a greater or lesser extent, has been more direct with his wishes about Mob.\\n\r\nTo be honest, ignoring the various bugs that the characters have makes the experience better. That and Teru, Teru is a good character in its entirety.\\n\\n\r\n4. Enjoyment: 9.5\\n\r\nI know, my scores don't make sense, right? Well, let me explain.\\n\r\nAlthough the story has some errors, and is not perfect in any way, it is quite good as a whole. Yes, the \"final battle\" sucks, but the few battles we did see were pretty good. Yes, most of the characters take advantage of Mob or treat him in a way he doesn't deserve, but that's why seeing the majority evolve in the end is even more refreshing. Yes, the ending was a disappointment compared to what could have been, but that only shows how good the episodes prior to this are.\\n\\n\r\n\u2013\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, Mob Psycho 100 could have been much better, but that doesn't mean it isn't an enjoyable watch.",

            "content": "Back when Mob Psycho 100 came out, I heard a lot of praising coming out about it, and having thoroughly enjoyed another series written by the same person, One Punch Man, I immediately put this on the list to watch. I put off watching this for a long time, but I eventually got around to watching it and my initial reaction to it was \"Meh.\" That's not to say Mob Psycho is a bad show by any means, it is certainly very good, I just wasn't all that into it. The first half consists of mostly one-two episode stories that are just there to establishsome new characters before we get into the second half of the series, which actually has a story. Unfortunately, it's a pretty boring story. It just boils down to here's a group of bad guys that are bad for no reason, fight them. I'll go more into it later but the story was very underwhelming. The story's stakes are also virtually non-existent because its established early on that Mob is too OP to be hurt and all of the other characters have plot armor. 3/10 for the story.\\n\\n\r\nFrom that last tangent, you would wonder why I said that this show is good, and these next two categories are why. The art and animation of this series are just fantastic. All of the characters have unique and memorable designs, the animation is fluid and colorful. It's just great to look at. The music in this series is also great. The OP of this series is great. No matter how little I cared about the story of this series, I always got hyped to watch some more just because of the opening alone. 10 for art and 9 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nNow back to the things I didn't like, the characters. Starting with the protagonist, Mob. He's just too OP. There's no stakes in any of his fights because you know he'll win. I hate characters like these, because they feel completely unrealistic. This is very similar to Saitama from One Punch Man, who, as I mentioned, was written by the same person. However, while I wasn't a fan of the fights involving Saitama, I enjoyed it because Saitama was just a fun character to watch. He's funny and his voice actor really puts a lot of emotion into his lines. Mob is not that. He's bland, and feels like he has no emotion at all. It just baffles me that the author can do a character right one time and then do the same character totally wrong the next time. Moving on, the villains in this series are not interesting in the slightest. They are not given enough screen time to make them memorable, which wouldn't be a problem, if I liked watching the protagonist. Some of you might not like me comparing these two shows again, but it helps me show what I'm talking about. One Punch Man also had some very unmemorable villains, simply because they didn't really have any time to develop, show their motivations or become engaging to watch in their own right. However, it wasn't as big of a problem in that series because I enjoyed watching Saitama so much. I don't like watching Mob, and because we focus on him instead of spending time trying to make the villains interesting, I'm just stuck there waiting for the episode to end without anything interesting. Well, there are some things that are interesting. Namely, the mentor figure, Reigen. The show quickly establishes that Mob and Reigen's student-teacher relationship is completely backwards, which is often played for laughs (although this does stop being funny after the second time), but I really did like Reigen's character. He's fun to watch, he has some of the best lines in the show and he's shown to be very insightful and kind towards the end of the season. There are more characters I could go into, but I mostly felt either neutral towards them or just disliked them. Since I can't remember another character I actually liked right now, I'll just move on. I'll give this section a 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was honestly quite boring to sit through. While I enjoyed rocking out to the OP and watching the incredible animation (especially during fight scenes), that was not enough to save this show for me. The style of humor this show goes for gets old quickly (although I did laugh quite a few times), and it just doesn't quite engage me as well as I had hoped the same person who gave us One Punch Man would. I'll give this another 4 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was just not for me. I can appreciate the series' incredible animation and music, but I can't say that the rest is anything special. The show is average at best. If you're looking for something that's just really nice to look at, I'd say this is a great candidate, but if you are looking for something more than that, I'd just say go rewatch One Punch Man (I know that I compared this show to OPM a lot and not everyone is okay with that, but the two shows are just very similar so it helps me show why I was disappointed by Mob Psycho 100).\\n",

But for me, on how much praise One Punch Man has been given, I personally enjoyed this anime slightly better than OPM. I think that this anime thought me of a lesson\u2014if you've been given powers equal to that of a God, would you use it wisely or use it roughly?\r\nThat's what Shigeo Kageyama is facing. A kind-hearted kid whose a reject (like most of us at MyAnimeList ;-;) but yields extremely powerful psychic abilities (similarto Saitama and his incredible strength). He has to find what life truly offers, because for him that his psychic powers are starting to get bored now. He hides this powers to the public, afraid of what he would do if he loses control of this potentially dangerous powers.\\n\\n\r\nMind the art style, but I enjoyed this anime. It is psychedelic, and brewing with creativity. Overall, I would give this a slamming 9.3/10. But that is just my opinion. ONE has given another masterpiece once again.

            "content": "The story follows the exploits of the titular character mob and his mentor/employer Arataka as they take up jobs to help people get rid of evil spirits, basically they are sort of shamans. Like all action anime, the mob world is divided into people with powers and ordinary people. The people with powers like Mob are called psychics and the others, well they are just called people. Mob in particular is an exceptionally strong psychic and beneath him lies an even stronger energy which posses Mob when his anger reaches 100 level. While in this beast like mode Mob is unable to control himself andthus hurts everyone around him without any discrimination. Mob has vague memories of this phenomena and the time when he injured his younger brother due to one such break. Thus, Mob joins Arataka to help defeat evil and to teach from Arataka how to control his powers. Here, lies a catch as Arataka is not a psychic as he advertises himself to be, in reality he is just plain smart, more accurately, street smart. He uses Mob to his own advantage and occasionally gives him the cliched advises that any ordinary Joe could give. They battle the monster of the week where Arataka slyly makes Mob take the responsibility to defeat the monster and calls it training. Amidst all the advice Arataka says to Mob to never use his powers on ordinary humans or humans in general. This becomes Mob's Achilles heel as often in the anime Mob refuses to fight the antagonists as it is against his moral codes and ethics.  This is what the story line felt in the first third of the season. Even though I really liked it, I thought that this would be one of the old school anime wherein the MC just fought the bad guys and an evil organization in the last couple episodes. Bluntly said, I was wrong and wrong by a mile. A parallel story line runs here which sees Mob as an ordinary student struggling in his academics and athletics and in trying to impress his crush Tsubomi. In this story line Mob is shown as an everyday Joe himself in contrast to really strong esper. He realizes that Tsubomi is not impressed by psychic and looks for more ordinary strengths in her guy. Mob also is in awe of his brother who is pretty much the opposite of him. He doesn't have any esper abilities but is pretty much good in every other thing he tries. Mob exactly isn't envious of him but yearns to be able to stuff that everyone else can accomplish with ease, like eating without bending the spoon. In school Mob joins body building club to become physically fit to impress his love, his brother and more importantly himself. This according to me is one of the strong acts of the anime, as it genuinely humanized the usually aloof Mob. This is what separated the motivations in the anime from other generic shonen. Unlike the usual, Mob didn't really want to be the strongest Psychic in the word, nor did he care about it. All he wanted was to become a better human being and a person of whom his brother and he himself could be proud of.  In the second third of the anime and the major viewpoint shifts from Mob to his younger brother Ritsu. The story progresses from how an ordinary Ritsu awakens his own psychic powers. Ritsu is a genius and an all rounder unlike his brother. He is extremely smart, athletic and popular. On the outside Mob and Ritsu seem to be ordinary brothers who have that weird love hate relationship, but that's just the surface. Both Mob and Ritsu are kind of envious of each other. As discussed earlier Mob wants to be a person of whom Ritsu can be proud of, he is especially proud of Ritsu. He wants to be better at education and sports like Ritsu, and that's normal. Ritsu on the other hand is more than just envious, he borders towards obsession. From a very young age, Ritsu becomes painfully aware of the fact that Mob is special. Ritsu despite having it all, doesn't have the psychic abilities. He tries his best to cover his desires, and we as watchers might not even have known about his ambitions and desires, if the story had not shifted to his viewpoint. This is again one of the other stronger points of the anime. The rival in here got ample screen time and the creators gave him enough substance to flesh out a 3D character. Ritsu's ambition, motivations and emotions were made very clear, this gave a reason for him to act the way he did, he didn't just simply challenge the rival to become strong or to prove him wrong. This added an emotional depth to his character and to overall story in itself. Despite all of this, the problem with Ritsu was that he wasn't as compelling character as Mob. Thus, the slice of life esque story with Ritsu's POV felt like it was dragging. There was one episode where nothing really happens but Ritsu feeling angry all the time. The anime had noble intentions and tried to do something most shonen could only dream of,  though the shonen tag acted as a weakness here rather than a strength. The inability of shonen anime to have a deep meaningful conversation and the its inability to portray delicate human feeling without breaking the genre, left the anime to do this with only hard hitting visual cues. I felt that by this way, Ritsu insecurities were pushed to my face rather than showing it gradually and with some delicateness. Thus, the plot herein felt rushed and the feelings weren't portrayed accurately and subtly. This was one of the weak points of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show were quite well created. All of the characters you could see in real life, at least the human ones. The shy Mob, the genius Ritsu and slyly Arataka. All of these characters can be seen in almsot any group of people. Apart from Arataka, who was a bit exaggerated, both Mob and Ritsu felt human-esque characters. They had their separate personalities and motivations. These ambitions were something that most people desire. Mob desired to be a model student and  citizen, Ritsu desired something bit more complicated. Though, if the psychic powers can be substituted as just another talent, then it is clearly visible that Ritsu was jealous his elder brother. He admired his elder brother for these talents and wanted the same for himself. In that aspect Mob too was jealous of Ritsu's talents. This aspect was especially beneficial to create a more fleshed out character, as brother I am myself a bit jealous of my siblings skills that I do not possess. I have seen many other people wanting a talent that someone in their family has, but they do not. I felt that made their jealousy more believable and warranted when compared to other anime. Thus, the characters especially the two brothers are what separated Mob from OPM. The anime offered an emotional connect to characters and a window to their actions and thoughts. Other side characters like Arataka and Ekubo were pretty cool characters too. They added the humor to otherwise a standard action anime. Especially, Arataka with his wits and charm was an engrossing  and alluring character. He made the dull moments a lot less bearable and even when Ritsu was acting out of place and I felt the story dragged, it was Arataka and Ekubo duo who made the show a lot more fun. Thus, the show really hits it out of park with the character.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show was something that really took me by surprise. I am not really a fan of One's art style. I tried reading the original OPM and I couldn't get past 10 chapters without putting it down. I was really glad when Murata sensie decided to redraw it. Mob being One's lesser known work before the start of the anime didn't get any such version. Thus, the animators of the anime would have to work with One's style; this was a point of concern for me as I felt that the anime would have bad artwork. Though, all my fears were put to rest when saw the gorgeous artwork the anime had. The characters didn't feel animated, rather they felt like a hand drawn moving characters, like when you flip the pages of a book, though with a lot better fps. The artwork I felt was the best part of the show and really enthralled me. The opening and ending too was good enough and other themes like battle music too were not bad. Though, they didn't really stand out or increase the overall dramatic effect of the anime; yet they didn't feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, as I said earlier the anime was a must watch of last year and even generally holds out pretty good. What separates this one from OPM and other shonen in general is the emotional connect it offers with the characters while also excelling in the battle and shonen themes.\\n",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 was a really enjoyable watch! \r\nThe premise of the show is really interesting and I think the show does a somewhat good job of establishing the world. However, the show is slightly slow to start off and some things remain unexplained for example Reigen seems surprised there are other espers than Mob but everyone else in the world is not at all taken aback by Mob's possession of psychic abilities. Later on the show, some other characters awaken psychic abilities but it's never explained if just about anyone can do this or if those who do are special. These minor things andconsidering the show has a light-hearted aspect to it I try not to question it too much. The humour while not everyone's taste appealed to me cos it was just harmless fun.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many seem to seem to find Mob's simplistic character design annoying or a flaw I believe it adds to the unique outlook of the show. Mob is a somewhat below average character there is not much to him besides his caring and polite nature and psychic abilities. The show follows Mob's journey of figuring out his relationship with his powers, and his want to create an identity for himself without them. If Mob were given any other talent I don't feel the storyline would have worked as well. Similarly, while the art style is slightly unnerving at first, it actually makes the show more unique and enjoyable to watch as different art styles are used in different scenes to emphasize the mood or atmosphere of the said scene. The opening track is actually one of the best I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think Mob Psycho 100 is definitely worth the watch.",

            "content": "This series borders on perfection. Right from the very first seconds of it, you realize that you're up for a bizarre, yet intriguing experience. Opening with a psychedelic-like fight between our psychic protagonist, Mob, and a bunch of colorful, bizarrely designed monsters. This gives us an insight to the very first thing we learn about Mob: he's practically invincible. Continuing with the tradition started by its predecessor One-Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 shows us a story from the perspective of an overpowered protagonist.\r\nOther than this and their obvious similarities in design, these two protagonists are immensely different. Mob is incredibly shy and reserved because of3 main reasons: 1) his powers make him feel like an outcast, as he doesn't know anyone like himself, and this makes him feel like they are a curse, a burden; 2) he develops an inferiority complex by comparing himself to his brother, Ritsu, who is absolutely perfect at anything he does. Where Mob is physically weak, Ritsu is strong and athletic; where Mob struggles academically, Ritsu gets perfect grades on a constant basis; where Mob is socially inept and awkward, Ritsu is popular, considered attractive, and has a position in the student council of their school. This antithesis, however, belies a more complex relationship of mutual jealousy between brothers, providing a chance to appreciate scenarios of brotherly rivalry, treason, forgiveness and love. And 3) Mob, in fear of his powers, has bottled them inside himself, and with this, he has ended up bottling his feelings together with them, leaving behind an expressionless boy who is seemingly unfazed by everything. Compare this to Saitama's awkwardness stemming from his utter boredom with his life, and his desire for action, and maybe a little bit of recognition.\\n\\n\r\nThe best aspect of this series, in my opinion, is its ability to subvert the notion present in a lot of entertainment forms that special powers mean someone is particularly special. This series takes that and flushes it down the toilet, as it takes psychic geniuses, grabs them by the face, and yells at them to wake up from their delusional fantasy and come back to reality, to realize that special powers are merely another human characteristic that sets us apart and makes us interesting, not a sign of genetic supremacy. No one represents this aspect better than Mob, who flat out refuses to use his powers for his own benefit or harm others with them, despite his immense natural talent, and resorts to other ways to grow as a man and earn the things he desires. He resorts to physical exercise, socialization attempts, and counseling from his mentor, the self-proclaimed psychic (read: con-artist) and overall charismatic and confident dork, Reigen Aratama.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that I find worth commenting and that is easy to observe is the artwork and animation. It reminded me a lot of short animations one would usually see on YouTube because of the colorful, rough, bizarre look of it, a style that works mostly for short works on the Internet. Seeing it here, in a longer form, seemed like a sketchy decision that could easily backfire. However, it helps set the tone for an out-of-this-world experience that bends and plays with our minds as wonderfully as only a master magician could. This series WILL toy with your expectations and beliefs, and as long as you're open to this, you will love what Mob Psycho 100 has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing stopping it from a perfect score was my own enjoyment of the series. As much as I liked it, I failed to truly respond emotionally to the story and its various moments. I would attribute this to the fact that Mob's very overpowered nature took away the sense of true danger from my perception of the series, making this storytelling element both a strength and a weakness. Also, I watched it at a time where work and college stopped me from watching it with a clear, appreciative mind. I will give this series another try in the future, hoping an even more enjoyable ride.",

            "content": "This anime is amazing. Don't listen to any of the negative reviews that say otherwise, because they are blind by their biases--probably by how 'bad' the art is  or their high expectations how shounen anime 'should' be--to see how great of this anime is.\r\nFirst Mob psycho is not your average shounen anime, which is really refreshing. It's about a middle school boy who has psychic powers. His employer Reigen is a con man who uses mob for his powers, which goes completely unnoticed by oblivious mob. Mob only has one wish which is to be popular-which may not seem like much for a plotof a story but you will be amazed at well everything ties together at the end. (I'm not explaining any more of the plot than this.)\\n\\n\r\nOn my next point, The plot is well crafted. Nothing is unexplained, and it's not too over board like some other shounen manga are.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well made which is surprising since I thought they were going to be cliche and flat--they were none of that. The relationships don't go as deep as they do in other anime like Naruto, but what can you expect from a gag twelve episode anime? It's a short series but we see how valuable each character of the main crew is. Yet, the relationship between the Kageyama brothers is one of the sweetest sibling relationship that I have ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the humor is hilarious. It's not on Gintama's level, but it is something. I love it when shounen anime does that--going against the norm, and not in an overbearing way. The humor is just right. \\n\\n\r\nAlso don't judge an anime by it's art, you will miss out on an amazing plot. I used to be like that until I watched ping pong the animation. It's art is so 'bad', but the plot is so simple and yet intriguing. After while you won't even notice how 'bad' the drawings are. The same applies to Mob psycho 100, however in my case I thought the art fit the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, don't go into this anime expecting much, it's literally not like the other shounen anime. And this may or may not be your slice of tea, which you will never know until you give it a shot.\\n\\n",

Yet you can not swim against the (main)stream forever, ONE or not, eventually the boat of goodness will pick you up, exhausted, and carry you into explored waters of templates, banality and infantilism.

            "content": "With the second season of Mob Psycho 100 airing right now, I decided to finally watch the first season and I have to say I am pretty impressed. Mob Psycho 100 definitely seems to do something unique with its art style, its characters and the several themes it has to tell.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nMob Psycho 100 is about Shigeo Kageyama (Mob) and his life as a psychic going to school and having a sort of part time job exorcising spirits with the con artist Arataka Reigen who is a self-proclaimed psychic. The story has a variety of different themes like what happens when people suddenly get alot of power in their hands with there being no one to keep their powers in check. Many psychics in this anime tend to think of themselves as the chosen ones who will need to change the world, because of their powers and get overconfident because of that. They then quickly get a reality check when someone stronger than them shows up, which often causes them to change many of their ideals. The story also gives examples of the bad sides of daily school lives, although the anime does exaggerate them a bit. Overall, the story, although pretty simple, has a lot of interesting themes and things to tell.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you want to have a taste of how the animation of Mob Psycho 100 is, you can just watch the opening as it uses a variety of animation styles and some abstractness in its animation as well. This continues throughout the show as, even though the character designs and the background are not too amazing, the show does seem to use very unique styles in its animation, which are especially seen in its many fight scenes. Overall the animation is not the best animation out there from a quality point of view, but it does have a very unique style and seems to use the fact that it is an anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThere are some very good soundtracks used in Mob Psycho 100, seen for example with its unique opening and some of its main themes like 'Mob Kanjou no Bakuhatsu' (Explosion of Mob's feelings). The show has a variety of different soundtracks for several of its different characters and a variety of different situations coming up in the show. The voice actors also do a pretty good job, although they did not really stand out more than usual.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100 has a variety of different characters and the characters in the anime are pretty interesting overall. Starting off with the main character Mob himself as he is probably the least interesting, because he is a pretty bland character, compared to the other characters. He mostly lacks in expressing a lot of emotions and seems as very shy because of that. He does not think a lot about his own ideals either, as he copies most of them from Arataka Reigen. Another thing that can be annoying is that he is not very smart and basically falls for the traps of all the con artists he meets. Arataka Reigen, the self-proclaimed psychic is one of the most interesting characters from the anime. He is a con artist, but still has a lot of good morals and overall good things to say. He is also very sure of himself in his cons, which can often lead to some very comedic situations. Ritsu Kageyama, Mob's brother, is also a pretty interesting character. He has a pretty difficult relationship with his brother and develops a lot throughout the anime. The same goes for Teruki Hanazawa, as he has a lot of character development as well. His ideals he had about society change a lot after meeting Mob. Finally, there's Ekubo or Dimple, an evil spirit who gets weakened a lot by Mob and then continues to join the cast. He also causes a lot of comedic moments. Overall the characters (except for Mob himself) have interesting characters and some character development as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall Mob Psycho was a very enjoyable anime for me. It had a lot of interesting characters (especially Arataka Reigen), it has very enjoyable fight scenes with unique animation and a good soundtrack and also a variety of very comedic moments which make it a lot of fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nBonus categories: 8/10\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nComedy: 8/10\\n\r\nThe show has a lot of comedy in it and overall executes it very well. Many scenes use the comedy as a part of the scene and a part of the character interactions, which make them seem very fluid. Sometimes there can be a few jokes in which it is a hit or miss case, but overall the comedy is very well done and really adds something to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAction: 8/10\\n\r\nThe anime has a variety of action scenes in the battles between different psychics and the different battles exorcising evil spirits, for example. The battles use a pretty good fighting choreography and can often give some unexpected twists and turns, which can still make them pretty exciting to watch. The fight scenes of course will not be for everyone, but from a technical point of view they are pretty well made, use a variety of different soundtracks, unique animation and a pretty good fight choreography overall.\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (7,83/10)\\n\r\nConclusively, Mob Psycho 100 is a pretty interesting anime which has a simple story with some interesting themes, unique animation styles, a very good soundtrack overall, a variety of interesting characters who also get some character development and comedy and action which is very well done overall. It was also a very enjoyable anime for me. Now we will wait and see if season 2 can equal this season or can even improve upon it.\\n",

It was pretty generic, but it kept my attention somewhat, so it deserves a 6/10.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe action and battle scenes caught my eyes a lot, and the style was very peculiar and interesting. A lot of the characters looked very different and specific, and this out-of-the-box thinking really struck it with me.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe anime managed to deliver both an Opening theme and Ending theme that I found wonderful, along with the greatOST that accompanied the show throughout its scenes. I found myself singing along each time the show started. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nYou have a pretty normal weak-but-op archetype main character, with a bunch of other common roles filled in by others. I didn't see myself getting attached to any of these characters, although I did get quite pumped for Mob's explosions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough Mob Psycho 100 is definitely not the best anime out there, it is captivating and fulfilling. I recommend watching it for its interesting style, great action, and intensity. It was a great watch.\\n",

            "content": "The beautiful thing about how ONE, manga author of Mob Psycho 100, creates stories is the evolution of characters - each has his or her own story, and the plot twists cause growth. It is also not new to this writer, as with One-Punch Man, to portray the main character as a simple, humble person with insurmountable power, unmatched by any other. What's amazing is that the setting of this series takes a completely new lens in the struggles a hero goes through. \r\nStory\r\nWe follow the narrative of Mob, an eighth-grader, who is very plain, other than his ridiculous psychic abilities. The themes thatemerge from the plot are mostly those of a typical Japanese middle schooler: puppy love, part-time jobs, clubs, making friends, sibling rivalry, and gang wars (oops). All these are juggled with the underlying elements that come about from Mob's powers: exorcism, supernatural battles, and organizations that seek world domination.\\n\\n\r\nThough the above description of the plot themes sound quite ludicrous, the story was able to progress in a digestible way. The anime begins at a steady pace, with a dash of humor and a mix of seriousness here and there. Mob's life revolves around himself, his family, and his school. Eventually, he is pushed towards the world outside his comfort zone. Given his capabilities, and the responsibilities that come with it, what actions are he willing to take?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was indeed enjoyable. What bothered me was that the ending was rather abrupt. Cliffhangers can be exciting and can call the audience to want more, but there were some unanswered questions (i.e. were there no consequences to Ritsu's actions?) that were unsettling.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound\\n\r\nPersonally, I am not a fan of the art or how the characters were illustrated. Though I understand it just adds to the comedy, I found it absurd that middle-schoolers from the Body Building Club look like old men. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the fight scenes were admittedly amazing and artfully executed. The same can be said about the accompanying on-point sound track and effects. These definitely boosted entertainment value. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nFor this portion, I wanted to highlight those who were of significance and displayed noteworthy growth. \\n\\n\r\nShigeo Kayema aka \"Mob\"\\n\r\nUsually, main characters with invincible and inexplicable powers cause a plot to lack conflict and the hero to be one-dimensional. Mob, being the complex personality that he is, thankfully is not that way. \\n\r\nAt the beginning, he is shown as a loner who just wants the girl he likes to notice him. As the story unfolds, we see that there are two great things about him - his humility and his steadfast virtuousness. As mentioned, Mob has this ultimate prowess that no one can beat. Despite that, he views himself as a below-average person who needs to work harder than everyone else to amount to something. This inspires those around him to be better. Mob is definitely socially awkward, gullible, and needs to \"get a clue.\" But it is precisely this innocence that pushes him to hold on so strongly to his ideals (to a fault sometimes). Backed by his power, he is able to protect those values he holds dear. Even if he is a simpleton with a lackluster personality, these qualities exude this special charisma that draw people towards him.\\n\\n\r\nArataka Reigen \\n\r\nReigen, the master of Mob, runs a low-cost psychic company that exorcises evil spirits and assists with paranormal concerns. He is the one who taught Mob to stick to all these wonderful ideals and values. The irony of it all is that Reigen is actually not psychic, but a con-artist who masters in deception and psychological manipulation. \\n\r\nMany are angered at Reigen for being so two-faced and using Mob's powers to fuel his business. However, I believe that at the end of the series, we see how Reigen actually does hold fast to his virtues and deeply cares about Mob.\\n\\n\r\nTeruki Hanazawa aka \"Teru\"\\n\r\nAt the first encounter with Teru, he is described perfectly: a big fish in a small pond. As he is the only one with psychic powers in his school, he believed he was the \"chosen one\" and the best in the world. \\n\r\nIn the face of Mob, who has modesty, true talent, and power, he is humbled and changes.\\n\\n\r\nRitsu Kageyama\\n\r\nBeing Mob's younger \"normal\" brother and the pressures he inflicts on himself, Ritsu has the most fascinating character development. In all other aspects one would customarily call exemplary - brains, brawn, good moral standing (he's in the student council), and social popularity - he has nothing lacking; Mob even looks up to him. However, none of these matter to Ritsu compared to his older brother's talent. He has a bro-con like no other, holding his oniichan as the standard of success. He is outwardly very kind and put-together, but in actuality continuously badgers himself with \"why don't I have psychic powers.\" \\n\r\nOnce presented with the opportunity to taste the forbidden fruit at the price of his integrity, it's interesting how his power-drunk character affects the choices he makes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe series takes you through this awesome ride, with such a relatable setting and down-to-earth personalities. Just to reiterate, the plot forces that propels the evolution of the characters in Mob Psycho 100, coupled with the insane visuals and evenly powerful audio, is truly astounding. This really draws you even deeper into its spell. Though imperfect because of its lack of closure, I am definitely looking forward to the next season.",

            "content": "Now, I may be a slightly bit biased, considering this anime was the first I completely finished. However, in my defense, if I had done the same for an anime I didn't enjoy as much, I wouldn't be writing this review.\r\nI don't have experience with ONE's other work (One Punch Man), but I'm glad I was introduced to him through Mob Pyscho 100. This anime is exceptional, and coming from someone who is very picky about what kind of anime they would even want to try out, that is saying a lot.\r\nLet's first discuss the characters. The score I gave this particular piece is a10/10. The way these characters are written and presented are genius, to say the least. They each have very strong personalities--even the characters that only appear for a couple minutes in an episode. Meanwhile, the main characters are likable, even if you're not really supposed to like them. They each have a very unique charm to their personalities, something that--as a writer--is very difficult to achieve. Regein and Mob are irresistible and their relationship is incredibly fun to watch. Despite Mob being the exact opposite of what is supposed to be expected of a MC of this type of show, he is fun and lovable. You root for him and want the best. Each character is well-introduced, and you learn what they're about very quickly. ONE and Bones did an excellent job of creating and then interpreting/presenting these characters.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the plot. I gave this particular section an 8/10, because it is a very simple plot line, but the little differences within it really make it stand out. The plot line follows a middle schooler nicknamed Mob, who is an incredible esper. However, he doesn't like his powers, since he'd much rather be improving himself to impress the girl he likes (who likes big muscles, rather than a guy with psychic abilities). He's mentored by the conman Reigen Arataka, who cares for Mob in his own way, all the while teaching him life lessons. It sounds like a plot that many people have seen before, which is partly the reason why I didn't give this a full 10/10. That being said, Mob is not like every happy-go-lucky protagonist, in fact, he's the exact opposite, which makes the plot stand out a bit more. His out-of-place personality pushes the plot out of the box of copycat shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art! I gave this a 10/10 because, wow, is this animated spectacularly. I will admit I like shows with different styles more than the usual anime look, but even so, the animation is never boring. We are very rarely left with ten seconds of a frozen screen where the only movement comes from characters' mouths, and if it is frozen, the animators and artists do it in a way that makes it stand out, so it doesn't bore the audience. Because the art style is based on ONE's original webtoon, the character designs are simple enough that more time can really be spent on creating interesting animation and explosive scenes. The use of different mediums also keeps the viewers on their toes, and it is, personally, one of my favorite parts of the show. The way they mix classic animation with different mediums helps make the scene's mood even stronger. Not to mention, it looks great (just take the EP, I mean, that shit is gorgeous!). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Mob Psycho 100 is a great show, and I will never stop recommending this show to people interested in watching anime. This continues to be the only anime I have ever scored a 10/10 on MAL, since I've been watching more and more shows. I wouldn't mind if Bones did not come out with a second season, because these 12 episodes have done an incredible job of telling the story of Mob, and continue to entertain me even after I have watched it twice after my first viewing--though, I sure as hell wouldn't mind to see more great Reigen scenes!",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 is, in my considered opinion, a perfect anime. It does not have a flaw. I will go through the six review categories one by one. \r\nSTORY: 10\r\nThe story of this season of Mob Psycho 100 is essentially about being a complete human being. Mob has unbelievable psychic abilities, but ever since he was a child, he's never been able to use them to get the things he really wants. His quest is to fit into his social environment and become a strong, responsible young man. Mainly, this is because he wants to date a girl named Tsubomi, a childhood friend of hiswho just doesn't care that much about him, them having grown apart as she fit in with their peers and he did not. From there, he gets a part time job helping a fraud psychic through the occasional real paranormal encounter, joins a club in order to become stronger, and has several misadventures along the way, most notably becoming involved with a criminal syndicate and having to deal with being a child placed in an adult situation. This story escalates perfectly, never bogs down, and spends every one of its episodes exploring Mob and his environment in meaningful, interesting ways. \\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\r\nThis show's artstyle is done a massive injustice by its still frames. Every animation here is perfect for the scene, with an absolute minimum of wasted screentime and moneysaving animation shortcuts. Action is fast paced and fluid, dialogue is visually interesting and well-directed, and story elements come as much from the visuals as the dialogue. The OP deserves special mention here. It's a visual treat,  laying the show's absurd universe out with surreal transformation cuts and plenty of spoiler-free references to later chapters of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nThe voice acting is superb, the effects are evocative and unique, and the soundtrack is an absolute masterpiece. One of the best aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\r\nI'm not going to dive too far into individual summaries here, partially because there are a lot of characters and partially because I could never do them justice in a short-form review. If you want essays pm me, I'll write em. The main cast is complex, believable, thoroughly likeable, and surprisingly human for how goofy this show's universe and story are. The side characters are fun as well, with just enough going on to keep them fun without dragging the story away from Mob and his core group. No complaints, and special shout outs to two things: the dialogue, which is consistently hilarious, and the character Reigen Arataka, who is the standout of the show for sure. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nThis show is, first and foremost, a comedy, and it is hilarious. The characters are funny without being unlikeable or unrealistic (in the context of the show's universe), the visuals are snappy and over-the-top in the way only animated comedies can really nail, and the setting is flexible and bizarre enough to absorb a hell of a lot of wackiness without breaking down. It's not quite on the level of Nichijou, humor-wise, but it lands every joke it tells and the psychic battles more than pick up the slack. They are gorgeous, weighty, consequential, shockingly brutal at just the right times in just the right amounts, and feel like the emotional climaxes that they (thanks to the framing device of Mob's emotional breaking point being shown onscreen as a percentage) literally are. ONE outdoes One Punch Man in a lot of ways with Mob Psycho 100, but this is the area where I think this show stands out the most. An absolute freaking blast to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n\r\nIt's perfect. Watch it. Watch it again if you already did. Read the manga for ONE's raw storyboarding. Listen to the soundtrack. Support the official release. It's perfect.",

It has some of the most impressive animation since One-Punch Man, every episode has at least few moments of outstanding animation and fights are always breathtaking. When the show tries to be funny it very much is, there's plenty of comedy here both in visuals and dialogue and aside from visuals that's the second biggest strength of the show.\r\nMy gripe lieswith everything from episode 5 where show goes to shit and episode 11 where it gets back up. For pretty much half of the show's run time it forgets what it's good at which is being funny and tries to tell a completely asinine, edgy story about jealousy, fear of your own powers and not fitting into society due to one reason or another. None of those are bad by themselves but the way it's done is lazy and predictable way that doesn't add anything to the story and almost completely cuts out comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it, funny, good looking show that for whatever reason forgets what it's good at for half of the run time.",

            "content": "When magic becomes commonplace it becomes redundant.\r\nThat is one of the messages this series has. \r\nStory: 7\r\nMob Psycho 100(now on referred as MP100 for sake of convenience) is in a way kinda brilliant anime, it redefines and combines genres into a big clump of fresh breeze. If you are familiar with slice of life anime's you know that they tend to be devoid of any major plot as they are meant to reflect \"normal life\", well MP100 manages to stay true to that statement while maintaining story arch common to shounen and action series. Although MP100 has story full of motives and end goal itmakes it redundant since the series ain't about the story but about growing up. Without spoiling any details I will say that there are many small sub plots in the series which will all intertwine in some manner and each one of these sub plots witness various characters coming of age story, Mob- kun's being in the spotlight. The \"main story\" is not that important and is pretty generic but it serves well as a medium to tell the stories that are really the important ones here.\\n\r\nEnough with story onto art\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThis is kinda subjective. I personally enjoy Ones art style a lot and the animations are made fluently. There is a lot of over the top animating in this series and it has strong graphical representation which conveys the mood of the scene well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe music fits the series well. I adore the opening music! All the voice actors are solid. I especially enjoyed Sakurai Takahiro's performance as the sleezy con artist Reigen and Itou Setsuo's as Mob.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is one of the things where this series shines! All the characters, even though some of them fall into obvious shounen/action archetypes, feel unique in some way. You cry for them, you will detest them and you will cheer for them. There ain't completely one dimensional character in the series (on the exception of a few supporting characters) they have personality and most of them grow as a character throughout their limelight.\\n\r\nAlthough I must say Mob annoys me time to time but there's a plot heavy reason for that and I can look over it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 Overall:8\\n\r\nMP100 is solid series, not perfect but very good nonetheless. It's fresh and interesting I highly recommend at least watching it. It is sibling of one punch man that is for sure but it still has it's own stuff while being very smart  analogy about some serious important thing (this time growing up) disguised into more carefree action packed package.",

The only anime I enjoyed more than this one is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\r\nYet, I have to say that the story and the characters are pretty mediocre. The only character I find pretty interesting is Reigen Arakata. He has skills in so many other domains, but why did he chose to activate in exorcism? I like Mob too, because he is pretty relatable in my opinion. The story is pretty good, not outstanding. I like the main characters of ONE`s works. They are socially awkward, yet indestructible, a combination that I absolutely adore.\r\nThe artof this anime is just too good. I really love the design of the characters and the surroundings. I also love the intro and the ending, which are just incredibly well done. \\n\r\nThe intro is by far ONE of the greatest intros I have ever seen (haaa, i made a pun there, ha, ha... yeah, I know I am not funny). It compresses the whole anime in just 1:30 minutes, and the soundtrack is just amazing. Adaptations of ONE`s work are simply amazing and I look forward to more Mob Psycho 100 and One Punch Man in the future.",

The music is good enough that you may end up listening to some of its soundtracks during your free time. The characters are diverse, interesting, and they fit very unique roles that go together surprisingly well. Also, Reigen may be one of the coolest charactersin anime ever conceived.

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 is an anime that at first has a rather unclear tone. Is it a comedy? Is it a parody? Action? Well, it turns out to be a mix of all these things. On the face of it, you have your standard overpowered shounen character, like in OPM (although Mob does have the weakness that his power can overwhelm him and then run out of charge for a bit). But the themes of this anime and how they are explored is where the true strength of this anime lies.\r\nMob hates the fact that his powers are the only excellent thing about him andso tries to become like his brother- good at more normal things like sports and getting girls. Mob's brother is jealous of Mob's incredible power. Reigen is a fluke clairvoyant but has strong core principles of non violence. The character development in this anime is phenomenal and the true strength of the anime. It's what seperates it from OPM, it's not a shoenen parody, it's a well done mash up of slice of life, supernatural thriller and character based comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very unique. It's like it has been drawn in part with crayons. I find it to be refreshing and the bright colours are both appealing and suit the show as it allows for a vivid portrayal of the ghostly powers of the espers and phantoms.\\n\\n\r\nThe only things drawing the anime back are- the first three episodes for one. They are rather slow to start and many people did quit the anime because of them, missing out on the gripping action that was just out of reach to them as they did not have the patients. Sometimes guys, the 3 ep rule just does not work. Reigen is a great character but some of his advice to Mob was stupid, like his non violence that he stands by to such a point as to put Mob and his friends in danger, as he can't even fathom using violence in self defense. This behaviour is not really rewarded as Mob defends them anyway in such a way as to fool Reigen that he was doing it and with no violence. One last flaw is that some of the humour is very anime, if you know what I mean, and as such VERY hit and miss, but many moments also worked well, like Asahi losing his hair.\\n\\n\r\nAside from these flaws, this is a solid anime. I found it to be ONE's true masterwork and much better than One Punch Man, even if this one doesn't have the flashy animation to fool people into believing otherwise. A solid 7/10 from me.",

            "content": "TL;DR Mob Psycho 100 is gorgeous eye-candy with real substance to back it up. 8/10\r\nArt: 10/10 The most unique part of Mob Psycho 100 (MB100) is the art direction. At the beginning, the goofy character designs have great comedic effect, but that serves later to juxtapose the beautifully rendered scenes of Mob's psychic power. The magic seems extra profound and powerful in a world that is usually oversimplified, bland, or hilariously ugly. Fights are stunningly well animated, and well choreographed for maximum excitement. The art makes the lighthearted scenes funnier and the serious scenes more powerful, and I give many props to this show forthat.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters: 8/10 The story revels in good strong character development and an impressive set of morals and ideals that you wouldn't expect from the goofy outset. But like One Punch Man (perhaps even more so), MP100 is more than capable of delivering relatable emotions and character-driven plot. The characters have a wealth of depth to their personalities. They fall and rise and fall; they make mistakes and learn from them, and that is very satisfying to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 The Opening is very catchy and is a blast to listen to, but nothing else stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nA strong show overall. Would very much like a second season to keep it going. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 was a simply superb anime from start to finish.  Hilarious, action packed and full of unique characters.  Throughout the first half of the anime, I thought it truly had the potential to make it into my Top 20 all time, and although it didn't make it in the end, it was pretty darn close.  \r\nThree things make this anime great: \r\n1. The humor.  This is more an action anime than a comedy, so they aren't trying to constantly make you laugh.  There is some palpable drama in the anime and serious moments, but the humor is interspersedat a nice pace and the jokes really land when they do come.  \\n\\n\r\n2. The action.  The art style of the anime really played well with the action scenes.  It's animated a lot like Kill La Kill/One Punch Man, which allowed the action to flow smoothly.  The fights were amazing, specifically when Mob fights the Shadow Boss and his first encounter in an alleyway with a Scar.  \\n\\n\r\n3. Arataka Reigen.  This anime wouldn't be nearly as good as it was without Reigen.  A con man who has managed to make himself the mentor of Mob, he shines as the best, funniest character in the whole anime.  I would easily watch a spinoff with him as the main focus of an anime.  I had actually planned to deduct points off of the anime for its ending when it first started to play out, but it was Reigen's strength as a character that actually made it better than I think it would've been had it been a traditional Shounen type ending.  (You'll understand what I mean once you see the final episode.).   \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to these three things, the anime also provided a strong supporting cast, that I actually would like to see get more time if a 2nd season is ever produced.  Specifically the members of the Body Improvement Club and the Telepathy Club.  Dimple was also a stand out supporting character.  Normally mascots are irritating and needless, but the scheming evil spirit fit the story nicely and added to the anime, not subtracted from it.  The score was also outstanding.  The opening theme was especially beastly.    \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't find much bad to say about it.  I'm not sure if the ending is going to be everyone's cup of tea, but it worked for me.  Mob is also a timid MC, but he has to be in order for the characters around him to work.  So, his flaccid temperament is synergistic with the plot and cast and works well.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you haven't watched Mob Psycho by now, definitely check it out.  It definitely earns its high rating here on MAL.   \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

The unorthodox colorful animation is a sight to behold, and the dynamics of movement are marvelous, if there is something speedy, you can really feel the speed! The addition of humour in form of the teacher/sensei/boss is a nice twist and gives another layerto this already exquisit experience of an anime! \\n\\n\r\n10 out of 10!",

            "content": "I have a little community of anime watchers where I come from. None of them exists on my friends list because I'd die of embarrassment if they ever saw one of my reviews. Anyway, the one thing that I always tell them is that Mob Psycho 100 is one of the most brilliant anime in all existence. But why? Why would I tell them this anime is worth their time, that this is my go-to recommendation for anyone who hasn't watched it? Why would I tell them that this anime should be a higher priority on your watch list than Full Metal Alchemist, Code: Geass,Attack on Titan, Boku No Hero Academia, One Punch Man or any other insanely popular 8/10 or above show on this website?\\n\\n\r\nWell... The answer is simple. If I showed you a 5-second clip from each of the aforementioned shows and asked you to pick out a single clip which was the funniest, most badass and unique. Mob Psycho 100 is the only one of those clips that could fulfil all 3 of those categories and therefore would be the only logical winner. Yes, Attack on Titan has its badassery but I don't think it ever made me laugh. Yes, Full Metal Alchemist has its story but I don't think I've ever feared for the worst possible outcome. Yes, Boku No Hero Academia has its entertaining battles but none of them, and I mean none of them, could start and finish within 5 seconds and still possess the raw power of a scene that Mob Psycho 100 provides oh so well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nA la the nature of ONE, the story follows a very cut and paste theme of \"a young boy with a hidden power gets mixed up in a load of sh*t\". But, this is ONE, the revered creator of the Doomfist anime, which means it takes the utter piss.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the entire series, you'll find that Mob never once plays along with the story. All of the enemies are like \"mwuhahaha I'm the big bad evil motherf*cker, there's no way you'll beat me, prepare for a fight that will last at least 40 episodes (*not including filler)\". All while this is happening, bystanders are thinking \"Oh he's finished now, they'll never beat Mr. bigbadmotherf*cker\" or \"Mob can't do this, he's gonna have a breakdown **EMPHASISED ANIME GRUNT**!!\"\\n\\n\r\nNow, if this was Bleach, I would have just described this week's episode to you. If this was Boku No Hero Academia, I would have just described Deku's 5-minute inner monologue that he does before a 10-minute fight.\\n\r\nHowever! This is Mob Psycho 100! And we have a protagonist who is as arsed with this fight as he is with watching every single episode of One Piece back to back. So what does he do? He casually walks up to the f*cker and flicks him in the forehead. DEAD.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the case with pretty much the whole anime, void a few instances where Mob's pacifist ideals come into play, and you'd think it would get boring. Actually, reading it back, if what I just described happened 13 times in a row then I'd probably give this anime a pass. The miracle of this show (and this is what ONE really is good at) is that this CAN happen 13 times in a row and be different and more entertaining every time. With added pieces of mystery and the little 0 to 100 buildup that Mob does from time to time, fights really, and I mean REALLY get you going. The show isn't about \"how will he win?\". It's about \"How will the opponent respond when he's done getting f*cked upside under?\".\\n\\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning, as an aside, that Mob is in no way looking to get stronger (like every anime character ever). Instead, everyone thinks that he cares about his own strength but Mob just wants normalcy. Instead of asking \"wise master Regan\" what to do to strengthen himself he asks him how to get girls and make friends. Its a lot less entertaining when written in words but don't underestimate the power this has in making this story as good as it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nOne thing that you'll notice right off the bat is that Mob Psycho 100 has a very unique art style. One thing that I will say about Bones is that they're very good at what they do but this goes above and beyond. For anyone that has seen any of ONE's drawings, you'll see how that has translated into this exaggerated, glossy and all in all brilliant art style. Just pay attention to the little details, slight movements and emphasised frames and you'll understand... At least I hope you do cause I really hate writing about the art.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about sound. While not as impressive as the rest of the anime, Its still f*cking exquisite. The anime opens up with a short and cryptic fight scene between a bunch of 'T H I N G S' but pay attention to the music. Even if you're not sure about this anime, watch the first minute or two and simply listen, because that's what you can expect and you can decide for yourself if you like it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nI think my opening paragraphs and story section did a pretty good job of describing Mob as a person, so I'll just skip right on ahead to the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nIn Mob Psycho 100 there are 2 distinctive characters that I want to talk to you about. Reigen and Teruki.\\n\r\nReigen is f*cking hilarious. Hands down. As a con man posing as an all-powerful psychic who specialises in exorcisms... and backrubs, he could single-handedly carry this show on his back. Without spoiling too much, let me tell you about what kind of person he can be. Towards the end of the series, Reigen challenges the most powerful enemy of the group. His opening attack is to pull out a coin on a string - everyone is assuming he's gonna try to hypnotise them. After a few seconds of peace and silence, he proceeds to uppercut the b*tch and send em flying across the room like a paper ball. He has no powers at all. He is completely outmatched. But he's an amazing con man and one of the funniest people in all anime and this scene demonstrates that perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nTeruki is possibly the second most powerful member of the \"good guy\" team. His introduction was very interesting as he starts off as an egotistic shadow-leader with an obsession with his own importance. In short, he's a complete tit. Of course, as is true to my first paragraph, his royal slamjam twizzlerdunkerino turns him into a new person and he ends up being the key example of character development in the series. This may be worthy of criticism as this development literally happens in 2 seconds. He went from left wing to right wing in under 1.4 seconds. He also went through a wall...\\n\\n\r\nBoth of them together make up for the lack of personality that comes with Mob's character. I can't criticize Mob's monotonous personality as its who he is meant to be, is key to the story and you really can't notice it when these two are in a room with him. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - \\n\r\nI really can't put it any other way. I loved this anime. Loved it Loved it Loved it Loved it Loved it.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nSo that is why I recommend that all of my chums watch Mob Psycho 100. That is why it should belong at the top of their priority list and that is DEFINITELY why you should too.\\n\\n\r\nRight then, now that I'm done with that I'll just read back through it and OH MY GOD HOW LONG DID I MAKE THIS IM SO SORRY.",

            "content": "It's a good example, that even with such a simple setting, as school, guy having a super power and falls in love with a classmate, can be fascinating. Everything about this anime feels set up in place, like notes in inspired piano melody. And here's why. \r\nFirst, even though this title is about supernatural stuff and physcic powers, feeling and memories of all the characters are always in the first stage. Powers, regardless of how mighty they are, don't matter, what does is how human you are, what person you are right now or will be. And that, I think, is a very valuable message.The story tells so much more than just Mob fighting with whoever. \\n\r\nAction. Mob Psycho is constantly hyping you with new enemies, or location, or with showing Mob's true power. And it doesn't hesitate with action sequence, I knew immideatily that all fighting scenes are gonna be marvellous. I couldn't help myself, but to eat episodes one after another. I believe if I saw this on japanese TV when it first aired, I would be dying to see the next episode.\\n\r\nArt and animation are incredibly creative. You can definitely see that even animators had fun drawing this anime. They used different techniques, art styles for certain slapsticks and emotions, it only adds to an amazing story. It's almost as if you can feel what characters feel through the screen.\\n\r\nIMHO must-watch, you're surely missing if you overlook this title.",

            "content": "Those series ended up being a bit.. underwhelming.\r\nThere are some similarities with one punch man, in the sense that there are people with supernatural abilities here. However unlike one punch man, this title is more focused on character development and motives, plus on the protagonist's character, and character's choices. I enjoyed action parts of the show, and character-development part of the shoe.\r\nThe problem is... the story for some reason took an unexpected direction in episodes near this season's end, and I didn't enjoy those episodes much. Didn't see the ending coming, though.\r\nAdditional details are below.\r\nStory:\r\nAside from few episodes near the end, it iinteresting. Characters aresomewhat relatable, and are not cliched, although there are several one-time comic characters showing up now and then.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe show mimics original art by ONE. Meaning it is very different from standard anime - character's are drawn in simplistic/rough fashion, and some of the background characters may be downright ugly and may resemble unskilled drawings. However, you quickly get used to this style, and it works great in action scenes. It is not Kemonozume, but it is fairly unusual. Still all the important characters are quite well drawn, despite the overall \"rough\" style.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVery entertaining/interesting intro song. Overal music is very good, without any cliched themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, they're relatable and undergo character development, although some of them serve as comic relieff. Characters aren't as simple as they would seem at a first glance, and over the time they slowly develop, plus you start learning new sides of their character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is good, but I expected more after seeing first episodes. It is definitely worth checking out, and probably would work best if you watch the whole season in one sitting.",

            "content": "As with One Punch Man, characterization is a strength while the story is a weakness. But this review is about Mob Psycho 100, so let's get started with that.\r\nStory: 6 for Fair\r\nThe same format as OPM. In the beginning, there's a teacher and a student. The student follows the teacher, even though said teacher has nothing to give the student. They defeat some things because they profit from it and want to help others. (In OPM there's rankings and in MP100 there's money.) And there's more of a story at the end, something that links the last few episodes and ties them together as moreof a sequential progression. Nothing about it was too new or innovative, but it moved.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 for Very Good\\n\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100's art is also incredibly experimental in comparison to OPM. With techniques like paint-on-glass animation, the paranormal scenes can contrast the more realistic ones. It's beautiful to GIF and beautiful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 for Good\\n\\n\r\nThere's not really much to remark upon here. I did appreciate the musical scores during or approaching battle scenes, but this was more towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 for Good\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic does not attach itself to any new format: Mob/Reigen can just be seen as Genos/Saitama, albeit with different motivations. (Reigen relies on Mob for profit and possible emotional fulfillment.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd Mob bears many similarities to Saitama. He is not concerned with power, but he is concerned with finding a purpose in life. He is almost effortlessly strong. His indifference is not unique. However, Ritsu's relationship with Mob makes him different from Saitama. Ritsu humanizes Mob, in a way. The Body Improvement Club and Tsubomi also help with this. \\n\\n\r\nI truly loved Reigen. While Mob doesn't exactly need a father figure, Reigen is receptive to his calls for help. I commend the timing of the Mob/Reigen backstory. It's not exactly revolutionary, but it was more interesting than having it at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 8 for Very Good\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy Mob Psycho 100. It's a good twelve episode stretch where you're introduced to solid characters and stimulating visuals. However, the story is lacking. Character development and relationships were the things to attach me. If you're looking for a better story than OPM, maybe MP100 isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Noragami to anyone who's enjoyed this one, as well. It reminds me of Noragami in terms of the \"there's always an exception to death\" rule, and just the overall theme and look of spirits.",

            "content": "So... Let me just say I went to this with some expectations - having watched One Punch Man (Season 1) and hearing about how much Mob Psycho 100 lived up to the hype and learning the hard way it kinda doesn't...? Sorry guys, if you wanted me to start gushing about this show left and right, this review ain't gonna be about that.\r\nI'll try to make this simple and concise: psychic abilities aren't that new a concept, nor are they original. But fine, I can let that pass. The author just needed a new way to make stories about overpowered characters - and don't thinkI'm throwing this at the author's face: it works. Mostly, at least. With One Punch Man, it did. And I'm sorry if y'all don't like comparisons but it's very easy to difficult not to compare the author's different works, specially when they're this similar.\\n\\n\r\nLet's do this by parts.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: It's not that special, but not that bad, either. The characters are the redeeming quality, because I believe the author at least tried to make them feel real, gave 'em a moral compass or lack-there-of, etc. The story is highly bland if you look at it from an entertaining standpoint, of course, it's all for the sake of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry, but the only CLOSE THING I did to laughing while watching this show was smiling when the main character had a wholesome moment or when those \"IMMA-KILL-THIS-KID-HERE-AND-NOW\" followed by the villain being brutally crushed by the protagonists moments hit. Those were funny, truly never gets old. This may be debatable, but I believe that's why One Punch Man is so appreciated, too. But that's another show, of course, let's keep our eyes on this one.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: The one genuinely funny character? Reigen. The wholesome ones? Mob and Ritsu. The good ones? Dimple, the blond guy (sorry, can't remember his name) and the Bodybuilding Group Guys.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: For me, the opening got stale after 1 listen. I didn't even bother to listen to the whole ending. Not going to shit on either, though.\\n\\n\r\nART: The art is fairly good but highly reminiscent of One Punch Man. Not to say it doesn't look good, but it definitely has that \"more of the same\" vibe. Other than that, the animation MOSTLY holds up. Here's the thing: I get that some moments are pure and raw power and action, but some action sequences were ruined because of bad direction. Episodes 6-7 have examples of that. Once again, it's mostly my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Watched it till the end for the characters. I haven't made up my mind about watching season 2. It was definitely entertaining, but I can't say the rating on this site is that accurate, though.\\n\\n\r\nHope this review helps ya!",

While the art style is a bit abstract, it's not bad by any means. The animation quality was great and there was good character development of the lead characters. Mob Psycho 100 is a perfect combination of funny and exciting with a little bit of wtf added to the mix. If I had to judge this anime using only one word, it would definitely have to be \"bruh\" lol.

            "content": "Mob Psycho 100 i think is the 2nd best anime of 2016 just bested by Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. Here are my thoughts (spoiler warning ahead)\r\nStory 9\r\nThe story of Mob Psycho 100 is about a boy named Shigeo Kageyama commonly referred to as Mob, Mob has supernatural psychic powers. Mob works under Arataka Reigen whom Mob calls his master thanks to Reigen giving him life lessons, Reigen is an \"exorcist\" but is actually a fake and uses Mob to fight the spirits with his powers but also trying to keep Mob in check so he wouldn't go out of control with his powers because whenhe reaches 100% he would go berzerk and loses control of his powers going in a blind rage in the process.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Mob Psycho 100 i think is pretty fucking amazing, the pacing of the story is also pretty great and it's pretty tough getting only 12 episodes for a action supernatural anime without it getting rushed but in the end it's paced perfectly, if i got to say one thing i dislike it's probably the ending, it's pretty sequel baiting but that's it, the story is pretty great\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Mob Psycho 100 is vivid and amazing. In my opinion this has got to be the best show that Bones has ever animated. Every single frame looks smooth and beautiful, the interaction between characters are also really well animated with the face expressions smoothly animated. The action scenes are really where it's at in terms of animation, Every single thing the characters do in the fight scenes are amazingly animated and choreographed with the supernatural techniques looking as beautiful as they can be and the opening and ending animation are amazing as fuck\\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Mob Psycho is pretty good but i find the soundtrack excluding the OP and ED kind of lacking but that's a minor complaint, the sound of the anime is great with the action scenes again being the high point with the sound design\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character in the anime is great, but my highlight goes to Arataka Reigen, he is just so well developed from being a con artist that you would probably hate in the beginning but once Mob tells all these stories about him giving Mob superb advice for dealing things in life you can tell he's more than meets the eye, that doesn't mean that Mob the main character isn't great he's fucking amazing, especially during the second half of the show. The main supporting characters are also pretty good with Mob's little brother, Hanazawa and Ekubo being the highlights for the main supporting characters (the main characters other than Mob and Reigen)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know how to explain how i enjoyed the show so much but my god i did\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\\n\r\nI think Mob Psycho 100 might be the most fun i had last year with the show being great in every way possible in my perspective so i'll probably have a blast again rewatching this show",

The animation is really incredible as well, and paired up with the bright and unique art style, this is one of the best looking anime out there in my opinion.\r\nI've heard many people say that this show is too similar to One Punch Man, and there are clear similarities, such asthe character design of manga artist One, creator of both Mob Psycho 100 and OPM, and the concept of an overpowered main character. \\n\r\nPersonally, I do not think this detracted from my enjoyment, as the two shows vary quite a lot in the themes they tackle, and don't end up feeling too similar.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is a solid 9/10 from me.

            "content": "The only thing that stopped me from watching this earlier was because I just didn't know about it. If I'd have known one of my favourite content creators had released a new anime, I would have jumped on it from day one (heh).\r\nSTORY: 7\r\nThe actual storyline-story doesn't show up until halfway through the season, but up to that point, I was okay with it just being a slice-of-life anime about a kid with psychic powers. The meat of the plot is your standard bad guys doing bad guy things, but with something bigger possibly brewing under the surface (and the ever-nearing Season 2), I hopeI can look forward to something a bit more unique later on.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is basically lifted right from the manga (with a few necessary touch-ups), and it fits very well. The dynamic lighting makes the sort of simplistic art style stand out from other anime that have the \"rough edges\" style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs I said above, I watched the English dub. I can't complain about any of the character's voices; they fit them all very well. I may give the sound an 8 overall, but if I were to rate the opening, I would have to give it higher than a 10! It's a top contender for my favourite anime OP of all time (so far).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines, for the most part. The main characters are so fun and distinct. But the best part of the writing is that the character flaws practically write the story. The situations they get into, and how the situation plays out, depends on their personalities; I don't think anyone does anything remotely out of character. However, as great as the main characters are, the side characters are really left on the sidelines, with almost no development whatsoever. I get that there's not a whole lot you can do in 12 episodes (and maybe I'm a bit spoiled since MHA deals with its supporting characters very well), but with some characters, they hint at a potential story element with them, then leave them alone for a long time. It's a little disappointing, but hopefully they'll get their own chance in the limelight next season.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\\n\r\nI binged this with a friend who had already watched it twice, and I enjoyed every second of it. The use of a meter slowly counting up to Mob's \"Explosion\" builds tension, even moreso as the series progresses and the stakes get higher.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\\n\r\nIt's quirky, it's kick-butt, but more importantly, it has heart. We can sympathize with Shigeo's desire to be more popular (especially as a middle-schooler), and with Ritsu's desire to be more like his older brother. A lot of the rules of this universe seem to be hidden from us, and seem to be revealed only when they need to be. It's very mysterious, but it also likes to play around. It's great, even as a standalone thing, but I'm so looking forward to Season 2 in 2019.",

The show starts off promising but unfortunately the quality goes downhill after 3-4 episodes as the end product becomes neither funny nor deep.. just edgy and uninteresting. The show can't decide whether it's taking itself seriously or not. Both the self-aware jokes and 'deep' ideas are just.. kind of out there without cohesion. Despite boasting character development, the villains either end up dead before they can be developed or are dull and one-dimensional. They mostlyserve as tools for the brother MCs. To be fair, there is only so much you can do in 12 episodes. I felt like this show was experimental in many ways, it tried to be different than the pack but the formula just didn't work. \\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side I enjoyed the artstyle and some of the fight scenes though these were also nothing to write home about. Reigen was a fun character to watch, his interactions were the highlights of the show. In conclusion, unless you're a ONE fan or you want to see Saitama wear different wigs, feel free to pass on this one.",

And damn me, this show destroyed them.\r\nThe animation is awesome, the fight scenes are incredibly well made and the OP is incredible.\r\nReisen is incredible and i ended up wanting to watch more of him.\r\nThe comedy is pretty well made! \r\nAnd holy hell how deep the characters were! \r\nIf there was something i definitely was not expecting from this show was that the characters felt so real (in anime standards) and wellthough. Mob Pyscho aside from being an awesome anime talks a lot about talent, hard work, admiration and fear. And i was blown away of how much i liked those scenes (more than the fights and the comedy).\\n\r\nWhere is the 10/10 score?\\n\r\nThe characters art... A bunch of the characters were...\\n\r\nHey look! Is blonde exorcist saitama with short bowl head saitama! Look thats female photographer saitama! And here he comes the other blonde saitama to kick the ass of the bowl head saitama! Ugh...\\n\r\nI get that Mob and his brother look alike because they are brothers. But some other characters being literally Saitama with a wig was something unforgivable. Why? Because not all the characters are represented in that way. There are a lot of characters that are drawn completely different.\\n\r\nSo its either everyone are Saitama with a wig or only 1 (maybe two if we count the brother in). Nothing in between is forgivable.\\n\r\nThe last point: Pacing.\\n\r\nThis anime goes fast. Ridiculously fast. \\n\r\nCrazy fast. A character can get a power up on an episode and be a complete monster on the next one.\\n\r\nTo the common anime watcher this can be a good thing since they hate filler, backstory and so but i felt that this pacing was so good that it was bad.\\n\r\nIn the end i ended up wanting more of this almost masterpiece. \\n\r\nThe story barely starts in this anime so think of this as a preview to the real show. Just like Re:Zero.",

            "content": "Okay, so these are the basics and I'm not going to delve very deep into them -- strictly in terms of art and humor (and characters, somewhat), this anime is reminiscent of OPM, since the two were written by the same creator. Those are the aspects that stand out the most for me personally, and get a big yes from me. Laughs are granted, especially on account of two certain supporting characters that come in at different points in time.\r\nWhat lowered my final score was the inconsistency of the story.\r\n[SPOILER WATCH: I'M KEEPING IT AS VAGUE AS I CAN BELOW.]\r\nIt started to suffer about halfwaythrough the season -- just around the time Ritsu began to gain more focus, and even more so, specifically as soon as Mob & co. started to get *seemingly* closer to the real villains of the show... only for those villains' trail to become ACTUALLY increasingly confusing. If that sounds like it doesn't make sense, well, the story didn't help me out here much. That's essentially the key word to describe my thoughts on the latter half of the season -- confusion.\\n\\n\r\nLet me recap what that final run of episodes is like -- one bad guy pops up after another, and all of them have their names and powers like the ones that came before, but there comes a point where there's so many of them, and they disappear almost as quickly as they are introduced, and so much is going on with all the shifts and turns and realizations happening in the meantime that it's hard to keep up, and on top of that you discover you're now really tired of the location (which is the one thing that doesn't change for the longest time once the characters reach a certain area, and that's a BAD thing), and somehow, suddenly, you find that you... just... don't care anymore. Which is disappointing as hell to realize, when you know you loved the first seven-or-so episodes so much you were totally ready to rate this thing a 9. (Was that paragraph exhausting to read, or what? I swear that is the same feeling you get watching those episodes.)\\n\\n\r\nIn view of my love for those earlier episodes as well as the characters, I can't give this less than a 7. There are also parts of the finale that worked for me, I guess (most did not). Still, it's a shame. I'm hoping season 2 pulls through, because this has a LOT of potential.",

The use of good/great drawing sporadically used should also be a main stay of ONEs anime's, used for serious scenes or for a comedic punchat just the right time. Mob going 100% usually happens when he goes unconscious and usually a new \"form\" not apparent in the manga appears so we don't know if this is just Mob's nature or if he is possessed by something. But he has used it consciously in the manga a few times. Single watch is a definite, but multiple watches is only recommended for those who just love the series.",

Under the pseudonym One, he brought this incredible story, but with a drawing quality well below average, but it was the great vision of this man that gave us Saitama and therefore Mob. Unlike the strongest bald man evercreated, Mob retains all his visual style based on One's manga, but at no time does he have to envy Saitama. Mob Psycho is a really great story that exploits another character of overwhelming power in search of more human goals, added to that to its somewhat bizarre animation, brings truly unique moments. A story that really is worthwhile.",

This show has redemption,kindness, and extremely colorful fights. A mc that's already powerful that can fuck up any egoistic villain really strokes your knob of excitement. The villain makes dumb jokes about how they'll destroy the mc only to get bop bop to the head and explode. If you don't find these typeof anime funny, at least give it a try. I find this repetitive as well but Mob Psycho does it so brilliantly you can't stop watching. It's not master piece but it aight cuh.\\n\\n\r\nProgression Toward's Mob Explosion: 100%",

            "content": "I take in consideration that Mob Psycho 100 might just not be my thing although I loved One Punch Man from the same creator, but it's not really good. Maybe it just went over my head. There's this metaphor about people born with psychic powers aka \"people who are special\" that are greatly advantaged in life, just like our normal world where some people are extremely good at stuff and it advantages them more or less the same way. But they're also still human after all and luck is also a factor, just like real life. I think that's a good idea except you couldmake a compilation of all those dialogues in 5 minutes top. Twelve episodes is too long and too empty to pass this \"theme\" along and it just end up feeling like a boring, uninspired, ordinary shounen despite the unique artstyle and imagination of One.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were pretty boring and lacked substance, except for Reigen, who is exceptional. He's a con artist that screw the metaphor over because he's good at lying and improvising. He doesn't need psychic powers if he can convince a client a ghost exist, he doesn't need powers to exorcise a fake ghost and if he stumble on a real problem, he already convinced arguably the most powerful esper in the world to be his student and employee. He is more interesting than the rest of the cast. The battles are lame too, expect one-sided battles all the time, except when it involves Shigeo/Mob. Then you have to be patient and wait until his counter reaches a hundred percent, then he goes from \"I don't want to hurt anyone and I'm fine getting raped and destroyed\" to \"I'm invincible\".\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to be pretentious or tell people what they should like or not but all in all I feel this is overhyped, it's just not really good. Is it a cheap idea to cash in the success of One Punch Man? Who knows. It had potential, it just falls short. On a positive note, it's not a trash anime. I've disliked shows in the past because they were stinking too hard (Black Lagoon, Fullmetal Panic!, Psycho-pass, etc.) but this one doesn't stink. It's just not a ripe fruit.",

However, unfortunately for me, I was very disappointed.\r\nOne of the main reasons was the art style. I just did not like it at all. I was hoping for it to grow onto me as the series went on but it never happened and it was a constant source of annoyance detracting from the story. However, many people seem to like the unique style so it might be just me so I would suggest giving it a go. Also, despite the art stylebeing bad the animation was a bit better and many scenes rolled out quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason was the characters. I just did not connect with the main character at all. Despite him being quite OP on a physical level, his personality was something I could not stand at all. He is very unemotional and just lacks any resemblance of common sense which makes him just frustrating to follow. The arbitrary restrictions of not using his powers on others imposed by his master also just felt very silly.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the story, it felt very episodic (maybe it was the intention) as opposed to there being a real plot behind it. I also did not like the exorcist element at all a) because it is a very lame concept in the first place imo and b)there was no uncertainty about any encounter ever since the viewer always knew that Mob could take care of the situation",

This review is just personal opinion but may have factual reasons to back up certain parts of the opinion.)\r\nMob Psycho 100 is originally a web manga created by ONE (also created One Punch Man) that was adapted into an anime by Studio Bones. Of course, these two aspects caused a severe hype train among pretty much everyone in the anime community as both ONE and Bones are heavily admired. But for me, those two aspects were severe red flags considering that One Punch Man was a giant disaster of ananime and Bones made My Hero Academia, another giant disaster of an anime, the season before Mob Psycho 100 aired. And looking at Bones' history, they were quite an awful studio in my eyes, as they have also made rather hideous drecks like Fullmetal Alchemist (and Brotherhood), Soul Eater, Space Dandy, Noragami, and many more. Unsurprisingly, I didn't stand corrected and I got just what I expected but even worse; a hideous dreck blown to extreme proportions. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 1/10: \\n\\n\r\nThere really is no saving the storyline here. First, there is this guy named Shigeo Kageyama, a.k.a. Mob, who is an esper with psychic powers and joins Arataka Reigen, who is a conman when it comes to hunting ghosts, and they go on a hunting spree. However, they try to expand it to Mob being ostracized for his esper powers but next thing you know, he makes friends in an instant, nullifying the esper ostracization that might have had the story something to go for. To make matters worse, it is being praised for literally being the antithesis of The Irregular At Magic High School, which is often called out for turning into a harem (of course harems are the biggest scapegoats in regards to anime). Overall, the story just blows and there is no saving this one, but the next aspect is EVEN WORSE!\\n\\n\r\nArt - (-5/10):\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I seriously have to give negative points on the art department because Mob Psycho is by far one of, if not, the most hideous anime I have ever seen, on par with Masaaki Yuasa's works, both in terms of the art style and character designs. And of course, it's not shocking that LITERALLY EVERYTHING IN THE ANIME IS HAND DRAWN, which is the main reason why it's so hideous in the first place. And don't get me started on character designs. ONE's drawings are as bad as they were in One Punch Man, and literally every human being in the anime is a bunch of Saitama clones with wigs (as if Saitama's character design wasn't bad enough)! Seriously, do ONE and Studio Bones seriously hate modern art styles? These seriously make them comes off as a yes to the question, and I won't be surprised if it actually is true. Sadly, it is being praised exactly for that, cutting corners heavily and abstaining from the use of modern technology. And I don't want to feel like I am watching a terribly old anime when watching a modern anime. But this does exactly that in one of the strongest manners possible. So yeah, one of the worst art I have ever seen in all of anime, so bad it was terribly nauseating.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nYou know, I will give where it's due. The OP, 99, and ED, Refrain Boy, don't sound all that bad. However, that's not saying they're any good at all. Those are just average at best. The rest of the soundtrack isn't worth mentioning as they're just forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 1/10: \\n\\n\r\nAh, the awful world of characters. Mob, the unsatisfied idiot who is terribly nonbadass (ONE's signature move for MC characters, unsurprisingly), Reigen, the conman who walks away scat free, Koyama, a cookie cutter villain who gets praise solely for being in a Studio Bones shonen anime, and a bunch of other character I already stopped caring about now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 0/10: \\n\\n\r\nwhat sort of enjoyment is there, when there is a combination of piss poor storyline, hideously offensive and/or nauseating art style and character designs, average-at-best OP and Ed best forgettable rest of soundtrack, and overall just straight up bad and forgettable characters? For me, there is zero enjoyment and I for one cannot recommend anyone to watch this and become elitists. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 0/10: \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100, and My Hero Academia combined was the death sentence of anime I considered good, as I am constantly running out of anime that interest me. I cannot endorse this at all and I have to consider this as one of, if not, the worst anime I have ever seen in my life.",
