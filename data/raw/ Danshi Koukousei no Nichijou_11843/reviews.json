Playing off the all-too-common \u201cschoolgirls and everyday life\u201d genre, DKN is far more than the mere gender reversal it may first appear to be.\r\nHaving an all-male cast, ignoring the \u201cmoe\u201d factor really works in the show's favor. There is likewise no unnecessaryfan service\u2014the show places jokes first and foremost, and that lends itself well to the short skit-like structure of the various comedy bits. Alternately dry and outrageous, DKN's jokes never fail to solicit a laugh. They are helped along commendably by the flamboyant facial expressions and varying vocal tones for which anime is so well-loved.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to universally recommend a comedy show as the genre draws on what is often rather personal taste. The best parallel I can make to its off-the-wall humor is the type found in many 4-koma and parody manga strips. If you enjoy the aforementioned, you will find yourself at home with DKN.\\n\\n\r\nOf note is the parodic vein of common anime situations, characters, feelings, and stereotypes DKN contains. I don't want to give too much away, but the \u201cmeta\u201d humor it features is a real high point.\\n\\n\r\nEven with its nearly pure comedy focus, DKN manages to achieve the \u201crefreshing\u201d vibe that so many slice-of-life works go for. The author's keen understanding of high school boys' mentality\u2014their zeitgeist, if you'll humor my ten-dollar vocabulary\u2014really shines through in the show's less zany moments, and those of gut-busting hilarity alike. As a male viewer, abundantly flowing were my (figurative) single-cheek tears of laughter and nostalgia at the familiar antics and feeling of young friendship illustrated in this masterwork. \\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention must be made of the insanely clever Literature Girl segments, easily the show's standout and my favorite comedy bits of any show in recent memory. Also to Sugita Tomokazu, the well-loved Kyon, for his excellent portrayal of Hidenori in said skit and across the show at large.\\n\\n\r\nThrough and through, an outstanding show. If you can connect with its brand of comedy, the humor and heart within will stick with you for some time to come.",

            "content": "\"Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.\" F. Scott Fitzgerald. \r\nOh youth and the epic journey called growing up. Most people tend to, in a way or another, be deeply defined by their teenage years. High school is a fond memory to some and a painful one to others, but I think everyone can agree that it is a unique and special period of our lives, one that has no equal. Most people quickly relate the words High School with friendship, as the friends you make in that period of time seem to leave a permanent mark in your memories and sodoes the time you spend with them, most of which is filled talking about something random or even stupid, laughing at simple and normal things, sharing mutual interests and hobbies, talking about the opposite gender in a playful or perverted way and worrying about the weirdest things. Yes, those years you spend in High School are special in a simple and silly way and it is that way that Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (DKN) tries and successfully manages to recreate in a hilarious manner.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] - 8 - Daily Lives of High School Boys. That's basically it. It is a standard slice of life type of story, but one that works amazingly well. The episodes are divided into segments and focus on a big number of characters, each of them with his own peculiarities, as he endures daily tasks. To portray something so simple in an amusing way is not easy at all and I think most animes that actually try this end up filled up with dull boring moments that just kill the mood. DKN avoids that in almost every single scene which is quite amazing and even in its worse episode you'll still laugh out loud quite some times. Most segments are short which gives the comedic tone light, random and fast paced giving it a tremendous enjoyability. To sum things up, it isn't an amazing and complex storyline since it is a slice of life, but the setting and the execution of the comedy match and fit each other so well that you just can't care about how simple the story is.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] - 8 - Not much to point out here. The art was acceptably good. It didn't need to be better anyway. The character design was adequate with  a pretty good worn on some characters' expressions. \\n\r\nThe animation was good enough for it. It didn't particularly shine, but I never felt like it needed to be better, so I guess they did a good job with it.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] - 9 - Alright, so I had to give the 9 here for two specific reasons. First of all the soundtrack was very fitting and comedic. The Literature Girl Song cracked me up every single time, it was absolutely perfect for those moments and just hearing the song alone will make you laugh so that's a great job there. Then the second reason lies in the voice actors. Since I'm not an experiences anime reviewer I wasn't sure about where I should talk about this, so I'm just including it within the sound for obvious reasons. Yeah I have to admit I'm a Gintama Fan, so having Sugita (probably my favorite voice actor) and Suzumura playing two of the main characters made the anime that much better. Sugita's voice fit Hidenori too well and his natural ability of making everything he says funny was perfect here. Other than them I also have to positively mention other very fitting voices like Motoharu's (Daisuke Namikawa), Ringo's (Aoi Yuuki) and Yanagi's (Yuu Kobayashi). Indeed a great selection of voice actors.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters] - 9 - Probably one of its strongest points, since most times the punchlines rely completely on the characters as the humor is very character-driven on most scenes. Something very good about this series is the fact that the main character doesn't monopolize every scene, in fact it's just the opposite - he doesn't even show up in two or three episodes at all. The secondary characters are hilarious, each of them playing right into a character stereotype but adding a sort of twist to it. Motoharu, the delinquent who's supposedly badass and mature, but still get's manipulated by older girls and is strangely deep and introspective, also having an above the average sensitivity and fragile spirit. Literature Girl, the mysterious silent girl who stands by the riverside staring into the horizon lost in thought, but she's actually just a naive wannabe novel author looking for an ideal encounter with a guy by the riverside. Among many others.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] - 9.5 - Maybe I'm exaggerating here but I feel that the 10 is appropriate. Most episodes went by extremely fast and I laughed like a mad man at most scenes from beginning to end. If a comedy that achieves that doesn't deserve the 10 in enjoyment then few animes do. I really enjoyed this very much and agree with people that relate its sense of humor to Gintama and Nichijou - which I also liked quite a lot. It really surprised me, since I didn't watch any trailers. I just saw a new anime called Daily Lives of High School Boys and thought \"well I have 20 minutes free so why not? It'll probably be filled with female-targetted fanservice though...\". Then the first episode blew me away. It's actually very easy to tell if you'll like this series or not - just watch the first episode. If you dislike the first episode you don't need to see more as you most likely won't like it at all.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] - 9 - Overall a solid comedy anime that any comedy fan should check out. Get some friends together one afternoon and watch a couple of episodes, it'll probably feel even better!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you decide to give it a shot and thank you for reading!",

            "content": "What is the first thing pop up in your head when you hear a high-school-slice-of life-comedy anime? Boring, if you ask me. I used to think that a pure comedy show revolving around high school students life is so common and dull, my perception changed after I watched Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, I will refer it as Nichibro from this point. The title may give you a doubt, I wouldn't be surprised if you're skeptical, what's so great about watching a comedy anime revolving around highschoolers' everyday life? I'd say Nichibro stands out because it succeed in delivering what it offers, that is comedy.\r\nThe titleof this anime literally describes what this show is all about; the daily lives of high school boys. No it's not about cute boys do cute things, but it's about a group of school boys do what they do best, such as slacking off in a friend's house, pranking on people, talking about girls, telling random stories and any other things in exaggeration manners. Nichibro is a gag based anime much like Nichijou-- its girls counterpart. The format is also similar; every episode of this series is composed of several random short skits which usually are not connected to each other. Each skit focuses on a slapstick humor with a punchline at the end. I personally found most of them hit the mark while others are predictable. It's like getting a present on a Christmas morning; sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you are unsure and sometimes it's an ugly sweater. In other words, some people may find one or two skits boring and unfunny, and some other may not. After all, I believe comedy is very subjective, you can't really argue what's funny or not, it's a matter of taste-- what's funny to one person will not always to another.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, Nichibro is quite decent but it's not amazing either. Although the background is simple but it's pretty detailed especially the buildings which is fine for this kind of show. The characters are well drawn and they look natural, like how the male characters aren't wearing their uniform properly. That's how the high school boys dressed. They leave their ties undone, some characters even don't bother to wear ties at all, their shirt are un-tucked, even Karasawa is wearing a hat all the time. The funny expressions or the faces they make is enough to make me burst out in laughter. The characters are also well animated, I notice some characters look alive and vibrant. There is one thing I'm complaining about its design, they (the studio) probably decided to cut corners by drawing some characters with no eyes or it was simply lazy, I have no idea. Still, one can say it's on purpose to show which ones are the main characters. Overall it doesn't ruin the show thou.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point of this show is the characters. First of all, Nichibro doesn't have much character development. I believe character development isn't always necessary especially in a pure comedy show like this one, as long as they are there to make you laugh, that will do. Now let's check out our main characters, the first is Tadakuni, he is the straight man in the group and probably the most ordinary among the trio, but surprisingly, he's someone you can easy relate to. He's usually needed to pull off the jokes. Hidenori, he's the one who usually comes up with crazy schemes. The last is my favourite, Yoshitake, the blond guy. He usually plays along when Hidenori comes up with anything stupid. Their exaggerated attitudes, expressions and randomness are really amusing to watch. In the midst of the series, in fact, they don't \"eat\" all the screen time. In other words, if one is too \"normal\" being a student, he won't have much screen time. This when the supporting characters rise. I find the supporting roles are very interesting as well, complete with their own unique personalities. One thing I mind is how violence the girls are to the boys. In my opinion, it's a bit overusing for a slapstick joke anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say much about the sound. The opening song is rather typical but I find the ending sequence is really something. They put a skit on the ending which is very interesting. The upbeat and catchy music while the casts are performing a play in cultural festival is hilarious. The randomness on it is epic. I have no complaints for the voice acting. The voice actors fits the characters, especially Hidenori who's voiced by Sugita (he also has done voice for Gintoki). The way when he talks to himself or when he's overthinking something really makes me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal note; Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is a solid comedy show. If you're looking for good laughs, I'd like to suggest you to give it a shot. In my experience, in every episode I've watched I always find at least one or two skits that are funny and memorable. Moreover, I'm sure you can somehow relate them to your highschool life, although it won't be as extreme and funny as in this series. This is the first time I've watched an anime that is divided into several skits each episode and I like it. I would gladly recommend this to everyone. Overall, This show is thoroughly entertaining and worthy my time.",

            "content": "\u201cI suppose if we couldn't laugh at the things that don't make sense, we couldn't react to a lot of life.\u201d \u2013 Hobbes, from Calvin and Hobbes.\r\nAs a stressed out college student, I constantly find myself looking back at my high school years and remembering the fun old times. My all boys school meant that we could rein in free chaos without the worry of having to act proper around girls, so my class and I did all sorts of pranks and whatnot. From playing football in the hallway, to accidentally taking down a security camera, to taking down the school flag and wearing itas a cape, lighting up fireworks in class, all those things. Truth be told, high school was boring, but my classmates made it so much fun during our free time. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is about.\\n\\n\r\nA comedy anime like no other, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (or Daily Life of High School Boys if you prefer) had me laughing just as much (and probably more) as any comedic work out there. I found myself wiping tears from my eyes constantly and enjoying every single second of it. At twelve episodes in length, Danshi Koukousei promises that you will enjoy every single moment.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, Danshi Koukousei has no overarching story. There is no typical high school plot in here as you would imagine from most generic slice of life animes. In fact, the show is presented in what most people would refer to as a \u2018skit\u2019 format. An episode of the anime will generally contain in average eight skits, each of them representing wildly different aspects of the free time that high school boys face on a day to day basis and what they do to liven up their boring lives.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, most of these are exaggerated at some points, but there isn\u2019t anything wrong with that. In fact, it adds more to the realism of the show and how high school boys tend to exaggerate normal situations in their mind. Add that to the fact this anime is a HUGE parody of anime as a whole, taking in various anime tropes and destroying them before your very eyes. Oh you were expecting this to happen? Well haha, FUCK YOU PREDICTABILITY!\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of characters, there is no better way to describe the main cast as extremely human. Each character has his own little quirk that makes him instantly relatable to someone. I found myself constantly laughing and thinking along the lines of: \u201cOh my God that is so my friend from senior year!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast is comprised of the trio of destiny: Tadakuni (whose last name is never revealed and in fact parodied by the show itself), Hidenori, and Yoshitake. Tadakuni is your straight man, the guy who is dragged into the crazy and manic antics that his two best friends get themselves in to. Hidenori is the bespectacled one, the playboy of the group and generally the inner monologue heavy guy who analyzes situations over and over again in a very comedic fashion. And finally, we have Yoshitake, the blonde dyed member of the group who is usually the idiot and goes along with whatever the situation around him dictates. \\n\\n\r\nAside from those three, the anime introduces many many characters throughout the course of its run, giving us a well varied and excellently written cast. However, due to the sheer amount of characters, it\u2019s kind of hard to remember the names of all of them. But, this is beautifully averted when the anime itself tells you that, while it knows its introducing many characters late into the show, it\u2019s not important to remember all their names. \\n\\n\r\nIt is also important to acknowledge the main female characters from this extensive male cast. At the end of every episode, there is an extra skit titled \u201cHigh School Girls Are Funky!\u201d which features three girls (Yanagi, Habara and Ikushima) who are basically the female counterparts of the main trio. While their skits are not as funny as the male ones, they are still the parts of the series where backstory is heavy handed and offers some insight into the past of some of the characters which, at least in my book, is a step in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of animation, the studio responsible for animating this is Sunrise Inc., famous for shows such as The Visions of Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, Tiger and Bunny, among others. In itself, the animation is very simplistic and it actually works in favor of the show\u2019s theme. Add that to the fact that most of the characters sport some weirdly exaggerated faces to go along with some of the jokes makes said jokes all the better. A curious thing to note about the animation is the decision to shadow the eyes of the majority of the small female cast. This, I found out much later, was surprisingly parodied by the show as well in one of the later skits. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast does a beautiful job with the characters as well. Most of the voices are blown out of proportion for some of the jokes, which makes the delivery of them all the better. You might find some of the voices rather familiar, particularly with Hidenori\u2019s seiyuu Tomokazu Sugita, famous for lending his voice to Gintama, another comedy anime. Miyu Irino is present here as the voice of Tadakuni, showcasing his amazing talent, and Kenichi Suzumaru is here as well, giving his voice to the bumbling idiot that is Yoshitake. Add to those three Daisuke Namikawa as the voice of everyone\u2019s favorite delinquent Motoharu, and you have one of the best voiced casts in recent anime history (at least that\u2019s how I see it).\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, the music is also very well executed. Audio Highs, known for their previous work in Bakuman and Gintama, are responsible for the masterfully well-crafted music that is present in this show. The anime sports one opening and one ending, with the opening being \u201cShiny tale\u201d by Mix Speakers, Inc. while the ending theme is \u201cO-hi-sama\u201d by Amesaki Annainin. Both are very good, with the first one really pumping you up for a high school anime while the ending is\u2026 well, stupid. It simply fits with the whole theme of the show in its own, unique, way.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve covered everything there is, it\u2019s time to go down to the final verdict.\\n\\n\r\nThis show means a lot to me. Not just because it made me laugh, but because some of the skits that the show has are actually situations that occurred to me during my daily life while in high school. The days I spent laughing with my friends, worrying about a friend\u2019s little sister (well, actually it was his cousin) and whatnot really brought me memories that had long passed. It made me look back in life and smile at how beautiful everything was with my old friends and how much I miss them. It\u2019s an anime I hold very near and dear to my heart simply because of the feelings it evoked in me while watching it and, truth be told, for being the funniest anime I have seen in my entire life.\\n\\n\r\nDanshi Koukousei no Nichijou gets a very well deserved 9/10. It would be a 10, but the short length left me wanting for more. But, just like everything else, even the short length is parodied by the show. Aside from that, a couple of jokes fell flat on their faces, but this didn\u2019t detract from my overall enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMuch thanks to Mel, for proofreading this (I love you my little internet daughter), Erika, for providing her helpful insight, and my good friend Wendy, who should write some reviews of her own because she is a FREAKING GENIUS.\\n\\n\r\nThere will be more to come, so expect more from me in the following months. AND AS ALWAYS, ANY FEEDBACK WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED.\\n\\n\r\nThis is Team Dai-Squirtle, to the stars and back!\t\\n",

            "content": "Warning: There will be a copious amount of taking my comedy anime seriously\r\nDaily Lives of Highschool Boys is a satire of anime's depiction of highschool life. The entire name and set up is a direct reference to the glut of anime about a bunch of girls doing cute shit in highschool, although it frequently jumps into referencing romance anime or other dude wish fulfilment stuff. From the very direct referencing of K-ON to the highlighting that boys 'are only any use in sports or battle anime', it's constantly lampshading this genre. But what makes it better than most anime's attempts at parody is it's nota 'playful parody'. It's not doing the exact same thing these other anime are doing except pointing to itself occasionally and shouting 'look at me, I'm doing this thing that other anime does, aren't I cool'. It mocks these aspects and satirises them, and through its depiction highlights what makes them ridiculous or dumb.\\n\\n\r\nTake the show's seemingly most popular segment, Literature Girl. The characters start to spout lines about the weather is, except in poetic ways to indicate their feelings at the time. But instead of leaving it at that, which is what many self-serious romance anime do, it provides a running commentary track with the male character constantly berating his own attempts to sound cool, and in turn laughing at the girl's own attempts to fulfil this ideal romantic scene she's seen in romance stories. It's also satirised it from the girl's side too, a character whose own attempts to put herself into these idealistic romantic situations turn her into this raving mad girl whose desperation to fulfil these checklists from her fanfiction only serve to drag her further down in the eyes of the male love interest of her choice.\\n\\n\r\nAnother area of choice Nichibros mocks other anime is the depiction of girls. Instead of cutesy ideal girlfriends, the women in this series are how highschool boys in real life feel girls are like. They're scary monstrous beings, completely incomprehensible, whose only aim is to jam more suffering onto the lives of the boys. The depiction is no less realistic than the hyper cutesy versions of other anime (although many of the women I follow on twitter seemed to find this less-celebratory depiction more realistic), the fact that they go all out with this depiction of girls as universally horrible is a large part of the reason I respect its devotion to satire. This all comes to a head in the Highschool Girls Are Funky segments, which takes a group of girls starting scenarios the exact same way the girls in something like K-ON does, but go in completely different directions due to how horrible they all are. The first segment in particular stands out, for one girl asks what they are going to do today, followed by another girl yelling at her and punching her in the face. Completely fucking ridiculous, but its direct contrast and reference to K-ON and its ilk frames the scene and uses this contrast to highlight how ridiculous the insufferably nice versions of highschool girls are.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so on and so forth, the show satirises so many various aspects of how unrealistic the depictions of highschool life is. Sometimes it's just through placing this scenes in more realistic settings, such as the above literature girl segment, or how the boys try to act out scenes from their favourite RPGs but completely lose the sense of the plot. There's satirising through exaggeration, such as the depiction of girls or the very opening segment where the main character leaves house with a piece of toast in his mouth, followed by his friends eating bowls of ramen. There's a few ones that defy classification, such as the depiction of sisters. They're not desirable love toys. Rather, they're inhuman creatures that you've spent so much time around that you don't even consider them as girls anymore. They're referred to solely as \"X's imouto\" and are never shown to have any eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAgain I could go on, but all I'd be doing is continuing to spoil the various jokes in the anime. What I'm trying to say is that Daily Lives of Highschool Boys is a satire of modern anime's depiction of highschool and how this can warp the expectations of teenagers for how this life is supposed to run. When viewed through this filter, every joke in the series takes on a new light. It's not the actual daily lives of highschool boys. It's the daily lives of highschool boys as viewed through the filter of how anime thinks their lives should go.\\n\\n\r\nOn a personal note, I had pegged this show completely incorrectly pre-season. I probably shouldn't have, what with the director being the same guy who did School Rumble and Gintama. But a season before this we got Kimi to Boku. It was an unusual idea, having cute boys doing cute things rather than girls. But the end result was the exact bloody same. You could have swapped those genders around and got the exact same shit we have been getting for the past few years, except now seen through a more shoujo-y filter. It made me depressed. I love anime because of how it can take totally crazy ideas and animate them to make wonderful stories no other medium would even dare to try approach. Yet we were living in an era where it was becoming commonplace to make non-stories about a bunch of kids doing nothing. The announcement of Daily Lives of Highschool Boys struck fear into my heart because I thought perhaps Kimi to Boku was not just a once off, and that cute girls doing nothing was going to spread into other genres.\\n\\n\r\nSo thank you Daily Dudes. Thank you for not only being that, but satirising the very thing I thought you were going to be.",

            "content": "Story (9/10) - \r\nDaily Lives of High School Boys is a 12 episode series based off a manga by Yasanobu Yamauchi. The series follows the daily lives of high school students, specifically, the comings and goings of the all male student population at Sanda North Boys High. Yup. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t look for anything more earth shattering than that, guys. That\u2019s all you get with Daily Lives; odd boys doing odd things\u2026just like Lucky Star is cute girls doing cute things. This show doesn\u2019t try to rewrite the book on what a high school comedy can be; it just uses a tried and true formulaand rolls with it, using the everyday conversations and situations high school boys face on a day-to-day basis to push things along. However, the thing that makes this show stand out more than other high school comedies, is the fact that the writing seems so unique. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) \u2013 \\n\\n\r\nThe animation style of Daily Lives is much like the show itself; nothing out of the ordinary. Everything is very well done, as is expected of a project tag-teamed by Square Enix and Studio Sunrise. I have to say, I really liked the character designs this time around. Unlike Free! who felt the need to give their male cast these bulging, rippling, \u201cthere\u2019s no way in HELL those can exist on a regular human\u201d mound of muscles, \u201cNichibros\u201d give these characters an awkward gawky look that makes them more endearing to the viewer. One thing that I noticed about this particular show, animation wise, was the fact that the creators made a point not to show ANY male character wearing their uniform correctly\u2013everyone has their shirts un-tucked, some characters leave their ties undone or don\u2019t wear the ties at all. It adds a level of realism to the whole thing\u2013after all, do you HONESTLY expect a group of high school boys to wear the uniform the RIGHT way? I do question why the animators decided to give some of their non-main characters the shadow eye treatment. While it doesn\u2019t really take anything AWAY from the anime, it is a bit distracting.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme this time around is \u201cShiny Tale\u201d by Mix Speakers, Inc. Seriously, I can\u2019t get enough of this song. It\u2019s so upbeat and it actually sounds like the opening theme for an anime that\u2019s centered on high school boys. The Entire Cast of \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\" in the End Credits...Note The Haruhi Cosplayer...The animation it\u2019s played over is awesome and matches extremely well. The closing theme is \u201cOhisama\u201d [\"Sun\"] by Amessaki Annainin. This song\u2026well\u2026it\u2019s weird. Not \u201cbad\u201d weird, don\u2019t get me wrong at all, but it\u2019s weird on a \u201cwhat the heck am I listening to, and why do I like it so much\u201d weird. I can honestly say this is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard a kazoo used as a musical instrument in an anime theme song\u2026and it\u2019s not bad! The animation that plays over the scene is, for all intents and purposes, the funniest ending credit sequence I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026EVER. You can keep the karaoke scenes at the end of Lucky Star, and the \u201cHare Hare Youkai\u201d from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. This ending animation puts all of them to SHAME. The incidental music is just as funny and cool as the action it\u2019s played over, yet it doesn\u2019t dominate the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\u2013 \\n\\n\r\nAs with any story of this nature, it\u2019s the characters that move things along\u2014after all, it\u2019s a slice of life, so the characters that we follow have to be interesting. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nTadakuni:-\\n\\n\r\nThe long suffering straight man of our primary bro-trio. He\u2019s pretty average as compared to his friends Hidenori and Yoshitake, and thus is always exasperated to the point of manic over their antics\u2026though he does have a crazy streak of his own.\\n\\n\r\nHidenori Tabata:-\\n\\n\r\nOur glasses-wearing character of the trio. Remember that old-school Nickelodeon TV show \u201cKenan and Kel\u201d? Well, he\u2019s an animated version of Kenan. He\u2019s this grand over-the-top character who often kicks off the crazy conversations and situations our primary bro-trio gets into.\\n\\n\r\nYoshitake Tanaka:-\\n\\n\r\nThe blond-haired [Dyed\u2026] member of our primary bro-trio. If Hidenori is Kenan, then Yoshitake is Kel. He\u2019s more apt to follow Hidenori\u2019s lead with regards to crazy ideas, leaving Tadakuni to spaz out. In his youth, Yoshitake was known as the masked avenger \u201cRubber Shooter\u201d, helping out those who were being bullied. In fact, though Hidenori doesn\u2019t know it, Yoshitake actually helped him out as \u201cRubber [Band] Shooter\u201d when he was being bullied. Quite commendable\u2026even though he sits in his chair oddly.\\n\\n\r\nMotoharu:-\\n\\n\r\nOur dark skinned student council member. While he looks like he could be a juvenile delinquent, and when we first meet him, he is referred to as such, Motoharu is actually a really nice guy who gets along well with his older sister, even though she tormented him when he was younger, and her friends tend to have their way with him [not in that way you pervs\u2026] at any given time. Motoharu is the Nichibro I relate to more than any of the others because, bless him, he doesn\u2019t know how to ride a bike. Thankfully in his case, as well as mine, he had his bros help him out.\\n\\n\r\nToshiyuki Karasawa:-\\n\\n\r\nAnother student council member. You\u2019ll know him by the ever-persistent cap on his head. He wears the cap to cover over a very distinct scar on his face that was given to him by a girl when he was little. Though he comes off as being very mysterious and aloof, he\u2019s actually capable of being just as goofy as the others.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more characters in this compendium of kooks, like the Student Council President and his Second in Command who never really seem to be in the Council Room, Tadakuni\u2019s Little Sister who is by far one of the cruelest little sister characters in anime [\u2026Oriemo not withstanding, because I'm still trying to figure out what the heck is going on there\u2026], or the group of oddball girls from the \u201cHigh School Girls are Funky\u201d skit. Suffice it to say, they are the perfect compliment to our main cast as listed above.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) -\\n\\n\r\nSo where does that leave us? Daily Lives of High School Boys is about as realistic a look into the lives of teenage boys as you can get currently. It\u2019s not willowy light like Kimi to Boku, nor is it fangirl fodder like\u2026THAT show\u2026it\u2019s just an honest, hilariously funny look at the lives of some very\u2026odd high school boys. With its funny and realistic story, entertaining characters, odd yet functional animation, jamming music, and all-star voice cast, Daily Lives of High School Boys will leave you feeling nostalgic for your high school years\u2026and wondering if you and your friends were really as big of dorks as Tadakuni, HIdenori and Yoshitake. Nine times out of ten\u2026you were.\\n",

            "content": "The opening scene of the first episode is a hilarious and wonderful introduction to this series, but unfortunately Daily Lives of High School Boys goes off the rails shortly after the OP and never returns.\r\nDaily Lives tries to play around with and subvert the tropes, cliches, and stereotypes common to slice-of-life anime (and anime in general), but doesn't always succeed in sending them up properly -- which sometimes seems more like an endorsement of the cliches than a critique thereof. I think this is the core reason why Daily Lives fails, though there are a raft of other problems that further damn this series.\r\nSTORY (4)\r\nTherereally isn't a story, just a collection of skits. The stories of the various skits are each individually well thought out and inventive. The lack of plot progression from one skit isn't necessarily a problem, but when coupled with the lack of character progression it means that nothing progresses, so there's little to engage with or look forward to in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor of the series is centered around social awkwardness. This style of humor just isn't my thing, and so I didn't find very funny most of the jokes and situations in the series. This is a subjective criticism, yes, but on a more objective note, Daily Lives lacks variety in its humor and suffers as a result -- perhaps more for some viewers than others.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (1)\\n\r\nThe characters of Daily Lives are properly fleshed out, enough at least for the show's premise. Unfortunately, they are also unlikeable dicks who lie, cheat, steal, and prey on others. They are absurdly exaggerated caricatures of actual \"high school boys,\" which could have been a source of humor and a send-up of cliches, but they are exaggerated in a negative direction.  They don't just tease their friends, they abuse them. They don't just not know how to talk to girls, they are in fact thoroughly misogynistic. They don't just get into trouble, but they actively try to frame their friends for their own misdeeds. They are not believable, likeable, or compelling. \\n\\n\r\nGiven what terrible people they all are, friendship seems out of place in the Daily Lives universe. I could scarcely imagine any of these detestable cretins having positive emotions towards anyone, but if one considers the possibility of Stockholm syndrome, they can be seen as somewhat believable. The moments in which the viewers are granted psychological insight into the characters' minds are gratifying, if only because it provides reassurance that each are indeed sane and reasonable, because their actions routinely indicate otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe occasional side characters who are actually not evil, insane, malicious dirtbags are usually taken advantage of or injured by those who are, further compounding Daily Lives' enormous problems with characterization and storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nART (8) & SOUND (8)\\n\r\nI appreciated the light, smooth animation style, which fit both the quotidian theme of the show and the flights of fancy the characters are prone to. Sound and voice acting are good also.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (4)\\n\r\nDaily Lives conveys just one thing: High school boys are horrendous people who should be avoided at all costs. There is no coherence among the various skits and no progression in the characters. There is nothing compelling to keep viewers watching, aside from the comedy (if that's your thing). On the other hand, there is certainly plenty repulsive to make viewers think twice about watching.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (2)\\n\r\nDaily Lives is a thoroughly offensive, painfully unfunny, totally disjointed, inexpert, hackneyed, awkward, depressing, detestable, insulting, poorly-conceived excuse for an anime, and  I thoroughly regret having ever watched it.",

            "content": "We are all aware about how first impressions are a very important factor if you\u2019re going to enjoy a show. \r\nMy first impression of Danshi was it was a more annoying version of Kimi to Boku. \r\nThe comedy style seems to be the same as Drifters comedy at times. That immediately turned me off from that show. \r\nWhat also doesn\u2019t help is this is indeed another episodic show that I continue to have issues with. \r\nI was basically checked out by episode 8. I knew what was going on. I knew nothing was going to get better. I didn\u2019t care for the rest of theshow. \\n\r\nThere was a scene in episode 2 where Tibata told to ignore Tanaka. I was wondering if I should just ignore this entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThat is another issue with this show that Tanaka and Tibata are one of the most annoying duo I\u2019ve seen in a long time. \\n\r\nThere were some other male side characters that were watchable. But it is hard to get attached to any when you despise the main characters. \\n\r\nThere were scenes that could have been funny but I didn\u2019t laugh because I was so checked out by then to care. \\n\r\nI could also see they were trying to be snarky with references and taking jab at tropes. That doesn\u2019t tickle my fancy either. \\n\r\nI also am not interesting in seeing sisters continue to beat up on the brothers again and again and again. Not my thing. \\n\\n\r\nI really couldn\u2019t understand the main concept of the show at the end either. \\n\r\nAt least with Non Non Biyori you understand the main concept of it is okay to live in the sticks. \\n\r\nDid they want to get girlfriends? Is it a boy vs. girl competition? Or is it just pure nothingness? \\n\r\nI felt like it was voided of any main focus I could take away from the show. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was something I did appreciate about the show was the role reversal the show did after the completion of the ending song. \\n\r\nIt allowed me to see if it was because it was a group of boys that made it harder for me to care. \\n\r\nWhat I found out is that when it is boys my impression is, well I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with these guys. \\n\r\nBut when it is girls my impression is I wouldn\u2019t want to date these gals. Which ended up being worse. \\n\\n\r\nI do believe there is a fine line between funny and obnoxious faces and Danshi would fall under obnoxious. \\n\r\nI\u2019ll have to hit the art rating hard because that was mainly the only artistically thing I can talk about. \\n\r\nStory? Was there even a story? There was a few recurring segments but no progression in them. It was pretty terrible. \\n\r\nThen characters are terrible. My enjoyment was terrible. \\n\r\nThe show had a good opening song but a below average ending song. \\n\r\nThis show failed to bring any sort of happiness to me unfortunately. \\n",

Is it stressful, exhausting, slave-driving, or even fun in some cases?\r\nIn a time period where almost every anime has some elements of school life or the words \"High School\" involved, it usually puts a damper on the experience as a whole depending on how you look at it before you may have even watched it. (Heck, even after you're dead you go back to high school according to Angel Beats). \r\nSo when you have an anime centering not around the overall experience and tales of friendship that take place in a high school, butthe quirks and antics that are possible in the lives of boys in the depth of their adolescence, what do you get?\\n\r\nWell, insanity. That's the best word to describe Daily Lives of Highschool Boys. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe title basically sums up the story the best than I ever could; it's centered around the humorous events and tales of three best friends, Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake. It's fairly straightforward, and as this is a comedy, there are no deep or thought-provoking themes, nor does it try to take itself seriously. Quite the opposite, in fact, as this series tends to make fun of itself time and time again. They even threw a wrench into the attempt to break out of the slice-of-life genre in the first minutes of the first episode, which I greatly appreciated.\\n\r\nEvery episode is extremely episodic, with the only over-arching theme being that most of these take place in an all-boys school which our protagonists attend.  It's rather obvious that coming from a manga, there are at least 3-4 \"segments\" that the show is split up into its individual chapters. This actually works quite well, as the story doesn't ever feel overwhelming and is laid-back in its nature and presentation. Plus, as each skit is only 2-5 minutes at most, it's easy to stop and take a break at any time without feeling like you're missing anything major, because really, you're not.\\n\r\nAs for the humor itself (since I wouldn't know where else to talk about it), I would have to say that compared to other comedies, is rather crude at times, though there are never scenes where the stories or jokes are too confusing. The simplicity of the jokes themselves add to the show's charm, and the inner monologues varying from person to person just gives it so much style and enjoyment out of it. Sometimes it's completely over-the-top and exaggerated, and other times quite... quietly presented. The only con I would have to say is that though the punch lines are there, it seems pretty anti-climatic at the end of certain scenes, like there was too much build-up and not enough reaction, though that might just be a personal bias from me. \\n\r\nNever is the comedy too girly and there's not a hint of moe to be found, which is really refreshing from your usual run-of-the-mill \"cute girls doing cute funny things in highschool\"; gender reversal is always a pleasure. The humor is crude and presented as such, and it really gives off the feel and realism that this is all coming from teenage boys going through a dumb phase, and it just suits the show and characters perfectly. I wouldn\u2019t want it to be any other way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of DLHSB are, well, exactly what they are: high school boys who fool around, get laughed at, and have no idea what they're doing in general. They give a little bit of realism to the show, but at the same time it's a bit of a downfall because with its incredibly large cast of supporting characters, things feel somewhat crowded at some points trying to remember them all. This mostly applies to the supporting characters who only show up for an episode or less and then disappear, though luckily there are only a few to be found.\\n\r\nI think the best part about the show's reoccurring characters (outside of the main three) is how memorable they are. Even though the show's opening emphasizes the fact that there are a lot, by the end of the twelfth episode you'll be sure to remember who everyone is, which is quite an accomplishment in and of itself. But again, because they're reoccurring and the segments of this show are so short, it may be a natural thing to know who everyone is, even if not by name but rather by what kind of personality and their funniest scene was and the diversity between them is refreshing. \\n\r\nThe main trio has a great dynamic both as best friends and as a comedic group. Hidenori and Yoshitake are the two jokesters, though in different ways than one another, while Tadakuni is the classic \u201conly sane man\u201d out of the three. Despite the fact that some people call Tadakuni boring and not funny at all, his reactions and dialogue towards the events around him are required for a lot of the jokes to be pulled off. Their dynamics and interactions as a trio are some of the most ridiculous and entertaining ones I\u2019ve seen in a while. It\u2019s their conversations and idiotic plans and jokes with the outside cast that is really one of the biggest and most entertaining parts of this show.\\n\r\nSince our cast is so incredibly large, I can\u2019t go into too much detail about them individually, but I will spare mention for the \u201cLiterary Girl\u201d Yassan, who is probably one of the fan-favorites (and mine as well) out of the cast for being a perfect\u2026 well, deconstruction of the classic trope of \u201cquiet mysterious girl by the riverbank\u201d. Extra props go to her merely for her existence, though I have to take a few points off for some unnecessary side characters here and there and not all of them are completely original but still entertaining nonetheless.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMost people\u2019s complaints towards this show usually stem from its animation, since when watchers think to \u201chigh school shenanigans\u201d, they\u2019d think of something comprised from some sort of cutesy moe-style studio, see Kyoto Animation and Xebec due to their previous works. However, I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue here, because if the show were any\u2026 cuter, it would ruin the blunt edge that this show has as a show about /boys/ and just throw the entire thing off and look incredibly misleading. The style and the way things are drawn matches the tone and characters of the anime perfectly, and though there isn\u2019t any particular part in the show\u2019s runtime that I could point out as looking absolutely gorgeous, it doesn\u2019t need to be.\\n\r\nAs for the animation itself, it\u2019s nothing amazing and is rather standard compared to other anime today. Others may call it lackluster, but it sincerely and dutifully does everything it\u2019s supposed to do and I never found anything to be completely impassable. Remember, this is a comedy anime. Unlike Nichijou (which happens to be the most common comparison to this show), DLHSB doesn\u2019t have any amazing KyoAni-standard animation to flaunt whenever they happen to have it on hand. Naturally, I would always appreciate more of a visual feast when I can catch one, and it\u2019s always a bonus, but I would be one to say that the style of animation chosen for this show isn\u2019t really /required/ for the jokes to be played out properly. So for what it is, it\u2019s just fine and I would rather prefer they keep this memorable style they have of drawing characters because it sets it apart to other comedies I know of. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAhhh, god, the sound. I\u2019ve been waiting to review this aspect since the very first episode, but let\u2019s start with the obvious. \\n\r\nThe music was done by the lovely person over at Audio Highs, mainly known for their previous work on the well-known and well-liked Gintama series. However, I can\u2019t make a steady comparison as I\u2019ve yet to listen to anything outside of that particular show. The OST doesn\u2019t exactly have too many memorable tracks on it, or anything that I would be inclined to pick up and listen to outside of the show. But, same as the animation, it does its job and is great as accompaniment to the series, but not as a stand-alone track that I would want to put on repeat fifty times for an hour. You will probably remember a few of the lazier tracks that are played multiple times, but never did I find there to be too little music or a certain song that I loved to pieces. The OP and ED are incredibly catchy and more or less will get stuck in your head for hours after you finish the show, so if you catch me humming the opening at any given point, you have full rights to slap me upside the head.\\n\r\nGood god. The voice acting. Where do I even begin with the voice acting. Well, to start off with, again, the obvious: this is a comedy. The voices are required to be big, bombastic, ridiculous, and overdramatic regardless of the scene.\\n\r\nAnd in that very important aesthetic, Daily Lives of High School Boys delivers. Oh, so, well, might I add.\\n\r\nMost of the time the lines and jokes themselves aren\u2019t necessarily what makes the scenes funny; though it may apply to most shows out there, the way they are delivered and reacted to /REALLY/ picks up the slack where animation and dialogue don\u2019t to make the scenes hilarious. Miyu Irino and Suzumura Kenichi do amazing jobs as their respective roles of Tadakuni and Yoshitake, especially given the fact that the two haven\u2019t done too much in terms of comedy shows. \\n\r\nBut then there\u2019s Hidenori, who was oh-so-BEAUTIFULLY voiced by the comedy god; none other than Sugita Tomokazu himself. Maybe this just comes from my personal bias and opinion, but his obvious famous role as Sakata Gintoki really prepped him up wonderfully to deliver some of the most enjoyable and laughable lines in the entire show. Just listening to him say anything as Hidenori made me want to cry with laughter simply because of how well they were delivered. I have to say that out of the entire cast for this show, Sugita Tomokazu is definitely the shining star of any and all of the actors, despite there being, well, a lot of them. Even though the OST isn\u2019t anything remarkable the sound score is automatically pushed up to a nine just because of the stellar voice acting.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Final Verdict: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe key point to enjoying this show (and many others that exist) is to not take it seriously, which isn\u2019t too hard in this case. It\u2019s not an anime I would recommend to absolutely everyone, since I know comedy isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea and neither are episodic series. However, it really doesn\u2019t take much to have fun watching this, since chances are you will laugh at least once unless this type of anime really doesn\u2019t stand out to you. Sure, it\u2019s not perfect, since nothing ever is, but as a comedy that is meant purely for entertainment value, it\u2019s a light-hearted, episodic show that will do you just fine as far as shows like Nichijou go. \\n\r\nIts major shining points are its character interactions and the presentation of the jokes, all of which is held strongly together with amazing voice acting and over-the-top characters that are a delight to view on screen. The animation and music is simplistic but does their jobs well enough for there to be nothing cringe-worthy to be found. The only downfalls that I can personally find is the lack of detail put into farther-placed frames and character designs, plus a few unnecessary side characters (usually who are females), but it doesn\u2019t take away too much from DLHSB in general. But the main reason why I would tell anyone to watch this is because of its take on the high school slice-of-life genre and its incredibly amusing gender reversal, because this thing really does not give two shits about dainty girls and the classic stereotypes in the way it presents itself. \\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a casual, not-to-be-taken-seriously-or-thought-about comedy with amusing characters, outstanding voice acting, and a few deconstructions of moe and the usual tropes of high school based anime, or even if you\u2019re just looking for a few laughs, Daily Lives of Highschool Boys certainly does not fail to deliver, and I personally had tons of fun watching it, and I hope you do too. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThis is an anime about normal everyday life! Mobile suits and tales of adventure don\u2019t come into it!\u201d\\n",

Look at the first few episodes and see if the comedy clicks with you.\r\nComedy:\r\nDaily Lives of Highschool Boys is first and foremost a comedy series.    There isn\u2019t a lot of time spent on character development or any overarching plot.   Like Azumanga or other4koma-based shows, it\u2019s broken up into shorter skits which keep things fresh.  Even if one skit is unfunny to you, the next might be good.   It parodies anime clich\u00e9s and also elements from a real teenagers life. While I\u2019ve seen a lot of comedies flounder when it comes to that culture barrier, this one I think honestly has minimal problems (either that or I've been watching too much anime).   I think the comedy comes off as a cross between Gintama and Azumanga.\\n\\n\r\nOur cast:\\n\r\nThe [male] characters don\u2019t have extreme or wacky personalities, and as such the characters end up feeling pretty \u201creal\u201d even if they are doing and saying really absurd things.    The girl characters are generally given extreme personalities, and as such felt really fake.  I know some people say this is intentional and \u201chigh school boys really see high school girls as terrifying and out to get them\u201d but eh.  I\u2019m not so sure.  Elementary boys, sure, but in my experience teenagers are quite the opposite (wink wink).    It fell flat for me, is what I am trying to say.   Come to think of it, I\u2019ve never seen a slice of life comedy which can portray genuine humor with both genders, so there you go.      As a satire of how girls are often depicted in anime it might work slightly better, but I still thought the Highschool Girls are Funky skits were the least enjoyable parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat ED:\\n\r\nI\u2019d recommend looking up the ending sequence.  It is too much fun and I sat through it every time.   \\n",

            "content": "This anime is obviously about High School Boys and their daily lives, or should I say, the highlights of their daily lives? \r\nIt's a really good anime with lots of weird and awkward moments, which will make you smile and laugh.\r\nStory: 7 of 10\r\nThere is no exact plot in this anime, but only short story arcs in each episode. Each arc contains some of the characters, either in their High School Building, by the riverbank, or in Tadakuni's house, convenience store etc. Each arc is quite short but funny, albeit the endings aren't that good. Each arc may just end as if they're on squareone again, leading to nothing at all. Most of the times, you won't be able to see what actually happens. One character hits another but then, the ending is just with a picture of what happened, with the person in the pictures voice saying \"Daily Lives of High School boys\", in weird voices. I think that they have chosen to do it like that to simplify things by not having to animate more scenes for each arc. I think that the stories need some development, some of them do get a bit tiring. I personally still like it though, because it shows just the daily mundande activites of teenagers. After the ending of each episode, you'll get a glimpse of daily lives of \"Funky High School Girls\". But the daily life isn't always funfilled. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very simple, the character designs are similar to each other, there are nearly no wardrobe change (they all have their school unforms on). This is a bit disappointing, but it's understandable because it's often about their lives as High School Boys/Girls. The colour leans toward pastel colours, making it look like a shoujo anime. But that didn't put me off, I personally love it! Too bright colours wouldn't have made it into a slice of life anime. The movements of the characters are a bit akward, though it's nothing to worry about! \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 of 10\\n\r\nI didn't like the opening song nor the ending song, they weren't that catchy either. They were quite average and sounds like typical anime songs (pop song). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs weren't that good, but I really liked all the characters. Each of them had their quirks; Tadakuni, the \"too\" normal guy, Hidenori, the glasses guy who looks really boring but is one of those who will make you laugh. His voice actor is really good! And then we have an anime character who looks like a middle aged man, but is actually 17 year old. All of them are one or another very considerate of others feelings, especially girls. They sometimes try to not point out things, for example when getting the wrong amount of change and not saying anything because they don't want the cashier to get into trouble. They do small kind deeds that actually makes you like them. They aren't stereotypically dirtyminded, though panties are something that pops up here and there xD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those rare animes where you can't help but enjoy every scene, every character and their weird but somehow cute behaviours. They make you laugh, and also, makes you cherish your everyday life. Some parts may be a bit boring, but, in the end, you always get a funfilled ride in every episode. Though none of the endings left me satisifed: This anime is addictive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 of 10\\n\r\nBottomline: A feel good anime, with lots of laughters and not so daily blunders and moments!\\n\\n",

But I'm sorry I'm gonna be that immature person for this once.\r\nOkay so this anime is apparently considered as the must-watch comedy anime. After reading a few reviews and getting recommended to watch this, I gave it a try. My lord, this shit is unbearable to watch. Never have I in my life cringed this much while watching anime. I kept waiting for the apparently godlikejokes only to realise that the insanely cringy moments are THE jokes. I seriously can't imagine how a grown-up would find the jokes funny or even the anime enjoyable to watch. Because the 'story' of this anime is as boring as it sounds: the daily lives of highschool boys. Yeah, that's it. I don't need to have a dramatic, action-packed, supernatural, romantic storyline. But really, make it at least enjoyable to watch in some way. I have seen other animes with almost no storyline which are much more entertaining than this one.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't even mentioned the art and characters which are truly horrible. Wtf   is this animation style. Most girls don't have eyes and all the characters look the same. They have the same like 3 hairstyles but one is blonde and the other brunette... Yeah such a diversity hooray! I understand that you don't need Ufotable level animation for a comedy-parody anime, but at least make it seem like you tried. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the characters are just as horrible as the art. Even for a parody anime they were so boring to see. The females were absolutely the worst. They were just really annoying, dumb, abusive no-eyed gorillas disguised as highschool girls. The sister-characters kept fighting with their younger/older brother for no fucking reason. But hey, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is a comedy anime so this is supposed to be funny :) Well it isn't, the characters are too much even for a comedy serie. This anime is just trying too hard to be funny but fails miserably.\\n\\n\r\nSound/music wise it's okay I guess. Nothing special just pretty much the standard. \\n\\n\r\nI don't get why people praise this anime so much as I can't imagine anyone else than little kids enjoying this shit. Jesus, I need to cleanse my eyes with Hinamatsuri.\\n",

I thought something like DKN would have bad humor, recurring boring situations, and overall nothing all too fancy for enjoyment. I was wrong.\r\nThe comedy and satire is excellent, the characters have great, well, character in them, all in all being very different which adds to the enjoyment and interactions between any particular character combination were very well-written and professionally acted. Again, Idon't know much about what a good anime is, but this is my personal review and damn I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very neat, as to be expected from a newer anime (such as FMA:Brotherhood which had a similar neatness imo), and matches the style of the show. Like I said earlier, the voice acting is superbly done, and paired with the typical exaggerated facial expressions it made my past few days very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI do not think that 10/10 would be overdoing it, I seriously found no flaws for me. Some jokes are of course predictable, but I wouldn't really think rating it less cause of that is justifiable.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I recommend this. I'm a 21y/o guy with what seemed to be zero interest in themes like high school, yet I am here rating this as an excellent anime. Have fun.",

            "content": "Ah, slice-of-life. If you are not one to enjoy putting yourself into the character's shoes... well you should at least give it a try for this anime. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is quite different from other comedy anime because rather than having a continuous plot, it has various skits. I am not exaggerating when I say this is my all-time favorite comedy anime (I have not watched Gintama yet so maybe my opinion will change).\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nAlthough there is no real constant plot, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou does not fail to implement various, entertaining scenarios. Each skit is not too short and most importantly catches myinterest. Laughing at a bunch of mischievous boys doing the most uncanny things, what else do you want from an anime with this title!? Also, each skit contributes to future skits in later episodes which is probably the only connection between the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI have to admit, at first the art was not extremely appealing to me - the background is usually quite bland, colors don't stand out, and character designs were typical, and some minor characters (mostly females) didn't even have faces drawn. However, after delving deeper into the show, I found that each character was uniquely drawn. By the end of the anime, you may be referring to the characters by \"that guy with that hat\" or the \"dark-skinned blond guy\"! Another great thing which I loved about the art was the FACIAL EXPRESSION. My god, the overemphasis of their reactions are priceless and send me to a hysterical trance every. single. time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound is just average. They don't really stand out but on some occasions, the background music does bring laughter. This is because certain skits have a specific soundtrack and whenever the music pops up again and that skit made you laugh before, you'll have a smile on your face and nothing has even happened yet!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nAll of the characters are funny. Although some of the them may have stereotypical \"comedy character\" personalities, traits, etc., the other various characters balance it out. Most of the characters are males; however, near the end of some episodes there will be a short skit involving female characters who do contribute to the main story. Some of them are annoying, especially the voices, but that does't detract the laughter. If you are looking for dynamic characters then this anime may not be for you. I did not see any dramatic changes in the characters so if you were looking for a character you could relate to who becomes a better version of himself, eh... sorry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI can certainly say I enjoyed this anime. I looked forward to it whenever a new episode came out. It was so enjoyable I had to write a review for it years later! Although comedy anime is usually a love or hate, I don't think it's even possible to hate this anime unless you don't like skits and prefer an actual plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite not having a perfect score on any criteria except enjoyment, I gave this anime a whooping 10/10. Why? I enjoyed it. I enjoyed every single second I spent watching this show instead of doing homework or getting outside to get some sunlight. I re-watched it a second time when I introduced it to my friends for goodness' sake! If by the end of this review this anime still doesn't intrigue you, eh... what can I do? I'm just saying you're going to be missing out! If you watched the first episode and still aren't hooked, I guess it's just not for you. Comedy is subjective and I guess you'll find better laughter in some other anime.",

Playing off the all-too-common \u201cschoolgirls and everyday life\u201d genre, DKN is far more than the mere gender reversal it may first appear to be.\r\nHaving an all-male cast, ignoring the \u201cmoe\u201d factor really works in the show's favor. There is likewise no unnecessaryfan service\u2014the show places jokes first and foremost, and that lends itself well to the short skit-like structure of the various comedy bits. Alternately dry and outrageous, DKN's jokes never fail to solicit a laugh. They are helped along commendably by the flamboyant facial expressions and varying vocal tones for which anime is so well-loved.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to universally recommend a comedy show as the genre draws on what is often rather personal taste. The best parallel I can make to its off-the-wall humor is the type found in many 4-koma and parody manga strips. If you enjoy the aforementioned, you will find yourself at home with DKN.\\n\\n\r\nOf note is the parodic vein of common anime situations, characters, feelings, and stereotypes DKN contains. I don't want to give too much away, but the \u201cmeta\u201d humor it features is a real high point.\\n\\n\r\nEven with its nearly pure comedy focus, DKN manages to achieve the \u201crefreshing\u201d vibe that so many slice-of-life works go for. The author's keen understanding of high school boys' mentality\u2014their zeitgeist, if you'll humor my ten-dollar vocabulary\u2014really shines through in the show's less zany moments, and those of gut-busting hilarity alike. As a male viewer, abundantly flowing were my (figurative) single-cheek tears of laughter and nostalgia at the familiar antics and feeling of young friendship illustrated in this masterwork. \\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention must be made of the insanely clever Literature Girl segments, easily the show's standout and my favorite comedy bits of any show in recent memory. Also to Sugita Tomokazu, the well-loved Kyon, for his excellent portrayal of Hidenori in said skit and across the show at large.\\n\\n\r\nThrough and through, an outstanding show. If you can connect with its brand of comedy, the humor and heart within will stick with you for some time to come.",

            "content": "\"Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.\" F. Scott Fitzgerald. \r\nOh youth and the epic journey called growing up. Most people tend to, in a way or another, be deeply defined by their teenage years. High school is a fond memory to some and a painful one to others, but I think everyone can agree that it is a unique and special period of our lives, one that has no equal. Most people quickly relate the words High School with friendship, as the friends you make in that period of time seem to leave a permanent mark in your memories and sodoes the time you spend with them, most of which is filled talking about something random or even stupid, laughing at simple and normal things, sharing mutual interests and hobbies, talking about the opposite gender in a playful or perverted way and worrying about the weirdest things. Yes, those years you spend in High School are special in a simple and silly way and it is that way that Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (DKN) tries and successfully manages to recreate in a hilarious manner.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] - 8 - Daily Lives of High School Boys. That's basically it. It is a standard slice of life type of story, but one that works amazingly well. The episodes are divided into segments and focus on a big number of characters, each of them with his own peculiarities, as he endures daily tasks. To portray something so simple in an amusing way is not easy at all and I think most animes that actually try this end up filled up with dull boring moments that just kill the mood. DKN avoids that in almost every single scene which is quite amazing and even in its worse episode you'll still laugh out loud quite some times. Most segments are short which gives the comedic tone light, random and fast paced giving it a tremendous enjoyability. To sum things up, it isn't an amazing and complex storyline since it is a slice of life, but the setting and the execution of the comedy match and fit each other so well that you just can't care about how simple the story is.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] - 8 - Not much to point out here. The art was acceptably good. It didn't need to be better anyway. The character design was adequate with  a pretty good worn on some characters' expressions. \\n\r\nThe animation was good enough for it. It didn't particularly shine, but I never felt like it needed to be better, so I guess they did a good job with it.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] - 9 - Alright, so I had to give the 9 here for two specific reasons. First of all the soundtrack was very fitting and comedic. The Literature Girl Song cracked me up every single time, it was absolutely perfect for those moments and just hearing the song alone will make you laugh so that's a great job there. Then the second reason lies in the voice actors. Since I'm not an experiences anime reviewer I wasn't sure about where I should talk about this, so I'm just including it within the sound for obvious reasons. Yeah I have to admit I'm a Gintama Fan, so having Sugita (probably my favorite voice actor) and Suzumura playing two of the main characters made the anime that much better. Sugita's voice fit Hidenori too well and his natural ability of making everything he says funny was perfect here. Other than them I also have to positively mention other very fitting voices like Motoharu's (Daisuke Namikawa), Ringo's (Aoi Yuuki) and Yanagi's (Yuu Kobayashi). Indeed a great selection of voice actors.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters] - 9 - Probably one of its strongest points, since most times the punchlines rely completely on the characters as the humor is very character-driven on most scenes. Something very good about this series is the fact that the main character doesn't monopolize every scene, in fact it's just the opposite - he doesn't even show up in two or three episodes at all. The secondary characters are hilarious, each of them playing right into a character stereotype but adding a sort of twist to it. Motoharu, the delinquent who's supposedly badass and mature, but still get's manipulated by older girls and is strangely deep and introspective, also having an above the average sensitivity and fragile spirit. Literature Girl, the mysterious silent girl who stands by the riverside staring into the horizon lost in thought, but she's actually just a naive wannabe novel author looking for an ideal encounter with a guy by the riverside. Among many others.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] - 9.5 - Maybe I'm exaggerating here but I feel that the 10 is appropriate. Most episodes went by extremely fast and I laughed like a mad man at most scenes from beginning to end. If a comedy that achieves that doesn't deserve the 10 in enjoyment then few animes do. I really enjoyed this very much and agree with people that relate its sense of humor to Gintama and Nichijou - which I also liked quite a lot. It really surprised me, since I didn't watch any trailers. I just saw a new anime called Daily Lives of High School Boys and thought \"well I have 20 minutes free so why not? It'll probably be filled with female-targetted fanservice though...\". Then the first episode blew me away. It's actually very easy to tell if you'll like this series or not - just watch the first episode. If you dislike the first episode you don't need to see more as you most likely won't like it at all.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] - 9 - Overall a solid comedy anime that any comedy fan should check out. Get some friends together one afternoon and watch a couple of episodes, it'll probably feel even better!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you decide to give it a shot and thank you for reading!",

            "content": "What is the first thing pop up in your head when you hear a high-school-slice-of life-comedy anime? Boring, if you ask me. I used to think that a pure comedy show revolving around high school students life is so common and dull, my perception changed after I watched Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, I will refer it as Nichibro from this point. The title may give you a doubt, I wouldn't be surprised if you're skeptical, what's so great about watching a comedy anime revolving around highschoolers' everyday life? I'd say Nichibro stands out because it succeed in delivering what it offers, that is comedy.\r\nThe titleof this anime literally describes what this show is all about; the daily lives of high school boys. No it's not about cute boys do cute things, but it's about a group of school boys do what they do best, such as slacking off in a friend's house, pranking on people, talking about girls, telling random stories and any other things in exaggeration manners. Nichibro is a gag based anime much like Nichijou-- its girls counterpart. The format is also similar; every episode of this series is composed of several random short skits which usually are not connected to each other. Each skit focuses on a slapstick humor with a punchline at the end. I personally found most of them hit the mark while others are predictable. It's like getting a present on a Christmas morning; sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you are unsure and sometimes it's an ugly sweater. In other words, some people may find one or two skits boring and unfunny, and some other may not. After all, I believe comedy is very subjective, you can't really argue what's funny or not, it's a matter of taste-- what's funny to one person will not always to another.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, Nichibro is quite decent but it's not amazing either. Although the background is simple but it's pretty detailed especially the buildings which is fine for this kind of show. The characters are well drawn and they look natural, like how the male characters aren't wearing their uniform properly. That's how the high school boys dressed. They leave their ties undone, some characters even don't bother to wear ties at all, their shirt are un-tucked, even Karasawa is wearing a hat all the time. The funny expressions or the faces they make is enough to make me burst out in laughter. The characters are also well animated, I notice some characters look alive and vibrant. There is one thing I'm complaining about its design, they (the studio) probably decided to cut corners by drawing some characters with no eyes or it was simply lazy, I have no idea. Still, one can say it's on purpose to show which ones are the main characters. Overall it doesn't ruin the show thou.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point of this show is the characters. First of all, Nichibro doesn't have much character development. I believe character development isn't always necessary especially in a pure comedy show like this one, as long as they are there to make you laugh, that will do. Now let's check out our main characters, the first is Tadakuni, he is the straight man in the group and probably the most ordinary among the trio, but surprisingly, he's someone you can easy relate to. He's usually needed to pull off the jokes. Hidenori, he's the one who usually comes up with crazy schemes. The last is my favourite, Yoshitake, the blond guy. He usually plays along when Hidenori comes up with anything stupid. Their exaggerated attitudes, expressions and randomness are really amusing to watch. In the midst of the series, in fact, they don't \"eat\" all the screen time. In other words, if one is too \"normal\" being a student, he won't have much screen time. This when the supporting characters rise. I find the supporting roles are very interesting as well, complete with their own unique personalities. One thing I mind is how violence the girls are to the boys. In my opinion, it's a bit overusing for a slapstick joke anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say much about the sound. The opening song is rather typical but I find the ending sequence is really something. They put a skit on the ending which is very interesting. The upbeat and catchy music while the casts are performing a play in cultural festival is hilarious. The randomness on it is epic. I have no complaints for the voice acting. The voice actors fits the characters, especially Hidenori who's voiced by Sugita (he also has done voice for Gintoki). The way when he talks to himself or when he's overthinking something really makes me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal note; Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is a solid comedy show. If you're looking for good laughs, I'd like to suggest you to give it a shot. In my experience, in every episode I've watched I always find at least one or two skits that are funny and memorable. Moreover, I'm sure you can somehow relate them to your highschool life, although it won't be as extreme and funny as in this series. This is the first time I've watched an anime that is divided into several skits each episode and I like it. I would gladly recommend this to everyone. Overall, This show is thoroughly entertaining and worthy my time.",

            "content": "\u201cI suppose if we couldn't laugh at the things that don't make sense, we couldn't react to a lot of life.\u201d \u2013 Hobbes, from Calvin and Hobbes.\r\nAs a stressed out college student, I constantly find myself looking back at my high school years and remembering the fun old times. My all boys school meant that we could rein in free chaos without the worry of having to act proper around girls, so my class and I did all sorts of pranks and whatnot. From playing football in the hallway, to accidentally taking down a security camera, to taking down the school flag and wearing itas a cape, lighting up fireworks in class, all those things. Truth be told, high school was boring, but my classmates made it so much fun during our free time. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is about.\\n\\n\r\nA comedy anime like no other, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (or Daily Life of High School Boys if you prefer) had me laughing just as much (and probably more) as any comedic work out there. I found myself wiping tears from my eyes constantly and enjoying every single second of it. At twelve episodes in length, Danshi Koukousei promises that you will enjoy every single moment.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, Danshi Koukousei has no overarching story. There is no typical high school plot in here as you would imagine from most generic slice of life animes. In fact, the show is presented in what most people would refer to as a \u2018skit\u2019 format. An episode of the anime will generally contain in average eight skits, each of them representing wildly different aspects of the free time that high school boys face on a day to day basis and what they do to liven up their boring lives.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, most of these are exaggerated at some points, but there isn\u2019t anything wrong with that. In fact, it adds more to the realism of the show and how high school boys tend to exaggerate normal situations in their mind. Add that to the fact this anime is a HUGE parody of anime as a whole, taking in various anime tropes and destroying them before your very eyes. Oh you were expecting this to happen? Well haha, FUCK YOU PREDICTABILITY!\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of characters, there is no better way to describe the main cast as extremely human. Each character has his own little quirk that makes him instantly relatable to someone. I found myself constantly laughing and thinking along the lines of: \u201cOh my God that is so my friend from senior year!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast is comprised of the trio of destiny: Tadakuni (whose last name is never revealed and in fact parodied by the show itself), Hidenori, and Yoshitake. Tadakuni is your straight man, the guy who is dragged into the crazy and manic antics that his two best friends get themselves in to. Hidenori is the bespectacled one, the playboy of the group and generally the inner monologue heavy guy who analyzes situations over and over again in a very comedic fashion. And finally, we have Yoshitake, the blonde dyed member of the group who is usually the idiot and goes along with whatever the situation around him dictates. \\n\\n\r\nAside from those three, the anime introduces many many characters throughout the course of its run, giving us a well varied and excellently written cast. However, due to the sheer amount of characters, it\u2019s kind of hard to remember the names of all of them. But, this is beautifully averted when the anime itself tells you that, while it knows its introducing many characters late into the show, it\u2019s not important to remember all their names. \\n\\n\r\nIt is also important to acknowledge the main female characters from this extensive male cast. At the end of every episode, there is an extra skit titled \u201cHigh School Girls Are Funky!\u201d which features three girls (Yanagi, Habara and Ikushima) who are basically the female counterparts of the main trio. While their skits are not as funny as the male ones, they are still the parts of the series where backstory is heavy handed and offers some insight into the past of some of the characters which, at least in my book, is a step in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of animation, the studio responsible for animating this is Sunrise Inc., famous for shows such as The Visions of Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, Tiger and Bunny, among others. In itself, the animation is very simplistic and it actually works in favor of the show\u2019s theme. Add that to the fact that most of the characters sport some weirdly exaggerated faces to go along with some of the jokes makes said jokes all the better. A curious thing to note about the animation is the decision to shadow the eyes of the majority of the small female cast. This, I found out much later, was surprisingly parodied by the show as well in one of the later skits. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast does a beautiful job with the characters as well. Most of the voices are blown out of proportion for some of the jokes, which makes the delivery of them all the better. You might find some of the voices rather familiar, particularly with Hidenori\u2019s seiyuu Tomokazu Sugita, famous for lending his voice to Gintama, another comedy anime. Miyu Irino is present here as the voice of Tadakuni, showcasing his amazing talent, and Kenichi Suzumaru is here as well, giving his voice to the bumbling idiot that is Yoshitake. Add to those three Daisuke Namikawa as the voice of everyone\u2019s favorite delinquent Motoharu, and you have one of the best voiced casts in recent anime history (at least that\u2019s how I see it).\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, the music is also very well executed. Audio Highs, known for their previous work in Bakuman and Gintama, are responsible for the masterfully well-crafted music that is present in this show. The anime sports one opening and one ending, with the opening being \u201cShiny tale\u201d by Mix Speakers, Inc. while the ending theme is \u201cO-hi-sama\u201d by Amesaki Annainin. Both are very good, with the first one really pumping you up for a high school anime while the ending is\u2026 well, stupid. It simply fits with the whole theme of the show in its own, unique, way.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve covered everything there is, it\u2019s time to go down to the final verdict.\\n\\n\r\nThis show means a lot to me. Not just because it made me laugh, but because some of the skits that the show has are actually situations that occurred to me during my daily life while in high school. The days I spent laughing with my friends, worrying about a friend\u2019s little sister (well, actually it was his cousin) and whatnot really brought me memories that had long passed. It made me look back in life and smile at how beautiful everything was with my old friends and how much I miss them. It\u2019s an anime I hold very near and dear to my heart simply because of the feelings it evoked in me while watching it and, truth be told, for being the funniest anime I have seen in my entire life.\\n\\n\r\nDanshi Koukousei no Nichijou gets a very well deserved 9/10. It would be a 10, but the short length left me wanting for more. But, just like everything else, even the short length is parodied by the show. Aside from that, a couple of jokes fell flat on their faces, but this didn\u2019t detract from my overall enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMuch thanks to Mel, for proofreading this (I love you my little internet daughter), Erika, for providing her helpful insight, and my good friend Wendy, who should write some reviews of her own because she is a FREAKING GENIUS.\\n\\n\r\nThere will be more to come, so expect more from me in the following months. AND AS ALWAYS, ANY FEEDBACK WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED.\\n\\n\r\nThis is Team Dai-Squirtle, to the stars and back!\t\\n",

            "content": "Warning: There will be a copious amount of taking my comedy anime seriously\r\nDaily Lives of Highschool Boys is a satire of anime's depiction of highschool life. The entire name and set up is a direct reference to the glut of anime about a bunch of girls doing cute shit in highschool, although it frequently jumps into referencing romance anime or other dude wish fulfilment stuff. From the very direct referencing of K-ON to the highlighting that boys 'are only any use in sports or battle anime', it's constantly lampshading this genre. But what makes it better than most anime's attempts at parody is it's nota 'playful parody'. It's not doing the exact same thing these other anime are doing except pointing to itself occasionally and shouting 'look at me, I'm doing this thing that other anime does, aren't I cool'. It mocks these aspects and satirises them, and through its depiction highlights what makes them ridiculous or dumb.\\n\\n\r\nTake the show's seemingly most popular segment, Literature Girl. The characters start to spout lines about the weather is, except in poetic ways to indicate their feelings at the time. But instead of leaving it at that, which is what many self-serious romance anime do, it provides a running commentary track with the male character constantly berating his own attempts to sound cool, and in turn laughing at the girl's own attempts to fulfil this ideal romantic scene she's seen in romance stories. It's also satirised it from the girl's side too, a character whose own attempts to put herself into these idealistic romantic situations turn her into this raving mad girl whose desperation to fulfil these checklists from her fanfiction only serve to drag her further down in the eyes of the male love interest of her choice.\\n\\n\r\nAnother area of choice Nichibros mocks other anime is the depiction of girls. Instead of cutesy ideal girlfriends, the women in this series are how highschool boys in real life feel girls are like. They're scary monstrous beings, completely incomprehensible, whose only aim is to jam more suffering onto the lives of the boys. The depiction is no less realistic than the hyper cutesy versions of other anime (although many of the women I follow on twitter seemed to find this less-celebratory depiction more realistic), the fact that they go all out with this depiction of girls as universally horrible is a large part of the reason I respect its devotion to satire. This all comes to a head in the Highschool Girls Are Funky segments, which takes a group of girls starting scenarios the exact same way the girls in something like K-ON does, but go in completely different directions due to how horrible they all are. The first segment in particular stands out, for one girl asks what they are going to do today, followed by another girl yelling at her and punching her in the face. Completely fucking ridiculous, but its direct contrast and reference to K-ON and its ilk frames the scene and uses this contrast to highlight how ridiculous the insufferably nice versions of highschool girls are.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so on and so forth, the show satirises so many various aspects of how unrealistic the depictions of highschool life is. Sometimes it's just through placing this scenes in more realistic settings, such as the above literature girl segment, or how the boys try to act out scenes from their favourite RPGs but completely lose the sense of the plot. There's satirising through exaggeration, such as the depiction of girls or the very opening segment where the main character leaves house with a piece of toast in his mouth, followed by his friends eating bowls of ramen. There's a few ones that defy classification, such as the depiction of sisters. They're not desirable love toys. Rather, they're inhuman creatures that you've spent so much time around that you don't even consider them as girls anymore. They're referred to solely as \"X's imouto\" and are never shown to have any eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAgain I could go on, but all I'd be doing is continuing to spoil the various jokes in the anime. What I'm trying to say is that Daily Lives of Highschool Boys is a satire of modern anime's depiction of highschool and how this can warp the expectations of teenagers for how this life is supposed to run. When viewed through this filter, every joke in the series takes on a new light. It's not the actual daily lives of highschool boys. It's the daily lives of highschool boys as viewed through the filter of how anime thinks their lives should go.\\n\\n\r\nOn a personal note, I had pegged this show completely incorrectly pre-season. I probably shouldn't have, what with the director being the same guy who did School Rumble and Gintama. But a season before this we got Kimi to Boku. It was an unusual idea, having cute boys doing cute things rather than girls. But the end result was the exact bloody same. You could have swapped those genders around and got the exact same shit we have been getting for the past few years, except now seen through a more shoujo-y filter. It made me depressed. I love anime because of how it can take totally crazy ideas and animate them to make wonderful stories no other medium would even dare to try approach. Yet we were living in an era where it was becoming commonplace to make non-stories about a bunch of kids doing nothing. The announcement of Daily Lives of Highschool Boys struck fear into my heart because I thought perhaps Kimi to Boku was not just a once off, and that cute girls doing nothing was going to spread into other genres.\\n\\n\r\nSo thank you Daily Dudes. Thank you for not only being that, but satirising the very thing I thought you were going to be.",

            "content": "Story (9/10) - \r\nDaily Lives of High School Boys is a 12 episode series based off a manga by Yasanobu Yamauchi. The series follows the daily lives of high school students, specifically, the comings and goings of the all male student population at Sanda North Boys High. Yup. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t look for anything more earth shattering than that, guys. That\u2019s all you get with Daily Lives; odd boys doing odd things\u2026just like Lucky Star is cute girls doing cute things. This show doesn\u2019t try to rewrite the book on what a high school comedy can be; it just uses a tried and true formulaand rolls with it, using the everyday conversations and situations high school boys face on a day-to-day basis to push things along. However, the thing that makes this show stand out more than other high school comedies, is the fact that the writing seems so unique. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) \u2013 \\n\\n\r\nThe animation style of Daily Lives is much like the show itself; nothing out of the ordinary. Everything is very well done, as is expected of a project tag-teamed by Square Enix and Studio Sunrise. I have to say, I really liked the character designs this time around. Unlike Free! who felt the need to give their male cast these bulging, rippling, \u201cthere\u2019s no way in HELL those can exist on a regular human\u201d mound of muscles, \u201cNichibros\u201d give these characters an awkward gawky look that makes them more endearing to the viewer. One thing that I noticed about this particular show, animation wise, was the fact that the creators made a point not to show ANY male character wearing their uniform correctly\u2013everyone has their shirts un-tucked, some characters leave their ties undone or don\u2019t wear the ties at all. It adds a level of realism to the whole thing\u2013after all, do you HONESTLY expect a group of high school boys to wear the uniform the RIGHT way? I do question why the animators decided to give some of their non-main characters the shadow eye treatment. While it doesn\u2019t really take anything AWAY from the anime, it is a bit distracting.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme this time around is \u201cShiny Tale\u201d by Mix Speakers, Inc. Seriously, I can\u2019t get enough of this song. It\u2019s so upbeat and it actually sounds like the opening theme for an anime that\u2019s centered on high school boys. The Entire Cast of \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\" in the End Credits...Note The Haruhi Cosplayer...The animation it\u2019s played over is awesome and matches extremely well. The closing theme is \u201cOhisama\u201d [\"Sun\"] by Amessaki Annainin. This song\u2026well\u2026it\u2019s weird. Not \u201cbad\u201d weird, don\u2019t get me wrong at all, but it\u2019s weird on a \u201cwhat the heck am I listening to, and why do I like it so much\u201d weird. I can honestly say this is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard a kazoo used as a musical instrument in an anime theme song\u2026and it\u2019s not bad! The animation that plays over the scene is, for all intents and purposes, the funniest ending credit sequence I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026EVER. You can keep the karaoke scenes at the end of Lucky Star, and the \u201cHare Hare Youkai\u201d from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. This ending animation puts all of them to SHAME. The incidental music is just as funny and cool as the action it\u2019s played over, yet it doesn\u2019t dominate the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\u2013 \\n\\n\r\nAs with any story of this nature, it\u2019s the characters that move things along\u2014after all, it\u2019s a slice of life, so the characters that we follow have to be interesting. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nTadakuni:-\\n\\n\r\nThe long suffering straight man of our primary bro-trio. He\u2019s pretty average as compared to his friends Hidenori and Yoshitake, and thus is always exasperated to the point of manic over their antics\u2026though he does have a crazy streak of his own.\\n\\n\r\nHidenori Tabata:-\\n\\n\r\nOur glasses-wearing character of the trio. Remember that old-school Nickelodeon TV show \u201cKenan and Kel\u201d? Well, he\u2019s an animated version of Kenan. He\u2019s this grand over-the-top character who often kicks off the crazy conversations and situations our primary bro-trio gets into.\\n\\n\r\nYoshitake Tanaka:-\\n\\n\r\nThe blond-haired [Dyed\u2026] member of our primary bro-trio. If Hidenori is Kenan, then Yoshitake is Kel. He\u2019s more apt to follow Hidenori\u2019s lead with regards to crazy ideas, leaving Tadakuni to spaz out. In his youth, Yoshitake was known as the masked avenger \u201cRubber Shooter\u201d, helping out those who were being bullied. In fact, though Hidenori doesn\u2019t know it, Yoshitake actually helped him out as \u201cRubber [Band] Shooter\u201d when he was being bullied. Quite commendable\u2026even though he sits in his chair oddly.\\n\\n\r\nMotoharu:-\\n\\n\r\nOur dark skinned student council member. While he looks like he could be a juvenile delinquent, and when we first meet him, he is referred to as such, Motoharu is actually a really nice guy who gets along well with his older sister, even though she tormented him when he was younger, and her friends tend to have their way with him [not in that way you pervs\u2026] at any given time. Motoharu is the Nichibro I relate to more than any of the others because, bless him, he doesn\u2019t know how to ride a bike. Thankfully in his case, as well as mine, he had his bros help him out.\\n\\n\r\nToshiyuki Karasawa:-\\n\\n\r\nAnother student council member. You\u2019ll know him by the ever-persistent cap on his head. He wears the cap to cover over a very distinct scar on his face that was given to him by a girl when he was little. Though he comes off as being very mysterious and aloof, he\u2019s actually capable of being just as goofy as the others.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more characters in this compendium of kooks, like the Student Council President and his Second in Command who never really seem to be in the Council Room, Tadakuni\u2019s Little Sister who is by far one of the cruelest little sister characters in anime [\u2026Oriemo not withstanding, because I'm still trying to figure out what the heck is going on there\u2026], or the group of oddball girls from the \u201cHigh School Girls are Funky\u201d skit. Suffice it to say, they are the perfect compliment to our main cast as listed above.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) -\\n\\n\r\nSo where does that leave us? Daily Lives of High School Boys is about as realistic a look into the lives of teenage boys as you can get currently. It\u2019s not willowy light like Kimi to Boku, nor is it fangirl fodder like\u2026THAT show\u2026it\u2019s just an honest, hilariously funny look at the lives of some very\u2026odd high school boys. With its funny and realistic story, entertaining characters, odd yet functional animation, jamming music, and all-star voice cast, Daily Lives of High School Boys will leave you feeling nostalgic for your high school years\u2026and wondering if you and your friends were really as big of dorks as Tadakuni, HIdenori and Yoshitake. Nine times out of ten\u2026you were.\\n",

            "content": "The opening scene of the first episode is a hilarious and wonderful introduction to this series, but unfortunately Daily Lives of High School Boys goes off the rails shortly after the OP and never returns.\r\nDaily Lives tries to play around with and subvert the tropes, cliches, and stereotypes common to slice-of-life anime (and anime in general), but doesn't always succeed in sending them up properly -- which sometimes seems more like an endorsement of the cliches than a critique thereof. I think this is the core reason why Daily Lives fails, though there are a raft of other problems that further damn this series.\r\nSTORY (4)\r\nTherereally isn't a story, just a collection of skits. The stories of the various skits are each individually well thought out and inventive. The lack of plot progression from one skit isn't necessarily a problem, but when coupled with the lack of character progression it means that nothing progresses, so there's little to engage with or look forward to in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor of the series is centered around social awkwardness. This style of humor just isn't my thing, and so I didn't find very funny most of the jokes and situations in the series. This is a subjective criticism, yes, but on a more objective note, Daily Lives lacks variety in its humor and suffers as a result -- perhaps more for some viewers than others.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (1)\\n\r\nThe characters of Daily Lives are properly fleshed out, enough at least for the show's premise. Unfortunately, they are also unlikeable dicks who lie, cheat, steal, and prey on others. They are absurdly exaggerated caricatures of actual \"high school boys,\" which could have been a source of humor and a send-up of cliches, but they are exaggerated in a negative direction.  They don't just tease their friends, they abuse them. They don't just not know how to talk to girls, they are in fact thoroughly misogynistic. They don't just get into trouble, but they actively try to frame their friends for their own misdeeds. They are not believable, likeable, or compelling. \\n\\n\r\nGiven what terrible people they all are, friendship seems out of place in the Daily Lives universe. I could scarcely imagine any of these detestable cretins having positive emotions towards anyone, but if one considers the possibility of Stockholm syndrome, they can be seen as somewhat believable. The moments in which the viewers are granted psychological insight into the characters' minds are gratifying, if only because it provides reassurance that each are indeed sane and reasonable, because their actions routinely indicate otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe occasional side characters who are actually not evil, insane, malicious dirtbags are usually taken advantage of or injured by those who are, further compounding Daily Lives' enormous problems with characterization and storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nART (8) & SOUND (8)\\n\r\nI appreciated the light, smooth animation style, which fit both the quotidian theme of the show and the flights of fancy the characters are prone to. Sound and voice acting are good also.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (4)\\n\r\nDaily Lives conveys just one thing: High school boys are horrendous people who should be avoided at all costs. There is no coherence among the various skits and no progression in the characters. There is nothing compelling to keep viewers watching, aside from the comedy (if that's your thing). On the other hand, there is certainly plenty repulsive to make viewers think twice about watching.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (2)\\n\r\nDaily Lives is a thoroughly offensive, painfully unfunny, totally disjointed, inexpert, hackneyed, awkward, depressing, detestable, insulting, poorly-conceived excuse for an anime, and  I thoroughly regret having ever watched it.",

            "content": "We are all aware about how first impressions are a very important factor if you\u2019re going to enjoy a show. \r\nMy first impression of Danshi was it was a more annoying version of Kimi to Boku. \r\nThe comedy style seems to be the same as Drifters comedy at times. That immediately turned me off from that show. \r\nWhat also doesn\u2019t help is this is indeed another episodic show that I continue to have issues with. \r\nI was basically checked out by episode 8. I knew what was going on. I knew nothing was going to get better. I didn\u2019t care for the rest of theshow. \\n\r\nThere was a scene in episode 2 where Tibata told to ignore Tanaka. I was wondering if I should just ignore this entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThat is another issue with this show that Tanaka and Tibata are one of the most annoying duo I\u2019ve seen in a long time. \\n\r\nThere were some other male side characters that were watchable. But it is hard to get attached to any when you despise the main characters. \\n\r\nThere were scenes that could have been funny but I didn\u2019t laugh because I was so checked out by then to care. \\n\r\nI could also see they were trying to be snarky with references and taking jab at tropes. That doesn\u2019t tickle my fancy either. \\n\r\nI also am not interesting in seeing sisters continue to beat up on the brothers again and again and again. Not my thing. \\n\\n\r\nI really couldn\u2019t understand the main concept of the show at the end either. \\n\r\nAt least with Non Non Biyori you understand the main concept of it is okay to live in the sticks. \\n\r\nDid they want to get girlfriends? Is it a boy vs. girl competition? Or is it just pure nothingness? \\n\r\nI felt like it was voided of any main focus I could take away from the show. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was something I did appreciate about the show was the role reversal the show did after the completion of the ending song. \\n\r\nIt allowed me to see if it was because it was a group of boys that made it harder for me to care. \\n\r\nWhat I found out is that when it is boys my impression is, well I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with these guys. \\n\r\nBut when it is girls my impression is I wouldn\u2019t want to date these gals. Which ended up being worse. \\n\\n\r\nI do believe there is a fine line between funny and obnoxious faces and Danshi would fall under obnoxious. \\n\r\nI\u2019ll have to hit the art rating hard because that was mainly the only artistically thing I can talk about. \\n\r\nStory? Was there even a story? There was a few recurring segments but no progression in them. It was pretty terrible. \\n\r\nThen characters are terrible. My enjoyment was terrible. \\n\r\nThe show had a good opening song but a below average ending song. \\n\r\nThis show failed to bring any sort of happiness to me unfortunately. \\n",

            "content": "What word would you choose to describe your high school days? Is it stressful, exhausting, slave-driving, or even fun in some cases?\r\nIn a time period where almost every anime has some elements of school life or the words \"High School\" involved, it usually puts a damper on the experience as a whole depending on how you look at it before you may have even watched it. (Heck, even after you're dead you go back to high school according to Angel Beats). \r\nSo when you have an anime centering not around the overall experience and tales of friendship that take place in a high school, butthe quirks and antics that are possible in the lives of boys in the depth of their adolescence, what do you get?\\n\r\nWell, insanity. That's the best word to describe Daily Lives of Highschool Boys. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe title basically sums up the story the best than I ever could; it's centered around the humorous events and tales of three best friends, Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake. It's fairly straightforward, and as this is a comedy, there are no deep or thought-provoking themes, nor does it try to take itself seriously. Quite the opposite, in fact, as this series tends to make fun of itself time and time again. They even threw a wrench into the attempt to break out of the slice-of-life genre in the first minutes of the first episode, which I greatly appreciated.\\n\r\nEvery episode is extremely episodic, with the only over-arching theme being that most of these take place in an all-boys school which our protagonists attend.  It's rather obvious that coming from a manga, there are at least 3-4 \"segments\" that the show is split up into its individual chapters. This actually works quite well, as the story doesn't ever feel overwhelming and is laid-back in its nature and presentation. Plus, as each skit is only 2-5 minutes at most, it's easy to stop and take a break at any time without feeling like you're missing anything major, because really, you're not.\\n\r\nAs for the humor itself (since I wouldn't know where else to talk about it), I would have to say that compared to other comedies, is rather crude at times, though there are never scenes where the stories or jokes are too confusing. The simplicity of the jokes themselves add to the show's charm, and the inner monologues varying from person to person just gives it so much style and enjoyment out of it. Sometimes it's completely over-the-top and exaggerated, and other times quite... quietly presented. The only con I would have to say is that though the punch lines are there, it seems pretty anti-climatic at the end of certain scenes, like there was too much build-up and not enough reaction, though that might just be a personal bias from me. \\n\r\nNever is the comedy too girly and there's not a hint of moe to be found, which is really refreshing from your usual run-of-the-mill \"cute girls doing cute funny things in highschool\"; gender reversal is always a pleasure. The humor is crude and presented as such, and it really gives off the feel and realism that this is all coming from teenage boys going through a dumb phase, and it just suits the show and characters perfectly. I wouldn\u2019t want it to be any other way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of DLHSB are, well, exactly what they are: high school boys who fool around, get laughed at, and have no idea what they're doing in general. They give a little bit of realism to the show, but at the same time it's a bit of a downfall because with its incredibly large cast of supporting characters, things feel somewhat crowded at some points trying to remember them all. This mostly applies to the supporting characters who only show up for an episode or less and then disappear, though luckily there are only a few to be found.\\n\r\nI think the best part about the show's reoccurring characters (outside of the main three) is how memorable they are. Even though the show's opening emphasizes the fact that there are a lot, by the end of the twelfth episode you'll be sure to remember who everyone is, which is quite an accomplishment in and of itself. But again, because they're reoccurring and the segments of this show are so short, it may be a natural thing to know who everyone is, even if not by name but rather by what kind of personality and their funniest scene was and the diversity between them is refreshing. \\n\r\nThe main trio has a great dynamic both as best friends and as a comedic group. Hidenori and Yoshitake are the two jokesters, though in different ways than one another, while Tadakuni is the classic \u201conly sane man\u201d out of the three. Despite the fact that some people call Tadakuni boring and not funny at all, his reactions and dialogue towards the events around him are required for a lot of the jokes to be pulled off. Their dynamics and interactions as a trio are some of the most ridiculous and entertaining ones I\u2019ve seen in a while. It\u2019s their conversations and idiotic plans and jokes with the outside cast that is really one of the biggest and most entertaining parts of this show.\\n\r\nSince our cast is so incredibly large, I can\u2019t go into too much detail about them individually, but I will spare mention for the \u201cLiterary Girl\u201d Yassan, who is probably one of the fan-favorites (and mine as well) out of the cast for being a perfect\u2026 well, deconstruction of the classic trope of \u201cquiet mysterious girl by the riverbank\u201d. Extra props go to her merely for her existence, though I have to take a few points off for some unnecessary side characters here and there and not all of them are completely original but still entertaining nonetheless.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMost people\u2019s complaints towards this show usually stem from its animation, since when watchers think to \u201chigh school shenanigans\u201d, they\u2019d think of something comprised from some sort of cutesy moe-style studio, see Kyoto Animation and Xebec due to their previous works. However, I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue here, because if the show were any\u2026 cuter, it would ruin the blunt edge that this show has as a show about /boys/ and just throw the entire thing off and look incredibly misleading. The style and the way things are drawn matches the tone and characters of the anime perfectly, and though there isn\u2019t any particular part in the show\u2019s runtime that I could point out as looking absolutely gorgeous, it doesn\u2019t need to be.\\n\r\nAs for the animation itself, it\u2019s nothing amazing and is rather standard compared to other anime today. Others may call it lackluster, but it sincerely and dutifully does everything it\u2019s supposed to do and I never found anything to be completely impassable. Remember, this is a comedy anime. Unlike Nichijou (which happens to be the most common comparison to this show), DLHSB doesn\u2019t have any amazing KyoAni-standard animation to flaunt whenever they happen to have it on hand. Naturally, I would always appreciate more of a visual feast when I can catch one, and it\u2019s always a bonus, but I would be one to say that the style of animation chosen for this show isn\u2019t really /required/ for the jokes to be played out properly. So for what it is, it\u2019s just fine and I would rather prefer they keep this memorable style they have of drawing characters because it sets it apart to other comedies I know of. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAhhh, god, the sound. I\u2019ve been waiting to review this aspect since the very first episode, but let\u2019s start with the obvious. \\n\r\nThe music was done by the lovely person over at Audio Highs, mainly known for their previous work on the well-known and well-liked Gintama series. However, I can\u2019t make a steady comparison as I\u2019ve yet to listen to anything outside of that particular show. The OST doesn\u2019t exactly have too many memorable tracks on it, or anything that I would be inclined to pick up and listen to outside of the show. But, same as the animation, it does its job and is great as accompaniment to the series, but not as a stand-alone track that I would want to put on repeat fifty times for an hour. You will probably remember a few of the lazier tracks that are played multiple times, but never did I find there to be too little music or a certain song that I loved to pieces. The OP and ED are incredibly catchy and more or less will get stuck in your head for hours after you finish the show, so if you catch me humming the opening at any given point, you have full rights to slap me upside the head.\\n\r\nGood god. The voice acting. Where do I even begin with the voice acting. Well, to start off with, again, the obvious: this is a comedy. The voices are required to be big, bombastic, ridiculous, and overdramatic regardless of the scene.\\n\r\nAnd in that very important aesthetic, Daily Lives of High School Boys delivers. Oh, so, well, might I add.\\n\r\nMost of the time the lines and jokes themselves aren\u2019t necessarily what makes the scenes funny; though it may apply to most shows out there, the way they are delivered and reacted to /REALLY/ picks up the slack where animation and dialogue don\u2019t to make the scenes hilarious. Miyu Irino and Suzumura Kenichi do amazing jobs as their respective roles of Tadakuni and Yoshitake, especially given the fact that the two haven\u2019t done too much in terms of comedy shows. \\n\r\nBut then there\u2019s Hidenori, who was oh-so-BEAUTIFULLY voiced by the comedy god; none other than Sugita Tomokazu himself. Maybe this just comes from my personal bias and opinion, but his obvious famous role as Sakata Gintoki really prepped him up wonderfully to deliver some of the most enjoyable and laughable lines in the entire show. Just listening to him say anything as Hidenori made me want to cry with laughter simply because of how well they were delivered. I have to say that out of the entire cast for this show, Sugita Tomokazu is definitely the shining star of any and all of the actors, despite there being, well, a lot of them. Even though the OST isn\u2019t anything remarkable the sound score is automatically pushed up to a nine just because of the stellar voice acting.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Final Verdict: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe key point to enjoying this show (and many others that exist) is to not take it seriously, which isn\u2019t too hard in this case. It\u2019s not an anime I would recommend to absolutely everyone, since I know comedy isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea and neither are episodic series. However, it really doesn\u2019t take much to have fun watching this, since chances are you will laugh at least once unless this type of anime really doesn\u2019t stand out to you. Sure, it\u2019s not perfect, since nothing ever is, but as a comedy that is meant purely for entertainment value, it\u2019s a light-hearted, episodic show that will do you just fine as far as shows like Nichijou go. \\n\r\nIts major shining points are its character interactions and the presentation of the jokes, all of which is held strongly together with amazing voice acting and over-the-top characters that are a delight to view on screen. The animation and music is simplistic but does their jobs well enough for there to be nothing cringe-worthy to be found. The only downfalls that I can personally find is the lack of detail put into farther-placed frames and character designs, plus a few unnecessary side characters (usually who are females), but it doesn\u2019t take away too much from DLHSB in general. But the main reason why I would tell anyone to watch this is because of its take on the high school slice-of-life genre and its incredibly amusing gender reversal, because this thing really does not give two shits about dainty girls and the classic stereotypes in the way it presents itself. \\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a casual, not-to-be-taken-seriously-or-thought-about comedy with amusing characters, outstanding voice acting, and a few deconstructions of moe and the usual tropes of high school based anime, or even if you\u2019re just looking for a few laughs, Daily Lives of Highschool Boys certainly does not fail to deliver, and I personally had tons of fun watching it, and I hope you do too. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThis is an anime about normal everyday life! Mobile suits and tales of adventure don\u2019t come into it!\u201d\\n",

            "content": "Pros: Great comedy, short length, skit and episodic format make it easy to pick up\r\nCons:  The skits can fall a little flat and/or be lost in translation, I personally found the Highschool girls are Funky skits to be a bit eyeroll worthy.\r\nBottom Line: A funny series that doesn't take too much investment to watch.   Look at the first few episodes and see if the comedy clicks with you.\r\nComedy:\r\nDaily Lives of Highschool Boys is first and foremost a comedy series.    There isn\u2019t a lot of time spent on character development or any overarching plot.   Like Azumanga or other4koma-based shows, it\u2019s broken up into shorter skits which keep things fresh.  Even if one skit is unfunny to you, the next might be good.   It parodies anime clich\u00e9s and also elements from a real teenagers life. While I\u2019ve seen a lot of comedies flounder when it comes to that culture barrier, this one I think honestly has minimal problems (either that or I've been watching too much anime).   I think the comedy comes off as a cross between Gintama and Azumanga.\\n\\n\r\nOur cast:\\n\r\nThe [male] characters don\u2019t have extreme or wacky personalities, and as such the characters end up feeling pretty \u201creal\u201d even if they are doing and saying really absurd things.    The girl characters are generally given extreme personalities, and as such felt really fake.  I know some people say this is intentional and \u201chigh school boys really see high school girls as terrifying and out to get them\u201d but eh.  I\u2019m not so sure.  Elementary boys, sure, but in my experience teenagers are quite the opposite (wink wink).    It fell flat for me, is what I am trying to say.   Come to think of it, I\u2019ve never seen a slice of life comedy which can portray genuine humor with both genders, so there you go.      As a satire of how girls are often depicted in anime it might work slightly better, but I still thought the Highschool Girls are Funky skits were the least enjoyable parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat ED:\\n\r\nI\u2019d recommend looking up the ending sequence.  It is too much fun and I sat through it every time.   \\n",

            "content": "This anime is obviously about High School Boys and their daily lives, or should I say, the highlights of their daily lives? \r\nIt's a really good anime with lots of weird and awkward moments, which will make you smile and laugh.\r\nStory: 7 of 10\r\nThere is no exact plot in this anime, but only short story arcs in each episode. Each arc contains some of the characters, either in their High School Building, by the riverbank, or in Tadakuni's house, convenience store etc. Each arc is quite short but funny, albeit the endings aren't that good. Each arc may just end as if they're on squareone again, leading to nothing at all. Most of the times, you won't be able to see what actually happens. One character hits another but then, the ending is just with a picture of what happened, with the person in the pictures voice saying \"Daily Lives of High School boys\", in weird voices. I think that they have chosen to do it like that to simplify things by not having to animate more scenes for each arc. I think that the stories need some development, some of them do get a bit tiring. I personally still like it though, because it shows just the daily mundande activites of teenagers. After the ending of each episode, you'll get a glimpse of daily lives of \"Funky High School Girls\". But the daily life isn't always funfilled. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very simple, the character designs are similar to each other, there are nearly no wardrobe change (they all have their school unforms on). This is a bit disappointing, but it's understandable because it's often about their lives as High School Boys/Girls. The colour leans toward pastel colours, making it look like a shoujo anime. But that didn't put me off, I personally love it! Too bright colours wouldn't have made it into a slice of life anime. The movements of the characters are a bit akward, though it's nothing to worry about! \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 of 10\\n\r\nI didn't like the opening song nor the ending song, they weren't that catchy either. They were quite average and sounds like typical anime songs (pop song). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs weren't that good, but I really liked all the characters. Each of them had their quirks; Tadakuni, the \"too\" normal guy, Hidenori, the glasses guy who looks really boring but is one of those who will make you laugh. His voice actor is really good! And then we have an anime character who looks like a middle aged man, but is actually 17 year old. All of them are one or another very considerate of others feelings, especially girls. They sometimes try to not point out things, for example when getting the wrong amount of change and not saying anything because they don't want the cashier to get into trouble. They do small kind deeds that actually makes you like them. They aren't stereotypically dirtyminded, though panties are something that pops up here and there xD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those rare animes where you can't help but enjoy every scene, every character and their weird but somehow cute behaviours. They make you laugh, and also, makes you cherish your everyday life. Some parts may be a bit boring, but, in the end, you always get a funfilled ride in every episode. Though none of the endings left me satisifed: This anime is addictive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 of 10\\n\r\nBottomline: A feel good anime, with lots of laughters and not so daily blunders and moments!\\n\\n",

This was probably the funniest anime I've seen, especially the starting scene. The opening song is great and the characters are really likable. This is not a sentimental anime that will make you cry, but just a comedic anime made for laughs. If you just want a funny anime this is my favorite. \r\nEdit: I've rewatched clips of this show over and over again on Youtube and it still never gets old. However, if you aren't immediately into the sort of comedygiven by the first couple scenes then I suggest dropping it as it won't be as enjoyable for you.",

But I'm sorry I'm gonna be that immature person for this once.\r\nOkay so this anime is apparently considered as the must-watch comedy anime. After reading a few reviews and getting recommended to watch this, I gave it a try. My lord, this shit is unbearable to watch. Never have I in my life cringed this much while watching anime. I kept waiting for the apparently godlikejokes only to realise that the insanely cringy moments are THE jokes. I seriously can't imagine how a grown-up would find the jokes funny or even the anime enjoyable to watch. Because the 'story' of this anime is as boring as it sounds: the daily lives of highschool boys. Yeah, that's it. I don't need to have a dramatic, action-packed, supernatural, romantic storyline. But really, make it at least enjoyable to watch in some way. I have seen other animes with almost no storyline which are much more entertaining than this one.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't even mentioned the art and characters which are truly horrible. Wtf   is this animation style. Most girls don't have eyes and all the characters look the same. They have the same like 3 hairstyles but one is blonde and the other brunette... Yeah such a diversity hooray! I understand that you don't need Ufotable level animation for a comedy-parody anime, but at least make it seem like you tried. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the characters are just as horrible as the art. Even for a parody anime they were so boring to see. The females were absolutely the worst. They were just really annoying, dumb, abusive no-eyed gorillas disguised as highschool girls. The sister-characters kept fighting with their younger/older brother for no fucking reason. But hey, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is a comedy anime so this is supposed to be funny :) Well it isn't, the characters are too much even for a comedy serie. This anime is just trying too hard to be funny but fails miserably.\\n\\n\r\nSound/music wise it's okay I guess. Nothing special just pretty much the standard. \\n\\n\r\nI don't get why people praise this anime so much as I can't imagine anyone else than little kids enjoying this shit. Jesus, I need to cleanse my eyes with Hinamatsuri.\\n",

I thought something like DKN would have bad humor, recurring boring situations, and overall nothing all too fancy for enjoyment. I was wrong.\r\nThe comedy and satire is excellent, the characters have great, well, character in them, all in all being very different which adds to the enjoyment and interactions between any particular character combination were very well-written and professionally acted. Again, Idon't know much about what a good anime is, but this is my personal review and damn I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very neat, as to be expected from a newer anime (such as FMA:Brotherhood which had a similar neatness imo), and matches the style of the show. Like I said earlier, the voice acting is superbly done, and paired with the typical exaggerated facial expressions it made my past few days very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI do not think that 10/10 would be overdoing it, I seriously found no flaws for me. Some jokes are of course predictable, but I wouldn't really think rating it less cause of that is justifiable.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I recommend this. I'm a 21y/o guy with what seemed to be zero interest in themes like high school, yet I am here rating this as an excellent anime. Have fun.",

            "content": "Ah, slice-of-life. If you are not one to enjoy putting yourself into the character's shoes... well you should at least give it a try for this anime. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is quite different from other comedy anime because rather than having a continuous plot, it has various skits. I am not exaggerating when I say this is my all-time favorite comedy anime (I have not watched Gintama yet so maybe my opinion will change).\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nAlthough there is no real constant plot, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou does not fail to implement various, entertaining scenarios. Each skit is not too short and most importantly catches myinterest. Laughing at a bunch of mischievous boys doing the most uncanny things, what else do you want from an anime with this title!? Also, each skit contributes to future skits in later episodes which is probably the only connection between the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI have to admit, at first the art was not extremely appealing to me - the background is usually quite bland, colors don't stand out, and character designs were typical, and some minor characters (mostly females) didn't even have faces drawn. However, after delving deeper into the show, I found that each character was uniquely drawn. By the end of the anime, you may be referring to the characters by \"that guy with that hat\" or the \"dark-skinned blond guy\"! Another great thing which I loved about the art was the FACIAL EXPRESSION. My god, the overemphasis of their reactions are priceless and send me to a hysterical trance every. single. time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound is just average. They don't really stand out but on some occasions, the background music does bring laughter. This is because certain skits have a specific soundtrack and whenever the music pops up again and that skit made you laugh before, you'll have a smile on your face and nothing has even happened yet!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nAll of the characters are funny. Although some of the them may have stereotypical \"comedy character\" personalities, traits, etc., the other various characters balance it out. Most of the characters are males; however, near the end of some episodes there will be a short skit involving female characters who do contribute to the main story. Some of them are annoying, especially the voices, but that does't detract the laughter. If you are looking for dynamic characters then this anime may not be for you. I did not see any dramatic changes in the characters so if you were looking for a character you could relate to who becomes a better version of himself, eh... sorry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI can certainly say I enjoyed this anime. I looked forward to it whenever a new episode came out. It was so enjoyable I had to write a review for it years later! Although comedy anime is usually a love or hate, I don't think it's even possible to hate this anime unless you don't like skits and prefer an actual plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite not having a perfect score on any criteria except enjoyment, I gave this anime a whooping 10/10. Why? I enjoyed it. I enjoyed every single second I spent watching this show instead of doing homework or getting outside to get some sunlight. I re-watched it a second time when I introduced it to my friends for goodness' sake! If by the end of this review this anime still doesn't intrigue you, eh... what can I do? I'm just saying you're going to be missing out! If you watched the first episode and still aren't hooked, I guess it's just not for you. Comedy is subjective and I guess you'll find better laughter in some other anime.",

The situations or little skits it shows, will most likely crack you up because its just stupid. Though the show doesn't really have much of a plot it mostly just exist for comedic purposes. \r\nI didn't really see the anime having any problems besides not having a plot, but it doesn't really need one for the type of anime it is. I can almost guarantee you will like this show if you give it a shot. If you want something that will make you laugh thenthis is probably it. If it doesn't then sorry guess it's just your type of humor. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely the funniest anime I've ever seen. Give this one a try, it could become one of your favorite anime!",

            "content": "One thing \u201cDanshi Koukousei no Nichijou\u201d, or \u201cDaily Lives of High School Boys\u201d taught me is that high school boys acting silly is a universal occurrence.  If you\u2019ve ever been a part of a tight-knit group of friends while growing up, then DLoHSB is something you should watch.  It\u2019s an atypical Shouen anime that revels in the camaraderie, trivial conflicts, and the general antics one engages in as an immature young male.\r\nDLoHSB is a comedy that follows a group of friends as they simply live their lives.  That\u2019s it.  It\u2019s serialized in the least possible way; every episode consists of aseries of short, comedic vignettes that may or may not be revisited as the series progresses.  So those looking for an overarching narrative that begins in the first episode and satisfyingly concludes in the final episode might want to look elsewhere.  What DLoHSB does offer is an abundance of laughter.  As we all know, comedy is subjective, so whether or not this anime works for you depends largely on how funny you find the characters and the situations they find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime introduces a plethora of characters, but the main group consists of Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake.   The three of them are childhood friends, all of whom attend the same all-boys academy.  Even though the anime makes you think Tadakuni is the main character, it focuses on Hidenori a lot more.  Left and right, the anime constantly subverts your expectations, and more often than not, it plays a huge factor in making the comedic elements work.  These guys mess around every chance they get; sometimes they stop their walk home to engage in some LARP, other times they wear the underwear of Tadakuni\u2019s little sister.  And don\u2019t think for a second that Tadakuni has a little sister complex or that the other two are just depraved little boys.  He doesn\u2019t and they aren\u2019t, they\u2019re just crazy like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe segment that involves them wearing underwear is called, \u201cHigh School Boys and Skirts\u201d.  Every segment has the same \u201cHigh School Boys and X\u201d naming scheme, in which one or all three of them comment or interact with something or someone (so many \u201cORs\u201d!).  However, it\u2019s not always the three of them \u2013 boys from their school\u2019s student council get in on the action, too.  But make no mistake; every segment is from a male perspective.  Although that\u2019s not entirely true, because most of the episodes are post-scripted with a female-centric short called \u201cHigh School Girls are Funky\u201d.  Basically they\u2019re saying, \u201cGirls are equally crazy and immature!\u201d, and after watching them, they\u2019re absolutely right.  \\n\\n\r\nThe structure of the episodes makes them go past quick.  If you didn\u2019t find a particular segment funny, odds are you\u2019ll find the next one hilarious.  A lot of them were absurd, but they all have a recognizable honesty to them.  While the absurd moments were funny in and of themselves, I found myself laughing the most during those \u201cit\u2019s so true\u201d moments.  Moments like awkwardly trying to sound cool in front of a girl, or being emasculated by your older sister.  Even if the humor didn\u2019t work, I still found something relatable about the situation.  It\u2019s easy to see everything not humorously hitting its mark for everyone, but when it does, it\u2019s painfully funny.  I could easily watch an entire series dedicated to \u201cHigh School Boy and Literary Girl.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nDLoHSB is animated fairly well, and its animation definitely helps to accentuate the comedic moments.  Usually at the punch-line of a joke, backgrounds and character reactions are exaggerated to drive home the point.  However, what I found most interesting from an artistic perspective is that the majority of females characters lack eyes.  It could be because we\u2019re seeing them from the perspective of the Hidenori & co., and the only girls with eyes are the ones they identify with the most, such as Yassan (Literary Girl).  Or, it could be because girls are icky!  Whatever the case, I liked their decision to go that route, as it makes the series unique.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, DLoHSB doesn\u2019t have a series-long plot to resolve, yet at the end, you do get a sense of closure.  Despite all the mindless shenanigans, you feel as if the characters learned a valuable lesson they\u2019ll eventually apply going forward.  DLoHSB is primarily aimed towards males, but everyone should be able to find something identifiable about it - either as the victim or the offender in one of its many comedy shorts.  Male or female, if you like subversive, self-aware comedy with funny and likable characters, then, yeah, watch this!\\n",

            "content": "We looked back at our school days and we think \"Yeah, i've done some stupid shit in school.\" No one is perfect, and even the most perfect A-scoring twit might just be the greatest exhibitionist in the universe. And thus, we are prone to doing things that are childish, dumb and hilarious.\r\nAnd thus, comes The Daily Lives of Highschool Boys. originally from a manga by Yamauchi Yasunobu, The Daily Lives of Highschool Boys tells an everyday tale of three boys: Hidenori, Yoshitake and Tadakuni who lives like the male versions of Azumanga Daioh characters. Along with several friends and female side characters, these three goon with their daily lives recreating Dragon Quest, talking about something and attempting some crossdressing. It's pretty much related to any high school kid, since most of these things the three have done are similar to some of the stuff we've done.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's format runs like a sketch, where each sketch are dedicated to 5 minutes of the main characters and/or the side characters. It works in a sense and some of them are funny, and even if some of the sketches aren't as funny as the rest, atleast it brought a smile to my face. And the show tends to end with a post-credit sketch featuring three girls, who are living parodies of slice of life shows like K-On! and A-Channel. And sometimes, these girls are funnier than the main characters and it brings some irony and surprise to this show, since the main focus was set on the boys.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of British comedy like me, then the best way to describe the series and its humor is like watching the characters from the Inbetweeners acting like they're in the Last of the Summer Wine. In fact, it is exactly that: It's basically Last of the Summer Wine but with characters from the Inbetweeners. I mean, it's slow yet it's funny but at the same time, peaceful. It's like watching the antics of teenagers from the window of a Starbucks joint. While you're sipping you macchiato and pretending to listen to your stupid hipster friends, you're actually paying attention to a bunch of teens outside the window recreating Dragon Quest, and then retweeting it to make sure that everyone cares what you fucking saw, eventhough they don't because they're too busy trying to read a book at a river bank.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of this series is basically a crossover cast of Gintama, Code Geass and Persona 4, especially when Hidenori and Yoshitake are voiced by Gintama's Tomokazu Sugita and Kenichi Suzumura. Tadakuni is voiced by the talented Miyu Irino. He has a really good voice for a tsukkomi type of character, and he should be doing more of those to be honest. Other than the three, you also have the likes of guys voiced by Akira Ishida, Hiroki Yasumoto, Daisuke Namikawa, Nobuhiko Okamoto, Takahiro Sakurai, Showtaro Morikubo and Jun Fukuyama to name a few. SUrprisingly, this show also has an excellent female cast featuring Yoko Hikasa, Ayahi Takagaki, Risa Hayamizu, Yuuki Aoi, Ami Koshimizu, Yuu Kobayashi, Shiwa Saito, Kaori Mizuhashi and Yukana to date. It has one of the best A-list cast of seiyuus i've seen in an anime, and their voices are done pretty well. I love yoko Hikasa as Yassan, the awkward literary girl who has a crush on Hidenori but is suffering from a case of introverted awkwardness that pumps up to eleven everytime she meets him. She's exactly like Mio, except more awkward.\\n\\n\r\nInfact, with a cast like that, they'd actually look like a government cabinet where Tomokazu Sugita is the Prime Minister and Jun Fukuyama is the Minister of Roadworks or something like that. Infact, imagine a Japanese government where the cabinet ministers consists of nothing but the cast of Daily Lives of Highschool Boys. Imagine a government like that, and if it happens Japan would become the greatest country in Asia, where its policies consist of Miyu Irino crossdressing to attract foreign investors or Yuu Kobayashi throwing pies to members of TEPCO in the face. I'd support a government like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is directed by Shinji Takamatsu from Gintama who's work is excellent in this series. There are certain quirks from Gintama that you see in this, with the camera shots and Tadakuni's room resembling the Yorozuya most of the time. Speaking of Gintama, the addition of Sugita, Suzumura and Audio Highs as composers makes for a great experience watching this, because it feels alot like Gintama set in high school, and it succeeds in that compared to the Sket Dance anime which also aims to do that yet somehow misses the mark.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, great series. if you want to remember about the stupid things you did as a teenagers, then you should be watching this instead of telling your friends and family members because they really don't give a fuck about the time you ran naked during a class trip, because no one wants to remember that.",

Unlike me I was expecting way too much from the ratings and super positive reviews and I ended up a bit disappointed.\r\nHold on fanboys , let me explain. \r\nIt's not pretty good if it's compared with anime from every genres. But it's without a doubt a perfect example of good comedy anime. No fan-service and purely relying on three male character's sense of humor to make this show funny and I'm impressed that it worked out pretty well. For people with bad memory likeme , I found every episode very easy to catch up and understand. Since it's not that related to the previous episodes. Like sometimes you could've just missed one episode without realizing it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no solid story for this since it's a slice of life anime. But that's just further prove that comedy can be presented as effectively even without a proper story. The art style fits very well. Even though it's not the best , but it's one of a minor reasons why this anime is funny and for viewers to like the characters. Even though it's cliche like any other comedy manga out there but I don't really mind.\\n\\n\r\nIt's 100% okay for anime like this to not have too much character development. Like , it's Comedy. People came for the jokes and laugh , not to understand the characters very well. But the characters are still pretty lovable even without the in-depth developments.Their decision making and reactions are enough to make you love a few of em.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion : This is a nice anime , don't be afraid to pick it up if you're interested.",

            "content": "Have you ever seen a show that started out as a really forgettable show and then became something great. Or maybe the opposite, a show that starts out great and then just plummets down. Surprisingly, I\u2019ve found that most shows I\u2019ve watched are pretty consistent with it\u2019s quality. You know, we have shows like Darling in the Franxx or Death Note who both have a very large quality drop near the middle of the show (IMO). But I don\u2019t think I ever thought about dropping any of those shows. But that\u2019s where DLHSB unfortunately. From the first episode I really disliked it. It had somegood parts like the skirt scene, which is one of the best scenes in the show IMO. But the rest just felt so boring. I don\u2019t really know what it was, but something about the writing made me not enjoy it. It really felt like a 2010 anime. \\n\r\nThe show uses a lot of meta jokes throughout the show, and for the most part I think they were really funny. Commenting on the fact that one of the characters weren\u2019t in many of the scenes, or that all of the scenes were never their daily life (as the titles suggests), but the most interesting. It comments on how Slice of Life anime were written, and how few shows actually felt like real life. But the first meta jokes in the show really grinded my gears. It felt like they just made fun of something they themself did. It\u2019s like when deadpool says that the writing is bad at one point in the second movie, but doesn\u2019t do anything with it. Breaking the fourth wall to make fun of yourself isn\u2019t funny unless you do anything with that. At one point I was glad that the opening and ending were long so that the actual episodes wouldn\u2019t take time to watch. I know just watching a show to have watched it is bad, but I always have this thought that a show could redeem itself if I just took time to watch everything. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, it definitely did. When I watched the fourth episode, something weird happened. I started to enjoy the show. The conversations that the main characters had became very realistic to how friends actually talk (Like in the scenes where they play volley and the visuals were oddly artistic, especially for this show. I\u2019ll get to that later), while still being funny. Something happened at after the third episode. I don\u2019t know if it was that I got used to the bad writing or if it actually got better. But either way, I accepted it gladly and my decision to drop it was finally scrapped. \\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019m definitely not saying that it became a perfect show or anything. The problems I had with the first three episodes were still there, but it didn\u2019t feel like every scene was annoying, but that the annoying scenes were scattered across the whole show. I\u2019ll explain. \\n\\n\r\nI had many problems with the show. It had many predictable jokes and ones that go on for way too long, or should\u2019ve gotten a longer time to develop more. Many jokes are beaten to the ground like the \u201cstealing the sisters underwear\u201d joke that really embraced the over-the-top nature of the show at first but then just becomes annoying, Some of the exposition is handled pretty horribly. And lastly, many of the characters don\u2019t feel very unique, I mixed up many of them. Mainly Hidenori and Yoshitake. Their sense of humor felt really similar, their characters felt very similar and both of their voice acting was very undistinguishable (I could tell them apart while watching the show. But if you let me hear lines of dialogue from both of them, I would not tell them apart anymore)\\n\\n\r\nBut there were two problems that were the most memorable ones. \\n\r\nThe first one is the structure of the show. The show is structured in a way where nothing is chronological. But that every scene is a new funny scene. I did not like this structure at all. There are shows that do this well, like this seasons Kaguya-sama. Like in DLHSB, the shows structured where none of the scene are chronological. That the scenes are there to present us with jokes. The difference is the connection between the scenes and how many there are. \\n\r\nIn kaguya-sama, none of the scenes very often isn\u2019t in a chronological order, but is just scenes that the creator came up with. The difference here is that most scenes are about the same thing. Kaguya and Miyuki battle for dominance. They try to make the other person confess their love for the other, to make sure they don\u2019t have to do it themself. Not every scene works like this, but it\u2019s how the show works in general. \\n\r\nIn DLHSB, none of the scenes share anything. The first scene could be about the main characters stealing one of the sisters underwear, and then transition into a scene where the joke is that all the characters fall into pools of water outside (An example of a joke that goes for WAY too long). Though, this isn\u2019t the main problem. \\n\r\nBut the real problem is the amount of scenes in every episode. I\u2019ll continue to compare with Kaguya-sama. Cause in that show, there are 3 scenes in every episode more or less. The jokes get to develop this way, and are therefore funny. The difference here is that DLHSB has around 7 scenes per episode (I only counted once, so it could be more or less. I\u2019m guessing it was normally more). It\u2019s the opposite, where none of the jokes are developed and are usually just one jokes that is thrown at us multiple times. This is what really made the show boring at times, and is what I hate about the first three episodes. You could\u2019ve cut out scenes and developed some of the better ones. An example would be this. In one of the episodes, one of the characters (Really vague huh?) receives a love letter. He shows it to his friends and they all assume that it is a joke and want revenge for this. Then we cut to the place where the love letter told the character to come. A way to develop the joke could\u2019ve been to show us them planning and training for the revenge, to really show us how absurd the scene is. It is a simple mistake that can change a lot. At least that could\u2019ve raised MY enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow as I said, there was one other thing that was as bad. And that would be the visuals. \\n\r\nI\u2019m not a massive fan of the normal anime art. There are great visual in anime for sure, but I like more stylistic art styles more than animes almost realistic general artstyle. And this a good example of this. Most of the visuals looked pretty ugly in my opinion. Other than the artstyle not being for me, the the coloring looked really bland, the character designs weren\u2019t that memorable and the animation was really boring, where much of it is edited by just using the same small animation over and over again (Like when something impactful happens, the animation would just be two characters jumping in front of a red background and the camera would go up and down a bunch of times. Yeah, that was a pretty bad explanation.)\\n\\n\r\nBut the big problems with the visuals for me were the background characters. Or what I call, hentai designs. A way to fit the budget with an animation is to make background characters faceless. Or at least eye-less. This a good way to save money, but not to make a visually appealing show. But if that was just the case for the background characters it would\u2019ve been fine. The problem is when \u201cmain side-characters\u201d gets this treatment. An example of this Tadakuni\u2019s sister Mei. Her character is in the show A LOT. She is a pretty big character even thought I wouldn\u2019t say that she was a main character. But we never see her eyes. Her and her friends are all eye-less. It makes them look very inhuman. Eyes are a big part of how humans identify people. Is is a big part of our face and identity in a way. So removing them looks really weird, especially when they\u2019re big enough to make me notice it every time. And what annoys me more is when tiny characters don\u2019t get this treatment. Yassan is a joke character used in a few scenes. She has a face. Her brother is used in ONE scene. He has a face. They were willing to spend money on drawing two joke character, where one isn\u2019t even a character, and not a character who is in a majority of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThat was probably the most annoying part of the show, even the structure could\u2019ve been ignored at times. But every time i saw a faceless sister, all I could think of is that hentai use the same method to make the viewer immerse themself into the male character so that they can cum faster. (Not to disrespect BTW. We\u2019re all into different things)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut all that aside, I thought the show was okay. I enjoyed it, but I saw a lot of problems in it. I\u2019ll give it a 5/10 for now",

Then, you, my friend, have not to worry.\r\nFunnily enough, Daily Lives of the High School Boys is one of the most fascinating comedy, slice-of-life anime you'll ever find.\r\nAnd based on the title, it tells the story of three main characters doing crazy s***s and funny stuffs that surrounds them. Not only they revolve at these three MCs, but also the other supporting characters from the all-boys High School, and someother girls. And if that's not enough, there's also the \"High School Girls are Funky\" sequence where it revolves around the other three main characters, all of which are girls, who have to deal around in the same universe. This sequence is shown after you waited (or skip) the ending song.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is purely nonsensical, just like in Nichijou, filled with hilarious slapstick comedy that you can find in this 12-episodic anime series (plus the OVAs). And let me tell you, that even a short comedic skit, it will make you smile or even laugh. They will tickle your funny bone whenever they do something hilarious, intentional or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is almost the same as Nichijou, except they make it male and... some characters are hideous.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it comes to characters, well, it's all done perfectly well for this comedic anime series. And let me tell you, when it comes to comedy, the characters that were performed here are fantastic, no matter where you look at from different perspective. From hilarious one liners to stupid yet ridiculous skits, everyone performed here will just tickle your funny bone.\\n\\n\r\nBoth OP and ESPECIALLY the ED is pretty great. But the ED really stands it all out as the ED plus it's video is pretty hilarious and spot on.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all else, everything that surrounds this 12-episodic anime is crazy and hilarious as hell. If your looking for something a much more funnier comedy, try this one. Or if you want something that is related to Nichijou, you've come to the right place/anime. Daily lives of High School Boys is, definitely, the one you should try for. It's fun, hilarious, and even though the plot is nonsensical, it will sure make you laugh and keeps you watch this anime in just one, yet rewarding, series. \\n\\n\r\nI hope they made Season 2 for this. Oh! And Nichijou as well...",

            "content": "This anime's plot is exactly as the tittle suggests. \r\nIt offers many different, in most cases funny occasions in which the characters meet up. There are actually plenty of characters, and they have all unique atmospheres about them, but their characteristics are very simple. Interactions between this simple characters are executed perfectly, they all fit their roles pretty well. I'd say the best part of it would be characters, just by seeing them you will be laughing with guesses on what might happen.\r\nThe punchlines will make your sides hurt, and they start from episode 1 up till the end. There are just a few partswhere it isn't so funny, like it could be. The plot is like a marathon of special episodes of some show. There are a few \"specials\" that are connected to each other, which leads to character development. Yes... legit character development in a slice of life show. Apart from the comedy, this anime follows realistic motives. Like troubles with starting an conversation with an opposite sex that you don't know quite well. It usually turns out hilarious, but you could also learn something from here.\\n\\n\r\nSound is what is also another exceptional part here. Usually it is slow, which fits the mood or plot progression. I didn't personally find music out of sync. The OP is good, while i personally didn't like the ED, I felt like it was annoying. Voice acting is really impressive. When they act they change the voice dramatically that it feels right in the place, or just plain hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation would be the main criticism i give. It feels too plain and simple for 2012, it fills the atmosphere but i still feel it could have been more beautiful. The animation has some drops in quality, but in some parts the producers were exerting themselves when they put more effort on some little stuff, that could bring you up a feeling of fulfillment after you notice it. However, i don't praise anime much on art and animation, and it shouldn't be your main concern in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said this is full of comedic \"specials\", however there are a few parts that are actually just entertaining to watch without having a need to laugh. They serve to just make you a little bit happy, preparing you for the next funny scenes.  I find it brilliant because humans can't laugh non stop. It's a nice time to take a break without having a need to stop watching for a while. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this a lot. It is very catchy so i finished it quickly. Easy going, simple and funny, you could watch in most times, in most moods, so feel free to give it a shot. Just the first episode will get you hooked. I didn't want to point out any scenes, so that you could experience them first hand in a glorious way. For comedy it would be a 9, because some scenes aren't so brilliant like most of them. Overall as an anime i give it an 8, which scores high in my book.",

            "content": "The Video Review is out on my youtube channel, but here is the written Review. This was one of the harder anime to review.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe Daily Lives of Highschool Boys story is exactly as the title says, it\u2019s based on the Daily Lives of Highschool Boys. To make a long story short, there is no definitive story. The show is more a sketch show, there are a lot and different segments featuring most if not all the characters in the show. And all these different sketches are clever and well written, because they all do their jobs, it\u2019s funny, and not just haha funny,more like roflcopter lol lmao I\u2019m dying funny. Most skits start out as the characters are bored, and they find ways to pass time and have fun, some situations they go straight right in the thick of it. Some of these activities can be a range from simple conversations, doing activities or something you probably wouldn\u2019t do. Yet it all works. There is also a side story, where instead of boys, it focuses on girl activities and it is sort of a parody in itself. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there is no overarching plot in this anime, the different segments and situations that they\u2019re a put in is very entertaining. Some of these sketches are really relatable, especially if you were a boy, you may have once in your life had experience the same situation. Each segment is cleverly written and paced quite well. Every sketch was funny, and it\u2019s supposed to be, so the writers knew what they were doing with the script. I love the different situations they came up with; I was entertained from start to finish. Although it doesn\u2019t have a story, it\u2019s so unique and that it doesn\u2019t really need a story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, where shall I begin. There is so many characters in the show. Even though they\u2019re supposed to be three main characters, Tadakuni, Hidenori and Yoshitake, I thought all the characters got the enough screen time for all them to be equal, especially the boys characters. Because each skit is usually focused on one group of boys, then it jumps to another in the sketch, or it could be focus on one particular character in general.\\n\\n\r\nTadakuni is pretty much just the straight man, he usually tries to get through the day or situation as normally as possible, but his friends think otherwise and they usually bait him into doing something stupid. Even though he is given off as the main character, he is probably seen the least and the reason for that is quite funny. \\n\\n\r\nHidenori is the one who usually gets the boys into awkward bizarre situations. He\u2019s the one usually setting up the sketches, he looks at situations and decides to make them more interesting. However this is also shown as he tends to overthink simplistic things.  \\n\\n\r\nYoshitake is supposed to look like the cool character of the trio, like the bad boy rebel. He gets caught up in the adventures with the trio, and he is mostly seen with Hidenori. Despite posing the bad boy look, he is actually quick witted and smart. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no character development in this show. Because its sketch show. However I love all the characters  and the roles are all filled out, and when they interact with each other, you can only expect something great is going to come out of it. All the boys in general are really relatable, if you were guy, you know exactly how these high school boys will react, but of course it is more dramatic than real life. Because these characters are all so funny and well written, I loved pretty the whole cast, whether they were awkward or straight up cool.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 7/10, 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the animation and art style is rather basic, however for show that knows what it is, it executes it well. The animation is nothing special that even the characters and writers say the animation isn\u2019t great. Most the character designs look very similar, so sometimes it is hard to point out other characters, because they look kind of the same. However it does look more realistic, the boys actually look like boys, they never wear their uniforms correctly and they\u2019re not huge muscular guys. Most of the eyes in the show is rather basic, it\u2019s just one colour fill with an iris that\u2019s either bright white and big or a dot. Most of the girls in the show don\u2019t even have eyes at all, because it\u2019s a show about boys, so they didn\u2019t put much detail into the girls, only some main girl characters. They even make a joke about this in the series. But because of its simplistic nature, it works well with the anime, I think the simple art adds to the concept and the comedy of the show, and also they have funny face faults as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack does well for setting up boring mundane life situations, because that\u2019s how the sketches usually starts, they\u2019re bored and they find something to do, and the music is just nothing special it fits it. The opening theme is pretty good I must say, it\u2019s upbeat like the show, only thing it does sound a bit more serious than the actual show itself, but it\u2019s still does a good job. But let\u2019s get to the ending song. It\u2019s so bad, but yet so good at the same time. It\u2019s catchy as hell and it\u2019s freaking funny as well, and put that with the ending sequence where the boys are performing in a play, it fits perfectly. It\u2019s purposely sounds bad, but when you realize what it\u2019s meant for it\u2019s so good. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI had so much fun watching this show. Because it\u2019s so quick you really pass the time, before I knew it, it was over. I laughed at pretty every joke in the show, it\u2019s that funny. They\u2019re able to keep the comedy consistent. There are many types of jokes, whether it\u2019s simple slapstick to even breaking the fourth wall. The jokes are fresh each time, and watching the build-up is enjoyable. Because they are sometimes when you expect the joke anyway, it comes out and you\u2019re still laughing because you predicted it, but if you don\u2019t expect it, it\u2019s still funny. If you\u2019re looking for a comedy anime, this is probably the funniest anime of all time. I\u2019m just going to say it right here, this is definitely my funniest anime of all time. If you\u2019re looking for a quick laugh, it\u2019s good to pull out one sketch or episode and get yourself a laugh, because it\u2019s that funny. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier in this review, this is one of the harder anime to review. The story gets a 8 from me, despite being no overarching definitive plot, the segments and sketches and writing were so smart clever and unique. I loved every situation they came up with and also because it\u2019s relate-able.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound they get a 7 and 8 from me. The animation simplistic style really fits well with this kind of genre, however sometimes it maybe too simple, such as character designs and backgrounds. The soundtrack does its job, however it\u2019s the opening and ending themes that a great, especially the surprisingly bad, but good ending song.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, I give them a 9, for the reason, there is no character development in them. However I loved all the characters in this show, every character pretty much had equal time to shine and also they were all well written and likeable.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 10, my only regret is that I can\u2019t give it any higher. It is the funniest anime I have ever seen. The jokes were consistent from start to finish, the comedy never dropped and I had so much watching this, before I knew it, it ended.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score I give it a 8.5 after rounding it all up. But regardless of the score I recommend you go check out this anime as it\u2019s probably the funniest anime, well my funniest anime of all time. It\u2019s just pure fun, especially if you\u2019re looking for good laugh or even a quick laugh.",

            "content": "Danshi Koukousei ni Nichijou: Boys Will Be Boys\r\nThis anime is about the lives of high school boys. It's that simple, a slice of life anime about boys. The anime is composed of short stories which focuses on 3 male friends and their colleagues in their last year of high school. They talk about whatever that comes into mind and hilarity ensues. \r\nThe comedy presented in the anime is very unique. I applaud the writer for accomplishing so much comedy in very short skits. Even though few of the punchlines are very predictable, most of them are just outrageously funny and will come out of nowhere.There are only a few story arcs involved in the story which is kind of a downfall for the anime but overall the anime's story complements well with the style of the anime (involving short skits). My favorite arc would be the one involving Literature Girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are designed normally but the personalities are just like a bowl of mixed nuts. Every personality can be seen on the show. Some of them have multiple personalities and it works on them just fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music of the anime is just okay. Both the OP and ED themes have their sentiments as well as the background music.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend you watch the show. You can rest anytime you want since the show is composed of short skits. You can comeback anytime and pick up where you left off. If you're having a bad day, try watching this show. I guarantee you will at least laugh once. \\n",

            "content": "This show, is my all-time favourite slice of life and comedy show, with absolutely superb comedy and funny moments. This was originally based off a manga (which I also recommend). But all in all, this is hilarious and is severely underrated by the anime community.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nIt\u2019s about daily life of high school boys, what did you expect? They place in hilarious moments that would happen (slightly exaggerated), but making hilarious situations that make you wonder why on earth the characters do this kind of stuff. The episodes are all split into 5 minute chunks, with a fresh topic each, which a few exceptions. If youliked Nichijou, Osomatsu-san, or Gintama, I highly suggest this series, or vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and art: 8/10\\n\r\nThere was nothing in particular that really stood out, but made by Sunrise, so there weren\u2019t any faults either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe main focus are the voice actors. They made superb choices in voice acting for every single character, especially with Sugita Tomozaku as the voice actor for Hidenori, for some moments when his voice just fits right into the scene. The opening and ending are good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nEvery single one of the characters are hilarious, if it may be them having conversation, talking to themselves, or other. This is the place that makes Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou so good. Every character has a unique personality, such as the \u201cdelinquent\u201d, where he is actually on the student council and responsible, and also his inability to ride a bicycle. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, being one of my favourite comedies with the character\u2019s hilarious antics of daily life. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is into comedy.\\n",

            "content": "Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is an anime about exactly what it's named after. Daily lifes of high school boys, a quirky and fun shounen slice of life anime. This anime was a rather enjoyable watch, despite my dislike of anime which I consider having \"no plot\". It's story is presented to you in a sort of comic-like form, giving you short stories within the span of several minutes, each with their own fun little story or happening either being new or a continuation of another story. For example, \"Daily Lives of High School Boys 2\", being a continuation of the past short story, \"Daily Livesof High School Boys 1\". \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the anime isn't something you haven't seen before- nothing amazing or mouth watering, but it contains a very lighthearted, simple, and childish feel. Considering how the story is told, the art fits perfectly and makes this anime even stronger and enjoyable. When talking about sound and it's OP and ED, it's almost the same for art. However, both pieces are relatively superb, the OP being a rockish feel and the ending being well... Special in it's own sort. Sound effects and the introduction to, \"High School Girls are Funky\" holds it's own memorable area in my head for this anime, to be specific. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of this anime has to be the characters. From the get-go when beginning this anime, the characters share the one of the funniest and weirdest chemistry with each other, and are definitely very memorable. As they play pranks or horse around, everything they do is very fun to see, and watching the characters and how they interact has to be the best part of this anime. Acting over-the-top or unethically serious, almost every character in the anime is their own, and don't give off the copy-paste sort of feeling that you get in some anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime was a very enjoyable and memorable series, having it choked full of hilarity and interesting characters, genius writing and superb voice acting to boot. Watching this gave me a different opinion on these sort of anime that contain nothing close to what I find a plot, but didn't really matter to me after watching a couple of episodes.\\n\r\nFinal Words: A memorable anime full of fun characters and simple art, but has one of the funniest comedic writing that I've seen in a while.",

It's about three high school boys and their daily lives. Doesn't really sound interesting right? Yet, i personally think that this show is one of the rare cases of comedy done right. It had me in fits of laughter even in the first 10 minutes. No, scratch that; in the the first 5 minutes.\r\nThe art is just ordinary, not too bad, not toopretty. However, i'm not too fond of the art style when most of the female characters doesn't have a proper face. They don't have eyes! I think that its one of the gags to emphasize that they're just side characters, but i think it ruined the art for me.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't paid proper attention to the sounds..It's not bad, but it's not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the comedy, the characters are one of the strong points of this show. Each character is likable enough. I love the interaction between the 3 main characters; their friendship is (sometimes) heartwarming but usually they make you want to facepalm. Really, really.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this,  because every episode that i watched managed to get some laughter out of me.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend those who just finished a tearjerker or a psychological anime to watch this show for comedic relief :)",

            "content": "Humm a collaboration between Sunrise (Gundams) and Square Enix (Final Fantasy XIII-2)? \r\nThe first thing we should expect to see should be ultra cool giant mecha robots fighting between each other with light sabre imitation swords and summoning guardian spirits to cast offensive magic with 1 minute long full screen special effects right? Yes! .... wait...... NOT!!\r\nLike the synopsis wrote, this anime originated from a gag manga. \"Gag\" literally meaning jokes. Hence its supposed to be a simple comedy, which is supposed to be FUNNY. For \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\", \"SUPER DUPER #$&%ING FUNNY!!!!!\" is where this anime truly shines.\r\nThe story is centered around 3normal young boys studying in an normal all-boys only high school. Having normal friends, going about their normal everyday lives. This statement is entirely true to every word. However the fun and enjoyment that comes from watching them is NOT NORMAL!\\n\\n\r\nThese 3 young boys have questions about life like any normal high school teenage boy would, but the events that happen to them as they try to find out the answers are ROFL funny! Like how an innocent question about skirts can lead to them cross-dressing with the stolen underwear from one of the friend's violent younger sister!\\n\\n\r\nEven though I am a fan of comedy + slice of life anime (eg: \"Lucky Star\", \"Minami-Ke\") and have watched at least 1 to 2 of such gag animes. This series' jokes are the funniest I have ever seen. Every 20 minute session of watching an episode had me ROFL(Roll On Floor Laughing) till I was cramping, out of breath and close to hyperventilating. Once I had a drink of water while I was in the middle of watching episode 2, and it resulted in me having to press my hand tightly to my mouth for a full 5 mins to prevent the water from spurtling all over my precious dual screens and mechanical keyboard, because I was trying to prevent myself from laughing.\\n\\n\r\nHere are my breakdown for the individual categories:\\n\\n\r\nStory 9:\\n\r\nStory? What story?? As like most gag comedy anime in japan, there isn't a serious linear plot. For good reason, a serious, linear, sensible plot just isn't funny! The things and events that contribute to the story are totally random events happening to the ragtag cast of characters. And hell does it WORK! The lack of story just makes the jokes unpredictable and funnier.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6:\\n\r\nGag anime/manga usually has poor art. Mainly due to the fact that as long as the jokes are funny, the manga artist didn't need to put a lot of effort in the art to make the manga sell. The art is acceptable as a gag anime at best. Characters usually have the simple SD (super deformed) feel to them, especially during the funnier moments. And the backgrounds are simple, the colour scheme elementary as well. However I am not complaining as the lack of art didn't kill my enjoyment at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7:\\n\r\nNothing special about sounds. Plus points would be that the characters and emotions are wonderfully voice acted. The funnier conversations and jabs with their highs and lows in emotions are all wonderfully paced and delivered by the voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9:\\n\r\nA ragtag cast of normal teenagers who just wanna have fun and their equally crazy relatives and friends. The characters all appear normal at first impression until the jokes and gags start to kick in. Each character has their own personality and quirks which is very very obvious in the anime, and none of the characters are dull or flat, which is a great achievement for a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\r\nTruly truly a masterpiece in enjoyment. I have almost never seen a funnier comedy in my life. Just watch an episode and laugh almost continously for 20 minutes. Jokes are original, funny and unpredictable. Cast is interesting, the parodies are fun and instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with japanese anime/game culture.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9:\\n\r\nAn overall score of 9 is very deserving of a work of such pure laughter and enjoyment. It didn't score 10 mainly because of the mediocre art. But the lack of art really does not hinder the entertainment you get from watching \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\". \\n\r\nI just hope that as I watch future episodes the jokes stay original and funny and doesn't get the lame, unfunny feeling most gags start to feel when the author is starting to run dry of inspiration.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Highschool Boys + Ridiculous actions = Hilarious slice of life anime = Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\r\nStory: 9 - (There isn't really any story or plot here) This story is about Tadakuni, Hidenori, Yoshitake and their daily lives as they attend an all-boys academy. This series is basically focused on how really normal and petty things can turn into hilarious jokes as their lives don't really go on. A reason why I like this series is because despite having no story it was so funny which is why you don't need to add any logic or brains here as you can watch it when you're inany mood.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 - Usually in comedies there is a specific style used but that's not the case here which makes me like the art as it really suits the anime. Another thing I like about the art is how it contributed for the scenes as it perfectly created moments especially during the 'library girl' case.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - The sound isn't something exceptional but the soundtrack was one of the things that made up the scenes which is notable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 - Even though the characters had no depth and weren't given any specific information regarding their backgrounds as our characters are 'normal' but they were so hilarious and idiotic which makes them likeable and their ludicrous antics is what made up their lives which results in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 - I extremely enjoyed this anime to the point that I've even re-watched it and I might watch it again because I just can't get enough. This series can be enjoyed by most people but not all as they may get irritated by the fact that our characters lack in common sense, they don't like slice of life series, anti-shounen anime or they just don't like animes that are set in high-school.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who liked: Sket Dance, Lucky Star, Gintama, Nichijou, Kimi to Boku, Azumanga Daioh, Arakawa Under The Bridge, Sakigake!! Cromartie Koukou, Baka to Test Shoukanjuu, Watamote, Minami-Ke, Binbougami Ga!, Seitokai Yakuindomo, Meganebu!, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Tsuritama and Hetalia Axis Powers will like this series as they have similar humour/setting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 - Overall I loved this series a lot and despite the matter of fact that there are people who might have some problems with this series, I would still recommend this series to any kind of audience.",

This is hilariously good not because it's not the type of comedy that needs to shout to give and explain to you the joke but because everyone here has a normal life without any romance,sports adventure, or any saving the world typeof thing. Its just them going on with their lives without any worry for the future.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10/10\\n\r\n Althought the art isn't that good and to anyone who would actually read this wonder why i give it a 10 is because how it is. No one is overly handsome yet is somehow the school loser, No one is overly beautiful, And here's the best part about the art they feel so normal, I think i used the world normal alot but trust me its the best part. By that i mean it somehow feels so real considering no one in this story is important and they would be some random background character if it was in another anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10/10\\n\r\n Everyone in this story is likable even the mean girls who are supposed to be portrayed as somewhat bad. Also I don't know if this was a running gag or not but one of the three main characters(hard to consider anybody here a main character) has the least screentime on the entire show he even broke the fourthwall saying why do i get such a little screentime even thought I'm a main character. The other 2 Main Characters are probably the most liked ones considering on how they act so much immaturely yet doesn't get repetitive.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-10/10\\n\r\n The jokes here doesn't get too old and even thought they reuse the panty jokes it never gets unfunny that's how good this is. Jokes are well timed well planned well executed.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-9/10\\n\r\n Why 9!!!?  My only problem with this is why it only has 12 episodes when this is just a pure comedy without much moving so it would maybe be easy to animate . Actually I;m just kidding my real problem with this is how much this anime makes you want to have friends like those or want to live in that world where everything is so fun makes me feel like sht when you just sit on your computer wishing you could just live as someone there without having too much to worry about your life ahead of you\\n",

Chizaru from Kimi to Boku gets married and he gets a son Tadakuni who in fact acts the same as him : ) Like Father and Son. ( Same voice actor too) Yuta and Yukki also gets married and they have a child Yoshitake-who has the same personality of both Yuta and Yuki combined. Kanname also gets married(he finally confessed his love to Kaori-sensei) and one day- Hidenor is born. He got Kaneme's looks.\r\n :  )   If you wantthis could be a modern day version of Gintama in a way.    \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\n Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou or Daily Lives of High School Boys is a gag comedy anime about  the humorous yet \"realistic\" everyday life of Tadakuni, Hidenori, Yoshitake, and other students at a boys' high school. We also find out their is an all girl school near them. The episodes centers around mini skits where Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake will do something freaking hilarious.  HAHAHA : ) We also see other characters joining in on the fun : )\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Characters-\\n\\n\r\n Similar to Kimi to Boku art and character style.  Sunrise is the one doing the animation-- which is nice : ) \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nHAHAHA this anime is so hilarious I  can't stop laughing.  I recommend this to everyone who loves Slice of Life anime plus Gag comedy combined should watch Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. : )  10/10",

            "content": "\"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\" is a sketch/anecdotal comedy that parodies slice-of-life high school anime -- particularly those involving 'cute girls doing cute things' -- to great comedic success.\r\nThe humor involves a lot of non-sequiturs and trope inversion, and builds on itself over time without getting repetitive or trite. I will say that I thought the later episodes were funnier than the first couple episodes, though I'm not sure if that's objectively true, or if I just grew more receptive to that kind of humor over time. If you've watched an episode or two and are unsure if you want to continue, my reccomendation is tokeeping going.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the series tracks the antics of three second-year high schoolers at an all-boys school: Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake. After a few episodes, the cast of charactes is broadened to include their classmates, the student council, the student council of an all-girls neighboring high school, the siblings of our main characters and their classmates -- and then some. From around episode three onwards, there's even a segment after the ending credits called \"Joshi Koukousei wa Ijou Fu\" (High School Girls are Funky) featuring three (pretty weird) high school girls who act as foils to the premise of the show (the daily lives of high school boys, as it were), and that ends up being riotously funny and almost stealing the show! There are a few other recurring sketches (Hidenori and Literary Girl / Yassan comes to mind) that had me laughing out loud on public transit when I watched them.\\n\\n\r\nThough this broad cast of characters sounds like it could have the effect of being confusing and/or preventing development of the main characters by creating distractions, it actually turns out really well. The introduction of a diverse cast really allows the series to have fun and go out on a limb with their humor without having stuff seem contrived or *completely* unreasonable. This is a sketch comedy show that relies on randomness for humor, to be sure, but part of the appeal of the show is that you can actually imagine each segment as a real slice-of-life, humorous and bizarre though they are. \\n\\n\r\nAll this being said, \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\" lacks the true genius of Kyoani's \"Nichijou\" -- another anime of a similar format to which is often compared. The jokes in \"Danshi\" are not quite-so-smart and the laughs are not as frequent. Still, that difference is minimal and still nets \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\" a 9/10 in my book; it's something that every anime fan should watch.",

Very episodic in nature, there are still some episodes that build on the history and relationships (Literary Girl, Archdemon, Rubber Shooter, etc...) which I found engaging.\r\nThis show elevates the mundane lives of high school boys to the level of myth, heroism, and absurdity. It's great.\r\nMy only gripes are minor ones such as...Tadakuni! He totally disappears for a few episodes and he's the most relatable and straight character. The women in the series are all portrayed as physically strongerand desperate for the boys' attention, it would've been good to see some balance, e.g. the boys pining for girls' attention.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very strong 9 for this series, a great fun series to watch with a sting of nostalgia for us older men out there recalling the lost, mundane, boring, exciting years spent as a high school boy.",

This show boasts a lot of casual comedy and a group of retarded friends who will only bring a smile on your face. Despite having no plot this anime is a much watch for any comedy lovers. As the title suggestsit depicts the day to day adventures of 3 close friends Hidenori, Yoshitake and Tadakuni. Some scenes are pure gold and the gags are even better. This show could also be closely called as Daily Misadventures of Highschool Boys. As  a slice of life type anime it often exaggerates some of the scenes but this is the core of this show.  From finding a random stick on the street and starting an all out war with the demon king in the most RPG manner is one such example.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters all have different personalities which are always appealing. While you might think of this show comprising of only boys you are wrong. The girls in this show are equally hilarious from the little aggressive sister to the possessive literary girl. The first episode did not appeal a lot to me but as soon as you start to realize the intent of the characters you will find yourself laughing uncontrollably. \\n\\n\r\nThe positives of this anime are the different types of characters each with a personality you will like, the often exaggerated humor, gags and analysis and the sound which just seems to go with the flow of this anime. The enjoyment from this anime is real and once you get used to it you\u2019ll only want more. The only negative side of this show is the lack of more episodes and a season 2. However, it is quite difficult to criticize Daily Lives Of High School Boys since it is one of the most widely acclaimed comedy animes.\\n",

As compared to Kimi to boku, it has more comedy, really funny and another thing, it's also really alike to Gintama. Well, with Gintoki's voice actor, Tomokazu Sugita and Sougo's voice actor, Kenichi Suzumura, it just adds that spice init, i mean they were the main characters in this anime too! Maybe i'm missing a few voice actors but who cares, this anime was really amazingly funny, almost like gintama you have random everyday happenings. I'll be true to myself now, i enjoy everyday life anime, this was seriously funny. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all i recommend it for those who love Gintama and slice of life anime, Hahahahahaha, so, ending it off, i really hope there's a season 2 to this anime, really hope so. I'd probably be rushing to watch the first episode of the season 2 if it comes up. Maybe someone could let me know if there's a season 2? Heheh, I'll probably manage to find out myself XD Overall i rate this a 10 :3 it deserves it XD",

Though the art and sound is not anything amazing, keep in mind that it's justa simple, light, just for gags type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed it alot, and if you're looking for some ROFLing or LOLing, this might just be for you.

            "content": "Comedy anime, in my opinion, are both some of the easiest and most difficult shows to write and make a successful series out of. On one hand, you don't have to have characters with a compelling backstory, or even really interesting personalities (sometimes), and you don't need a complex plot either, just a basic setting to put your characters so they can have funny interactions and whatnot. However, writing comedy that appeals to a wide audience can be a difficult feat, since comedy is one of the most subjective things out there. The dialogue, interactions between characters, the various scenarios these characters get in forcomedic value, etc. have work in harmony to get a laugh out of the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (Daily Lives of High School Boys) excels at that with flying colours. How this anime takes it's approach to comedy is simple: take things that Highschool boys (and girls) do, and twist those situations to make them absurd and over the top, without breaking the line between realism and impossibility. By taking these fairly mundane situations and making them way different than how we think they should've turned out is brilliant, and makes for many laughs. Of course, there will be times where the jokes just miss, but that's near impossible to clear up anyways, and thankfully, at least for me, it's kept to a minimum.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing about this anime is the overall format of each episode. Since each episode is divided into multiple parts (each a few minutes long), it is able to cover a wide variety of topics, put the joke they want to make in there, and quickly move onto the next part. With this, it keeps each scene fresh as well as keeping the viewer interested.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the driving force between any comedy anime are the characters. Now, the characters of Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou aren't completely distinct in personality. However, even though they don't have enriched personalities, there wasn't one character that didn't get a laugh out of me at some point, since the interactions and dialogue were so on point. I'm not going to go into detail for all of them, just the ones that stood out to me personally. \\n\\n\r\nFirst you have Hidinori, one of the three main characters. He has WAAAAAY\\n\r\n more screentime than the other two, to the point where you could say he is the only main character. He overreacts and overthinks the situations he gets himself into, and this is shown by his intense monologue scenes. The best of which are with another favourite of mine, Literary Girl (Yassan). Every part she was in had me laughing continuously. There are many others, but I won't dawdle on for too long here.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, you would think the animation is kind of lackluster, and you aren't wrong. The art and animation are extremely simple, to further emphasize what Tadakuni, another one of the main characters, says in the first episode. \"I live a normal life, attending a normal school in a normal town.\" The simplicity of the art makes it extremely easy on the eyes, so you focus more on the comedy more, which I think is much better than having a bright colour palette. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to the soundtrack, which is fine in Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou's case. It's incredibly simple, which makes it easy to accompany the scenes it is paired with nicely. It adds to the experience of the show without overpowering it, even if the soundtrack becomes unmemorable in the process. \\n\\n\r\nBoth the OP and ED were great, but I thought the ED was a step above. The over the top vocals, along with the wacky stage play that goes along with it was undeniably engrossing. \\n\\n\r\nThere is only one true goal to a comedy anime, and that is to make you laugh. If it doesn't make you laugh, it has failed. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is not a failure because of how many constant laughs it has provided me while watching it. Sure, some of the jokes missed, but those were very few and far between. Also, even though this show pertains to a fairly selective audience, that being the typical shounen demographic, I would recommend this to almost anybody: girls, young adults, etc. The show doesn't go so far as to pander solely to that demographic to the point where many others would be dissuaded by it (and by that I mean having every woman in the show have D cups), so I think most people would enjoy this show. I know I did.",

            "content": "I recently decided to give Daily Lives of High School Boys a rewatch because... well, I wanted to rewatch a few of my favorite anime and wanted to pick a comedy show. Daily Lives was the perfect contender as it may just be my favorite (pure) comedy anime. \r\nIn fact, it's one of two comedy animes that I rate a nine, which is an accomplishment in itself. The majority of comedy shows I've seen, even the best ones of recent times like Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun and Barakamon, top out at a solid eight. That means Daily Lives has something special, and two qualities it hasthat makes it stand out is:\\n\\n\r\n1] Consistently funny in every sketch. Don't get me wrong, some skits are certainly funnier than others (which ones are the funniest is a matter of opinion), but none of the jokes go below a certain level of funniness. I was always smiling, if not laughing my ass off. I'd even sometimes go \"aww\" for the rare heartwarming moment. I can't say there was a moment in the show where I wasn't enjoying myself.\\n\\n\r\n2] All characters are lovable. I won't go into details, but I am very fond of the Daily Lives characters even two years after I first watched it, particularly Hidenori (it really doesn't help that he's voiced by one of my favorite seiyuu, Tomokazu Sugita). There are no unlikable or boring characters, which can't be said of most other comedies I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other categories: the art, animation, and sound are all adequate, of course. The simple style works in the show's favor, and the voice acting is perfect all around. Not much else to say except it's great.",

            "content": "If I had to describe this anime in one word, that would easily be: HILARIOUS. From episode one, I was already laughing. There was never a dull moment. \r\nI was on the verge of giving this anime a good ol' 7, but then I let the show sink in a little bit over a few days, and found myself randomly smiling because I was just remembering a funny joke from this anime. That's why I'm bumping it up to an 8. Nothing more, and nothing less. \r\nStory: 7\r\nSure, this anime doesn't have a real story, I mean, it's name clearly says it how it is.The daily lives of high school boys.\\n\r\nAaannd, I guess that's why it can be seen as a weakness in this show, how there isn't really a story to follow, it's all just a compilation of events, that don't even fit together. But man, are they pretty damn hilarious. \\n\r\nDespite having such random stories in the one episode, the scattered events are part of it's charm, and also the point of the show, as it doesn't want to be taken seriously. HOWEVER, personally, I believe that if there was more of a story to follow, while keeping the same humour, it could actually be so much better. There could be more substance to the show than just humour.\\n\r\nNot only is that a problem for me, but at the end of the episodes, I kinda skipped over the last bit of the 'Girls Are Funky', because to be honest, the girls were kind of annoying.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nNot the best, but not unbearable either. Most of them all looked like chibis, which again, was probably the point as they didn't want to be taken seriously. What I didn't like was the fact that half the females in this show didn't have eyes. I really mean it, they were just not drawn in. Maybe it was just me, but I really wanted to see their full faces because it always looked incomplete, even if the anime was trying to focus on the 'High school boys' more than the girls.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThis was definitely what made the show enjoyable to say the least. They were all so unique and hilarious in their own way. Although there isn't that much character development, they all had such strong personalities that you could push that aside and simply just laugh at anything they did. For some reason, a lot of the things seemed some what believable, which made it all the more hilarious. \\n\r\nSome of the characters, however, namely Ringo, was really annoying. Maybe it was meant to be the humour of: 'I'm so annoying to everyone it's hilarious', but to be honest I just found it REALLY annoying.  -_-. Though, she does have her funny moments, mainly when there was another character to make the joke.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThere is seriously something about this anime that I just love, and it's not only because of it's characters, but it's BECAUSE of its story, its art style and its unforgettable humour. I know I dissed the story a bit, and the art, but honestly, holistically speaking, this anime didn't need a story line to follow to be good. It was simplistic, and that's what made it so enjoyable.\\n\r\nI probably used the word hilarious way too much in this review, but that's what it really was. If you are up for an anime because you are bored or need cheering up, or perhaps just need to past the time, this is definitely the one. Simple but effective, no doubt.",

I think that this is a must see for anyone who likes anime.\r\nI give the story a 7 out of 10, just because there was not a whole lot of story going on. Like you can start with the 3rd or 10th episode and you won't enjoy the series any less. Each episode is a collection of funny stories and situations about some high school boys (and girls). Only the final episode feels like it should be seen at the very end, because there are some references toprevious episodes and it wraps up the series (kinda).\\n\\n\r\nI think the characters were about a 8 out of 10. None of them really stood out to me in a way that I thought \"Oh, this character is my favorite\" or \"Hmm, I hate that character\" I just enjoyed all of the characters. But each character was unique: Hidenori and Yoshitake play ridiculous make believe games, Ringo is a girl who sees herself in a competition against the boys in almost everything, and Yassan is a \"literary girl\". \\n\\n\r\nFor enjoyment, I give it a 10 out of 10. Each story was hilarious and I really enjoyed this series. It's a series that you'll finish in a day, and you'll want to because you just want more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall an 8 out of 10. It's not really an anime that I'd call ground-breaking or life changing, but it is a joy to watch.",

There are also some segments that are dedicated to fleshing out and adding some depth to the characters that were very welcome and surprising.

You can finish watching the anime for a day though and since its a 2012 anime,the graphics and the art style are pretty normal but that doesnt stop me from watching it cuz its the comedy that we\"re after. \\n\\n\r\n       The most crucial thing however is the characters. i was only in the first episode and they were already stimulates my funny bones xD Also, i was quite suprised that the characters have the same voice actors that played as chacacters from the well known anime. In addition, the opening and ending are all superb especially the ending which i never missed in every single episode. \\n\\n\r\n        So far,it is one of the funniest anime ive ever watched. i dont have the reasons to dislike this anime because im sure that the people out there that already watched it will feel the same exact thing that i have now. I really recommend this anime to every fellow anime fans out there and whats more,it will be more funnier if you watch it with friends :D so in the end,ill rate this anime a 9/10 overall.",

            "content": "Daily Lives of High School Boys- It's literally exactly what it sounds like, no misleading titles here. I didn't have high hopes for this series, considering how bland and boring it seems, but I was actually pleased by it. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou seemed to me like one of those anime that starts out awesome and quickly deteriorates into episode after episode of unfunny nothingness. To my surprise, this show was pretty consistent for the most part. The first few episodes had me laughing much of the time, and I still got a more than decent amount of laughs in the middle, but towards theend the jokes became more predictable and less funny. Not to mention the absolutely nonexistent fourth wall.\\n\r\nThe only big issue with this anime is its lack of ANYTHING other than jokes. The story, if you can even call it that, solely consists of a series of short skits showing the various 'adventures' of a group of high school guys. None of the characters really have any personality whatsoever. They literally only serve the purpose of making joke after joke. As much as I love humor, that isn't okay with me under any circumstances. \\n\r\nAnother thing I disliked (which I think everyone has said but I'll repeat it) was the extremely violent female characters. I mean, as glad as I am to see that not all anime girls are weak idiots who are dependent on guys, there's a certain point where enough is enough. It was only funny the first few times. \\n\r\nThe animation is as simple as it gets, which was a bit disappointing since I really like detailed, high-quality animation. The soundtrack isn't terrible, considering comedy anime don't usually have very good music. The opening theme was enjoyable, but the rest of the tracks were kind of bland. \\n\r\nOverall, I found Daily Lives of High School Boys very enjoyable, but it could have been much better. It gets a generous 7/10 rating from me :)",

For me, it's either playing Katamari Damacy or Kingdom Hearts 2 on my ps2, playing any Kirby game or that one Pokemon tetris attack rip off on my 3ds, or I sit down to watch one of my favorite anime with some snacks and my pets (who usually settle in to watch with me on my back. You ever have a great pyranees, a toy yorkie, and a fat cat on your back? It's a great cuddle pile for sure).\r\nThis is the anime I default to when Ifeel sad, along with Nichijou. Not only is it hilarious, it's also perfectly light. There's no need for commitment. You can just watch it. It gives the feeling of a nice, sunny day. That's the only way I can describe it (for me).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay. It's nothing special, but it's a comedy so I kinda feel that art is appreciated, but not necessary for the genre.\\n\r\nThe stories are good and funny. \\n\r\nThe sound is fantastic. I can't help but perk up when I hear the ending song. It's the only song I actually don't mind getting in my head for days at a time. For the ending song alone, I would give sound a ten.\\n\r\nCharacters are great.  The only thing I would say is that they have no depth, but it's comedy, and not exactly a character driven comedy, so it's okay in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI just love this anime. I can't say it enough. I've made enough memories involving this anime that I will forever be blinded with nostalgia and love. \\n\r\nPlease check it out. Even if you don't end up loving it like I do, it's worth a shot.

With my limited anime knowledge going into watching it, this is the first time I've seen an anime that focused on normal life and also the first one that wasn\u2019t fantasy or magic based.\r\nStory:\r\nThis anime focuses on normal life so there's no real need for a story. The story has no effect on the score.\r\nStory - 6\r\nArt:\r\nThe art style is good for the most part. Maybe I'm just not used to the thin edges in this animebut it's not what I'm used to seeing. I\u2019ve never been much of a judge on art; I like what I like.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nWhenever you make a comedy, music cues are important. When it came to this anime, they nailed the proper music cues and sound effects to make it truly funny. The voice actors were great too, nailing their characters\u2019 voices.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis anime loses character points with me because there\u2019s too many and there\u2019s not a lot of focus on the main characters. Unless you\u2019re really good with names, you\u2019re probably not going to remember all of the characters. They throw in new supporting characters every episode and by the end of it, there are about 20 characters that are shown fairly regularly and this anime is only 12 episodes long! Now the creators did actually say in the anime you don\u2019t have to remember all of the characters\u2019 names which was pretty funny and it\u2019s true but it would still be nice if we could figure out everybody by the end. I had to re-watch the series again in order to remember all of the characters\u2019 names. What\u2019s funny, or not depending on what you consider to be a main character, is that the one character that starts off the anime and is considered one of the main characters practically disappears two-thirds of the way in until finally getting more time in the last episode. In one episode, he doesn\u2019t even show up at all. They actually make a joke out of it but if he\u2019s the main character, give him more air time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime was hilarious! It definitely kept me interested until the very end. Every episode is divided into about 6-8 skits each with a different theme. Whether it be about after school hangouts, summer vacation or meeting that girl by the river at sunset. Some of the skits were so funny they left me out of breath for a couple of minutes or at the very least made me grin. A few of the skits though, weren\u2019t up to par when it came to humour. Several of the skits helped to develop the characters which was nice. Every episode is enjoyable in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime is great if you just want to sit back and get lots of laughs. The humour is great and it\u2019s augmented if you have some knowledge about role-playing games and school anime. Unless you have a great memory you might struggle to remember characters\u2019 names and a couple of the skits aren\u2019t that great but overall this was very enjoyable and worth a look.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 8\\n",

            "content": "This is possibly the best anime I've ever seen. This show started out as a popular webcomic and, in the style of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, grew in popularity to release graphic novels, CDs, and finally an anime. Let's hope that like Zetsubou it receives many sequels. Because frankly the writers know what sort of comedy the viewers (or readers?) want and they definitely provide it. \r\nSTORY: I found the show to be a mix of Arakawa and Zetsubou. And, like both of them, absolutely ROTFL hilarious while being insane at the same time. The show advertises itself as being \"realistic.\" I don't know how truethat is, but it is certainly at least more realistic than most slice of life anime. The show starts out funny and rarely stops. You will walk away from this show wanting more. I tried reading the manga, btw, and found the anime infinitely more enjoyable. Why? Well...\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I think the sound really makes this show. While other equally funny shows such as Polar Bear Cafe employ extremely well known voice actors, this show uses experienced but more cult voice actors. And they are fantastic. Not only can you really hear the characters being developed, but you can just tell how much fun they're having playing the characters. \"Jack\" was probably my favorite character, but I also loved when they would freak out and just yell \"Imouto!\" whenever Tadakuni's little sister appeared. \\n\r\nAlso, I usually fast forward through OP and EDs, but the OP is catchy and the ED just fun to watch. It is one big WTF moment.\\n\\n\r\nART: This is where the show falls short. I don't mind. I mean, it's a simple show there for the laughs not the art. And, again like Zetsubou, relies on the content more than the prettiness to garner fans. I think that's awesome. But there's another comedy I've seen recently (Level E, in case you were wondering) that really stepped up the art from the manga and it definitely improved the show and story for me. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: I think I covered this pretty well under \"Sound,\" but let's review: The characters are great. Tadakuni is the straight man... sort of. All three of them have their moments being the straight man or fall guy while relying on the others to provide the jokes that manage to be juvenile and mature at the same time. The characters really have personality. If you tried to fit them into certain tropes you'd have a hard time of it because they're not specifically any character types, much like realistic teenage boys. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: So much luls. I think I'll go watch it and lol again right now. \\n\\n",

I needed something that was slapstick and simple, with no complicated plot in my anime diet and it successfully managed to satisfy that hunger.\r\nIt's exactly what the title depicts: daily life as a high school boy. It involves three high school friends who go to an all boy's high school and their wacky encounters in life. While some of their antics are typical to boys, such as stealing panties andplaying RPGs, the way they handle situations is what makes it hilarious. Sometimes the gags itself aren't that funny, but the characters are the ones that make up for it.  They have their own sarcastic , geeky, troubled, obnoxious, calculated personalities that add to the humor.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there are girls... but heh, they are a handful on their own and not your average cliched high school girls...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is average, but in this type of comedy anime, animation seems irrelevant to me at least, as long as the characters look relatively human and proportioned, I'm good. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a typical school comedy anime that will be shelved with others of its kind. Yet, there is something about this show's parodies and sense of humor that makes it a bit different than the average anime comedy. Or maybe I acted too much like these high school boys in high school that I actually find them relatable (I hope not. I wasn't THAT ridiculous. At least I don't think so). So, if you need something to watch after a long stressful day, or want to take a waltz down memory lane give it a shot,worst case, you ended up laughing.",

And I'm SO glad I decided to watch this, cause this anime is REALLY HILARIOUS!!\r\nYou know most of the funny moments in an anime is actually not funny, like the creator is really pushing it so it'll be funny but it's actually not, like big boobs or the girl hits/kicks the guy? It's not funny at all. BUT this anime.. omg I literally laughed so hard and hurt my stomach, I even cried because I laughed toohard.\\n\\n\r\n[ STORY ]  9\\n\r\nSo for this anime, they have like 4 or 5 story in 1 episodes. It's different everytime. But if you get the joke from every story, I promise you, you will laugh so hard just like I did. Because it won't be funny if you don't get the joke, tho I think if you watch anime you'll understand the joke.\\n\\n\r\n[ ART ]  8\\n\r\nSo actually one of the reason I clicked this anime was because of the cover, there's 3 cute boys in it lol. Well they're not cute they're actually a dork. Tho I still don't get why most of the girl doesn't show their eyes, is their hair too long or what?\\n\\n\r\n[ SOUND ]  8\\n\r\nThe opening is dope, but the ending man.. is so weird lol. But the animation is funny so I don't really mind.\\n\\n\r\n[ CHARACTER ]  9\\n\r\nTadakuni\\n\r\nI don't know why he suddenly not the main character in the last episodes, like he's suddenly gone. He funny tho I like him, but his friends are funnier.\\n\\n\r\nYoshitake\\n\r\nMY FAVORITE. Okay, he is HILARIOUS. He's really stupid it makes him so funny. His friendship with Tadakuni and Hidenori is just really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHidenori\\n\r\nHe looks like a smart guy with his glasses, but NO he is literally dumb. He cannot even find his own glasses, and guess where is it. It's in his head :) LMAO But he's definitely made this anime funnier.\\n\\n\r\nMotoharu\\n\r\nMy second favorite. His episodes with his sister is just SO funny to watch.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuo\\n\r\nHis episode when he played soccer with Hidenori is probably my favorite episode. Omg you have no idea how hard I laughed. He doesn't show much in other episode tho.\\n\\n\r\n[ ENJOYMENT ]  10\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime, honestly this is the first anime that really funny and made me laughed so hard. Well some anime are also funny it's just this anime is focus on the funny scene so you'll laugh more than the others. I really recommend this, I promise you, you won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\n[ OVERALL ]  9\\n\r\nI love it. You have to watch this! Especially if you're feeling down, sad or maybe brokenhearted? Yea watch this anime, and you will no longer be sad.",

But how on earth the creator got an idea about the plot, because it was ridiculously funny and makes my jaws hurt because I laughing too much.\r\nTadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake. They're just so stupid (I mean in a good way). Especially Hidenori, he's just so ridiculous with they way he thinks and act. \r\nI don't have any complaints about theart. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch something light, funny, undepressed anime.

The gags are simple, yet the punchline is delivered very nice and that's why Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is now added to one of my favorite comedy anime.\r\nThe characters are also..ahmm.. theyre a bunch of idiots doing crazy things everytime...Everyone can see themselves on the characters thinking that 'Hey, thathappen tom me too! or \"Haha, I did it too when i was young!!\"\\n\\n\r\nFunny that's it....still hoping for it's 2nd season.. :D",

He gets so much screen time, and he plays a big role in every single episode.\r\n-Sting from Fairy Tail joins the cast but he for some reason lost all his memories and is an average student.\r\n- The third main character is a Quincy. Probably Ishida's cousin.\r\nWith a cast like that, no wonder this is rated the highest anime of all time. It can get a little gory at times but that's okay. Comedies great and probably has the best plot of all time. You like every singlecharacter, including my personal favorite, the student counsel president.",

            "content": "Comedy is considered a tricky subject to grade, given humor can often be very subjective to individual experience and familiarity with the context in which humor is involved. Accessibility to humor is a hugely important issue when making a comedy, but it is for this reason that the Daily Lives of High School Boys (DLoHSB for short) is in fact a masterpiece of a comedy.\r\nOne of the best parts about this show is that you can quite literally start watching the series from any episode, and it will not hinder your viewing experience noticeably in any way.  DLoHSB accomplishes this in the amazing executionof its characters and story.  One might be quick to try to criticize this show for not having a traditional unidirectional developed plotline as well as uncoordinated or minimal significant character development, but this really isn't a fair way to grade the purpose of this show.  DLoHSB isn't a story about someone's continuing quest for greatness, adventures in a fantasy world, or anything grand.  As the title suggests, it is about the daily lives of high school boys (and to a lesser extent, girls and other related people as well), and it plays like a sit-com in format, with each episode dedicated to mini-plots that revolve around various themes.  While there are a few main characters with defining characteristics, you do not need to watch the series in order to immediately understand everyone's purpose as each mini-plot unfolds. 98% of the humor is extremely self contained in each mini-plot, and the series manages to make fun of almost everything in daily life imaginable from girls, RPGs, food, hormones, fantasies, school festivals, summer vacation, part time jobs, and many more topics. DLoHSB has an exceptional story for a comedy due to its incredible flexibility.\\n\\n\r\nWhile you wouldn't necessarily expect it from an episodic comedic series, the character development is actually a strong point for this series.  While this format does not permit so much of the typical growth over time in relation to a struggle against an opposing common force, the development that does occur in each mini plot of the series is both concise and effective. Characters, both male and female, run into a variety of problems typical of adolecents, many that may or may not involve interacting with the opposite sex. While interactions are generally exaggerated a bit for comedic purposes, events that transpire still leave the impression of being reasonably realistic and down to earth, as characters come to new realizations about various things ranging from how to maintain friendships, quirks that may or may not exist between sexes, and overcoming inconveniences that plague daily life.\\n\\n\r\nDLoHSB also features great voice acting and soundtrack to boot. The most commonly recurring of the characters, Hidenori, is voiced by Tomokazu Sugita, who is probably better known as Kyon. While he does not sound like an adolescent, his voice and Kenichi Suzumura's (voice of Yoshitake in this show) prove to be very versatile as Hidenori, Yoshitake, Tadakuni, and others get into shenanigans, many of which often parody tropes from the popular Dragon Quest series created by Square Enix. In general, all the voice actors of the series execute a variety of motions very effectively as the situation calls for it, and never does the voice acting sound unnecessarily bland. Combined with what seems to be deliberately cliche background music always ready to accompany the right situation, as well as a catchy and easy to follow ending theme, DLoHSB makes for a very enjoyable listening experience. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the weakest point of this series is the art.  The backgrounds in this show are a bit on the bland side most of the time, and as a slice of life type show, the series does not have a particularly huge animation budget, outside of a few comedic action scenes. This does not really detract from the viewing experience, because the purpose of this show is situational comedy. The fact that for instance several of the side characters are drawn without eyes is an excellent example of how this series executes itself brilliantly in a way that doesn't require a focus on high quality animation. As a whole however, character models are generally pleasing to look at, and while relatively simple special effects are used throughout the series, their execution for comedic purpose more than makes up for any lack of raw quality.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the only remotely plausible reason I could think of for not enjoying this series is if you happened to be a pre-adolescent that actually has litte knowledge and ability to relate to common real life situations, but the vast majority of people should definitely live past adolescence at some point.  DLoHSB suceeds in every possible way as a comedy in providing humor that is very accessible and easy to relate to. There are no real restrictions as to who can pick up this show and find something enjoyable from it. Even if you are a person that naturally searches for serious material, this show still can succeed to entertain you because of how effectively it can allow viewers to relate to all types of life experiences, serious ones included.  And if you want something funny, look no further because often times, nothing is funnier than real life itself.",

            "content": "Now I really wonder what high school boys do on their daily lives, if it is anything like this anime I am jealous. This anime is great, there were so many funny, cliche gimmicks that were amazingly enjoyable. However, the slow start through the first few episodes kept me from truly loving this series. The humor and jokes were great, though some were a bit predictable they were still very well executed and had me laughing. I loved the fact that this anime was written in a way to make fun of it's self, it was a very clever and humorous touch, without it Imight not have enjoyed this anime as much. The way the story was proceeding throughout the series was a bit weird to me at first, nevertheless I was able to make sense of it as the series progressed. Everything and everyone's stories were connected in some way and, lucky, I was able to understand what was happening and where the series was heading. My only issue with the series was the first few episodes because they did not grab my attention to keep wanting to watch. I literally had to force myself to watch the episodes. It's not that they weren't funny, I just didn't get enjoyment out of the first few episodes because I felt they lacked story. However, once I was a few more episodes in, maybe four or five, I understood what the creators were trying to do with their series and I came to adore it. I also want to make note about the music... it is AMAZING! I liked the op credits theme but not as much as the ed credits theme. I laughed each and every episode when the ed credits came on, and the song is just so catchy I cannot get it out of my head. Personally, I think the music was right on the money for this anime, it was perfect. I also want to point out that there were SOOOO many characters, so many, but I enjoyed each and every one. Except maybe for the so called \"funky girls.\" I won't talk about them much for spoiler reasons, but jeez they make us girls look like evil devil beings. >:3 Nonetheless, they, and the other girl characters, were still funny but I was more keen towards the male characters because they were the real comedians. Lastly, what I truly enjoyed about this series was the final episode. Not because the series was over, I actually wouldn't mind seeing a second season, but because it was so heartwarming, tear jerking and yet still so funny. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story lacks at first but once I was able to get through more episode it became pleasant and enjoyable. The art was really good, they had beautiful shots in the more series scenes, but when it came to the comedy ones they made it oh so more hysterical with the art. The sound is fantastic, I really dig the ed credits theme the most and throughout the series they nailed the music. The characters were all so funny, but there were A LOT of them it was sort of hard to keep track of all of their names. Nevertheless, I adored each and every one of them. The enjoyment level was there, especially more towards the end of the series. The series made me laugh, had  the right amount of jokes mixed in with some series topics, pleasant characters, outstanding music and, I must admit, it took me by surprise at how wonderful this anime turned out being.",

The mini plots of each episode are mostly fresh every time which keeps you motivated to continue watching. The soundtrack to the show is very monotone most of the time, but I want to highlight how much I feel like it did a perfect job at setting the tone for a gag a day show. The animation was pretty standard fair, but the extra affects they added to characterappearance every once in a while helped to add to gags that might have seemed shallow without the great visuals. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer, and a few scenarios were repeated a couple times too many, which is odd since the skit style of the show would presumably allow for a wide range of variety.",

            "content": "Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, also known as The Daily Lives of Highschool Boys, is a funny anime. Not enough? Well, how about it is a really funny anime? That\u2019s good enough? Well, I\u2019ll tell you how I found this. Well, it was easy; on YouTube Top 10 Lists. There was this one list, and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou was on it. However, I wasn\u2019t much interested, till I browsed through all the anime with the Shonen genre, and that\u2019s how it all started. Not that surprising. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, one of the funniest anime ever, it\u2019s review will begin now!\r\nThere are so many thingsI want to say about Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. A lot of things, even I don\u2019t bother counting! However, I will start with the positivity, then move on to the negativity. Okay, so there is no story; well, there kind of is. It\u2019s about 3 high school boys, and they\u2019re friends. They go to an all-boys school called Prefectural Sanada North High School, and they do all sorts of things that a high school boy should do. Have fun, play RPG games in real life, and go crazy! Not drunk, just normally crazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe good things are that this is not your average school anime: it\u2019s an all-boys school, so that is called a change in most school anime. Also, this story has so many different stories in it. You can call it a mini-story, or some things that happen in normal school life, but they just make it all absolutely hilarious and comedic, I just cannot stand how good they did on each story! Each \u201cmini-story\u201d has a situation, and you can watch how they deal with it, but they usually just play along and such, which makes it even more funny. It fills you with HOPES AND DREAMS.\\n\\n\r\nThe negative things are that the situations are always classic. Well, most of them are, but the jokes they make are so classic. Not only that, but the situations are everything that happen in high school life. Pretty much not everything, but some things. Not only that, but they are way too short! We could have them slightly longer! I know, that\u2019s how the manga works, but it is just a bit shorter than the manga. Just slightly. If it could have the same length, that would be okay! That\u2019s all for the story. Everything else is good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it is beautiful. Sunrise is really good at their drawing and animation, and not to mention Square Enix did a good job with the anime too. The way it is animated is perfect, absolutely perfect. You could say I have no problems with the art, and if I did, it won\u2019t be The Daily Lives of Highschool Boys, because this can be relatable to your life in high-school. The anime has one of the best art that I have ever seen, and it is done perfectly. Outstanding, and masterpiece art.\\n\\n\r\nI will say why the animation and art is good. The art for this anime is unique. Really unique. It looks like it\u2019s drawn by someone who spends their whole day drawing, because someone who does that improves on skills. The animation isn\u2019t really intense, but it is still one of the reasons this anime is really good. It is beautiful animation. Animation doesn\u2019t need to be intense; it can be beautiful too. That is what this anime\u2019s art pretty much is: impressive, beautiful, and absolutely well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really good, in my opinion. However, is this all we\u2019re gonna get about the characters? Really? They could tell us more about each character, because I am a bit disappointed. But that\u2019s the only bad thing. The good things are the character\u2019s personalities fit how they look. Tadakuni looks like a high-school boy who is most fit out to be the center, and someone who would be annoyed if a friend acts silly. Hidenori seems to be the most energetic, funniest, and probably the most calm but has emotions, and Yoshitake looks like an emotionless comedian that has emotions and probably the most dumbest one there. Not in an offensive way, just as of intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nI think they\u2019re all perfect for who they are. They are really good. Everyone is the same in this anime, and the way that they are pretty much presented are really good. Pretty well done, in my opinion. Like I said before, I didn\u2019t want to get this much of the characters and I wanted more, and I wanted them to show more in a different way. Instead of saying it straight (because if they did, it won\u2019t be a full manga adaptation), I want the characters to show more of who they are differently.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is beautiful. Although the ending song is silly, that\u2019s what I like about it. Just how silly it is makes the song good. The soundtrack itself is good in it\u2019s own way, but I feel like something isn\u2019t right. I don\u2019t know why, but something isn\u2019t right. It just doesn\u2019t seem right; but anyway, I find the soundtrack enjoyable. The opening is really good! The opening video really fits the whole anime, and the song is really catchy. However, I feel like it doesn\u2019t fit the anime. I don\u2019t know why, but it just doesn\u2019t fit. Yet, I never got my answer, but hey, at least everything else is good!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime overall is enjoyable! Although I feel like I can put it on-hold like I want to, it\u2019s really good! But it didn\u2019t catch my eye much to give it a 10 on enjoyment. However, I did find it all enjoyable, it was really good. I liked most scenes, while some scenes I say \u201cmeh, it\u2019s normal.\u201d. I don\u2019t hate any scene, but I just find it, well, neutral, I guess? Is that the best word? I would find real life enjoyable if my high-school life was exactly like Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake\u2019s life in high-school, because that would be cool. The anime is cool, I guess, really cool. It\u2019s well done.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, overall, I find this anime very good. Very cool, and it\u2019s worth a watch. Although it may not live up to your expectations, it is still worth it. I like this anime, and I think you will like it too, no doubt!",

Besides, when you actually get into a scene, then it does the title inserts at least a good six or seven times per episode, that's when it gets tiresome.\r\nArt:\r\nOkay, the art was pretty decent, I will admit (why on this review thing is 'decent' considered worse than 'mediocre'?). \r\nSound:\r\nIs there really need for the immediate introduction when you already have the opening theme to come, which is eh at best anyway?I also started to get annoyed with the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were too cringeworthy for me to watch properly.

            "content": "Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is an ideal show if you're looking for something with immediate satisfaction and minimal time commitment. This slice of life well illustrates the thoughts and actions of high school adolescence. And although it debuted in 2012, the show has aged well and can be re-watched time and time again.\r\nDanshi Koukousei strays away from high school anime cliches and has you fondly remembering those responsibility-free years. The gags and slapstick is in the forefront with the story plot peaks out behind the back seat. What's nice about the various skits in each episode is that they slowly continue as the episodes goon. But of course the episodes can be viewed out of order and still be enjoyable. Danshi Koukousei is unapologetic about depicting awkward high school boys and girls. It's refreshing to watch characters worry about their sibling's unkempt rage rather than an overused romance trope. Their insecurities, hesitations and flaws ground them in their animated reality. However, because the scenes are comedy-driven, if Japanese style humor is not to your taste it can be difficult to fully appreciate the comedy. (Story: 8)\\n\\n\r\nAs short episodic shows go, art is rarely the forte. The characters are simply shaded and the backgrounds often have generic scenery or patterned tone backgrounds when focusing on a character. With that said, the animation does not cut corners on character movements compared to other short series. It\u2019s a fair amount of effort coloring and animating the series, considering the attention 4-Koma length shows usually receive. It may not be the most memorable art style, but it\u2019s hard to forget the spiky hairdos of our \u201cdelinquent\u201d friends. (Art: 8)\\n\\n\r\nThe music score for Danshi Koukousei, is memorable, but not necessarily because of its musical finesse. There isn\u2019t much to say other than that it\u2019s meant to be amateur-ish, with comedians in the singers' position. The opening and ending songs stay consistent throughout the run. The opening is an upbeat number and the ending imitates a student-created song fit for the school play. Aside from that and the spoken segues, the other sounds involve cicadas and guitar strums (Sound: 7)\\n\\n\r\nHidenori and Yoshitake are undoubtedly the stars of the show. They are often the center of drama due to their larger than life personalities. Mostly their dynamic is thanks to the voice actor duo, Sugita Tomokazu and Suzumura Kenichi. From their performance in Gintama (as Gintoki and Okita), they naturally transition to another slap stick comedy together, with Sugita\u2019s Gintoki clearly shining underneath Hidenori's actions. However, the side characters in Danshi Koukousei were just as memorable, with their fair share of screen time. It\u2019s easy to sympathize with the other boys because they are often the ones picking up the pieces. They gain depth beyond their given archetypes and shine in separate spin-offs.  (Character: 9)\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s now been five years since this series came out, and yet the series ages well. It can be re-watched multiple times and still cause ceaseless chuckles. Personally, this show has brightened some gloomy days as the characters become endearing old friends. The show is meant to be laughed out loud while evoking universal reminiscence of childhood. Danshi Koukousei thoroughly makes fun of itself and the slice of life genre. It sets itself apart by leaving out the drama and presenting unadulterated amusement. (Enjoyment: 10).\\n\\n\r\nThe highlights:\\n\r\n- Longevity of the humor and re-watchability\\n\r\n- Nice balance of mundane life and outlandish scenarios\\n\r\n- Usage of side characters and their evolving involvement (School Council, Mitsuo and Literary Girl in particular)\\n\r\n- Main voice actors' character dynamics, especially Sugita Tomokazu's (Hidenori) and Suzumura Kenichi's (Yoshitake) roles. \\n\\n\r\nPoints of Improvements:\\n\r\n- Abrupt segues to the \"High School girls are funky\u201d (\u5973\u5b50\u9ad8\u6821\u751f\u306f\u975e\u5e38\uff09portions, and their less successful delivery on jokes\\n\r\n- Amateur sounding soundtrack with limited variety\\n\r\n- Art lacking detail and being average in style\\n",

            "content": "The first thing Tadakuni says is, \"I live a normal life, attending a normal school in a normal town.\" Next thing you know, he is trying on his sister's skirt, telling lies about puking up centipedes, and ruining Literary Girl's fantasy of talking to a lonely, introverted otaku who can harness the power of wind. And that was the pilot.\r\nTwelve episodes of absolute ridiculousness and stupid antics. A goldmine. \r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It is slightly different from other comedy slice-of-lifey shows in the sense that it revolves around schoolboys rather than schoolgirls. As a result, the humor is also altered (in a goodsense) from the \"staple\" of this genre. I am of the belief that the \"High School Girls are Funky\" shorts exist solely to make fun of said \"staple\". \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nI understand that slice-of-life shows are somewhat detached from a regular timeline. As long as a setting and/or a very vague objective has been established, there is nothing else really needed for it to \"progress.\"\\n\\n\r\nA slice-of-life show, often coupled with comedy, does not \"progress\" through  plot devices (usually) or a series of arcs (usually). It only aims to entertain, amuse, charm, and sometimes invite its audience to reminisce and sympathize with its various characters in various events.\\n\\n\r\nDoes Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou accomplish this? Certainly. Does it have an outstanding story and something that pushes its audience to hit \"Next Episode\" to see what happens next? No. \\n\\n\r\nBut that is to be expected. So I give it the \"decent\" score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nFor what slice-of-life comedies often lack in storytelling, characters will make up for that deficit. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, I realized that I was already attached to many of the characters...many of which were not \"the main characters\". Despite the fact that Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake were the \"starters\" of the show, the writers thoughtfully rotated other characters in and out of the mix, until the viewer has no expectations for focusing on only a few characters. (There is even a fourth-wall scene, which has been imitated in Sakamoto-san desu ga?, in which Tadakuni makes this known.)\\n\\n\r\nMy personal opinion is that this is a good thing; because character development is not a priority for something primarily intended to be funny and somewhat nonsensical. Even if character development was not a priority, there are some sentimental moments and other ways the show aims to have the viewer familiarize themselves with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, I did feel as if there was a particular lack of background information on the cast, but given the twelve-episode format, it cannot be helped.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 5/10, 7/10\\n\r\nAs always, art does not weigh very heavily on my scale, so I only give my thoughts on whether or not I though it was pretty.\\n\\n\r\n...It could be prettier. This show.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the animation looks a little lazy, so characters appear sloppy, or the colors appear blank and flat due to overlooking shading and detail. The characters themselves are not illustrated to look bishounen/bishoujo, but considering the humor...it is appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting on the other hand is extremely well done. Hidenori's \"Nooooo! Nooooo!\" will be forever engraved in my conscience. \\n\\n\r\n(BGM was alright. I liked the guitar sounds in the little intermissions between gags. But nothing particularly stood out, aside from the Literary Girl music.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDisclaimer that I am not difficult to entertain. I knew within ten minutes that I was going to sit through the next eleven episodes, no questions asked.\\n\\n\r\n...But seriously, there is no way someone cannot find the first couple of episodes funny enough to continue. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime. To anyone. At anytime. For anything.",

            "content": "Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is an anime series about a bunch of high school students, who behave like idiots for our entertainment. But surely most of us can relate in some way?\r\nAt one time or another we've all experienced life as a student in school. And at one time or another we all act like idiots in school. No, not the type of idiots who are just a nuisance and bully others for their own amusement, but idiots who battle to survive compulsory education through various methods: chilling out with friends, having as much fun as possible, and getting in trouble with teachers over seeminglytrivial matters. Unless you're the type who studies diligently 24/7. Yet then you wouldn't watch anime, nor would you read this. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is like a machine that takes situations we find in everyday school life, throws its own fictional students into the mix, and churns out exaggerated conversations, over-the-top reactions and ridiculous outcomes. Enough to leave you rolling on the floor breathless while witnessing some of the wild antics. They may take place in a classroom, someone's house, in the town, along a riverbank, etc. If most of these situations actually happened to us for real, our lives as a student would be one heck of a time.\\n\\n\r\nYou get an abundance of characters who become the source, and butt, of various jokes: those who are quiet, those who are perverted, those who are sarcastic, those who have beastly strength, those who are morons, and others besides. Unfortunately, some characters get less screen time than others. Some characters are hilarious, others not so much. This applies to the comedy. This show will be more or less appealing depending on each viewer's individual sense of humour. However, most comedy lovers should be guaranteed to find moments in this series that will send you into teary-eyed laughing fits, or at least slap a huge grin onto your face.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is split into a number of skits or segments that involve one or more gags. Make sure you don't stop watching once the end credits roll! Sure, there's an interesting school play with a catchy theme song, and it's amusing to watch. But more importantly, the episode continues for a short while afterwards with different characters in another enjoyable comedy tale. The music in this series is funky, it's relaxing, and it suits the light-hearted tone. The voice acting is impressive and lines are delivered with great timing to maximum effect. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much by way of a complex story, but that was never what this anime set out to achieve anyway. The comedy succeeds for the most part, and that's the crucial aspect. Admittedly, the animation isn't amazing, characters could do with more varied appearances and not all gags will be well received. But give it a try if you've watched too much depressing anime and you need a good laugh; you could do a lot worse than Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou!\\n",

It is one of the few animes that excels in its category.\r\nDanshi is mainly aimed at male teenagers, and exaggerates their insecurities. While hilarious, it also makes the characters more relatable and not just 'boke' characters. Personally I found the graduation scene emotional as it really did feel like the end of fun and games.The alienation of most girls in Danshi focuses the anime on the guys, which is great because theres no fan service that takes away from the humor\r\nMost people should find this anime interesting enougheven if they are/were not high school boys. Simplicity of premise, original humor and laid back pacing makes Danshi less of an investment and more of a comfortable distraction.",

After seeing TheAnimeMan praise this show for being extremely humorous, my friend and I decided to watch this show. We prepared ourselves for a lot of goofs and a lot of laughs.\r\nHe loved it, finishing the show to its end. I, on the other hand, only got to episode six.\r\nHere is why.\r\nThe story is simple - it follows the daily lives of high school boys. This must be a setup for something special - something that would remind one of such showslike Nichijou. But, the show is really what the title says it is. It really is the daily lives of high school boys. Nothing ridiculous happens in the show (apart from the first episode, which is just a predictable fourth wall break) and that sets me in the mood for a really normal show with sprinkled humor - not the show I was told about. As the story progresses, the jokes decrease in originality and I lose any interest in any conflict that may occur during the episode. Such a shame.\\n\\n\r\nNothing wrong with the art style. Not ugly, yet not really revolutionary. I don't consider this to be a problem, so that is why it is an eight out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is so-so. It isn't really notable, however the opening song is extremely catchy.\\n\r\nThe voice actors really suit their roles well and they never fail to deliver their lines with the enthusiasm a show like this requires. No problem here.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are unique cliches. Okay, let me explain. They originally came of as interesting characters, like how one of them was bullied and that another one mysteriously saved them - without knowing their identity - then later they befriend each other without the knowledge of previously met. That was an interesting concept and could of been developed - and maybe it did. However, then they revert back to normal perverted teenage mode, cracking some bland joke. They eventually mix into the background and are easily forgettable. Comedy should not mean shit characters. It is not an excuse.\\n\\n\r\nI fairly enjoyed the first four or so episodes of the show. Then, when the writers began to run out of ideas, they repeated jokes and after a while, brought back characters that you really don't care about - not like you CAN care about any of the cast at all. After I saw this, I quit the show seven episodes in with a sick feeling in my stomach. I wanted this to be enjoyable, and it was for a small amount of time, but then it spiraled into numbness and cliche-land.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do not recommend this to anyone who likes to see stories with comedy but isn't drowned out by it. If you want a fun anime and if you can get over repetition easier than myself, then this show is for you.",

            "content": "Feel like a break (from your very normal day) but can't afford a Kit-Kat? You might find Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou the perfect quick fix for a little high-school humour. Or if you're a girl like me and find silly high-school boy antics and bro-talk strangely funny, then you will most probably find yourself laughing your way through it and foregoing most of a day's work to watch the rest of the episodes.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nWell for starters, there isn't much of a plot. If anything, the story is all about high school boys living out their regular high school life, hence the title. But gosh, theseboys are hilarious! They decide to do some very random things with their friends: impersonations, pretending to be cool to girls, wierd themed games, escaping crazy sisters and planning \"how to be the best bro\" strategies. Each episode is a collection of around 3-4 mini stories about the boys (in a group or individually) going through some boy-ish dilemma or the other, and each of them, whilst being totally random and unrelated, is really fun to watch! I will admit, after a while (by the time you get to episode 7 or so) you can start to see a pattern with the jokes and it can be pretty predictable, but still worth watching. There are also high-school girl dilemmas tacked on the end of each episode, but to be honest, I'm not really loving those as much as the high-school boy dilemmas.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way it is slightly annoying that there isn't much of a development in terms of the story throughout the anime. But the collection of jokes is quite easy to watch episode after episode, and there's no need to remember any important details because of the random construction of the story. And whilst you may be thinking \"So is that it, I'm watching a collection of boy jokes??\": well, yes and no. On a slightly deeper level, you do get an insight into the theme of brotherhood throughout the series. There's a distinct ways boys act when they're together as bros, which keeps the overall story together in one piece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe three main characters that recur in the show are Tadakuni (possibly the most normal boy out of the three), Hidenori (is ostensibly cool, but really the strangest bro in the group and comes up with the craziest plans) and Yoshitake (equally as silly as Hidenori, but on the slightly dumb side). These boys spend a lot of time together as friends, and they get up to some crazy things as high-school boys. Throw in a host of classmates, the boys' school council, some sisters and a random girl reading by the river side, and there you have the ingredients for a good mix of stories: from sibling wars, to culture festival competitions and, of course, the random \"romantic\" exchange of conversations at the river side! I love the eccentricity of the characters, mainly because half the humour of the show comes from their stupidity! However, don't expect to see too much character development or romance from this show, it's purely focused on giving us snippets of the boys' lives. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nPretty average considering I'm normally the type for cutesy/pretty shouju style art, but I guess simple art works for this type of anime. Gotta love the crazy facial expressions on the boys faces when they're in the middle of an important scheme, does crack me up!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nSame as the art, it works, so it's good I guess.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nNormally I do like watching a series with depth and development, but Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is a refreshing change if you just want something to laugh about. It is simply humour, and yes the jokes get random sometimes, but overall I found it was a fun little break from my normal routine, particularly because the episodes are so short!\\n",

            "content": "I'll just come out and say from the top that Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou aka. The Daily Lives of High School Boys might be the best comedy I see from 2012. It's off-the-cuff type comedy skits is quite similar to an anime of a similar name (Nichijou). Although, the one thing I can say is this series is a little more grounded to reality than Nichijou was, and I say that as liberally as I can. Nevertheless, it's quirky, fragmented skit comedy bits are becoming a pretty popular trend of late in anime comedies. \r\nAs far as the plot is concerned, it's pretty self-explanatory withit's title. It's about the life of a group of high school boys at an all-boys school. It primarily focuses on a group of three close friends, Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake and their everyday, yet unsual experiences in high school. However, many of the supporting characters including Motoharu, Yasunori, and Mitsuo share a good deal of screen time as well. Generally speaking, there isn't a real strong narrative about these characters but the situational writing about them was fantastic. I was pretty amazed at how diverse some of the topics were covered, one of my personal favorites being the \"role-playing\" and the awkward conversations between Hidenori and Yassan on the river bank. \\n\\n\r\nThe best aspect about this series was it's script writing and voice actor performance. I cannot applaud Shinji Takamatsu enough for his work on this series. He's a very experienced director but this was only his second script and he did not disappoint. The dialogue was downright hilarious and truth be told, the casting was perfect for his writing. The one performance that caught my attention the most was Tomokazu Sugita's performance as Hidenori. My God, this was one of the funniest performances I have ever seen in my life. The way Tomokazu and Kenichi Suzumura (Yoshitake) worked off each other was great. I could get a sense from the performance that these two really enjoyed their roles and interactions with each other. \\n\\n\r\nI found the weakest aspect of the series was it's conclusion. What's quite strange is I found the final episode to be quite charming. However, by the time the episode was over, all the charm was thrown to the wayside in the final few minutes of the anime for an opportunity to setup a potential second season that we will more than likely never see. I found that to be a bit of a cop out for Shinji Takamatsu to pull that ending, and I hate saying that because I loved his writing and directing for the series. He really didn't have to do that and considering the nature of the series, he could've just stuck with the ending he had laid out in front of him instead of just say \"nevermind, pretend this never happened and we'll continue the series later.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can honestly say I am glad I checked out this series because it felt like it went by fast. By the time it was all said and done, I was begging for more brilliantly-written off-the-cuff bits. It made this series a blast to watch. If there was one comedy I had to recommend to anyone from 2012, this would be it.",

            "content": "Okay this is my first review, and my first review is going to be on one of my favourite anime of all time, the daily lives of high school boys. Just as a quick notice I'm going to keep all of my reviews short, so don't expect a long essay on why this series is one of the best anime in existence. Anyways lets get on with the review, and we'll start off by talking about the:\r\nStory:\r\nOkay so the story is by far the weakest part of the show, but that's what I expected going into this show so it didn't bother me that much.There is no over arching plot, because it's basically just and episodic slice of life. But anyways the story is kind of mediocre so I'll just leave it at that.\\n\r\nRating: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art done by Sunrise (one of my favourite anime studios) is great and I really love the simplicity of it. The art kind of fits with the comedic elements of the show and the animation in my opinion is also great. The character designs look more like wester cartoons than anime in my opinion, but not the kind that will make you think it's not anime, if you know what i mean. But to sum it up I love the art and animation in this show.\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOkay it's been a while since I watched so I really only remember the opening and ending, not the full soundtrack. So I can only really review it based on that. The opening had a good song and decent animation, but in my opinion it can be a little misleading. The opening is quite serious and makes this show seem like a serious show, when it's the complete opposite. The ending on the other hand was very silly which fit more with the shows mood and tone. \\n\r\nRating: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are very memorable and I liked all three of the main characters, I even liked most of the side characters as well. The friendship between the main three characters was amazing and all the situations they would get into would always make me laugh. I don't know whether to class this as a spoiler but a little but into the show Tadakuni (one of the main three) kinda just disappears from the show, like they forgot about him or something, I always thought it was weird. But I loved pretty much every character in this show.\\n\r\nRating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I said at the start of the review this is one of my favourite anime of all time, so of course I enjoyed a lot. It made me laugh on several occasions and the running gags never really got old, unlike most running gags in anime. This show was genuinely funny and manged to rival Gintama in it's comedy.\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI love this show and most of the episodes. But if I were to point out any flaws it would be the disappearance of Tadakuni and the fact that there wasn't really much of a plot. Overall this is a great show and I definitely reccomend it to others.\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 10/10\\n",

There's nothing complicated going on, there's just high-paced, over the top gags all the time. This author will always be one of my favorites, his newer manga is similar to this in comedy but better. There are a lot of laugh out loud moments to have here, unless you're the type that can't appreciate this type of comedy. It offers what it promised and never changes, which is great. It's also one ofthose relatively rare stories that actually works better in anime than manga format thanks to the voices and great, vibrant energy that is hard to convey in manga format.\\n\\n\r\nOh, it's not childish either, in case anyone wondered. Everyone just has different senses of humor, some people can't appreciate certain types of comedy, hell, everyone has things that others find hilarious but you find to be childish or stupid that you pretty much cringe at.",

This anime has 12 episodes, and each episode is divided into 5 or 6 sub-episodes. The main focus of the anime is on the daily and mundane life of us boys and the humiliating but hilarious situation that is faced by them now and then. The anime doesn\u2019t have a definite plot. Its main focus is on 3 friends, Tadakuni, Hidenori and Yoshitake, their high school class mates and their sisters. The anime also featuressome \u201cI don\u2019t even know who the hell they are\u201d girls at the prologue; they call that extra sub-episode, \u201cHigh school girls are funky\u201d. But somehow, even in this bizarre world of normal life of this anime has successfully delivered Comedy as much as its normal plot could get them too.\\n\\n\r\nWeakness: This anime is quite good, but still it has three major weaknesses.\\n\r\n1) The anime doesn\u2019t have a plot development. So, by the end of anime this plot gets to nowhere and it finishes just suddenly. That\u2019s one of the major weaknesses of the anime.\\n\r\n2) This anime dropped one of its protagonists, Tadakuni, for at least 4 episodes; which is unforgivable. As we know already, that it\u2019s a must for any kind of anime, to feature its protagonist at least once.\\n\r\n3) The anime, by the end of 6 episodes, keeps on adding new characters for no reason, but doesn\u2019t considers featuring its main character.\\n\\n\r\nRating: Thanks to its comedy and moments which made me say, \u201cHey! It happened to me once.\u201d This anime gets 7 out of 10 from me.",

The anime doesn't even take itself serious. A anime serie about 3 boy's having their daily life at school. A comedy slice of a life. And boy it is so funny. \r\nStory. \r\nWait wut? Is there astory in this anime?  Not really. You could consider this show is filled with sketches. Short story's with a funny ending. Then the next sketch jump's in. But in overall as the title suggest's. This is about the daily life as schoolboy's. And nothing more actually. That's why i give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt. \\n\r\nThe art is fitting well. The faces they use in this anime as just so funny and pretty unique. I give this an 8. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music is one of the factor's making the anime so great. You instantly know what kind of scene come's up when a certain melody start's to play in the background. I don't see that often that music has a big influence on a serie. And i deserve's a nice 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's. \\n\r\nI can't say much about them. They are boy's. And boy's do stupid thing's. The way how they react at certain situation's is just perfect. I couldn't think about a better cast for this story then these boy's.  The only thing what i was missing is the lack about information them. Even thnough like i stated earlyer. They often talk about the creater's of this anime. So it shouldn't be taken that serious. Here's a 8! Please don't eat it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nI like to laugh. And that's the only thing this serie focusses on. Making the viewer of this serie laugh. And they succeeded. I can't say much more then that they deserve a 9. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nNo plot. Nothing serious. Just sit back and laugh. That's what this serie is. And they did an awesome job. Well done Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. If you guy's ever come back as 'the daily live's of employer's'' i would watch that for sure. Here's a 8 !",

For some of the jokes I didn't get, I don't think there was anything to get.\r\nSome of my favorite moments are when this anime would break the 4th wall. I love it when they also make fun of other Anime. There is one part where I remember they are all running. And someone makes ajoke like you can only run late to school with a piece of toast in your mouth, while another character is eating fondo with a full tray of dipping options. This is so funny and is completely my style of humor. \\n\\n\r\nI also find it very interesting that even though I am an American, the Japanese culture and people can still have a similar style of humor. \\n\\n\r\nI have no doubt I will re watch this anime again.",

Each episodes contain multiple segments (sketches) so that the jokes are short, yet funny, and it'll make a greater impression because it'll never get old. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend this anime!",

            "content": "Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, or Daily Lives of High School Boys in English, follows the adventures (if they can truly be called that) of a cohort of high school boys (and girls!) over the course of twelve episodes. Each episode is broken into several skits, ranging from a minute to around five to seven, with most skits being build up to punchlines (or, later on, meta-satire of this formula) and with a select few forming coordinates on a singular plot line (one of which continues throughout the series to a very heartfelt conclusion).\r\nThe entire series is done in a very playful manner, and as suchis a complete joy to watch. It is consistently funny while maintaining a disarmingly human element. When the series ended, to my surprise, I found myself actually very attached to the characters, something that isn't usual for comedic shows such as this where character development takes a backseat to developing caricatures that are easily re-arranged for comedic potential. It's definitely a series worth the small time investment it will take and serves as a wonderful palette cleanser that will weasel its way into your heart and mind if you give it just one shot.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] - 7\\n\r\nThe story of the series is pretty much what you would expect from the title: what a bunch of high school boys do. Topics range from girls to schoolwork to mysteries to social interactions to conflicts with peers to pranks and more. What is simultaneously great and not-so-great about the series is its willingness to eschew narrative for fun. I say this is great because it adds a lot of variety and allows the characters to interact very organically when the macrocosm of a lengthy plot isn't factored in. Unfortunately, it also makes some connections lack substance, and this is made even more acute by how great some connections are. In short, I'm conflicted, because a story-heavy series just wouldn't suit the tone that's being gone for here, but the two or three very touching long-term developments are good enough to leave me wanting more.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] - 8\\n\r\nThere isn't much for me to say about the art. It is well-done, characters are easily distinguished and all have very good design. The tropes brought in from other anime are always showcased beautifully and in ways that are very faithful to the original incarnations. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound] - 8\\n\r\nThe sound here is great. I'm not too partial to the opening or closing credits, but the sound really reverberates in the world and meshes with themes well. In more slowed-down segments, the music complements, instead of overshadowing or cheapening, moments of emotional vulnerability. In the much more prevalent humorous portions, the quirkiness of the music gets along fine.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] - 8\\n\r\nThis goes along with story for me and is very important in my analysis of any major piece of narrative art. All the characters are given very specific personalities (save a few student council members who seem to languish in victimhood to the inability of a twelve episode sketch show to really flesh them out in meaningful ways) that carry through and inform a lot of choices of which sketches to place them in. There are frequent interludes in otherwise laugh-a-minute episodes that really show off some unique features and reflections from most of the major characters. Overall, even though I don't think I know any of the characters exceptionally well, I connect to them as I watch them in action.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] - 9\\n\r\nThe series is extremely easy to pick up, has a fantastic pace to it at almost all times, and is always sure to leave one teaser for later expansion on a topic per episode to reward those who continue immediately. The combination of other factors along with its genuine hilarity and likable characters make it an obvious pick for one of the most enjoyable TV series I've ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it. If you're looking for a short series to cleanse from a longer, more intricate anime or something you can pop in and rewatch a couple times for laughs, or if you're looking for an amazing pastiche of anime tropes and reversals, this is your series.",

There's a lot of random jokes and gags which makes me lovethis anime more. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great. i don't know what to say because they are hilarious. I was laughing for all twenty something minutes of the episodes, and despite having watched this anime several times, the jokes will most probably leave you in tears. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound  is exceptional; look for the soundtrack as well. The characters' voices really fit them well and the sound effects are really good as well. \\n\\n\r\nI think you would be able to tell, from this review that I truly and genuinely recommend this anime. 10/10 or maybe even 11/10 \\n",

            "content": "Sick of the 'Girls Do Nothing' shows that seem to permeate the anime market? Want some comedy and snark in your Slice-of-Life? Well you're in luck cause Daily Lives of High School Boys is the show for you! \r\nStory (8/10): Since this is a slice of life/comedy show, there's just about as much plot as you can expect. The basic premise is that we follow around 3 somewhat normal high school boys (Tadakuni, Yoshitake, and Hidenori) as they go through\u2026their daily lives. Though really, this show bounces around the fairly large cast after a few episodes. \r\nReally, beyond that there aren't many connecting stories orplots (being an adaption of a 4-koma manga, this is pretty normal), though there are a couple of carry over jokes and literally one or two stories that seem to creep up every now and then. (I can basically count them on 4 fingers.) Otherwise it's just some good random fun.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): The art style for the show was pretty good, staying consistent throughout. The colors are bold and everything looks good. If there is one problem, it's that the boys will tend to blend in together unless you know which character is which, since about 80% of them have similar faces and hairstyles.   \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): This is probably the first anime in a while that I remember most of the incidental music of. Seriously, every song that's played here is so ear worm-y that once they enter you brain, you'll hum along each time they pop up in the show. And that's not to say the OP and ED are slackers, either. While the opening Shiny Tale is good, I was much more entertained by the ending Ohisama. Seriously, that ending is horribly addictive (plus it's set to one of the most bizarre plays I've ever seen). Really, I don't think that there was a bad song to be found here at all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10): All the boys in this show are hilarious, and I mean all of them in their own way. Of the main 3 boys, Tadakuni is the straight man for everything, Yoshitake is the more random one, and Hidenori is all about the observational humor. The student council are also right up there as the better parts of the show. It just has to be their reactions to everything that happens to them, along with their strange relationship with another council president Ringo. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the big problems, though, is the female characters that appear throughout the show. Pretty much all of them are on one personality mode - BE TSUNDERE WITHOUT THE DERE. I kid you not, the girls in this show are assholes. Granted, I know that teenage girls aren't the paragons of sweetness (well aware of that, thank you), but we aren't crazy violent idiots. It's one of the jokes that just falls flat every time I see it. It was funny when it was one or two girls, but after episode 7 and every girl was characterized like this, it became ANNOYING. The only girls that seem free from this are Yassan (or Literature Girl) Ringo, mentioned above (well\u2026sometimes), and Harada. Yassan is just set up for jokes really well, Ringo is oblivious to stuff, and Harada is the straight ma- girl to her own set of friends. While they saved me from hating my own gender in this show, it's still a huge miss for me.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): If you want dry, sarcastic humor, this is the show for you. I cracked up at the majority of the jokes and always felt entertained by what was going on onscreen. While I disliked some of the characters, there were some that I really loved (Hidenori, Yassan, and Tadakuni became my favorites). There are some hit or miss things in the show, but I still had fun watching it.\\n\\n\r\nDaily Lives of High School Boys is another entry into the 4-koma/slice of life genre, but one that definitely sets itself apart. With a fun cast, dry humor, and good music, the show has something for all anime fans. While the female cast (and their subsequent jokes) is VERY hit or miss, it's not a deal breaker in the quality of the experience. This is definitely recommended for 4-koma and comedy fans, as well as those who want a full male cast doing random things instead of girls (though if you can't stand the tsundere with extra violence type girls, I'd be a little cautious).    \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8.6/10",

            "content": "Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is the definition of a school, comedy, SoL story and this is why it's so great. It doesn't try to take a new direction, it stays true to what it is. You can see alot of anime you get bored after the first episodes, because they're going in a totally new way than in the beginning, but you won't feel anything like that here (little spoiler: only that the later episodes have less major events).\r\nCharacters: You won't get characters that need development first. You get fleshed out characters who mostly speak through their own actions of who they are, yet youstill won't feel like an outsider, something you don't see most of the times. They don't try to be memorable or anything, even the anime tells you that you don't have to remember their names, yet you will still do after a couple of episodes and man, do they still become memorable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's pretty much a basic anime artstyle that doesn't differ from what is supposed to be \"general\" and that's what makes this good. Alot of anime nowadays try to adapt unique artstyles, you don't know how to feel about, and alot of times, you may feel like it doesn't even fit.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I can't really say too much about that, I didn't really follow what I heard and I don't remember any memorable tracks here (aside from the OPs and EDs), but I always felt like they have the right tracks for the situations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is maybe something you feel like alot of people just let it rot in their \"Plan to Watch\" list, but when they pull it out, most just can't put into words how great it is. Yeah, some jokes are pretty hit or miss, but it's pretty subjective on this point. All I can say is, it's worth the watch if you can appreciate humor that doesn't rely on references and stuff.",

            "content": "At its best, it's a really good school comedy! The problem is that it spends too much time on the wrong stuff. \r\nTo me, the student council and High School Girls parts were never that funny, and somewhere around half the show is made up of those skits. It's a little tiring, and especially disappointing because the parts about the main boys are almost invariably funny. \r\nIt'll sound way too negative if I say the show peaked in its first episode, but most of the Best Moments I had seen around online came from the beginning of the show, and then it diverges into somemostly unfunny side stories. The best parts are when they stay true to the original premise of just some high school boys living high school lives.\\n\\n\r\nFor a slice of life comedy, the art and animation are serviceable, but the horrible ending theme took away from my overall enjoyment. The voice acting was great though.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, poor Tadakuni. He's the protagonist and doesn't even appear in half of the episodes. \\n",
