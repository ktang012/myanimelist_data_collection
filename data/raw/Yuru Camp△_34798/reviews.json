            "content": "\u201c\u00a1 One for all, hole in one!\u201d \u2014Nadeshiko Kagamihara\r\nYuru Camp is one of the gems from the season. Who could have guessed a camping series would be fun, refreshing, and very entertaining? Also, no matter how you are feeling, after each episode you will end with a big smile on your face. Yuru Camp isn\u2019t about cute girls doing cute things. It is about how to enjoy simpler situations and how to maintain the proper mood and be happy under any circumstance. More important, the series irradiates that sensation to all the spectators. These girls give us a funny and delightful gem and will stayin our memories for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is straightforward and easy to follow, it is fun, fresh and entertaining to watch. It focuses on camping. Yes, I envision the same thing you\u2019re thinking: camping, are you kidding me? How can you have a plotline about camping? It must be a fiasco. However, Yuri Camp is not dull, from a common event like camping, the authors create an amusing narration where all the characters take pleasure in camping. Keep in mind that maybe you want to go camping with your friends after the series because the characters\u2019 commitment is plausible, delightful and absorbing. The message given to the audience through the story\u2019s simplicity is enjoying the moments of life.\\n\\n\r\nAs a starting point, the pacing is perfect, and the way how all the characters are involved is pretty clever. It is remarkable seeing the correlation and the chemistry between them, no matter if they appear in the scene for few seconds, their actions complement the setting, and you don\u2019t feel them wasted. Every character has a different personality that boosts the dynamic through the storyline and embodies the meaning of friendship. Another notable aspect, the trust. Would you camp with someone you do not trust? The series enrich the plot with those values and propels them in each episode. For example, Rin likes camping alone, but she starts enjoying her time with Nadeshiko and considers her as a friend. Since they are a group of \u201cbuddies,\u201d they share their tastes (food, hobbies, fun). Also, the story maintains the realism and gives tips about camping. This small world is full of comical events and funny jokes executed at the perfect moment ingeniously. Look Nadeshiko, she may seem to be childish, yet she is very energetic, and she uses that side of her personality to be humorous. Just with her behavior, the characters seem flashy and feel happy. All this is possible because the authors care about the pacing and the story.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, some spectators believe the series doesn\u2019t have a plot, so they consider the show boring. The simplicity of the narrative can be measured in the course of action and the mood while camping. How many of us have at least camping once in our lives? If it was a gratifying experience then this show will bring memories and forgotten desires, perhaps you could end remembering some of your old friends. This series demonstrates that every action, no matter how insignificant is, it would make our existence happier and enjoyable. For me, seeing how these characters admire a landscape, it is very remarkable. Maybe it is a clich\u00e9, but that easiness is what we call having a good time. Lastly, I have not found any negative aspect of the show. Nothing is perfect, yet the anime covers some basic ideas such as friendship, trust, passion, joy, and boosts them in a very entertaining way. Yuri Camp\u2019s beauty lies in its simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nWe have five characters in the story. The most noticeable Is Nadeshiko because she is the one that which gathers the rest of the cast together, and she is the central point for most of the jokes. Nadeshiko is very energetic and blissful. She loves eating, and we can consider her a thrilled girl. The other main character, Rin. In the beginning, she enjoys camping alone, but Nadeshiko\u2019s influence may change her. Rin has more camping experience than the others.\\n\r\nThe remaining characters add fluency to the story. Aoi and Chiaki, they are the members of the Outdoor Activities Club. Thanks to Nadeshiko the club continues with the activities and start to plan camping meetings. Lastly Ena, she always mocks Rin. Something I notice is the lack of a detailed background, but the plot works very well without it. You only need to know they like camping and the rest will come from their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are good. One exciting part is how they care about the landscapes. It is a plus because most of the scenes are outside. The camera angles and the camera movement focus on the main characters. Also, the color palette is very vivid and catch the attention of your eyes. However, the character\u2019s design is standard compared with other series; it goes well with the simplicity of the plot. Regarding the sound, the score fills the moments and the jokes. It isn\u2019t bad. Although, sometimes you don\u2019t notice it because it is standard. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are great. I love those two songs. The lyrics and the rhythm work very well and are very catchy. Honestly, I hummed the OP for a whole day. I am getting crazy. =( \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the combination between a simple and a fluid narrative, good characters, attractive art design, right sound, creates a delightful story called Yuru Camp. I like the show, I want a second season but maybe isn\u2019t going to happen, yet it was a hilarious ride. You must give this anime an opportunity.  \\n",

            "content": "I think that sometimes, to relax, we need to explore other unusual places, almost exotic, to realize how the nature around us is so exceptional. That's what Yuru Camp is trying to demonstrate. We don't always need awesome things like explosions, magic powers to make an interesting show. \r\nStory: Yuru Camp focuses on a theme: camping. We follow the daily life of Shima Rin (nicknamed Shimarin) who goes camping regularly on her days off. She meets the happy Nadeshiko who knows nothing about camping. After a little conversation and a delicious dinner in front of the incredible Mount Fuji, Nadeshiko develops a taste for camping.\r\nThosetwo girls attend the same high school. Nadeshiko also meets Aoi and Chiaki, two girls who formed the camping club. The latter is not so successful and has little budget. As for Shimarin, she prefers to go camping alone. \\n\\n\r\nThis is how the girls of the club will progressively be prepared for their adventure. Buy the equipment, the food necessary to spend a night in the mountains. Since we are in a cold period of the year, they also make sure they have the means to warm up. This is not always easy since the club doesn't have a lot of budget and must be satisfied with their tent costing 980 yen.\\n\r\nIt's fun to see what means they will use to do their first camping. The anime does a great job explaining in detail the different types of existing materials and the tasty dishes to cook when we go camping. it is really trying to convey to us the passion of its characters for camping. I honestly understand why Nadeshiko and her friends are so motivated.\\n\\n\r\nShimarin travels alone (over hundreds of kilometers) to discover the sublime landscapes and peaceful places in the prefecture. The girls will make a lot of use of the instant messaging system. Each of them will send a photo to show her the places she visited or banalities. This is how the relationship between characters will progress (especially between Shimarin and Nadeshiko) and finally allow them to go together all together, later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship is essentially based on the unsaid. We feel that Shimarin is someone who is used to being alone, whether in high school or camping. Her chance meeting with Nadeshiko will change things and allow her to share her passion with other friends of the same age.\\n\r\nSometimes she doesn't seem disinterested enough (except when she sees dogs) but in her heart, she really wants to have a good time with her new friends. For example, when Aoi will propose to go camping together. She refuses at first even if we can perceive a touch of regret in her words. Shimarin is usually mature, calm and resourceful.\\n\r\nAt the exact opposite, Nadeshiko behaves like a child (although she uses some old expressions) but she is sociable and always ready to go on an adventure with her friends.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, the landscapes are absolutely sublime, really. They would be ideal for wallpapers. These different places impressed me and I was fascinated by their realistic appearance. C-station studio isn't known to me but I will remember that excellent work. We can notice the use of CGI when Shimarin drives his moped.\\n\r\nThe vocal performances perfectly transpose the personality of our characters. Nadeshiko has an often playful voice, while Shimarin has a duller voice. The opening theme \"Shiny Days\" is catchy and the ending matches the relaxed atmosphere of the series.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is one of the highlights of the series. It is reminiscent of Celtic folk music. Tateyama Akiyuki has really captured this peaceful atmosphere with his OST. Honestly, it's a delight, and I can't wait to listen to them in a flac version. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the series has clearly exceeded my expectations. It is an excellent iyashikei with a relaxing autumn/winter atmosphere in Yamanashi that will make you smile regularly. The friendship between our cute characters is touching. Laid-back Camp is a success.",

            "content": "Another edition to the endlessly growing roster of \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d anime.  I definitely know a certain SOMEONE who would love this show. \r\nSo what is Yuru Camp\u25b3? (Yes, you have to have the little tent). In English, the title is \u201cLaid Back\u201d Camp, and that honestly couldn\u2019t be more appropriate. It\u2019s about a group of girls that form a camping club at their school, and spend their breaks doing just that; camping. There\u2019s relaxing atmosphere, friendly humor, and tranquility. \r\nSo, being that it\u2019s this kind of Slice of Life, the story certainly means to be casually presented. It\u2019s a ripe candidatefor those days where you do nothing but sit back, eat snacks, and refuse to care about anything else for at least 24 minutes of runtime (288 if you just watch the whole thing in one go, which is acceptable to me, being only a 12 episode show). \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the show is bad, I really don\u2019t think that\u2014but if you wanted something profound, look elsewhere. Yuru Camp\u25b3 is a show for the people who appreciate calm, happy presentations of friendship, hobby exploration, and overall contentment. There\u2019s nothing but smiles to be had, but it does it in a way that is neither over the top nor painful. We can find joy in how smoothly the anime incorporates naturalistic imagery alongside comfortable music and some pretty adorable characters. \\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the characters in the show are completely defined by their love of camping and their girlish charm. Again, I just cannot stress enough that this story is not trying to be anything more. They don\u2019t need to be deeply complex for this type of thing; they serve the experience well enough with just having well-defined archetypes. Still, while I wouldn\u2019t call this a detractor, it\u2019s scoring no points\u2014it breaks even. The story has little going for it other than the demeanor with which it's shown... they camp. That's honestly, really all it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is honestly wonderful, though. The colors are defined and the motion flows so much better than a lot of other shows that you\u2019d be entirely forgiven for coming to Yuru Camp\u25b3 for how it looks and the way it makes you feel. You definitely won't find much else.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tConsistently relaxing atmosphere. \\n\r\n-\tCamping tips and knowledge are pretty prevalent throughout, to the point where I learned a few things I didn\u2019t know before, and was appreciative that they had been taught to me through a decently entertaining show. \\n\r\n-\tI can\u2019t honestly say it\u2019s really boring, parts of the show did make me chuckle at times and I appreciated the camaraderie amongst the characters.\\n\r\n-\tWOW that opening. And ending. The music in this show is phenomenal, as is the animation.\\n\\n\r\nMIXED: \\n\r\n-\tIt does nothing new, yet does nothing wrong. It loses no money, yet makes no money. In business we call this \u201cbreaking even.\u201d \\n\r\n-\tHardly more emotions to be found other than pure joy and quiet peace. Also, some silliness here and there.\\n\r\n-\tIt\u2019s pretty much unspoilable. You can take this in two ways \u2013 one, that the show has no story; or two, the show presents a \u201cunique\u201d type of story. Both are acceptable descriptors. \\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tThis is yet another one of those shows where cute girls do cute things, and it seems like they only exist for the explicit reason of camping every week. There\u2019s no depth to be seen, and while I didn't hate them, being archetypes is nothing to celebrate. \\n\r\n-\tSometimes the series watches like an advertisement for various products and campsites around Japan, and honestly, I expect that this is exactly what it is. \\n\\n\r\nUpon writing this review, I discovered that this anime is based on a manga, and I couldn\u2019t be less surprised. According to my Japanese friends, who I\u2019ve spoken to about anime and manga quite extensively, manga is pretty damn popular in Japan, and there are manga for virtually everything and everyone. So it comes to me as no surprise that there\u2019s a manga exclusively about real camping locations, ways to camp there, and little else other than cute girls\u2014it would be something that a bunch of kids pick up at the market on the way to their OWN camping trip to read before they snooze off or right after dinner. Simple, inoffensive, and quite adorable at times. \\n\\n\r\nBut is it any more? \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think so. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The sun is setting. The cold breezes that brushed through the yellow-green grass just a few minutes earlier have left the plains. In front of a small camping tent, Rin is comfortably seated in a folding chair, reading a book. A while has passed and she decides to put down her warm cup of cocoa, close her book and stretch; a puff of breath turns into a small cloud and slowly fades away. She looks at her surroundings: a huge, empty field of grass, a small forest and a clear view of a Mt. Fuji tinted in a friendly pink. Rin is on another ofher lonesome weekendly winter camping trips. During the coldest season, she fancies spending some time alone in the quiet areas of Japan\u2014on camping sites usually uncrowded during the winter. \\n\\n\r\nDuring her trips, she spends a lot of time exploring the camping grounds; in midst of beautifully drawn, colorful sceneries, she follows intricately painted pathways in search for the stunning sights of an everyday beauty of nature perfectly evoked by the show\u2019s wonderful visuals. Whether she ends up exploring the campsites, the colorful forests of early winter, taking pictures of funny-looking statues or just sitting in her chair relaxing, it doesn\u2019t really matter; she just wants to spend some time on her own enjoying nature. Apart from camping, she doesn\u2019t have any predominant interests or hobbies, and while she does truly love her friends and enjoys spending time with them, this pastime is something she truly needs: a breather, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nIt comes as no surprise when she turns down an invitation to join her school\u2019s camping club; it\u2019d go against the purpose of her camping trips. And really, that\u2019s completely okay. Her friends understand. While they may not truly grasp her feelings, they respect her desire to camp on her own without pressing further. This comes as kind of a surprise initially: in general, the members of the camping club are very energetic and gung-ho; seeing these characters which one might initially pass off as everyday anime idiots act like sensitive, genuine human beings and friends is truly, truly refreshing. Rin and them couldn\u2019t be more different: Chiaki and Aoi often indulge in weird jokes or pranks, and while their love for camping is definitely genuine, so is their aversion to spending even a single penny on actually acquiring necessary utensils. Nadeshiko on the other hand is very much a simpleton\u2014a hyperactive, hyperhappy and hyperhungry simpleton. It\u2019s not only the members of the camping club who differ from Rin (whose camping trips aren\u2019t as quiet and calming as Rin\u2019s); the three horse around and have fun. Instead of appreciating the quiet and nature, they just want to spend time and camp together as a group of friends.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the cast and the camping trips covering such a wide spectrum, the otherwise rather monotonous-sounding activity of winter camping can offer a variety of different, but always pleasant and comfy experiences. And while Rin and her friends may be apart when camping (well, most of the time), they are never out of touch: during their camping trips they regularly message or call each other and send the others photos of the camping sites they visit. They indulge in mindless but fun chats about food or the weather and it feels completely genuine. But not only do these small chats serve to make the character\u2019s relationships feel real, they also help the otherwise standalone camping trip segments connect to the rest of the show to form a cohesive whole; while the general moods of Rin\u2019s camping trips and the camping club horsing around are completely different, they still feel like parts of the same show, not fragments of a greater whole.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t just these small conversations between the group and Rin that creates the feeling of unity between every single scene. Yuru Camp\u2019s soundtrack consists of very few songs which, while usually a negative, works well for what the show is trying to accomplish. The tracks are all very simple, but they sell their respective scenes perfectly through equally simple means: a short, repeated trill in the lead guitar is enough to sell the relaxing camping atmosphere; a change from a dominant guitar to flutes can be mystifying and create a sense of exploration; and a calm vocal song is enough to sell the most intimate of togetherness. It won\u2019t earn any medals or prizes, but the soundtrack does just what it\u2019s supposed to, and that\u2019s just what you want for an equally simple and relaxing show such as Yuru Camp.\\n\\n\r\nBe it Rin\u2019s appreciation for the quiet and nature, the lively and fun friendship of the camping club or their genuine and heartwarming relationships\u2014there is much to love in this soothing show. Yuru Camp may seldom stray off the beaten path, but it doesn\u2019t need to, for it is a comfy and lighthearted experience through and through.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you decide to join in on the fun please keep in mind that while camping\u2026\\n\\n\r\n- Always mind the campsite and facility rules\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t forget to clean up fires and take your trash!\\n\r\n- It gets cold during the winter. Stay warm and be well-prepared!!\\n\r\n- Have fun :)\\n\\n\r\nScore: 75\\n",

            "content": "Sit back, relax, and gaze upon the glory that is Yuru Camp.\r\nTbh I never expected to enjoy a series this much. With all the anime going on on a Thursday, this is definitely a great way to end it. The first episode already captivated me with its amazing soundtrack, character design, and background art.\r\nOur main character Rin, is someone who enjoys camping alone, we see that in episode 1. She's someone who would rather enjoy camping at her own leisure. However, because there are more amazing characters, she soon starts to meet them as well as open up to them more and becomes more social.I appreciate these character interactions because it's so humanlike and it's super sweet and all of them have chemistry with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it ain't just the characters themselves, the background art and colours are super attractive and really compliments the anime very well. There's also the fact that the background art and amazing colours are accompanied by the AMAZING OST. Each soundtrack piece really sets the vibe for each episode and each event that happens within Yuru Camp. Not to mention that GODLIKE OP. I've never heard such a catchier op than this one this season.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, apparently the campsites the girls' go to camp at are actually based on actual locations. I saw a few pictures of it in its real life form and it really looks exactly as the anime shows. It's amazing that these beautiful sites are real places to camp.\\n\\n\r\nSo in short:\\n\\n\r\nStory (8) - Very Simple, Rin who loves to camps meets a new girl who eventually befriends her and enjoys camping along with her in due time. Then more girls show up and then they'll all camp together. A simple yet very well executed story that hits every note right.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9) - Each character looks unique and the colours are well used.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10) - Easily one of the best OST's I've heard and the appropriate timings used of these songs really makes the anime all the better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10) - Each girl carries a beautiful and amazing personality and shows as well as reminds us how cute the CGDCT genre can be. Each girl is lovable and will not disappoint in putting a smile on your face.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) - I've enjoyed each second that Yuru Camp has to offer. I've never got bored of this anime and it was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) - If the goal of this anime was to give you a big smile and show you how girls can camp extremely well, then it does that very well. What can I say, it does everything right in terms of enjoyment, character, soundtracks, and beautiful art.\\n\\n\r\nYuru Camp will always be the anime to end my Thursdays. Now if you'll excuse me, I need some Ramen.\\n",

            "content": "If the only purpose of Yuru Camp was to create a very cute, shallow, flavor of the week moe show, then they\u2019ve succeeded brilliantly. If it attempted to be something more than that, it failed brilliantly.\r\nStory(3): Like most cute girls doing cute things shows, this show has little to offer in the way of story. This is a character driven show about a group of girls making friends and messing around in their club. There\u2019s hardly any conflict at all, the girls simply go about their lives. \r\nArt(6): The character designs do a great job of selling of cutsey part of the show, and doa good job clueing us on their personalities, as one dimensional as they may be. The pink hair girl has to be one of the most satisfying cute girl character designs I\u2019ve seen in a while. I can\u2019t say I remember the backgrounds being particularly notable, though, even in the parts where they are attempting to show off Mount Fuji. The animation isn\u2019t anything special either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(2): A cute girls doing cute things show doesn\u2019t always need to have a plot. They survive and die on the strength of their characters personalities and their relationships with each other. This is where the show really falls short. Each character could easily be summed up in one sentence. When they are put into situations, they interact in the most clich\u00e9 and predictable ways possible. They\u2019re not just laid back, they\u2019re boring.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(3): Because of the lack of thought or effort put into these characters, I found myself getting bored half way through the first episode. I pushed through a couple more because the MAL score here was so far, hoping it got better. It didn\u2019t, only adding more on dimensional characters that the show failed to make me care about.\\n",

            "content": "Camping 101 \r\nStarring: cute girls!\r\nWe\u2019ve had cute girls sailing to Antarctica, (Further than the Universe) cute girls in the apocalypse (Girls\u2019 Last Tour), cute girls singing, dancing, and playing instruments (anime like K-On!, Love-Live! And Hibike! Euphonium), and just cute girls doing nothing whatsoever (Lucky star and Yuyushiki). Now we have cute girls going camping.\r\nIt literally does what it says on the packet. It\u2019s a very relaxed slice-of-life anime about camping, including all the aspects you would expect to see in a camping anime. It goes into great detail about the campsites they visit, the equipment they use (everything from how they buy it tohow they set it up), the food they make (which by the way, looks amazing and will make you hungry if you watch it before eating), and the way they bond through camping together. I learnt enough about camping from this one anime that, assuming I ever wanted to go, I would know exactly how to prepare and what to do.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s nice to watch. It\u2019s very slow paced, each episode generally consists of planning and executing a different camping trip. The art and animation are fantastic; the scenery in particular is drawn absolutely beautifully. All the right colours and tones are used to convey the autumn-like feeling perfectly. The sound also fits the mood of the anime to a T. \\n\\n\r\nThere are five main characters, although the story mainly focusses on two of them. Rin is the silent one who enjoys the peace and quiet of camping alone. She doesn\u2019t tend to socialise much, and this is what makes her friendship with the outgoing and talkative Nadeshiko endearing to watch. You get to know Rin through her actions \u2013 the way her face lights up when she sips a hot cocoa, the way she stares at a gorgeous view like she\u2019s trying to devour it, the way she cares about her friends despite sometimes acting like they\u2019re a nuisance to her. She\u2019s very relatable as a character, and that\u2019s part of why I liked the anime so much.\\n\\n\r\nNadeshiko, as mentioned before, is the talkative one. She\u2019s also the clumsy, energetic and downright adorable one. She\u2019s the type of girl who injects life into the anime, and helps speed up the pace when it becomes too snail-like. Her becoming friends with Rin is essentially the premise of the anime \u2013 they meet by chance on a camping site, and, in the way of anime, find out they go to the same school together. She and Rin are a lot like chalk and cheese; apart from their love of camping they couldn\u2019t be more different. However their friendship blossoms nonetheless, and by the end of the anime they\u2019ve formed a solid relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters are relatively enjoyable to watch, although they aren\u2019t as developed as Rin and Nadeshiko. Aki and Aoi are girls in the same camping club as Nadeshiko, and Ena is a friend of Rin\u2019s who\u2019s persuaded to come along for the ride. Apart from camping, the anime mainly shows them in school, going shopping, working and just hanging out together. Nothing exciting or even particularly interesting, but their interactions are mildly humorous, very light-hearted, and always cute. The series shows how they each react to the camping aspect, and what each of them actually enjoys about camping. For some it\u2019s the peace, for some it\u2019s the food, and for some it\u2019s the companionship. Regardless, after watching this I felt I would probably enjoy camping too for one reason or the other. \\n\\n\r\nNow, although I said this anime was nice to watch, I wouldn\u2019t call it entertaining. It\u2019s more like you feel contented with the world after watching it. I had to be in a certain frame of mind to see it \u2013 when I was in the mood for something fast-paced and thrilling, I watched another anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for something tranquil, something cute and relaxing, this is a good choice. If you\u2019re not, then I\u2019d give this one a miss until you are. XD\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yuru Camp was a strange phenomenon to witness. An anime produced by a newish studio and an inexperienced staff, with a premise that looked about as basic and niche as it could, adapting a fairly unknown manga. Very few people looked forward to this show, and I was certainly not one of them as it didn't look particularly appealing at first.\r\nAnd yet, it remains as the third highest-rated non-sequel show of its season, only behind two series that rely on more visceral and spectacular storytelling (Sora yori mo tooi basho and Violet Evergarden), with heavier themes and mood shifts. It is one of the best-sellingshows of the season as well, increasing manga sales, selling a lot of merchandise and, as of today, tripling the amount of visitors to the campsites located at the Yamanashi Prefecture the series focuses on.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, Yuru Camp is a show about camping. And not even about camping as a side element or room for more potentially exciting character quirks. About camping in itself as an experience, with a cast of characters that develop an interest and are always looking forward to, and grow, and set their focus on the activity. For twelve episodes. With no tension, no character drama, no external elements getting in the way and certainly not a sense of danger or heavy uncertainty. It is strict in what it covers and straightforward in what it wants to evoke.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, that was an advantage to the show. Week after week, this was a safe choice with a clear attached mood that people could get into knowing what they'd expect and the exact kind of reaction they'd get from it. Some people probably didn't like it, but they weren't vocal: it's not the kind of show that can lead to visceral hate. Not having any element that could generate controversy, it was only natural that the series grew through the season with very little negativity around it. The scenario for this backfiring was also clear: after all, what kind of appeal does this harmless fun provide compared with the more spectacular and memorable narratives of emotional struggle in its season?\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard to answer, and yet, it becomes so clear when you are watching it. Selling Yuru Camp is difficult, as one would need to rely on vague statements about its mood. It's quiet, it's soothing, watch it whenever you need to chill. That's it. I could end my review here and it would be the most straightforward recommendation because that is what this show is about: pure and unadulterated calmness and peace of mind. No more no less.\\n\\n\r\nBut that would be too easy and misleading. Because it's not the simplicity and straightforwardness what makes this series work, but an execution that depends on a careful combination of directorial, cast, music and writing choices that shouldn't be dismissed just because the aim of the show is humble and simplistic. It is masterfully crafted in each of these elements and almost nothing in it feels random or inappropriate for the overall mood.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk first about the visual aspects of the show. A lot of things have been said about the sheer beauty and detail of the backgrounds, the use of a subdued color palette that makes everything look more relaxed and soothing, the clever use of lighting and so on. Each episode provides a good amount of wallpaper material and they do a great work at enhancing the beauty of the landscapes. But I would like to focus on something this series really excels at and makes everything work even better from a visually evocative point of view: framing. Yuru Camp is a series about outdoor activities and one of the things it does better at representing their appeal is reflecting with its visual language how vast and surrounding its scenarios are, in comparison with, say, confined rooms. Even more difficult if you take into account that it has to convey these feelings through characters that are part, and are reacting to that environment at that same time. By placing the characters at the right spot of the frame and by showing an astonishing sense of space and depth of field, the series manages to effectively transmit to the viewer a feeling of belonging there, and observing the environment along with, and not separately from the characters. It doesn't feature any particularly elaborate or flashy cinematographic trick but it does everything well in a way that I think very few have. A zoom-out that reveals a wonderful night view, a panoramic shot with the character surrounded by the immense beauty of her environment, a character moving towards the camera to properly reflect the depth of field. It is consistently clever and efficient at this and increases exponentially the appeal of its scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs leave more room for nitpicking. They have rather simple features, some kind of... questionable ones (what is up with those extra thin necks?) and overall they are designs that appeal to a fitting yet standard cutesy style. Past that level of simplicity, the thing is that they are actually very spot on in pretty much everything. They wear mundane and appropriate clothes, and the show has a surprising variety of outfits and styles for each of them. Particularly noteworthy is the big amount of aesthetic choices thrown around the character of Rin throughout the series, that make her quite visually dynamic and even leads to some running jokes with her hairstyles. Either way, I would not like to oversell the complexity of these character designs, since I think part of their appeal and also a very relevant fraction in the visual comedy of the show lie precisely in their simple and recognizable traits.\\n\\n\r\nThese general aspects aside, the show itself has a number of little issues in its visuals that depending on the person and the focus may look more or less serious. The animation in particular. It is clean, fluid and average or above average, always serviceable enough; but there's not much focus on movement and the series can look quite static at times. It has some surprisingly complex and detailed animation but it is not consistent with that and specially in its latter half it abuses montages of static and frozen panning shots instead. The CG animation of the vehicles feels kind of off-putting, even with the attempts of the series to make up for it by focusing on the depth of field of the shot; thankfully none of these moments last very long. However the biggest issue comes with episode 8. It is pretty much universally agreed that this episode is an aesthetic low in the series with clumsy animation and characters going off model way too often throughout.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, at least in my case, the flaws feel so irrelevant compared to all the great visual choices it makes that this aspect of the show remains impressive overall, with only a few occasional nitpicks here and there. What I'd like to emphasize the most here is that the visual language in this series is crucial and it is effectively conveyed with clever decisions and execution. The series manages to nail the cathartic and the mundane equally and is one of the most purely aesthetic anime experiences I've seen. And if you think that my views on the art are too positive, wait for the next section.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Oh, how do I even start with this. It's absolute brilliance from start to finish. The soundtrack is quiet and fluffy, even at its most playful it's just plain laid-back. Entirely instrumental except for the opening and ending, it constantly evokes the atmosphere of relax and uneventful fun that permeates through the entire series. However what truly makes this series stand out in this department is not in the tracks themselves, but in their use in context. It understands the music not as an accompaniment, but as an essential element of its aesthetics and narrative. And this is specially relevant in a season that, overall, did not stand out much in this aspect and took a lot of my nitpicks for otherwise great shows. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Yuru Camp understands so well is that, yes, the music is fitting and sets a mood, but that shouldn't stop you from playing and being active and dynamic with it. You can't expect to play a beautiful song in the background, stop caring, and proceed to focus on the visual narrative and the dialogue, because no matter how good it sounds, it will end up creating an aesthetic dissonance. This series takes its effort to match the images, the frames and the timing of the narration with the soundtrack. It quite often makes use of sudden and accurately timed interruptions for comedic effect, it saves the most emphasized parts of the track for the single moments of catharsis and it perfectly captures the mundane. It knows when to stop and it knows when to start again, what track to use for each moment and how to make proper and emotionally (or comedically) effective transitions. If all of this sounds basic, imagine my frustration while watching other shows in its same season failing to understand this fundamental approach.\\n\\n\r\nAnd damn if it's effective. The love and care put in this aspect of the show is astounding. Heck, if it even went through the trouble of creating a separate and fitting soundtrack for each of the campsite locations. That's some level of dedication out there. Seriously, the music in this show is something else. Even for its generally excellent delivery this is an easy standout.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the aspects of its sound design are also spot on. I love the effects, particularly those used to create atmosphere like the little ambient sounds, the wind breezing... that make the experience more immediate and relatable. As for the voice acting, the series has a very solid cast with a clear standout in Yumiri Hanamori's Nadeshiko. The way she nails the voice of her character, her sounds and her overall performance is essential to make Nadeshiko the cinnamon roll of unadulterated cuteness she is, and to do it with a character that was so easy to drive wrong has a lot of merit. Almost equal in merit and execution is Nao Touyama's Rin, a quiet type that is still perfectly empathic and entertaining to listen to, and knows how to add relatable nuances of emotion to a character that acts cold and restrained towards the rest. The rest of the cast all have fitting voices and add to the overall mood and the comedic effect of the characters, with another favorite of mine being Rie Takahashi's laid-back and playful role as Saitou. The energy of Chiaki and the soothing nature of Aoi are nailed as well and perfectly add to their style of humor. My only nitpick aside from some minor characters having more meh voices is with some little moments of Aki Toyosaki's Aoi. The character seems to have more creative freedom than the rest of the cast when it comes to the way she sounds, and at some points, episode 10 in special, that sort of rubbed me the wrong way.\\n\\n\r\nWith the visual and sound aspects covered, we can move on to the writing. And since this is just cute girls doing cute camping things for twelve episodes this should be fast, right?\\n\\n\r\nRight?\\n\\n\r\nYou know it won't. I'm afraid you have to stay for a little while yet.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest pet peeves with anime criticism is the, in my opinion, excessive reliance on themes. When it comes to a story focused on the mundane, that uses observational and incidental narrative and doesn't focus in a central point, prioritizing in your speech the talk about transcendence and depth of themes is artificial and uncalled for. And I have even seen it with this show. It's not like Yuru Camp doesn't offer valuable insight on certain topics, I'll get there a bit later, but to make it the main point of appeal of the series is, to me, missing the point and applying standards it doesn't aim for. And the solution is not to dismiss the efforts of this show based on the simple immediacy of its premise either, specially if such immediacy is carried through an observant perspective that has its inherent difficulty.\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I bringing this up? Because the writing of Yuru Camp is excellent. It is a definitive standout in its genre, and it is easily the most solid I could find in its season. The way it understands and applies character interactions through its entire run is nothing short of brilliant in its apparent simplicity and naturality.\\n\\n\r\nThe first element I'd like to tackle is the storyline. What I am about to say may sound surprising, but compared to other slice of life shows, I think the pure story aspect in this series is actually quite sophisticated, or perhaps I should say tightly structured. Contrarily to what one could think in a show that lives up to its premise of cute girls camping and having harmless fun, it has a clear narrative with perfect continuity throughout. All the characters undergo some sort of development regarding their interest on camping; some become more profficient, some start to contemplate other alternatives... The point I want to make with this is that in this show the narration is, above all, consequential. It constantly refers to previous events or circumstances, the attachment of the characters grows throughout and this development is kept as a basis for future interactions, both in the bigger picture and in slight and seemingly irrelevant details. This is true for all of them but particularly, as it's the main narrative focus, for the dynamics of Rin and Nadeshiko. Both learn from each other and we see how they gradually form an increasingly close relationship with some relevant transitions that have their emphasis in the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of the show is the experience of camping and the attachment to what it has to offer. Some people have said, not without reason, that the characters and the events are way too focused on camping, and that it is difficult to obtain a bigger picture of them when their lives and conversations are so conveniently reduced to their hobby. This never bothered me personally because I think the running theme of camping is more than enough to create a significant introspection to the characters, particularly because the very nature of this activity leads to a lot of quiet observation and naturalistic depiction, but I can understand this being an issue, particularly if you want to observe the characters in other situations or frames of mind, or if you get bored by the lack of variety of focus.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of its camping themes and focus, it also seems that a common issue among people who either disliked or don't share the enthusiasm for this show lies in the presence of a voiceover narrator who tells things to the viewer, serving as a tutorial for camping and giving advice. This is something I myself feel conflicted about, not because it bothers me personally, but because I honestly don't know how to draw the line and why do I find it acceptable and perfectly fine while other people feel completely unattached when it appears. To me I guess it has to do with how soothing the voice itself is, how it's strategically placed in the narration to avoid unnecessary interference with the natural interactions of the characters, or how at times it plays along with the characters and their mood.\\n\\n\r\nThrough its running theme of camping the show talks as well about friendship and opening up to new experiences. And where it excels at is not so much the inherent complexity of its themes, but the execution and particularly in the amount of right narrative decisions taken throughout to build a conclusion that is constructive and inspiring. One of the greatest merits of the writing in this series is how it never puts the characters in a situation where they are stated to be in the wrong or need to be fixed, despite the obvious contrast in their personalities and approaches. This is specially true for Rin, who is introduced as an introvert and loves camping alone at the beginning, and through the series she develops a liking for camping with people. But the loner Rin is still there for the entire series. And her introversion is not fixed either: it is an essential character trait of her and the other characters respect her boundaries. A good deal of the laid-back atmosphere in this show is achieved through the mutual respect the girls feel for each other. Nadeshiko, the initially hyperactive and potentially invasive personality that would force Rin to change, quickly understands that pressuring her is wrong, and lets her grow at her own pace. At the same time, she learns from Rin too, while not changing a bit of her outgoing and enthusiastic personality. It is very refreshing to see this sort of development, and it speaks volumes not only to the mutual understanding and empathy displayed by the characters, but to the narrative focus itself and the respect the writing shows for their agency and individuality.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they could be defined by basic personality archetypes. As said, Rin is the loner introvert and Nadeshiko the outgoing enthusiast. This is also true for the rest of the characters who all have a set personality and defined traits. While some people have mentioned this as a negative, I don't think Yuru Camp suffers from having characters that meet an archetype or *sigh* \"can be defined in a single phrase\". This is mostly because the writing stays refreshing and keeps finding new ways to explore the set traits of the characters throughout. And above all, it puts a lot of care in their interactions and chemistry together and with the surrounding environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe key word here is spontaneity. Everything in this series is built around this premise. The dialogues are filled with casual banter, they have some exposition here and there without feeling like infodumps, but the conversations feel perfectly down-to-earth and relatable, which is even more fascinating if one takes into account how quirky and differentiable their basic character types are. And as a result of this comes one of the greatest, and probably one of the most unsung, merits of this series.\\n\\n\r\nTake the scene with Saitou drawing a \"funny face\" in Chikuwa's photo. Take the Outdoors Club girls' silly imitations of camping objects and activities. Take the Santa Clangers, the \"intense\" chats between Rin and Saitou, Chiaki the evil kidnapper, Nadeshiko the granny and so on and on and on. There is something relevant around all of these moments. They are funny, but they don't need to. You don't need to find these jokes amusing in order for them to make sense because the ones they need to make sense to are the characters themselves. This lack of pandering is one of the things that put this show above so many of its competitors, particularly in the portrayal of friendships that, like any relationship, have their own codes and only make perfect sense to those who share them. Understanding this and not trying to tell the viewer \"hey, this is funny, that's why they are laughing\" but ultimately transmitting that the characters laugh because they genuinely, and no matter what you think, find this funny, is something I can never praise enough in this show. This is true even for Rin alone and her solitary interactions with her environment, filled with genuine moments of silliness and fun that are presented in the most natural way possible.\\n\\n\r\nA running theme with these girls and their relationships is the use of technology and this is another little aspect that I think deserves to be further emphasized. Where most other narratives either try to establish a contrast or never give enough importance to technology compared to \"real\", face-to-face interactions, Yuru Camp understands and applies both as a continuum of each other. They use their phones to communicate, to have fun together, to organize plans and etc. Rin and Saitou for instance understand each other extremely well, and yet, most of their interactions in the show happen through a phone chat. You don't need to see them together in a room to figure out how strong their friendship and mutual confidence is, and when it happens it only confirms what we already knew. Another example is in the relationship of Rin and Nadeshiko and how they connect deeply with each other even when they are hundreds of kilometers away, to the point that at one scene Nadeshiko literally wants to chat with Rin and serve as a remote travel guide to her solo camping adventure because that way she feels connected to Rin's journey.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least in this talk about characters and writing, going back to the importance of spontaneity, comes the comedy. Now, we all know the issue about comedy so it's not worth mentioning it again. What makes me laugh won't necessarily make you laugh and so on. But I can't deny that I laugh a lot with this series. Maybe even more than I could expect, considering how little it does to try to structure its jokes as, well, jokes. In fact, this may actually work in its advantage and it's absolutely worth mentioning the lack of a consistent straight man routine in this series. Whenever the characters do something silly, they seem to prefer playing along than reacting in disbelief or pointing out where the joke exactly is. As a result, a lot of these comedic moments feel spontaneous and lacking a separated structure, and above all, they don't overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately however, what makes Yuru Camp work and what explains its appeal to me is the synergy of all the individual elements mentioned above. Visual emphasis, soundtrack, character writing and storytelling combine to form a single and inseparable entity, which could only be achieved by putting individual care on each of them but also factoring a clear overall vision. The perfect embodiment of this lies in its conclusion, one of the most solid and appropriate I have ever seen in the medium, and which I don't think could even be possible had the show not been as carefully planned and integrated as it was during its whole run.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWow, this review went a long way. I had a lot of fun writing this, but think I owe you all an apology if you reached this point, specially considering that I haven't even used the word \"comfy\" yet in this review of Yuru Camp. Either way, thanks for taking your time to read this absurdly huge piece of enthusiastic rambling, if you have any feedback or commentary on what I wrote feel free to tell me.",

            "content": "In a part of the medium of anime where school settings are common, Yuru Camp decides to take us to the outdoors, and provides us with a fresh, more rare setting to indulge ourselves in.\r\nA large part of the appeal of Yuru Camp to me and many others is how the activities being shown can all be attempted in real life. This not only leads more people to try outdoor activities, but it allows people like me to relate to the time we spend outdoors. In my case, after many years of camping, hiking, backpacking, and hunting in Oregon, this show brings back memories ofmy childhood spent outdoors and the joys of friendship. With a setting in a show that connects you to an enjoyable part of real life, a whole new level of enjoyment is reached.\\n\\n\r\nAccomponing the story of this show is a comfortable blend of incredible landscape scenes, music, and tremendously cute characters. Many of the landscapes present in Yuru Camp are based upon real life locations in Japan, even the art of this show can bring you to connect with real places! With the art comes the music, which is composed of a relaxing collection of guitars, flutes, and other noises that compliment the story and art perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters, which make or break cute shows like this. There are 2 characters in which the most time is spent on, Rin and Nadeshiko, they are pretty much polar opposites. Rin is calm, independent, and loves to spend time alone, while Nadeshiko is full of energy and finds excitement from everything. When the two spend time together or communicate over texting, you can often see their personalities clash and cause moments that make you smile. The rest of the cast does not see too much time until later on, but still has their fair share of enjoyable moments. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 more minor parts of Yuru Camp that really stood out to me, this would be the traveling, and the food. The traveling by Rin on her moped shows just how independent she is, Rin is able to show us a variety of different dogs and different locations. Additionally, she often communicates with Nadeshiko and other friends by means of texting, these texts are often some of the most hilarious and enjoyable parts, every text is voiced and animated on the entire screen. This approach was unique and adds much enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there is the food. The food in Yuru Camp is yet another part that can be attempted in real life. Food is a major component of camping and Yuru Camp does not shy away from showing that. The entire process of cooking is usually displayed, from the preparation of ingredients all the way to the cute blobs of moe consuming these glorious, steaming Nippon delicacies. The cuteness of the food being eaten is absolutely outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nWith Yuru Camp, you can wash away the stresses of your life and dive into a world of comfort that is never eroded, and once the episodes are over, you can bring the activities to the real world, and you can see that sometimes outside isn\u2019t too bad. If you need some happiness and comfort in your life, Yuru Camp will deliver that, 10 times over.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "[6.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nEver spend the afternoon listening to those lo-fi hip-hop playlists on Youtube? The ones that play a long playlist of relaxing instrumentals over gifs of animated characters either studying, reading, or floating in outer space? If so, then you have probably experienced, through audio, the kind of feeling that Yuru Camp embodies and presents to you. The chirping birds and licking of river water as it wraps around the rocky shoreline. A group of students out at campsites, under no threat, in no danger, with no drama, cooking food for one another and conversing about what they value. The term here is \u201claid-back\u201d, and theshow translates that for its title. \\n\\n\r\nThe series here follows Shima Rin as she camps out in various locations around Mount Fuji, from lakes to open fields. Along the way, she meets Nadeshiko, a spunky, goofy pink-haired girl that has a similar, yet louder passion for camping. Later, we realize they go to the same school and lo-and-behold there is even a camping club, because of course there is, with a few other equally cute girls with a seemingly diehard passion for sleeping in linen huts outside. That\u2019s our story. No less and no more. \\n\\n\r\nFrom here we venture into their day-to-day lives. Without the burden of classes, social interaction, or growth for anyone but maybe Rin towards the end of the series. It really feels like a flatline in the best possible way, I suppose. As in, the line here is \u201ccomfort\u201d and the series encapsulates that comfort as well as it can within the parameters it draws. These parameters being the set locations during the winter in the small vicinity around where these characters live in Japan. It isn\u2019t for everyone but fortunately, it offers a lot to the crowd that really seems attached to the iyashikei presentation with a healthy dollop of feel-good humor. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Camping Under the Stars and Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nFunny faces, chibi inspired designs, and crackling campfires, Yuru Camp isn\u2019t going to blow you away visually. Much like the rest of the series, it often has an air of decentness that you can\u2019t help but acquiesce to after a few episodes roll by without your notice. That\u2019s kind of the charm of it. The character design is serviceable, without many standouts. Each girl has the expected wide pallet of hair-color and generally looks alright. Where the series, and the people making it, clearly put the most thought into was the honestly great variety of outfits worn. Now each one is a variation of winter-clothing, but they were never ridiculous or unbelievable and, throughout the runtime, each episode seemingly had a unique selection of designs to attach to these characters. Good stuff all around, here. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also not anemic, thankfully. The opening is catchy, the closer is quite frankly the best track in the series, and there enough background tunes to keep you engaged and on occasion bob your head to. Similar to those lo-fi hip-hop beats, that kind of melodic, unobtrusive, and relaxing feeling is injected into the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also nothing licentious here. Everything doesn\u2019t feel like it is there to sell sex. While this is something I hate to bring up in every anime I seem to review, it is a problem that just plagues this medium. While this series is easily pandering to a certain crowd, it\u2019s not doing so through sexual means and is never obnoxious about it and I will gladly take a series that doesn\u2019t drill sexual fanservice into your eyes every chance it gets. The entire thing feels wholesome, and a focus on sexualization would undermine that. The creatives seem to understand this and avoid it. Even the scenes in the hot springs are very neutral and don\u2019t have anything sleazy under the hood. Thumbs up for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the presentation is solid. I might even call it above average. It is where I expect a show like this to be. The directing is generally unremarkable, but the music and the decent production more than make up for that. The voice acting didn\u2019t blow my socks off but thankfully it avoids being shrill and loud. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Narrative, Characters, or Lack Thereof] \\n\\n\r\nDeadpan high schoolers, eccentric glasses, and alcoholic teachers with seemingly no care for students, there really isn\u2019t much to latch onto in this show. Of course, that\u2019s my opinion and I\u2019m sure for some just the serene experience of the whole thing can be enough. The atmosphere here is exceptional, but the characters that inhabit the atmosphere are about as normal as they come. Each one possesses a very minuscule amount of quirks or habits that didn\u2019t do much to intrigue me. While you could argue that\u2019s the point and the series wasn\u2019t trying to intrigue me, I can\u2019t help but feel like they could\u2019ve done more with these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, a show without a shred of conflict is just that, though, a show without a shred of conflict. Conflict grows characters and the deepest conflict here is often running out of food to eat. Again, that\u2019s the point, but there really should\u2019ve been more to the characters that we got to learn about as they bonded together. These girls, the four specific ones that took up most of the show, don\u2019t change or give us, the viewer, anything to chew on other than pretty scenery and delicious looking food. Which is a plus, the food looks great and watching cute girls eat food is something I will unabashedly indulge in (especially when it isn\u2019t obnoxiously over the top). Even Rin, our protagonist, who goes through the biggest \u201carc\u201d of the series doesn\u2019t get much to think about or ponder. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of conflict is a flaw in entertainment value, but a flaw that I think will easily be looked past by the people specifically looking for a series that doesn\u2019t have conflict and is an iyashekei. That\u2019s kind of the sharp-end of criticism, though, the flaws I see are often not what someone else sees. The nonchalant atmosphere is nice to sit back and enjoy, however, I doubt I\u2019ll be thinking back to this series as something memorable or worth revisiting. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nDo you want an overtly wholesome parade of cute anime girls camping? The comedy here isn\u2019t in abundance, but it\u2019s there. It\u2019s okay for anime comedy, too, occasionally making me breath air out of my nose. Yuru Camp relies on expectations more than anything. What do you want and ultimately, what engages you as a viewer? A lot of the flaws here, beyond some of the awkward CG vehicles and weaker animated segments are exceedingly subjective. It\u2019s hard to argue that this series isn\u2019t feel-good and it\u2019s almost impossible for me to say I didn\u2019t like a good portion of it. Even the slower moments were relaxing as all hell, and while the ideas presented here may feel myopic to some viewers, none of it felt tepid. Even the truly \u201claid-back\u201d moments, which manifested in five-minute segments of almost no dialogue, relaxing music, and maybe some monologuing, are relatively easy on the eyes and will, on more than one occasion, make you feel what this show is trying to make you feel. Comfortable.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and camping. This series makes you camp. Regardless of interesting characterization, what Yuru Camp does most well at is the meticulous creation of the scenarios at hand, here. A lot of the series is based on easy-reveals and drama-less conflict-resolution that feels good. For example, your hands are cold because it is cold out. You take your hand warmers and place them in your hands and exhale happily. That is a drama-less resolution, especially when one of your good friends walks up behind you and passes the hand-warmers to you and you smile and greet them. \\n\\n\r\nThis continues simply with the fact that the original creators of the manga this series is based on smartly made it set during the winter. A cold time that can often feel lonely alone. So of course, Rin, our lone-warrior of cute camping girls, ends up coming around and finding friends to camp with. Of course, there will be multiple scenes of snuggling up with yourself in a sleeping bag and cosplaying caterpillars. Because that\u2019s cute, and you can probably imagine just how warm that feeling is and in turn you are suddenly in a place of comfort and relaxation.  I commend the series for these smart creative choices that made for a better watch.\\n\\n\r\nThen it\u2019s the minuscule details to continue this streak of excessively unrealistic but ultimately satisfying interactions. Such as texting your friend at night and getting a response immediately. It almost never happens in the real world but damn it if it doesn\u2019t feel good when it does happen. Sharing a vista with a close one. Cooking food for someone and ultimately getting that favor returned by them later. Sharing a laugh. Admiring a sunset. Looking over the lake and not caring about tomorrow because hopefully today will last forever.\\n\\n\r\nThese are all great qualities and don\u2019t let my above-average score fool you. If you are seeking something like this, this may be the best show of the season for you. It is very time-oriented. If I was going through an excessively difficult time in real life and I threw this show on, at night, by myself, I would have most likely enjoyed it even more. Note that. Value what you value and don\u2019t let this wholesome series slip by you. \\n",

            "content": "We all search for a place to escape the difficult parts in life, whether it be movies, games or anime, we all seek something that makes us relax and enjoy living rather than stress about how difficult life is, Yuru Camp I think is the best when it comes to avoiding all that stress. \r\nYuru Camp is the most relaxing experience you might ever have in your life, the anime is great and you notice that from how happy you feel watching the episodes, each episode is like a new adventure with all characters being so loveable and cute it makes it an even moreamazing experience, you get to see how great camping is, why people love doing it and the amazing scenery that makes you want to get up and travel there just to see how wonderful it looks and that pretty much explains a lot of the charm in Yuru Camp.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much in the story other than the girls camping but you still enjoy it a lot watching how each character interacts with the others and how they move on and become better friends and their relationships get stronger which is very satisfying to see. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I loved the Kino No Tabi reference at the end :D Both this and Kino are in my favorite anime list. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Yuru Camp are great from the 5 MCs to the side characters, they are all very cute and loveable with each of them having her own characteristics that makes her unique and different from the rest, My personal favorite is probably Inuyama or Nadeshiko, Inuyama is only above the others because of how good her character design is (even though the rest of the designs, hers is just my favorite) while Nadeshiko is also better than the rest because of how cute her character is but in terms of overall characteristics then all of them are pretty much on the same level which shows how much attention was put into the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is phenomenal, The designs are great and the scenery and background is outstanding, if you somehow hate the characters you could just turn off the sound and subtitles and just enjoy how stunning it looks. \\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs are great, the Opening and Ending are amazing specially the ending since it really fits the atmosphere and all of that shows how great the sound directing is, well to be honest the directing of the whole anime was amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give it a 10/10 and I'm extremely sad watching one of the very few things that made me completely relaxed in my life end and I'm really going to miss it :'(  \\n\\n\r\nI can't believe I almost didn't watch it at the start of the season.\\n\r\nI can only hope for a 2nd season. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone that likes being happy tbh.",

            "content": "Yuru Camp can easily be described as the break out hit of the season, I highly doubt anyone could have predicted that Yuru Camp would have gotten as popular and highly regarded as it is. Yuru Camp does a lot right, but, I have a myriad of problems with the show; iyashikei is not a slice of life sub-genre and shouldn't be considered as such. Like the Thriller genre and the Mystery genre, it's easy to point out the similarities between both genres; but, what separates iyashikei and the slice of life genre is how they go about character development and narrative. Slice of lifeshows, like K-On, Gochiusa, and Nichijou, either are all sitcom-likes or they have a character driven story, Iyashikei shows on the other hand is setting oriented. Usually the settings of Iyashikei shows carry the story, the settings are often personified and have heavy symbolic significance within the narrative, the story and the appeal of Aria is largely based upon the interactions between the characters and the world of Aqua. Hidamari Sketch is a good example of a genre blend, the Hidamari apartments do hold significant value to the characters and does have symbolic value throughout the series, but on a moment to moment basis the appeal of the show is the interaction between characters. The same is true of Non Non Biyori. The slice of life genre and the iyashikei genre both attempt to capture the realities of life, but structure and the appeal of an iyashikei show is fundamentally different from that of a slice of life show. The appeal and structures of shows like Yokohama, Mushishi, Sketchbook, and Aria is completely different from the appeal of shows like Gochiusa, K-On, Demi-Chan, Yuru Yuri, and Kiniro Mosaic. It's easy to see why Iyashikei is considered a sub-genre, there are countless genre blends; but the iyashikei genre has grown so large and utilizes such different modes of character development and story telling, that one would be hard pressed to say that they are within the same genre when the shows on an individual level is examined.\\n\\n\r\nThe appeal of Yuru Camp is similar to Iyashikei shows, but the actual characters are written as if they are slice of life characters; every character except for Shima Rin is one dimensional, they are written around one character trait and most of the gags of the show revolves around seeing these character archetypes interact. Nadeshiko is the simple glutton archetype, Inuyama is the mother archetype, and Oogaki is the prankster archetype. Admittedly, most of the comedy in the show hits me, I laugh almost every episode; but had the show revolved around those three, I would have dropped the show by this point. Shima Rin is probably the most interesting character in the series, her introverted nature and passion for camping makes for an interesting juxtaposition to the members of the outdoors club. Most episodes can be divided into two parts, seeing the outdoor club going camping, and seeing Shima Rin go camping. The moments when the outdoor club goes camping is a great example of the typical slice of life show, the moments when Shima Rin goes camping is the closest the show come to being a proper iyashikaei show. Shima Rin gives the show a contemplative edge that is much needed. She is the tone setter of the show, she is what makes the show comfortable. Her interactions with nature isn't only fascinating but compelling. \\n\\n\r\nWhen discussing Yuru Camp with my friends, they often bring up how 'atmospheric' the show is, they often note the sound design and the beauty of the setting as whats appealing about the show; I disagree with the notion that Yuru Camp is atmospheric, if anything, it is universally accessible. The background art is based on real japanese campsites, it captures the feeling of camping very well, but the cartoonish designs of the Yuru Camp characters clashes poorly with the realistic background art. The character designs are cute, but they diminish the effect of the background art. The sound design of Yuru Camp is mediocre at best, the camp grounds don't actually feel that realistic, at least in comparison to other series. Yuru Camp is no Yokohama, or even Non Non Biyori in this regard. The most impressive use of sound was in Episode 7, when Nadeshiko and Shimarin are talking and the sounds of the camp fire is played over the subsequent flashbacks. The openings and the ending both sound pretty generic, but they fit the series well. The sound track of Yuru Camp is what first comes to mind when anyone says 'camping music.' The actual soundtrack of Yuru Camp is as generic as it gets. All of these factors coalesce into making the most accessible slice of life show i've ever seen, it avoids emotions other than happiness, and at times this becomes very grating because the show doesn't evolve in any way as time goes on. It makes Yuru Camp a very easy anime to recommend, it is perhaps the most relaxing shows i've ever seen; but the lack of character development and the mediocre art direction is a huge obstacle to me giving the show a higher score.",

            "content": "One of my favorite genres in anime is slice of life, I just really love how it makes me feel. Now there are different varieties of slice of life anime out there. There's romance, drama, school setting, and just in general every day life.\r\nYuru Camp is a typical every day life type of anime. What is it about? It's about a group of girls that go camping, and sometimes some of them go solo camping. And that's pretty much it.\r\nAdmittedly it doesn't have the most interesting of ideas, but it somehow makes it work. I fell in love with Rin and the rest of thegirls, seeing them interact and their friendship become stronger was just really rewarding to see.\\n\\n\r\nI'm an introvert in real life, so I'm always worried how anime will protray introverted characters, but in my opinion at least Rin is one of my favorite introverted characters out there. She wasn't made fun of, she wasn't hated on, no one thought she was strange for wanting time alone. \\n\\n\r\nShe's not socially awkward, she's not painfully shy. She's just more quiet than most, and that is how I personally am in real life.\\n\\n\r\nSo of course I was drawn to Rin immediately. Rin is the main character. As I said before she's a introvert, someone that likes being alone, but who doesn't mind the company occasionally, and I like that.\\n\\n\r\nNadeshiko is a hyper active girl that loves to eat. Normally hyperactive characters can be hit or miss for me, but I really enjoyed Nadeshiko's character a lot. She actually reminded me of a friend I had in high school, who like Nadeshiko was just very happy go lucky/hyperactive. Which was nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nI also really enjoyed how Rin and Nadeshiko's interactions became more valuable as the series continued. While Rin was okay with Nadeshiko camping with her, it was almost as though she wasn't quite sure how to act around her, in the sense that she looked at Nadeshiko oddly.\\n\\n\r\nBut as the series continued you could tell that they were becoming close friends. For instance Rin smiling whenever Nadeshiko did something, or Nadeshiko being so happy to see Rin.  \\n\\n\r\nNext is Aoi, a quiet, soft spoken girl who likes to joke around occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally Chiaki: A very loud and out going girl who isn't afraid to go after things that she wants.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters of course, but those are the main four characters. I really wish that Aoi and Chiaki had gotten more screen time, especially involving Rin, but their interactions were a lot of fun as well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not an outdoor person, I personally hate the cold, but this series actually made me want to go camping. \\n\\n\r\nI adored the characters, the characters interactions were a lot of fun to watch. I felt so comfy and had a big smile the majority of the time I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series had a normal length time in episodes, but it felt like just 5-10 minutes had passed instead of the 22+ minutes. Not saying that's how you'll feel of course , that's just how I personally felt with the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a slice of life fan, than you will likely enjoy this series, if you aren't a slice of life fan and are wanting to try slice of life series, maybe try something else first? And then work your way here? If you're just starting out in the slice of life genre this might be too slice of life for you, but maybe not, the only one who will really know is you.\\n",

Welcome to Yuru Camp\u25b3, a cutesy take on the slice of life aspect of camping, following a group of adventurous girls who love the outdoors as much as each other!\r\nWhat sucked me in to this story of camping was that the atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing. Leaving out the frantic setting in other anime, it let blissfulness shine through in an adorably positive manner. As someone who only knows about camping very straightforwardly, the simple presentation on the tips and techniques were given in an understandable format, andI definitely didn't mind learning about them! All the girls contained their own likable personalities, an entertaining factor on its own. Collectively, they were funny, happy, and all in all full of positivity. This was a simple yet great recipe to create a comfortable feeling of comfiness that warms you up. Their interactions with each other were pure. While they were close at heart upon meeting for the first time, the bonds became stronger every passing day in their camp life. It was an honest friendship that was enjoyable to watch while they set up their tents, cook their foods, or view the scenery as day turned into night. And I give my appreciation to the setting based on real sites such as Mount Fuji. These cozy areas seemed like they were great places to fully relax with nature.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I talk about setting, the outdoor landscapes were beautiful to look at. The attention to detail with the grass blowing or the reflections in the lake all added up into one simple but great visual. For the animation, it was essentially laid-back but it was a perfect complement for the peaceful atmosphere. Each girls possessed their own cute expressions when they were having a good time and I also loved their character designs. Their winter get-up was adorable, looking like a bundle of fluffiness. This presence of the girls enjoying the outdoor life together just makes the air around them so clean and refreshing. Ambience of natural sounds unwinded the body, preparing to absorb and connect to what nature can offer to us with its own environmental audio. Each scenes that were blown over by the soft soundtracks had a gentle and mellow vibe, enriching the quiet world of the lands away from the bustling cities. Whereas for the opening song, the upbeat tone matched the girls' lively personalities, and the soothing ending song concluded their enjoyable day on a tranquil note.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free from the rush of everyday life and go breathe in the fresh air of nature around us. Yuru Camp\u25b3 takes out all the current hassle and stress out of you, leaving you with feelings of content and a pleasant smile at every episode. So what's there more to wait? Bring in the marshmallows with you, we're going camping!",

The series is about camping. But it also reveals the enjoyment did you during the journey which is priceless. \r\nIt's make you feel to leave your busy life and enjoy the bliss of nature. \r\nIt's a comfy anime to enjoy. It's make you realise the fun involving spending nights under the stars. The background music is also very soothing. It's also provide little knowledge about camping.

Enough backstory lets get to the review. \r\nStory is a 7/10. Its not the most amazing story, its camping. Bland on paper but animated its quite the trip. Again its not a crazy wild story but its a damn good enough one to make a show out of. \r\nArt is a 9/10. The art in this show is godly. Mt Fuji looks great, the characters are adorable, the food doesnt look like a sopping wet urinal cake.Its fantastic. I hope a season 2 of this show drops soon because id love to watch more. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is an 8/10 mostly because the OP sounds like something from an 80's sitcom. The voice actresses and actors perfectly fit the roll of the character they've been chosen to voice. \\n\\n\r\nWhich moves me on to the characters\\n\\n\r\n10/10. Now they arent just 10/10 because muh waifu (which some of them are but shhh) its a 10 because the characters are fun to watch. Nadeshiko is an adorable pink haired girl with so little brain cells you get dumber just watching her but WHO CAAAAAAAARES shes cute (also once you hear her say rin chan its burned into your hearing). Rin is a girl who doesnt give a flying fuck-knuckle about nadeshiko but she puts up with her because camping alone isnt thaaaat much fun. Everyone else is stupid(except Aoi) because their role in the show isnt needed. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 for enjoyment. What can i say im a simple man. I see cute pink retard I click on cute pink retard. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL this show is probably an 8/10. I wish it were a bit longer but alas its not.",

If you don't, you probably won't like it because there is nothing else.  The only \"conflicts\" in the show are generally caused by the overreactions, are easily resolved, and result in little permanent change.  The humor is also a major problem in the show.  Some of the visual gags and blunt deliveries of dialogue are funny, but it often disrupts the pacing, and most of the jokes just aren't funny.  \r\nAnother problem is the constant narration.  I cansee they like the food they are all smiling, I don't need all 4 characters to independently say it.  There is literally a narrator character for no reason who decides to interject at random points and completely disrupt the flow.  There are some decent characters and some incredibly annoying ones.  At times the music works and at times is extremely repetitive and distracting. The opening and ending themes are very good.\\n\r\nThe show does what it is supposed to do well though.  The scenery is pretty, the food looks tasty, and at times is relaxing.  Overall 5/10",

            "content": "Sometimes, it\u2019s nice to relax. Maybe you\u2019ve been burned out on intense, energetic shows and need a change of pace. Maybe you\u2019ve come from a long day of work and need something to relieve the stress. Whatever the reason, you\u2019re looking for something a bit more laid-back that you can take in without having to pay too much attention to convoluted plots or segments with extended dialogue. This is the Iyashikei genre in a nutshell, often characterised by works like Mushishi and Flying Witch, shows in which comparatively little actually happen but which managed to be soothing through the beautiful ambience of their setting orthrough the joy of experiencing the simpler pleasures in life. In this regard, Yuru Camp is an Iyashikei through-and-through. \\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019re treated to a series of gorgeous establishing shots of the scenery from the very beginning. While these shots aren\u2019t as detailed or vivid as you might get from a Shinkai film or a KyoAni series, they\u2019re still very impressive and immersed me in the series almost immediately. The environment is coloured with soft tones that blend with each other almost seamlessly. This contrasts with the designs for the characters themselves, which are much more vibrant in a way that perhaps reflects their lively nature, particularly for the bundle of joy that is Nadeshiko with her bright, pink hair. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this anime is stellar, with many of the tracks having a style that I can only describe as being a cross between celtic and traditional japanese folk. It's a distinct sound that you'd recognise immediately upon hearing, but also low-key and pleasant to listen to. Other sound effects, such as the the breaking of sticks, fire, and even slapstick moments like Nadeshiko's face sliding down a window all sound completely authentic and help pull you into the experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, you have the stoic, reserved Rin who\u2019s most comfortable by herself, contrasting with the hyperactive bundle of energy that is Nadeshiko. It\u2019s one of my favourite character dynamics to witness in anime and it\u2019s almost always entertaining and incredibly cute to watch. There's a number of side characters as well, all with personalities that make them a joy to watch even if they don't get nearly as much development as the main pair. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface there\u2019s not really much of a story here, being a show about girls going camping and doing camping things. I would say that the core of the story is in how each girl develops as a person; how Nadeshiko discovers a new hobby through a chance encounter with Rin, and how Rin\u2019s interactions with different kinds of people changes her perspective on friendship and brings her out of her cold, seemingly impenetrable shell. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is an absolute pleasure to watch and very quickly became the highlight of my week. Whether you\u2019re watching this just after coming home from a long day at work or late at night before going to sleep, I think you\u2019ll really love this. It's by far the comfiest show of the Winter 2018 season.\\n\\n\r\nI can definitely see Yuru Camp becoming a new benchmark in the Iyashikei genre, much in the way Flying Witch and Aria were. Here's hoping for a second season!",

            "content": "OH HELL YES, another AOTS contender (besides Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho) and with EVEN LESS marketing from a budding studio (C-Station of Starmyu fame and forget all the other crap they did), with a simple yet engaging premise that's all about camping and with that, a lesson on camping skills and whatnot along with the simple character designs and personalities, with the beautiful breath-taking art that makes this series a sleeper hit indefinitely! Smiliar to Yorimoi, another (presumed) 11/10 rating that sums up how much I enjoyed the Iyashikei (healing) effect from start to end, and will miss this series to say the least:(\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWell, the starting point for this show is kinda intriguing as it shows Nadeshiko Kagamihara (WOW what a tongue-twister this name is) moving over from Shizuoka to Yamanishi to capture the view Mount Fuji right on Japan's 1000-yen bill. Problem is, after the whole journey and reaching her destination, only to fall asleep. Enter Rin Shima, the self-proclaimed girl who can camp out (and I guess her purpose is exploration) and is a skilled one that knows the way of camping (with her grandpa being the narrator if you haven't guessed so already), and with that, the journey of an after-encounter of the duo headstarts to find places of interest (of camping of course) whilst opening up to one another, and eventually with the Outdoor Camping Club duo (Aio Inuyama, Chiaki Oogaki), the (another quadruple) 4 girls attempt to learn all about camping, from finding the right places to the right equipment needed for a lasting experience, and ending off on a high note that's to expect with enjoying each other's company.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for comparison sake between Yorimoi and Yuru Camp:\\n\r\nSimilarities - Group of CGDCT-esque girls doing their stuff, and enjoying to the best of their abilities, and just soaking in the atmosphere.\\n\r\nDifferences - The course of their heading (plot pointers), the overall atmosphere (calm and composed vs. happening and progressing), and of course the source material (Yorimoi being an original work vs. Yuru Camp from the manga source of the same name)\\n\\n\r\nNo matter the similarities and the differences, both shows are definite must-watch-ers from the get-go from Winter 2018, and quarterback AOTSes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIt is with NO doubt that Yuru Camp's strongest point is at its characters (see the similarity?), and how their engagement with each other piques their interest and bad-rubbing, though the latter (I believe) serves as a plot pointer in the friendships.\\n\\n\r\nRin Shima (CV: veteran Nao Touyama of Nisekoi's Chitoge) is a nice protagonist-esque character, seeing that her abilities (learnt from her grandfather) serves her well as a solo, lone camper, entrusting herself with all the hard work from start to finish. Of course, that is until Nadeshiko's enthusiasm rubs her the wrong way at first till acceptance, and in that essence, opens her cold heart towards others who have the same interest and ambitions. To that extent, IMO I can really emphatize with Rin because most of the time she's a loner, until that heart warms up to other people and being welcome of it, definitely appreciate the progression of Rin.\\n\\n\r\nIMO the best girl (and waifu), Nadeshiko Kamigahara (CV: Yumiri Hanamori of Grimoire of Zero's Zero) IMMEDIATELY stands out above the rest for her enthusiasm that's so mesmerizing (and NO I'm NOT kidding) and encouraging others with her wwwiiiiddddeee brilliant smile across her face with her weird antics that make her one of the most covenanted characters in the series to no end. Everything of her feels like a joke, yet in a comical sense that delivers strong on the aspects of the show, knowing when to take a dump on jokes and whatnot that comes as a striking resemblance to how we enjoy our youth by doing stupid things that made no sense, but enjoy it for the fervor that gives us the presence of our younger times.\\n\\n\r\nThe Outdoor Camping Club gang of Aoi Inuyama, Chiaki Oogaki and Ena Saitou (voiced by supporting CVs Aki Toyosaki, Sayuri Hara, Rie Takahashi) also delivers on the plot points from their inclusion to the series (when Nadeshiko is introduced to the club) to the camping engagement with Rin, and it all makes up with none of the half-assed effort and goes full-on with their character personalities via the relationship towards Rin and Nadeshiko, and both of them serve their purpose as to be aspiring campers (again, like the other camping experienced duo), to make full use of their time to enjoy camping to the max.\\n\\n\r\nPlus the other side-characters, another strong lineup of characters that are just willing to try and not get fazed even by (minor) challenges (such as Chiaki and Nadeshiko's shock towards the expensive equipment), so much so that it's exciting to watch these characters mingle with one another and enjoy a purposefully themed Yuru (Laid-Back) Camp.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nC-Station (of Starmyu fame) did an impressive job on this manga adaptation, recapturing the sights and wonders of the simple yet artisitic manga drawings into the anime art that is chock full with the most beautiful and realistic of sites found in real life (e.g. 1000-yen billed Mt. Fuji in Episode 1).\\n\r\nTo see sites replicated in real life into anime form, that is truly the blessing of those of us who have done camping as a hobby and it certainly brought tears of joy that the experience is undoubtedly the same as it was in real life. Thumbs up for keeping the art aesthetics consistent with animation that's not too glaring nor uneasy that spoils the visuals, and instead, basks in the natural state of the world as we see fit.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAnother OST to look out for in Winter 2018, and an awesome and comfy one at that!!!\\n\\n\r\nMusic composer Akiyuki Tateyama definitely has props when it comes to music (through Shimoneta and Kemono Friends), and it shows here to a T. Anybody who has listened to the OST will definitely agree on its surprising narration, starting with Asaka's energetic OP \"Shiny Days\" (which bears a striking similarity to Jackson 5's \"I Want You Back\", \"ABC\"), ending with Eri Sasaki's calm, relaxing acoustic ED \"Fuyu Biyori\" (still loving her bright, warm voice as evidently heard in Plastic Memories OP which STILL really brought tears of joy) to the BGM which fits so carefully and glides along with the present situation at hand. Overall, another strong OST in the books.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAside from being some people's AOTS, this hidden gem truly is a blast to watch and be immersed if just for the camping aspect alone. This series overall really blew my mind away at how simple yet enticing the show-and-tell ability that most shows try to do but fail outright, and this is the one exception of a few that did what it was supposed to do from the outset, with great fervor and confidence.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? Maybe we should try to appreciate the outliers more (such as this, Yorimoi etc.) than just a show that we would skip from the beginning, and this show gave me hope that more of us can be exposed to these kinds of shows. A heartfelt recommended watch so we can all be exposed to the life and hobby of more than just the camping life.\\n\\n\r\n...And now I feel tempted to travel to Japan to just experience the camping life :-(\\n\r\nIT'S THAT MESMERIZING AND GOOD!!!",

            "content": "\u201c\u00a1 One for all, hole in one!\u201d \u2014Nadeshiko Kagamihara\r\nYuru Camp is one of the gems from the season. Who could have guessed a camping series would be fun, refreshing, and very entertaining? Also, no matter how you are feeling, after each episode you will end with a big smile on your face. Yuru Camp isn\u2019t about cute girls doing cute things. It is about how to enjoy simpler situations and how to maintain the proper mood and be happy under any circumstance. More important, the series irradiates that sensation to all the spectators. These girls give us a funny and delightful gem and will stayin our memories for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is straightforward and easy to follow, it is fun, fresh and entertaining to watch. It focuses on camping. Yes, I envision the same thing you\u2019re thinking: camping, are you kidding me? How can you have a plotline about camping? It must be a fiasco. However, Yuri Camp is not dull, from a common event like camping, the authors create an amusing narration where all the characters take pleasure in camping. Keep in mind that maybe you want to go camping with your friends after the series because the characters\u2019 commitment is plausible, delightful and absorbing. The message given to the audience through the story\u2019s simplicity is enjoying the moments of life.\\n\\n\r\nAs a starting point, the pacing is perfect, and the way how all the characters are involved is pretty clever. It is remarkable seeing the correlation and the chemistry between them, no matter if they appear in the scene for few seconds, their actions complement the setting, and you don\u2019t feel them wasted. Every character has a different personality that boosts the dynamic through the storyline and embodies the meaning of friendship. Another notable aspect, the trust. Would you camp with someone you do not trust? The series enrich the plot with those values and propels them in each episode. For example, Rin likes camping alone, but she starts enjoying her time with Nadeshiko and considers her as a friend. Since they are a group of \u201cbuddies,\u201d they share their tastes (food, hobbies, fun). Also, the story maintains the realism and gives tips about camping. This small world is full of comical events and funny jokes executed at the perfect moment ingeniously. Look Nadeshiko, she may seem to be childish, yet she is very energetic, and she uses that side of her personality to be humorous. Just with her behavior, the characters seem flashy and feel happy. All this is possible because the authors care about the pacing and the story.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, some spectators believe the series doesn\u2019t have a plot, so they consider the show boring. The simplicity of the narrative can be measured in the course of action and the mood while camping. How many of us have at least camping once in our lives? If it was a gratifying experience then this show will bring memories and forgotten desires, perhaps you could end remembering some of your old friends. This series demonstrates that every action, no matter how insignificant is, it would make our existence happier and enjoyable. For me, seeing how these characters admire a landscape, it is very remarkable. Maybe it is a clich\u00e9, but that easiness is what we call having a good time. Lastly, I have not found any negative aspect of the show. Nothing is perfect, yet the anime covers some basic ideas such as friendship, trust, passion, joy, and boosts them in a very entertaining way. Yuri Camp\u2019s beauty lies in its simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nWe have five characters in the story. The most noticeable Is Nadeshiko because she is the one that which gathers the rest of the cast together, and she is the central point for most of the jokes. Nadeshiko is very energetic and blissful. She loves eating, and we can consider her a thrilled girl. The other main character, Rin. In the beginning, she enjoys camping alone, but Nadeshiko\u2019s influence may change her. Rin has more camping experience than the others.\\n\r\nThe remaining characters add fluency to the story. Aoi and Chiaki, they are the members of the Outdoor Activities Club. Thanks to Nadeshiko the club continues with the activities and start to plan camping meetings. Lastly Ena, she always mocks Rin. Something I notice is the lack of a detailed background, but the plot works very well without it. You only need to know they like camping and the rest will come from their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are good. One exciting part is how they care about the landscapes. It is a plus because most of the scenes are outside. The camera angles and the camera movement focus on the main characters. Also, the color palette is very vivid and catch the attention of your eyes. However, the character\u2019s design is standard compared with other series; it goes well with the simplicity of the plot. Regarding the sound, the score fills the moments and the jokes. It isn\u2019t bad. Although, sometimes you don\u2019t notice it because it is standard. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are great. I love those two songs. The lyrics and the rhythm work very well and are very catchy. Honestly, I hummed the OP for a whole day. I am getting crazy. =( \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the combination between a simple and a fluid narrative, good characters, attractive art design, right sound, creates a delightful story called Yuru Camp. I like the show, I want a second season but maybe isn\u2019t going to happen, yet it was a hilarious ride. You must give this anime an opportunity.  \\n",

            "content": "I think that sometimes, to relax, we need to explore other unusual places, almost exotic, to realize how the nature around us is so exceptional. That's what Yuru Camp is trying to demonstrate. We don't always need awesome things like explosions, magic powers to make an interesting show. \r\nStory: Yuru Camp focuses on a theme: camping. We follow the daily life of Shima Rin (nicknamed Shimarin) who goes camping regularly on her days off. She meets the happy Nadeshiko who knows nothing about camping. After a little conversation and a delicious dinner in front of the incredible Mount Fuji, Nadeshiko develops a taste for camping.\r\nThosetwo girls attend the same high school. Nadeshiko also meets Aoi and Chiaki, two girls who formed the camping club. The latter is not so successful and has little budget. As for Shimarin, she prefers to go camping alone. \\n\\n\r\nThis is how the girls of the club will progressively be prepared for their adventure. Buy the equipment, the food necessary to spend a night in the mountains. Since we are in a cold period of the year, they also make sure they have the means to warm up. This is not always easy since the club doesn't have a lot of budget and must be satisfied with their tent costing 980 yen.\\n\r\nIt's fun to see what means they will use to do their first camping. The anime does a great job explaining in detail the different types of existing materials and the tasty dishes to cook when we go camping. it is really trying to convey to us the passion of its characters for camping. I honestly understand why Nadeshiko and her friends are so motivated.\\n\\n\r\nShimarin travels alone (over hundreds of kilometers) to discover the sublime landscapes and peaceful places in the prefecture. The girls will make a lot of use of the instant messaging system. Each of them will send a photo to show her the places she visited or banalities. This is how the relationship between characters will progress (especially between Shimarin and Nadeshiko) and finally allow them to go together all together, later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship is essentially based on the unsaid. We feel that Shimarin is someone who is used to being alone, whether in high school or camping. Her chance meeting with Nadeshiko will change things and allow her to share her passion with other friends of the same age.\\n\r\nSometimes she doesn't seem disinterested enough (except when she sees dogs) but in her heart, she really wants to have a good time with her new friends. For example, when Aoi will propose to go camping together. She refuses at first even if we can perceive a touch of regret in her words. Shimarin is usually mature, calm and resourceful.\\n\r\nAt the exact opposite, Nadeshiko behaves like a child (although she uses some old expressions) but she is sociable and always ready to go on an adventure with her friends.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, the landscapes are absolutely sublime, really. They would be ideal for wallpapers. These different places impressed me and I was fascinated by their realistic appearance. C-station studio isn't known to me but I will remember that excellent work. We can notice the use of CGI when Shimarin drives his moped.\\n\r\nThe vocal performances perfectly transpose the personality of our characters. Nadeshiko has an often playful voice, while Shimarin has a duller voice. The opening theme \"Shiny Days\" is catchy and the ending matches the relaxed atmosphere of the series.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is one of the highlights of the series. It is reminiscent of Celtic folk music. Tateyama Akiyuki has really captured this peaceful atmosphere with his OST. Honestly, it's a delight, and I can't wait to listen to them in a flac version. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the series has clearly exceeded my expectations. It is an excellent iyashikei with a relaxing autumn/winter atmosphere in Yamanashi that will make you smile regularly. The friendship between our cute characters is touching. Laid-back Camp is a success.",

            "content": "Another edition to the endlessly growing roster of \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d anime.  I definitely know a certain SOMEONE who would love this show. \r\nSo what is Yuru Camp\u25b3? (Yes, you have to have the little tent). In English, the title is \u201cLaid Back\u201d Camp, and that honestly couldn\u2019t be more appropriate. It\u2019s about a group of girls that form a camping club at their school, and spend their breaks doing just that; camping. There\u2019s relaxing atmosphere, friendly humor, and tranquility. \r\nSo, being that it\u2019s this kind of Slice of Life, the story certainly means to be casually presented. It\u2019s a ripe candidatefor those days where you do nothing but sit back, eat snacks, and refuse to care about anything else for at least 24 minutes of runtime (288 if you just watch the whole thing in one go, which is acceptable to me, being only a 12 episode show). \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the show is bad, I really don\u2019t think that\u2014but if you wanted something profound, look elsewhere. Yuru Camp\u25b3 is a show for the people who appreciate calm, happy presentations of friendship, hobby exploration, and overall contentment. There\u2019s nothing but smiles to be had, but it does it in a way that is neither over the top nor painful. We can find joy in how smoothly the anime incorporates naturalistic imagery alongside comfortable music and some pretty adorable characters. \\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the characters in the show are completely defined by their love of camping and their girlish charm. Again, I just cannot stress enough that this story is not trying to be anything more. They don\u2019t need to be deeply complex for this type of thing; they serve the experience well enough with just having well-defined archetypes. Still, while I wouldn\u2019t call this a detractor, it\u2019s scoring no points\u2014it breaks even. The story has little going for it other than the demeanor with which it's shown... they camp. That's honestly, really all it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is honestly wonderful, though. The colors are defined and the motion flows so much better than a lot of other shows that you\u2019d be entirely forgiven for coming to Yuru Camp\u25b3 for how it looks and the way it makes you feel. You definitely won't find much else.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tConsistently relaxing atmosphere. \\n\r\n-\tCamping tips and knowledge are pretty prevalent throughout, to the point where I learned a few things I didn\u2019t know before, and was appreciative that they had been taught to me through a decently entertaining show. \\n\r\n-\tI can\u2019t honestly say it\u2019s really boring, parts of the show did make me chuckle at times and I appreciated the camaraderie amongst the characters.\\n\r\n-\tWOW that opening. And ending. The music in this show is phenomenal, as is the animation.\\n\\n\r\nMIXED: \\n\r\n-\tIt does nothing new, yet does nothing wrong. It loses no money, yet makes no money. In business we call this \u201cbreaking even.\u201d \\n\r\n-\tHardly more emotions to be found other than pure joy and quiet peace. Also, some silliness here and there.\\n\r\n-\tIt\u2019s pretty much unspoilable. You can take this in two ways \u2013 one, that the show has no story; or two, the show presents a \u201cunique\u201d type of story. Both are acceptable descriptors. \\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tThis is yet another one of those shows where cute girls do cute things, and it seems like they only exist for the explicit reason of camping every week. There\u2019s no depth to be seen, and while I didn't hate them, being archetypes is nothing to celebrate. \\n\r\n-\tSometimes the series watches like an advertisement for various products and campsites around Japan, and honestly, I expect that this is exactly what it is. \\n\\n\r\nUpon writing this review, I discovered that this anime is based on a manga, and I couldn\u2019t be less surprised. According to my Japanese friends, who I\u2019ve spoken to about anime and manga quite extensively, manga is pretty damn popular in Japan, and there are manga for virtually everything and everyone. So it comes to me as no surprise that there\u2019s a manga exclusively about real camping locations, ways to camp there, and little else other than cute girls\u2014it would be something that a bunch of kids pick up at the market on the way to their OWN camping trip to read before they snooze off or right after dinner. Simple, inoffensive, and quite adorable at times. \\n\\n\r\nBut is it any more? \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think so. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The sun is setting. The cold breezes that brushed through the yellow-green grass just a few minutes earlier have left the plains. In front of a small camping tent, Rin is comfortably seated in a folding chair, reading a book. A while has passed and she decides to put down her warm cup of cocoa, close her book and stretch; a puff of breath turns into a small cloud and slowly fades away. She looks at her surroundings: a huge, empty field of grass, a small forest and a clear view of a Mt. Fuji tinted in a friendly pink. Rin is on another ofher lonesome weekendly winter camping trips. During the coldest season, she fancies spending some time alone in the quiet areas of Japan\u2014on camping sites usually uncrowded during the winter. \\n\\n\r\nDuring her trips, she spends a lot of time exploring the camping grounds; in midst of beautifully drawn, colorful sceneries, she follows intricately painted pathways in search for the stunning sights of an everyday beauty of nature perfectly evoked by the show\u2019s wonderful visuals. Whether she ends up exploring the campsites, the colorful forests of early winter, taking pictures of funny-looking statues or just sitting in her chair relaxing, it doesn\u2019t really matter; she just wants to spend some time on her own enjoying nature. Apart from camping, she doesn\u2019t have any predominant interests or hobbies, and while she does truly love her friends and enjoys spending time with them, this pastime is something she truly needs: a breather, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nIt comes as no surprise when she turns down an invitation to join her school\u2019s camping club; it\u2019d go against the purpose of her camping trips. And really, that\u2019s completely okay. Her friends understand. While they may not truly grasp her feelings, they respect her desire to camp on her own without pressing further. This comes as kind of a surprise initially: in general, the members of the camping club are very energetic and gung-ho; seeing these characters which one might initially pass off as everyday anime idiots act like sensitive, genuine human beings and friends is truly, truly refreshing. Rin and them couldn\u2019t be more different: Chiaki and Aoi often indulge in weird jokes or pranks, and while their love for camping is definitely genuine, so is their aversion to spending even a single penny on actually acquiring necessary utensils. Nadeshiko on the other hand is very much a simpleton\u2014a hyperactive, hyperhappy and hyperhungry simpleton. It\u2019s not only the members of the camping club who differ from Rin (whose camping trips aren\u2019t as quiet and calming as Rin\u2019s); the three horse around and have fun. Instead of appreciating the quiet and nature, they just want to spend time and camp together as a group of friends.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the cast and the camping trips covering such a wide spectrum, the otherwise rather monotonous-sounding activity of winter camping can offer a variety of different, but always pleasant and comfy experiences. And while Rin and her friends may be apart when camping (well, most of the time), they are never out of touch: during their camping trips they regularly message or call each other and send the others photos of the camping sites they visit. They indulge in mindless but fun chats about food or the weather and it feels completely genuine. But not only do these small chats serve to make the character\u2019s relationships feel real, they also help the otherwise standalone camping trip segments connect to the rest of the show to form a cohesive whole; while the general moods of Rin\u2019s camping trips and the camping club horsing around are completely different, they still feel like parts of the same show, not fragments of a greater whole.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t just these small conversations between the group and Rin that creates the feeling of unity between every single scene. Yuru Camp\u2019s soundtrack consists of very few songs which, while usually a negative, works well for what the show is trying to accomplish. The tracks are all very simple, but they sell their respective scenes perfectly through equally simple means: a short, repeated trill in the lead guitar is enough to sell the relaxing camping atmosphere; a change from a dominant guitar to flutes can be mystifying and create a sense of exploration; and a calm vocal song is enough to sell the most intimate of togetherness. It won\u2019t earn any medals or prizes, but the soundtrack does just what it\u2019s supposed to, and that\u2019s just what you want for an equally simple and relaxing show such as Yuru Camp.\\n\\n\r\nBe it Rin\u2019s appreciation for the quiet and nature, the lively and fun friendship of the camping club or their genuine and heartwarming relationships\u2014there is much to love in this soothing show. Yuru Camp may seldom stray off the beaten path, but it doesn\u2019t need to, for it is a comfy and lighthearted experience through and through.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you decide to join in on the fun please keep in mind that while camping\u2026\\n\\n\r\n- Always mind the campsite and facility rules\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t forget to clean up fires and take your trash!\\n\r\n- It gets cold during the winter. Stay warm and be well-prepared!!\\n\r\n- Have fun :)\\n\\n\r\nScore: 75\\n",

            "content": "Sit back, relax, and gaze upon the glory that is Yuru Camp.\r\nTbh I never expected to enjoy a series this much. With all the anime going on on a Thursday, this is definitely a great way to end it. The first episode already captivated me with its amazing soundtrack, character design, and background art.\r\nOur main character Rin, is someone who enjoys camping alone, we see that in episode 1. She's someone who would rather enjoy camping at her own leisure. However, because there are more amazing characters, she soon starts to meet them as well as open up to them more and becomes more social.I appreciate these character interactions because it's so humanlike and it's super sweet and all of them have chemistry with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it ain't just the characters themselves, the background art and colours are super attractive and really compliments the anime very well. There's also the fact that the background art and amazing colours are accompanied by the AMAZING OST. Each soundtrack piece really sets the vibe for each episode and each event that happens within Yuru Camp. Not to mention that GODLIKE OP. I've never heard such a catchier op than this one this season.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, apparently the campsites the girls' go to camp at are actually based on actual locations. I saw a few pictures of it in its real life form and it really looks exactly as the anime shows. It's amazing that these beautiful sites are real places to camp.\\n\\n\r\nSo in short:\\n\\n\r\nStory (8) - Very Simple, Rin who loves to camps meets a new girl who eventually befriends her and enjoys camping along with her in due time. Then more girls show up and then they'll all camp together. A simple yet very well executed story that hits every note right.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9) - Each character looks unique and the colours are well used.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10) - Easily one of the best OST's I've heard and the appropriate timings used of these songs really makes the anime all the better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10) - Each girl carries a beautiful and amazing personality and shows as well as reminds us how cute the CGDCT genre can be. Each girl is lovable and will not disappoint in putting a smile on your face.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) - I've enjoyed each second that Yuru Camp has to offer. I've never got bored of this anime and it was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) - If the goal of this anime was to give you a big smile and show you how girls can camp extremely well, then it does that very well.

            "content": "If the only purpose of Yuru Camp was to create a very cute, shallow, flavor of the week moe show, then they\u2019ve succeeded brilliantly. If it attempted to be something more than that, it failed brilliantly.\r\nStory(3): Like most cute girls doing cute things shows, this show has little to offer in the way of story. This is a character driven show about a group of girls making friends and messing around in their club. There\u2019s hardly any conflict at all, the girls simply go about their lives. \r\nArt(6): The character designs do a great job of selling of cutsey part of the show, and doa good job clueing us on their personalities, as one dimensional as they may be. The pink hair girl has to be one of the most satisfying cute girl character designs I\u2019ve seen in a while. I can\u2019t say I remember the backgrounds being particularly notable, though, even in the parts where they are attempting to show off Mount Fuji. The animation isn\u2019t anything special either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(2): A cute girls doing cute things show doesn\u2019t always need to have a plot. They survive and die on the strength of their characters personalities and their relationships with each other. This is where the show really falls short. Each character could easily be summed up in one sentence. When they are put into situations, they interact in the most clich\u00e9 and predictable ways possible. They\u2019re not just laid back, they\u2019re boring.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(3): Because of the lack of thought or effort put into these characters, I found myself getting bored half way through the first episode. I pushed through a couple more because the MAL score here was so far, hoping it got better. It didn\u2019t, only adding more on dimensional characters that the show failed to make me care about.\\n",

            "content": "Camping 101 \r\nStarring: cute girls!\r\nWe\u2019ve had cute girls sailing to Antarctica, (Further than the Universe) cute girls in the apocalypse (Girls\u2019 Last Tour), cute girls singing, dancing, and playing instruments (anime like K-On!, Love-Live! And Hibike! Euphonium), and just cute girls doing nothing whatsoever (Lucky star and Yuyushiki). Now we have cute girls going camping.\r\nIt literally does what it says on the packet. It\u2019s a very relaxed slice-of-life anime about camping, including all the aspects you would expect to see in a camping anime. It goes into great detail about the campsites they visit, the equipment they use (everything from how they buy it tohow they set it up), the food they make (which by the way, looks amazing and will make you hungry if you watch it before eating), and the way they bond through camping together. I learnt enough about camping from this one anime that, assuming I ever wanted to go, I would know exactly how to prepare and what to do.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s nice to watch. It\u2019s very slow paced, each episode generally consists of planning and executing a different camping trip. The art and animation are fantastic; the scenery in particular is drawn absolutely beautifully. All the right colours and tones are used to convey the autumn-like feeling perfectly. The sound also fits the mood of the anime to a T. \\n\\n\r\nThere are five main characters, although the story mainly focusses on two of them. Rin is the silent one who enjoys the peace and quiet of camping alone. She doesn\u2019t tend to socialise much, and this is what makes her friendship with the outgoing and talkative Nadeshiko endearing to watch. You get to know Rin through her actions \u2013 the way her face lights up when she sips a hot cocoa, the way she stares at a gorgeous view like she\u2019s trying to devour it, the way she cares about her friends despite sometimes acting like they\u2019re a nuisance to her. She\u2019s very relatable as a character, and that\u2019s part of why I liked the anime so much.\\n\\n\r\nNadeshiko, as mentioned before, is the talkative one. She\u2019s also the clumsy, energetic and downright adorable one. She\u2019s the type of girl who injects life into the anime, and helps speed up the pace when it becomes too snail-like. Her becoming friends with Rin is essentially the premise of the anime \u2013 they meet by chance on a camping site, and, in the way of anime, find out they go to the same school together. She and Rin are a lot like chalk and cheese; apart from their love of camping they couldn\u2019t be more different. However their friendship blossoms nonetheless, and by the end of the anime they\u2019ve formed a solid relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters are relatively enjoyable to watch, although they aren\u2019t as developed as Rin and Nadeshiko. Aki and Aoi are girls in the same camping club as Nadeshiko, and Ena is a friend of Rin\u2019s who\u2019s persuaded to come along for the ride. Apart from camping, the anime mainly shows them in school, going shopping, working and just hanging out together. Nothing exciting or even particularly interesting, but their interactions are mildly humorous, very light-hearted, and always cute. The series shows how they each react to the camping aspect, and what each of them actually enjoys about camping. For some it\u2019s the peace, for some it\u2019s the food, and for some it\u2019s the companionship. Regardless, after watching this I felt I would probably enjoy camping too for one reason or the other. \\n\\n\r\nNow, although I said this anime was nice to watch, I wouldn\u2019t call it entertaining. It\u2019s more like you feel contented with the world after watching it. I had to be in a certain frame of mind to see it \u2013 when I was in the mood for something fast-paced and thrilling, I watched another anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for something tranquil, something cute and relaxing, this is a good choice. If you\u2019re not, then I\u2019d give this one a miss until you are. XD\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yuru Camp was a strange phenomenon to witness. An anime produced by a newish studio and an inexperienced staff, with a premise that looked about as basic and niche as it could, adapting a fairly unknown manga. Very few people looked forward to this show, and I was certainly not one of them as it didn't look particularly appealing at first.\r\nAnd yet, it remains as the third highest-rated non-sequel show of its season, only behind two series that rely on more visceral and spectacular storytelling (Sora yori mo tooi basho and Violet Evergarden), with heavier themes and mood shifts. It is one of the best-sellingshows of the season as well, increasing manga sales, selling a lot of merchandise and, as of today, tripling the amount of visitors to the campsites located at the Yamanashi Prefecture the series focuses on.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, Yuru Camp is a show about camping. And not even about camping as a side element or room for more potentially exciting character quirks. About camping in itself as an experience, with a cast of characters that develop an interest and are always looking forward to, and grow, and set their focus on the activity. For twelve episodes. With no tension, no character drama, no external elements getting in the way and certainly not a sense of danger or heavy uncertainty. It is strict in what it covers and straightforward in what it wants to evoke.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, that was an advantage to the show. Week after week, this was a safe choice with a clear attached mood that people could get into knowing what they'd expect and the exact kind of reaction they'd get from it. Some people probably didn't like it, but they weren't vocal: it's not the kind of show that can lead to visceral hate. Not having any element that could generate controversy, it was only natural that the series grew through the season with very little negativity around it. The scenario for this backfiring was also clear: after all, what kind of appeal does this harmless fun provide compared with the more spectacular and memorable narratives of emotional struggle in its season?\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard to answer, and yet, it becomes so clear when you are watching it. Selling Yuru Camp is difficult, as one would need to rely on vague statements about its mood. It's quiet, it's soothing, watch it whenever you need to chill. That's it. I could end my review here and it would be the most straightforward recommendation because that is what this show is about: pure and unadulterated calmness and peace of mind. No more no less.\\n\\n\r\nBut that would be too easy and misleading. Because it's not the simplicity and straightforwardness what makes this series work, but an execution that depends on a careful combination of directorial, cast, music and writing choices that shouldn't be dismissed just because the aim of the show is humble and simplistic. It is masterfully crafted in each of these elements and almost nothing in it feels random or inappropriate for the overall mood.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk first about the visual aspects of the show. A lot of things have been said about the sheer beauty and detail of the backgrounds, the use of a subdued color palette that makes everything look more relaxed and soothing, the clever use of lighting and so on. Each episode provides a good amount of wallpaper material and they do a great work at enhancing the beauty of the landscapes. But I would like to focus on something this series really excels at and makes everything work even better from a visually evocative point of view: framing. Yuru Camp is a series about outdoor activities and one of the things it does better at representing their appeal is reflecting with its visual language how vast and surrounding its scenarios are, in comparison with, say, confined rooms. Even more difficult if you take into account that it has to convey these feelings through characters that are part, and are reacting to that environment at that same time. By placing the characters at the right spot of the frame and by showing an astonishing sense of space and depth of field, the series manages to effectively transmit to the viewer a feeling of belonging there, and observing the environment along with, and not separately from the characters. It doesn't feature any particularly elaborate or flashy cinematographic trick but it does everything well in a way that I think very few have. A zoom-out that reveals a wonderful night view, a panoramic shot with the character surrounded by the immense beauty of her environment, a character moving towards the camera to properly reflect the depth of field. It is consistently clever and efficient at this and increases exponentially the appeal of its scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs leave more room for nitpicking. They have rather simple features, some kind of... questionable ones (what is up with those extra thin necks?) and overall they are designs that appeal to a fitting yet standard cutesy style. Past that level of simplicity, the thing is that they are actually very spot on in pretty much everything. They wear mundane and appropriate clothes, and the show has a surprising variety of outfits and styles for each of them. Particularly noteworthy is the big amount of aesthetic choices thrown around the character of Rin throughout the series, that make her quite visually dynamic and even leads to some running jokes with her hairstyles. Either way, I would not like to oversell the complexity of these character designs, since I think part of their appeal and also a very relevant fraction in the visual comedy of the show lie precisely in their simple and recognizable traits.\\n\\n\r\nThese general aspects aside, the show itself has a number of little issues in its visuals that depending on the person and the focus may look more or less serious. The animation in particular. It is clean, fluid and average or above average, always serviceable enough; but there's not much focus on movement and the series can look quite static at times. It has some surprisingly complex and detailed animation but it is not consistent with that and specially in its latter half it abuses montages of static and frozen panning shots instead. The CG animation of the vehicles feels kind of off-putting, even with the attempts of the series to make up for it by focusing on the depth of field of the shot; thankfully none of these moments last very long. However the biggest issue comes with episode 8. It is pretty much universally agreed that this episode is an aesthetic low in the series with clumsy animation and characters going off model way too often throughout.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, at least in my case, the flaws feel so irrelevant compared to all the great visual choices it makes that this aspect of the show remains impressive overall, with only a few occasional nitpicks here and there. What I'd like to emphasize the most here is that the visual language in this series is crucial and it is effectively conveyed with clever decisions and execution. The series manages to nail the cathartic and the mundane equally and is one of the most purely aesthetic anime experiences I've seen. And if you think that my views on the art are too positive, wait for the next section.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Oh, how do I even start with this. It's absolute brilliance from start to finish. The soundtrack is quiet and fluffy, even at its most playful it's just plain laid-back. Entirely instrumental except for the opening and ending, it constantly evokes the atmosphere of relax and uneventful fun that permeates through the entire series. However what truly makes this series stand out in this department is not in the tracks themselves, but in their use in context. It understands the music not as an accompaniment, but as an essential element of its aesthetics and narrative. And this is specially relevant in a season that, overall, did not stand out much in this aspect and took a lot of my nitpicks for otherwise great shows. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Yuru Camp understands so well is that, yes, the music is fitting and sets a mood, but that shouldn't stop you from playing and being active and dynamic with it. You can't expect to play a beautiful song in the background, stop caring, and proceed to focus on the visual narrative and the dialogue, because no matter how good it sounds, it will end up creating an aesthetic dissonance. This series takes its effort to match the images, the frames and the timing of the narration with the soundtrack. It quite often makes use of sudden and accurately timed interruptions for comedic effect, it saves the most emphasized parts of the track for the single moments of catharsis and it perfectly captures the mundane. It knows when to stop and it knows when to start again, what track to use for each moment and how to make proper and emotionally (or comedically) effective transitions. If all of this sounds basic, imagine my frustration while watching other shows in its same season failing to understand this fundamental approach.\\n\\n\r\nAnd damn if it's effective. The love and care put in this aspect of the show is astounding. Heck, if it even went through the trouble of creating a separate and fitting soundtrack for each of the campsite locations. That's some level of dedication out there. Seriously, the music in this show is something else. Even for its generally excellent delivery this is an easy standout.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the aspects of its sound design are also spot on. I love the effects, particularly those used to create atmosphere like the little ambient sounds, the wind breezing... that make the experience more immediate and relatable. As for the voice acting, the series has a very solid cast with a clear standout in Yumiri Hanamori's Nadeshiko. The way she nails the voice of her character, her sounds and her overall performance is essential to make Nadeshiko the cinnamon roll of unadulterated cuteness she is, and to do it with a character that was so easy to drive wrong has a lot of merit. Almost equal in merit and execution is Nao Touyama's Rin, a quiet type that is still perfectly empathic and entertaining to listen to, and knows how to add relatable nuances of emotion to a character that acts cold and restrained towards the rest. The rest of the cast all have fitting voices and add to the overall mood and the comedic effect of the characters, with another favorite of mine being Rie Takahashi's laid-back and playful role as Saitou. The energy of Chiaki and the soothing nature of Aoi are nailed as well and perfectly add to their style of humor. My only nitpick aside from some minor characters having more meh voices is with some little moments of Aki Toyosaki's Aoi. The character seems to have more creative freedom than the rest of the cast when it comes to the way she sounds, and at some points, episode 10 in special, that sort of rubbed me the wrong way.\\n\\n\r\nWith the visual and sound aspects covered, we can move on to the writing. And since this is just cute girls doing cute camping things for twelve episodes this should be fast, right?\\n\\n\r\nRight?\\n\\n\r\nYou know it won't. I'm afraid you have to stay for a little while yet.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest pet peeves with anime criticism is the, in my opinion, excessive reliance on themes. When it comes to a story focused on the mundane, that uses observational and incidental narrative and doesn't focus in a central point, prioritizing in your speech the talk about transcendence and depth of themes is artificial and uncalled for. And I have even seen it with this show. It's not like Yuru Camp doesn't offer valuable insight on certain topics, I'll get there a bit later, but to make it the main point of appeal of the series is, to me, missing the point and applying standards it doesn't aim for. And the solution is not to dismiss the efforts of this show based on the simple immediacy of its premise either, specially if such immediacy is carried through an observant perspective that has its inherent difficulty.\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I bringing this up? Because the writing of Yuru Camp is excellent. It is a definitive standout in its genre, and it is easily the most solid I could find in its season. The way it understands and applies character interactions through its entire run is nothing short of brilliant in its apparent simplicity and naturality.\\n\\n\r\nThe first element I'd like to tackle is the storyline. What I am about to say may sound surprising, but compared to other slice of life shows, I think the pure story aspect in this series is actually quite sophisticated, or perhaps I should say tightly structured. Contrarily to what one could think in a show that lives up to its premise of cute girls camping and having harmless fun, it has a clear narrative with perfect continuity throughout. All the characters undergo some sort of development regarding their interest on camping; some become more profficient, some start to contemplate other alternatives... The point I want to make with this is that in this show the narration is, above all, consequential. It constantly refers to previous events or circumstances, the attachment of the characters grows throughout and this development is kept as a basis for future interactions, both in the bigger picture and in slight and seemingly irrelevant details. This is true for all of them but particularly, as it's the main narrative focus, for the dynamics of Rin and Nadeshiko. Both learn from each other and we see how they gradually form an increasingly close relationship with some relevant transitions that have their emphasis in the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of the show is the experience of camping and the attachment to what it has to offer. Some people have said, not without reason, that the characters and the events are way too focused on camping, and that it is difficult to obtain a bigger picture of them when their lives and conversations are so conveniently reduced to their hobby. This never bothered me personally because I think the running theme of camping is more than enough to create a significant introspection to the characters, particularly because the very nature of this activity leads to a lot of quiet observation and naturalistic depiction, but I can understand this being an issue, particularly if you want to observe the characters in other situations or frames of mind, or if you get bored by the lack of variety of focus.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of its camping themes and focus, it also seems that a common issue among people who either disliked or don't share the enthusiasm for this show lies in the presence of a voiceover narrator who tells things to the viewer, serving as a tutorial for camping and giving advice. This is something I myself feel conflicted about, not because it bothers me personally, but because I honestly don't know how to draw the line and why do I find it acceptable and perfectly fine while other people feel completely unattached when it appears. To me I guess it has to do with how soothing the voice itself is, how it's strategically placed in the narration to avoid unnecessary interference with the natural interactions of the characters, or how at times it plays along with the characters and their mood.\\n\\n\r\nThrough its running theme of camping the show talks as well about friendship and opening up to new experiences. And where it excels at is not so much the inherent complexity of its themes, but the execution and particularly in the amount of right narrative decisions taken throughout to build a conclusion that is constructive and inspiring. One of the greatest merits of the writing in this series is how it never puts the characters in a situation where they are stated to be in the wrong or need to be fixed, despite the obvious contrast in their personalities and approaches. This is specially true for Rin, who is introduced as an introvert and loves camping alone at the beginning, and through the series she develops a liking for camping with people. But the loner Rin is still there for the entire series. And her introversion is not fixed either: it is an essential character trait of her and the other characters respect her boundaries. A good deal of the laid-back atmosphere in this show is achieved through the mutual respect the girls feel for each other. Nadeshiko, the initially hyperactive and potentially invasive personality that would force Rin to change, quickly understands that pressuring her is wrong, and lets her grow at her own pace. At the same time, she learns from Rin too, while not changing a bit of her outgoing and enthusiastic personality. It is very refreshing to see this sort of development, and it speaks volumes not only to the mutual understanding and empathy displayed by the characters, but to the narrative focus itself and the respect the writing shows for their agency and individuality.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they could be defined by basic personality archetypes. As said, Rin is the loner introvert and Nadeshiko the outgoing enthusiast. This is also true for the rest of the characters who all have a set personality and defined traits. While some people have mentioned this as a negative, I don't think Yuru Camp suffers from having characters that meet an archetype or *sigh* \"can be defined in a single phrase\". This is mostly because the writing stays refreshing and keeps finding new ways to explore the set traits of the characters throughout. And above all, it puts a lot of care in their interactions and chemistry together and with the surrounding environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe key word here is spontaneity. Everything in this series is built around this premise. The dialogues are filled with casual banter, they have some exposition here and there without feeling like infodumps, but the conversations feel perfectly down-to-earth and relatable, which is even more fascinating if one takes into account how quirky and differentiable their basic character types are. And as a result of this comes one of the greatest, and probably one of the most unsung, merits of this series.\\n\\n\r\nTake the scene with Saitou drawing a \"funny face\" in Chikuwa's photo. Take the Outdoors Club girls' silly imitations of camping objects and activities. Take the Santa Clangers, the \"intense\" chats between Rin and Saitou, Chiaki the evil kidnapper, Nadeshiko the granny and so on and on and on. There is something relevant around all of these moments. They are funny, but they don't need to. You don't need to find these jokes amusing in order for them to make sense because the ones they need to make sense to are the characters themselves. This lack of pandering is one of the things that put this show above so many of its competitors, particularly in the portrayal of friendships that, like any relationship, have their own codes and only make perfect sense to those who share them. Understanding this and not trying to tell the viewer \"hey, this is funny, that's why they are laughing\" but ultimately transmitting that the characters laugh because they genuinely, and no matter what you think, find this funny, is something I can never praise enough in this show. This is true even for Rin alone and her solitary interactions with her environment, filled with genuine moments of silliness and fun that are presented in the most natural way possible.\\n\\n\r\nA running theme with these girls and their relationships is the use of technology and this is another little aspect that I think deserves to be further emphasized. Where most other narratives either try to establish a contrast or never give enough importance to technology compared to \"real\", face-to-face interactions, Yuru Camp understands and applies both as a continuum of each other. They use their phones to communicate, to have fun together, to organize plans and etc. Rin and Saitou for instance understand each other extremely well, and yet, most of their interactions in the show happen through a phone chat. You don't need to see them together in a room to figure out how strong their friendship and mutual confidence is, and when it happens it only confirms what we already knew. Another example is in the relationship of Rin and Nadeshiko and how they connect deeply with each other even when they are hundreds of kilometers away, to the point that at one scene Nadeshiko literally wants to chat with Rin and serve as a remote travel guide to her solo camping adventure because that way she feels connected to Rin's journey.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least in this talk about characters and writing, going back to the importance of spontaneity, comes the comedy. Now, we all know the issue about comedy so it's not worth mentioning it again. What makes me laugh won't necessarily make you laugh and so on. But I can't deny that I laugh a lot with this series. Maybe even more than I could expect, considering how little it does to try to structure its jokes as, well, jokes. In fact, this may actually work in its advantage and it's absolutely worth mentioning the lack of a consistent straight man routine in this series. Whenever the characters do something silly, they seem to prefer playing along than reacting in disbelief or pointing out where the joke exactly is. As a result, a lot of these comedic moments feel spontaneous and lacking a separated structure, and above all, they don't overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately however, what makes Yuru Camp work and what explains its appeal to me is the synergy of all the individual elements mentioned above. Visual emphasis, soundtrack, character writing and storytelling combine to form a single and inseparable entity, which could only be achieved by putting individual care on each of them but also factoring a clear overall vision. The perfect embodiment of this lies in its conclusion, one of the most solid and appropriate I have ever seen in the medium, and which I don't think could even be possible had the show not been as carefully planned and integrated as it was during its whole run.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWow, this review went a long way. I had a lot of fun writing this, but think I owe you all an apology if you reached this point, specially considering that I haven't even used the word \"comfy\" yet in this review of Yuru Camp. Either way, thanks for taking your time to read this absurdly huge piece of enthusiastic rambling, if you have any feedback or commentary on what I wrote feel free to tell me.",

            "content": "In a part of the medium of anime where school settings are common, Yuru Camp decides to take us to the outdoors, and provides us with a fresh, more rare setting to indulge ourselves in.\r\nA large part of the appeal of Yuru Camp to me and many others is how the activities being shown can all be attempted in real life. This not only leads more people to try outdoor activities, but it allows people like me to relate to the time we spend outdoors. In my case, after many years of camping, hiking, backpacking, and hunting in Oregon, this show brings back memories ofmy childhood spent outdoors and the joys of friendship. With a setting in a show that connects you to an enjoyable part of real life, a whole new level of enjoyment is reached.\\n\\n\r\nAccomponing the story of this show is a comfortable blend of incredible landscape scenes, music, and tremendously cute characters. Many of the landscapes present in Yuru Camp are based upon real life locations in Japan, even the art of this show can bring you to connect with real places! With the art comes the music, which is composed of a relaxing collection of guitars, flutes, and other noises that compliment the story and art perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters, which make or break cute shows like this. There are 2 characters in which the most time is spent on, Rin and Nadeshiko, they are pretty much polar opposites. Rin is calm, independent, and loves to spend time alone, while Nadeshiko is full of energy and finds excitement from everything. When the two spend time together or communicate over texting, you can often see their personalities clash and cause moments that make you smile. The rest of the cast does not see too much time until later on, but still has their fair share of enjoyable moments. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 more minor parts of Yuru Camp that really stood out to me, this would be the traveling, and the food. The traveling by Rin on her moped shows just how independent she is, Rin is able to show us a variety of different dogs and different locations. Additionally, she often communicates with Nadeshiko and other friends by means of texting, these texts are often some of the most hilarious and enjoyable parts, every text is voiced and animated on the entire screen. This approach was unique and adds much enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there is the food. The food in Yuru Camp is yet another part that can be attempted in real life. Food is a major component of camping and Yuru Camp does not shy away from showing that. The entire process of cooking is usually displayed, from the preparation of ingredients all the way to the cute blobs of moe consuming these glorious, steaming Nippon delicacies. The cuteness of the food being eaten is absolutely outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nWith Yuru Camp, you can wash away the stresses of your life and dive into a world of comfort that is never eroded, and once the episodes are over, you can bring the activities to the real world, and you can see that sometimes outside isn\u2019t too bad. If you need some happiness and comfort in your life, Yuru Camp will deliver that, 10 times over.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "[6.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nEver spend the afternoon listening to those lo-fi hip-hop playlists on Youtube? The ones that play a long playlist of relaxing instrumentals over gifs of animated characters either studying, reading, or floating in outer space? If so, then you have probably experienced, through audio, the kind of feeling that Yuru Camp embodies and presents to you. The chirping birds and licking of river water as it wraps around the rocky shoreline. A group of students out at campsites, under no threat, in no danger, with no drama, cooking food for one another and conversing about what they value. The term here is \u201claid-back\u201d, and theshow translates that for its title. \\n\\n\r\nThe series here follows Shima Rin as she camps out in various locations around Mount Fuji, from lakes to open fields. Along the way, she meets Nadeshiko, a spunky, goofy pink-haired girl that has a similar, yet louder passion for camping. Later, we realize they go to the same school and lo-and-behold there is even a camping club, because of course there is, with a few other equally cute girls with a seemingly diehard passion for sleeping in linen huts outside. That\u2019s our story. No less and no more. \\n\\n\r\nFrom here we venture into their day-to-day lives. Without the burden of classes, social interaction, or growth for anyone but maybe Rin towards the end of the series. It really feels like a flatline in the best possible way, I suppose. As in, the line here is \u201ccomfort\u201d and the series encapsulates that comfort as well as it can within the parameters it draws. These parameters being the set locations during the winter in the small vicinity around where these characters live in Japan. It isn\u2019t for everyone but fortunately, it offers a lot to the crowd that really seems attached to the iyashikei presentation with a healthy dollop of feel-good humor. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Camping Under the Stars and Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nFunny faces, chibi inspired designs, and crackling campfires, Yuru Camp isn\u2019t going to blow you away visually. Much like the rest of the series, it often has an air of decentness that you can\u2019t help but acquiesce to after a few episodes roll by without your notice. That\u2019s kind of the charm of it. The character design is serviceable, without many standouts. Each girl has the expected wide pallet of hair-color and generally looks alright. Where the series, and the people making it, clearly put the most thought into was the honestly great variety of outfits worn. Now each one is a variation of winter-clothing, but they were never ridiculous or unbelievable and, throughout the runtime, each episode seemingly had a unique selection of designs to attach to these characters. Good stuff all around, here. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also not anemic, thankfully. The opening is catchy, the closer is quite frankly the best track in the series, and there enough background tunes to keep you engaged and on occasion bob your head to. Similar to those lo-fi hip-hop beats, that kind of melodic, unobtrusive, and relaxing feeling is injected into the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also nothing licentious here. Everything doesn\u2019t feel like it is there to sell sex. While this is something I hate to bring up in every anime I seem to review, it is a problem that just plagues this medium. While this series is easily pandering to a certain crowd, it\u2019s not doing so through sexual means and is never obnoxious about it and I will gladly take a series that doesn\u2019t drill sexual fanservice into your eyes every chance it gets. The entire thing feels wholesome, and a focus on sexualization would undermine that. The creatives seem to understand this and avoid it. Even the scenes in the hot springs are very neutral and don\u2019t have anything sleazy under the hood. Thumbs up for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the presentation is solid. I might even call it above average. It is where I expect a show like this to be. The directing is generally unremarkable, but the music and the decent production more than make up for that. The voice acting didn\u2019t blow my socks off but thankfully it avoids being shrill and loud. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Narrative, Characters, or Lack Thereof] \\n\\n\r\nDeadpan high schoolers, eccentric glasses, and alcoholic teachers with seemingly no care for students, there really isn\u2019t much to latch onto in this show. Of course, that\u2019s my opinion and I\u2019m sure for some just the serene experience of the whole thing can be enough. The atmosphere here is exceptional, but the characters that inhabit the atmosphere are about as normal as they come. Each one possesses a very minuscule amount of quirks or habits that didn\u2019t do much to intrigue me. While you could argue that\u2019s the point and the series wasn\u2019t trying to intrigue me, I can\u2019t help but feel like they could\u2019ve done more with these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, a show without a shred of conflict is just that, though, a show without a shred of conflict. Conflict grows characters and the deepest conflict here is often running out of food to eat. Again, that\u2019s the point, but there really should\u2019ve been more to the characters that we got to learn about as they bonded together. These girls, the four specific ones that took up most of the show, don\u2019t change or give us, the viewer, anything to chew on other than pretty scenery and delicious looking food. Which is a plus, the food looks great and watching cute girls eat food is something I will unabashedly indulge in (especially when it isn\u2019t obnoxiously over the top). Even Rin, our protagonist, who goes through the biggest \u201carc\u201d of the series doesn\u2019t get much to think about or ponder. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of conflict is a flaw in entertainment value, but a flaw that I think will easily be looked past by the people specifically looking for a series that doesn\u2019t have conflict and is an iyashekei. That\u2019s kind of the sharp-end of criticism, though, the flaws I see are often not what someone else sees. The nonchalant atmosphere is nice to sit back and enjoy, however, I doubt I\u2019ll be thinking back to this series as something memorable or worth revisiting. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nDo you want an overtly wholesome parade of cute anime girls camping? The comedy here isn\u2019t in abundance, but it\u2019s there. It\u2019s okay for anime comedy, too, occasionally making me breath air out of my nose. Yuru Camp relies on expectations more than anything. What do you want and ultimately, what engages you as a viewer? A lot of the flaws here, beyond some of the awkward CG vehicles and weaker animated segments are exceedingly subjective. It\u2019s hard to argue that this series isn\u2019t feel-good and it\u2019s almost impossible for me to say I didn\u2019t like a good portion of it. Even the slower moments were relaxing as all hell, and while the ideas presented here may feel myopic to some viewers, none of it felt tepid. Even the truly \u201claid-back\u201d moments, which manifested in five-minute segments of almost no dialogue, relaxing music, and maybe some monologuing, are relatively easy on the eyes and will, on more than one occasion, make you feel what this show is trying to make you feel. Comfortable.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and camping. This series makes you camp. Regardless of interesting characterization, what Yuru Camp does most well at is the meticulous creation of the scenarios at hand, here. A lot of the series is based on easy-reveals and drama-less conflict-resolution that feels good. For example, your hands are cold because it is cold out. You take your hand warmers and place them in your hands and exhale happily. That is a drama-less resolution, especially when one of your good friends walks up behind you and passes the hand-warmers to you and you smile and greet them. \\n\\n\r\nThis continues simply with the fact that the original creators of the manga this series is based on smartly made it set during the winter. A cold time that can often feel lonely alone. So of course, Rin, our lone-warrior of cute camping girls, ends up coming around and finding friends to camp with. Of course, there will be multiple scenes of snuggling up with yourself in a sleeping bag and cosplaying caterpillars. Because that\u2019s cute, and you can probably imagine just how warm that feeling is and in turn you are suddenly in a place of comfort and relaxation.  I commend the series for these smart creative choices that made for a better watch.\\n\\n\r\nThen it\u2019s the minuscule details to continue this streak of excessively unrealistic but ultimately satisfying interactions. Such as texting your friend at night and getting a response immediately. It almost never happens in the real world but damn it if it doesn\u2019t feel good when it does happen. Sharing a vista with a close one. Cooking food for someone and ultimately getting that favor returned by them later. Sharing a laugh. Admiring a sunset. Looking over the lake and not caring about tomorrow because hopefully today will last forever.\\n\\n\r\nThese are all great qualities and don\u2019t let my above-average score fool you. If you are seeking something like this, this may be the best show of the season for you. It is very time-oriented. If I was going through an excessively difficult time in real life and I threw this show on, at night, by myself, I would have most likely enjoyed it even more. Note that. Value what you value and don\u2019t let this wholesome series slip by you. \\n",

            "content": "We all search for a place to escape the difficult parts in life, whether it be movies, games or anime, we all seek something that makes us relax and enjoy living rather than stress about how difficult life is, Yuru Camp I think is the best when it comes to avoiding all that stress. \r\nYuru Camp is the most relaxing experience you might ever have in your life, the anime is great and you notice that from how happy you feel watching the episodes, each episode is like a new adventure with all characters being so loveable and cute it makes it an even moreamazing experience, you get to see how great camping is, why people love doing it and the amazing scenery that makes you want to get up and travel there just to see how wonderful it looks and that pretty much explains a lot of the charm in Yuru Camp.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much in the story other than the girls camping but you still enjoy it a lot watching how each character interacts with the others and how they move on and become better friends and their relationships get stronger which is very satisfying to see. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I loved the Kino No Tabi reference at the end :D Both this and Kino are in my favorite anime list. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Yuru Camp are great from the 5 MCs to the side characters, they are all very cute and loveable with each of them having her own characteristics that makes her unique and different from the rest, My personal favorite is probably Inuyama or Nadeshiko, Inuyama is only above the others because of how good her character design is (even though the rest of the designs, hers is just my favorite) while Nadeshiko is also better than the rest because of how cute her character is but in terms of overall characteristics then all of them are pretty much on the same level which shows how much attention was put into the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is phenomenal, The designs are great and the scenery and background is outstanding, if you somehow hate the characters you could just turn off the sound and subtitles and just enjoy how stunning it looks. \\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs are great, the Opening and Ending are amazing specially the ending since it really fits the atmosphere and all of that shows how great the sound directing is, well to be honest the directing of the whole anime was amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give it a 10/10 and I'm extremely sad watching one of the very few things that made me completely relaxed in my life end and I'm really going to miss it :'(  \\n\\n\r\nI can't believe I almost didn't watch it at the start of the season.\\n\r\nI can only hope for a 2nd season. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone that likes being happy tbh.",

            "content": "Yuru Camp can easily be described as the break out hit of the season, I highly doubt anyone could have predicted that Yuru Camp would have gotten as popular and highly regarded as it is. Yuru Camp does a lot right, but, I have a myriad of problems with the show; iyashikei is not a slice of life sub-genre and shouldn't be considered as such. Like the Thriller genre and the Mystery genre, it's easy to point out the similarities between both genres; but, what separates iyashikei and the slice of life genre is how they go about character development and narrative. Slice of lifeshows, like K-On, Gochiusa, and Nichijou, either are all sitcom-likes or they have a character driven story, Iyashikei shows on the other hand is setting oriented. Usually the settings of Iyashikei shows carry the story, the settings are often personified and have heavy symbolic significance within the narrative, the story and the appeal of Aria is largely based upon the interactions between the characters and the world of Aqua. Hidamari Sketch is a good example of a genre blend, the Hidamari apartments do hold significant value to the characters and does have symbolic value throughout the series, but on a moment to moment basis the appeal of the show is the interaction between characters. The same is true of Non Non Biyori. The slice of life genre and the iyashikei genre both attempt to capture the realities of life, but structure and the appeal of an iyashikei show is fundamentally different from that of a slice of life show. The appeal and structures of shows like Yokohama, Mushishi, Sketchbook, and Aria is completely different from the appeal of shows like Gochiusa, K-On, Demi-Chan, Yuru Yuri, and Kiniro Mosaic. It's easy to see why Iyashikei is considered a sub-genre, there are countless genre blends; but the iyashikei genre has grown so large and utilizes such different modes of character development and story telling, that one would be hard pressed to say that they are within the same genre when the shows on an individual level is examined.\\n\\n\r\nThe appeal of Yuru Camp is similar to Iyashikei shows, but the actual characters are written as if they are slice of life characters; every character except for Shima Rin is one dimensional, they are written around one character trait and most of the gags of the show revolves around seeing these character archetypes interact. Nadeshiko is the simple glutton archetype, Inuyama is the mother archetype, and Oogaki is the prankster archetype. Admittedly, most of the comedy in the show hits me, I laugh almost every episode; but had the show revolved around those three, I would have dropped the show by this point. Shima Rin is probably the most interesting character in the series, her introverted nature and passion for camping makes for an interesting juxtaposition to the members of the outdoors club. Most episodes can be divided into two parts, seeing the outdoor club going camping, and seeing Shima Rin go camping. The moments when the outdoor club goes camping is a great example of the typical slice of life show, the moments when Shima Rin goes camping is the closest the show come to being a proper iyashikaei show. Shima Rin gives the show a contemplative edge that is much needed. She is the tone setter of the show, she is what makes the show comfortable. Her interactions with nature isn't only fascinating but compelling. \\n\\n\r\nWhen discussing Yuru Camp with my friends, they often bring up how 'atmospheric' the show is, they often note the sound design and the beauty of the setting as whats appealing about the show; I disagree with the notion that Yuru Camp is atmospheric, if anything, it is universally accessible. The background art is based on real japanese campsites, it captures the feeling of camping very well, but the cartoonish designs of the Yuru Camp characters clashes poorly with the realistic background art. The character designs are cute, but they diminish the effect of the background art. The sound design of Yuru Camp is mediocre at best, the camp grounds don't actually feel that realistic, at least in comparison to other series. Yuru Camp is no Yokohama, or even Non Non Biyori in this regard. The most impressive use of sound was in Episode 7, when Nadeshiko and Shimarin are talking and the sounds of the camp fire is played over the subsequent flashbacks. The openings and the ending both sound pretty generic, but they fit the series well. The sound track of Yuru Camp is what first comes to mind when anyone says 'camping music.' The actual soundtrack of Yuru Camp is as generic as it gets. All of these factors coalesce into making the most accessible slice of life show i've ever seen, it avoids emotions other than happiness, and at times this becomes very grating because the show doesn't evolve in any way as time goes on. It makes Yuru Camp a very easy anime to recommend, it is perhaps the most relaxing shows i've ever seen; but the lack of character development and the mediocre art direction is a huge obstacle to me giving the show a higher score.",

            "content": "One of my favorite genres in anime is slice of life, I just really love how it makes me feel. Now there are different varieties of slice of life anime out there. There's romance, drama, school setting, and just in general every day life.\r\nYuru Camp is a typical every day life type of anime. What is it about? It's about a group of girls that go camping, and sometimes some of them go solo camping. And that's pretty much it.\r\nAdmittedly it doesn't have the most interesting of ideas, but it somehow makes it work. I fell in love with Rin and the rest of thegirls, seeing them interact and their friendship become stronger was just really rewarding to see.\\n\\n\r\nI'm an introvert in real life, so I'm always worried how anime will protray introverted characters, but in my opinion at least Rin is one of my favorite introverted characters out there. She wasn't made fun of, she wasn't hated on, no one thought she was strange for wanting time alone. \\n\\n\r\nShe's not socially awkward, she's not painfully shy. She's just more quiet than most, and that is how I personally am in real life.\\n\\n\r\nSo of course I was drawn to Rin immediately. Rin is the main character. As I said before she's a introvert, someone that likes being alone, but who doesn't mind the company occasionally, and I like that.\\n\\n\r\nNadeshiko is a hyper active girl that loves to eat. Normally hyperactive characters can be hit or miss for me, but I really enjoyed Nadeshiko's character a lot. She actually reminded me of a friend I had in high school, who like Nadeshiko was just very happy go lucky/hyperactive. Which was nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nI also really enjoyed how Rin and Nadeshiko's interactions became more valuable as the series continued. While Rin was okay with Nadeshiko camping with her, it was almost as though she wasn't quite sure how to act around her, in the sense that she looked at Nadeshiko oddly.\\n\\n\r\nBut as the series continued you could tell that they were becoming close friends. For instance Rin smiling whenever Nadeshiko did something, or Nadeshiko being so happy to see Rin.  \\n\\n\r\nNext is Aoi, a quiet, soft spoken girl who likes to joke around occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally Chiaki: A very loud and out going girl who isn't afraid to go after things that she wants.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters of course, but those are the main four characters. I really wish that Aoi and Chiaki had gotten more screen time, especially involving Rin, but their interactions were a lot of fun as well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not an outdoor person, I personally hate the cold, but this series actually made me want to go camping. \\n\\n\r\nI adored the characters, the characters interactions were a lot of fun to watch. I felt so comfy and had a big smile the majority of the time I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series had a normal length time in episodes, but it felt like just 5-10 minutes had passed instead of the 22+ minutes. Not saying that's how you'll feel of course , that's just how I personally felt with the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a slice of life fan, than you will likely enjoy this series, if you aren't a slice of life fan and are wanting to try slice of life series, maybe try something else first? And then work your way here? If you're just starting out in the slice of life genre this might be too slice of life for you, but maybe not, the only one who will really know is you.\\n",

Welcome to Yuru Camp\u25b3, a cutesy take on the slice of life aspect of camping, following a group of adventurous girls who love the outdoors as much as each other!\r\nWhat sucked me in to this story of camping was that the atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing. Leaving out the frantic setting in other anime, it let blissfulness shine through in an adorably positive manner. As someone who only knows about camping very straightforwardly, the simple presentation on the tips and techniques were given in an understandable format, andI definitely didn't mind learning about them! All the girls contained their own likable personalities, an entertaining factor on its own. Collectively, they were funny, happy, and all in all full of positivity. This was a simple yet great recipe to create a comfortable feeling of comfiness that warms you up. Their interactions with each other were pure. While they were close at heart upon meeting for the first time, the bonds became stronger every passing day in their camp life. It was an honest friendship that was enjoyable to watch while they set up their tents, cook their foods, or view the scenery as day turned into night. And I give my appreciation to the setting based on real sites such as Mount Fuji. These cozy areas seemed like they were great places to fully relax with nature.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I talk about setting, the outdoor landscapes were beautiful to look at. The attention to detail with the grass blowing or the reflections in the lake all added up into one simple but great visual. For the animation, it was essentially laid-back but it was a perfect complement for the peaceful atmosphere. Each girls possessed their own cute expressions when they were having a good time and I also loved their character designs. Their winter get-up was adorable, looking like a bundle of fluffiness. This presence of the girls enjoying the outdoor life together just makes the air around them so clean and refreshing. Ambience of natural sounds unwinded the body, preparing to absorb and connect to what nature can offer to us with its own environmental audio. Each scenes that were blown over by the soft soundtracks had a gentle and mellow vibe, enriching the quiet world of the lands away from the bustling cities. Whereas for the opening song, the upbeat tone matched the girls' lively personalities, and the soothing ending song concluded their enjoyable day on a tranquil note.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free from the rush of everyday life and go breathe in the fresh air of nature around us. Yuru Camp\u25b3 takes out all the current hassle and stress out of you, leaving you with feelings of content and a pleasant smile at every episode. So what's there more to wait? Bring in the marshmallows with you, we're going camping!",

The series is about camping. But it also reveals the enjoyment did you during the journey which is priceless. \r\nIt's make you feel to leave your busy life and enjoy the bliss of nature. \r\nIt's a comfy anime to enjoy. It's make you realise the fun involving spending nights under the stars. The background music is also very soothing. It's also provide little knowledge about camping.

            "content": "Have you ever wanted to go camping but without the camping? Yuru camp was made for you then. This is probably the most lighthearted show Ive ever seen. Enough backstory lets get to the review. \r\nStory is a 7/10. Its not the most amazing story, its camping. Bland on paper but animated its quite the trip. Again its not a crazy wild story but its a damn good enough one to make a show out of. \r\nArt is a 9/10. The art in this show is godly. Mt Fuji looks great, the characters are adorable, the food doesnt look like a sopping wet urinal cake.Its fantastic. I hope a season 2 of this show drops soon because id love to watch more. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is an 8/10 mostly because the OP sounds like something from an 80's sitcom. The voice actresses and actors perfectly fit the roll of the character they've been chosen to voice. \\n\\n\r\nWhich moves me on to the characters\\n\\n\r\n10/10. Now they arent just 10/10 because muh waifu (which some of them are but shhh) its a 10 because the characters are fun to watch. Nadeshiko is an adorable pink haired girl with so little brain cells you get dumber just watching her but WHO CAAAAAAAARES shes cute (also once you hear her say rin chan its burned into your hearing). Rin is a girl who doesnt give a flying fuck-knuckle about nadeshiko but she puts up with her because camping alone isnt thaaaat much fun. Everyone else is stupid(except Aoi) because their role in the show isnt needed. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 for enjoyment. What can i say im a simple man. I see cute pink retard I click on cute pink retard. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL this show is probably an 8/10. I wish it were a bit longer but alas its not.",

If you don't, you probably won't like it because there is nothing else.  The only \"conflicts\" in the show are generally caused by the overreactions, are easily resolved, and result in little permanent change.  The humor is also a major problem in the show.  Some of the visual gags and blunt deliveries of dialogue are funny, but it often disrupts the pacing, and most of the jokes just aren't funny.  \r\nAnother problem is the constant narration.  I cansee they like the food they are all smiling, I don't need all 4 characters to independently say it.  There is literally a narrator character for no reason who decides to interject at random points and completely disrupt the flow.  There are some decent characters and some incredibly annoying ones.  At times the music works and at times is extremely repetitive and distracting. The opening and ending themes are very good.\\n\r\nThe show does what it is supposed to do well though.  The scenery is pretty, the food looks tasty, and at times is relaxing.  Overall 5/10",

            "content": "Sometimes, it\u2019s nice to relax. Maybe you\u2019ve been burned out on intense, energetic shows and need a change of pace. Maybe you\u2019ve come from a long day of work and need something to relieve the stress. Whatever the reason, you\u2019re looking for something a bit more laid-back that you can take in without having to pay too much attention to convoluted plots or segments with extended dialogue. This is the Iyashikei genre in a nutshell, often characterised by works like Mushishi and Flying Witch, shows in which comparatively little actually happen but which managed to be soothing through the beautiful ambience of their setting orthrough the joy of experiencing the simpler pleasures in life. In this regard, Yuru Camp is an Iyashikei through-and-through. \\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019re treated to a series of gorgeous establishing shots of the scenery from the very beginning. While these shots aren\u2019t as detailed or vivid as you might get from a Shinkai film or a KyoAni series, they\u2019re still very impressive and immersed me in the series almost immediately. The environment is coloured with soft tones that blend with each other almost seamlessly. This contrasts with the designs for the characters themselves, which are much more vibrant in a way that perhaps reflects their lively nature, particularly for the bundle of joy that is Nadeshiko with her bright, pink hair. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this anime is stellar, with many of the tracks having a style that I can only describe as being a cross between celtic and traditional japanese folk. It's a distinct sound that you'd recognise immediately upon hearing, but also low-key and pleasant to listen to. Other sound effects, such as the the breaking of sticks, fire, and even slapstick moments like Nadeshiko's face sliding down a window all sound completely authentic and help pull you into the experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, you have the stoic, reserved Rin who\u2019s most comfortable by herself, contrasting with the hyperactive bundle of energy that is Nadeshiko. It\u2019s one of my favourite character dynamics to witness in anime and it\u2019s almost always entertaining and incredibly cute to watch. There's a number of side characters as well, all with personalities that make them a joy to watch even if they don't get nearly as much development as the main pair. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface there\u2019s not really much of a story here, being a show about girls going camping and doing camping things. I would say that the core of the story is in how each girl develops as a person; how Nadeshiko discovers a new hobby through a chance encounter with Rin, and how Rin\u2019s interactions with different kinds of people changes her perspective on friendship and brings her out of her cold, seemingly impenetrable shell. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is an absolute pleasure to watch and very quickly became the highlight of my week. Whether you\u2019re watching this just after coming home from a long day at work or late at night before going to sleep, I think you\u2019ll really love this. It's by far the comfiest show of the Winter 2018 season.\\n\\n\r\nI can definitely see Yuru Camp becoming a new benchmark in the Iyashikei genre, much in the way Flying Witch and Aria were. Here's hoping for a second season!",

            "content": "OH HELL YES, another AOTS contender (besides Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho) and with EVEN LESS marketing from a budding studio (C-Station of Starmyu fame and forget all the other crap they did), with a simple yet engaging premise that's all about camping and with that, a lesson on camping skills and whatnot along with the simple character designs and personalities, with the beautiful breath-taking art that makes this series a sleeper hit indefinitely! Smiliar to Yorimoi, another (presumed) 11/10 rating that sums up how much I enjoyed the Iyashikei (healing) effect from start to end, and will miss this series to say the least:(\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWell, the starting point for this show is kinda intriguing as it shows Nadeshiko Kagamihara (WOW what a tongue-twister this name is) moving over from Shizuoka to Yamanishi to capture the view Mount Fuji right on Japan's 1000-yen bill. Problem is, after the whole journey and reaching her destination, only to fall asleep. Enter Rin Shima, the self-proclaimed girl who can camp out (and I guess her purpose is exploration) and is a skilled one that knows the way of camping (with her grandpa being the narrator if you haven't guessed so already), and with that, the journey of an after-encounter of the duo headstarts to find places of interest (of camping of course) whilst opening up to one another, and eventually with the Outdoor Camping Club duo (Aio Inuyama, Chiaki Oogaki), the (another quadruple) 4 girls attempt to learn all about camping, from finding the right places to the right equipment needed for a lasting experience, and ending off on a high note that's to expect with enjoying each other's company.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for comparison sake between Yorimoi and Yuru Camp:\\n\r\nSimilarities - Group of CGDCT-esque girls doing their stuff, and enjoying to the best of their abilities, and just soaking in the atmosphere.\\n\r\nDifferences - The course of their heading (plot pointers), the overall atmosphere (calm and composed vs. happening and progressing), and of course the source material (Yorimoi being an original work vs. Yuru Camp from the manga source of the same name)\\n\\n\r\nNo matter the similarities and the differences, both shows are definite must-watch-ers from the get-go from Winter 2018, and quarterback AOTSes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIt is with NO doubt that Yuru Camp's strongest point is at its characters (see the similarity?), and how their engagement with each other piques their interest and bad-rubbing, though the latter (I believe) serves as a plot pointer in the friendships.\\n\\n\r\nRin Shima (CV: veteran Nao Touyama of Nisekoi's Chitoge) is a nice protagonist-esque character, seeing that her abilities (learnt from her grandfather) serves her well as a solo, lone camper, entrusting herself with all the hard work from start to finish. Of course, that is until Nadeshiko's enthusiasm rubs her the wrong way at first till acceptance, and in that essence, opens her cold heart towards others who have the same interest and ambitions. To that extent, IMO I can really emphatize with Rin because most of the time she's a loner, until that heart warms up to other people and being welcome of it, definitely appreciate the progression of Rin.\\n\\n\r\nIMO the best girl (and waifu), Nadeshiko Kamigahara (CV: Yumiri Hanamori of Grimoire of Zero's Zero) IMMEDIATELY stands out above the rest for her enthusiasm that's so mesmerizing (and NO I'm NOT kidding) and encouraging others with her wwwiiiiddddeee brilliant smile across her face with her weird antics that make her one of the most covenanted characters in the series to no end. Everything of her feels like a joke, yet in a comical sense that delivers strong on the aspects of the show, knowing when to take a dump on jokes and whatnot that comes as a striking resemblance to how we enjoy our youth by doing stupid things that made no sense, but enjoy it for the fervor that gives us the presence of our younger times.\\n\\n\r\nThe Outdoor Camping Club gang of Aoi Inuyama, Chiaki Oogaki and Ena Saitou (voiced by supporting CVs Aki Toyosaki, Sayuri Hara, Rie Takahashi) also delivers on the plot points from their inclusion to the series (when Nadeshiko is introduced to the club) to the camping engagement with Rin, and it all makes up with none of the half-assed effort and goes full-on with their character personalities via the relationship towards Rin and Nadeshiko, and both of them serve their purpose as to be aspiring campers (again, like the other camping experienced duo), to make full use of their time to enjoy camping to the max.\\n\\n\r\nPlus the other side-characters, another strong lineup of characters that are just willing to try and not get fazed even by (minor) challenges (such as Chiaki and Nadeshiko's shock towards the expensive equipment), so much so that it's exciting to watch these characters mingle with one another and enjoy a purposefully themed Yuru (Laid-Back) Camp.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nC-Station (of Starmyu fame) did an impressive job on this manga adaptation, recapturing the sights and wonders of the simple yet artisitic manga drawings into the anime art that is chock full with the most beautiful and realistic of sites found in real life (e.g. 1000-yen billed Mt. Fuji in Episode 1).\\n\r\nTo see sites replicated in real life into anime form, that is truly the blessing of those of us who have done camping as a hobby and it certainly brought tears of joy that the experience is undoubtedly the same as it was in real life. Thumbs up for keeping the art aesthetics consistent with animation that's not too glaring nor uneasy that spoils the visuals, and instead, basks in the natural state of the world as we see fit.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAnother OST to look out for in Winter 2018, and an awesome and comfy one at that!!!\\n\\n\r\nMusic composer Akiyuki Tateyama definitely has props when it comes to music (through Shimoneta and Kemono Friends), and it shows here to a T. Anybody who has listened to the OST will definitely agree on its surprising narration, starting with Asaka's energetic OP \"Shiny Days\" (which bears a striking similarity to Jackson 5's \"I Want You Back\", \"ABC\"), ending with Eri Sasaki's calm, relaxing acoustic ED \"Fuyu Biyori\" (still loving her bright, warm voice as evidently heard in Plastic Memories OP which STILL really brought tears of joy) to the BGM which fits so carefully and glides along with the present situation at hand. Overall, another strong OST in the books.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAside from being some people's AOTS, this hidden gem truly is a blast to watch and be immersed if just for the camping aspect alone. This series overall really blew my mind away at how simple yet enticing the show-and-tell ability that most shows try to do but fail outright, and this is the one exception of a few that did what it was supposed to do from the outset, with great fervor and confidence.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? Maybe we should try to appreciate the outliers more (such as this, Yorimoi etc.) than just a show that we would skip from the beginning, and this show gave me hope that more of us can be exposed to these kinds of shows. A heartfelt recommended watch so we can all be exposed to the life and hobby of more than just the camping life.\\n\\n\r\n...And now I feel tempted to travel to Japan to just experience the camping life :-(\\n\r\nIT'S THAT MESMERIZING AND GOOD!!!",

            "content": "Yuru Camp\u00a0is based off of a manga by Afro. Which I'm fairly certain is a circle's name and not the name of the actual author. Afro is known for Anthology comics based off of works like Madoka, Sakura Trick, Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka & Sansha Sanyou. I'm detecting a pattern and it has to do with lots of cute girls and heavy shoujo-ai. This may be a circle after my own heart. It was adapted into an anime by C-Station. C-Station is one of those studios I've never heard of. They've got a list of nine anime they've worked on, according to MAL andthis is the first one I've watched.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open with young Shima Rin going on a solo camping trip. She stumbles across a girl sleeping near the camp site and thinks nothing of it, until late at night when the girl approaches her, crying because she overslept. This is Kagamihara Nadeshiko, a young lady who just moved into the area. Rin shares some of her pre-packaged camp food and lets Nadeshiko warm up by her fire until her sister arrives to pick her up. In a completely unsurprising coincidence, Nadeshiko has enrolled in Rin's school. She quickly joins the outdoor club with Oogaki Chiaki & Inuyama Aoi. From there we basically get our cast of young ladies bonding over camping.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real issue I have with the story telling is that they kind of do the Tsuritama\u00a0thing where they occasionally spend too much time on the mechanics of the outdoors activity. Although this series isn't nearly as bad about it and does a better job of giving you small snippets that integrate well into the story instead of the long diatribes that series had. They do go on too long about camping equipment on a few occasions though. You'd almost think they were sponsored by an outdoor goods store.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWith that relatively minor complaint out of the way, let's move on to the positives. First off, this series is really relaxing and charming. It's one of those anime that you just feel good watching. Rather like So Ra No Wo To.\u00a0The snappy banter among the girls is superb. Saitou probably gets the best lines in the series in that regard. Maybe they figured they needed something to make her stand out since she doesn't go camping most of the time and just kind of chats with the others using text messaging. The humour is really well executed and this series has a lot of strong comedic moments. I also appreciate that they address the financial barrier that people have to face when taking up a hobby like camping. And this series loves dogs, which I can appreciate. Not only does Saitou have a dog, but virtually every episode has incidental dogs somewhere. It even gets little details right like how chihuahuas don't do well in the cold, like to burrow and wear bunny outfits for nefarious purposes.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have a decent degree of complexity to them, which you don't often see in cutesy slice of life works. They also mesh very strongly for comedic purposes. Which is part of the reason that the banter is so excellent. Even the incidental characters they encounter on their excursions tend to have a good degree of verisimilitude.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is really nice. The characters are done in a pretty typical moe style which may not be impressive but does look good, and the scenery scenes are absolutely amazing. The series is also really good at drawing dogs. Whether they're just being encountered randomly or they're being put in little outfits. The level of detail put into the camping gear is also pretty impressive but camping gear isn't dogs so it's not that important.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0The main cast is voiced by Takahashi Rie, Touyama Nao, Hara Sayuri, Hanamori Yumiri & Toyosaki Aki. All of whom are really good in this. I'll also give Tateyama Akiyuki credit for doing a really good job on the soundtrack. You may recall that te did well with Kemono Friends too. The track in this might be a tad better.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's quite a bit. Rin and Nadeshiko in particular get a lot of moments, including sneaking into one another's tents in order to sleep together, although in both situations there's an explanation given beyond just them wanting to sleep together. There's also some stuff with Aoi deliberately making Chiaki jealous.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nSo, the writer for this clearly has a strong fondness for shoujo-ai, dogs and camping. Two of those things are interests we share but you're not catching me out in the woods where some slasher film shit could go down and there are biting insects. All in all, though, I found this to be a highly endearing, enjoyable little series. If you hate the more cutesy slice of life style stories, it's not going to change your mind. If you like them, even if only occasionally or when a really strong one comes along, chances are pretty high that you'll enjoy this one. For myself, I give it a 9/10.\u00a0\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended for those that have finished watching Yuru camp and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers present within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nRelaxing with Nadeshiko and friends as they show us how enjoyable camping can be\r\nBased off a popular manga of the same name Yuru camp which is also known by its English title of laid back camp is a comedy and slice of life anime that makes use of as its main premise a simple but easily relatable question that most travellers and explorers would ask themselves.Would camping in beautiful areas be more fun if you were camping with friends that share your passion for it? What will happen if one day you encounter people that share the same passion as you do in camping but even though they lack experience they more than make up for it by being keen to try it for the first time. What if you learned the joy and warmth that will come from doing something with friends that you all enjoy passionately. While simple this premise and intro, I felt resonated with me because as humans we all wish to explore new areas we haven\u2019t been to before, eat new food we haven\u2019t tasted before and learn to do things we couldn\u2019t do before. What will be better than that you ask? Of course, it will be doing these things with friends that share the same passion as you do. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of the series I felt made a strong impression on me because the main characters contrasted a great deal with each other both in terms of skills at camping and because they had personalities and attitudes that were opposites from each other. The desire to see how Nadeshiko\u2019s desire to learn how to camp after seeing Rin\u2019s skill was one of the reasons why I decided to stick with this anime and I'm glad that I did. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series follows a rather interesting group of high school girls that have a shared interest in a subject that not many girls their age would be interested in which is camping outdoors. These girls while not knowing each other at first gradually met as the series went on finding a topic that they are all passionate about and in the process forging a friendship between them that grows as they learn to both appreciate how fun camping is and how fun it is to enjoy it with friends that share your passion for it. This group includes the energetic and bright new student Nadeshiko, the cool and independent camper Rin, the positive and kind Aoi and the kind and playful Satou. Settings wise the series takes place in the areas around Mount Fuji while at the same time showcasing various campsites that are within the area that the main cast visits over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nRin\\n\\n\r\nRin Shima voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Asterisk Wars and Gate fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of the two protagonists of the series.  A high school girl that lives in the same area as Nadeshiko and the others Rin is someone that on first glance can come off as someone that\u2019s unsociable and cool by nature which comes from the fact that like most high school girls her age Rin is someone that prefers to not get involved with anything that may prove troublesome. As a result of this personality in the beginning of the series, Rin was somewhat of a loner that while getting along with her classmates and teachers at her school was otherwise distant from them. The sole exception to this rule, in the beginning, was her friendship with her classmate Satou as both seemed to understand each other well enough. Beneath this cool exterior of hers, it can be seen that Rin is also someone that is kind and considerate of others and is a hardworking and determined person by nature. As a result of her independent nature, Rin is someone that is calm and composed by nature and is relatively mature for someone of her age. The most prominent trait of Rin which also serves as the series main theme is naturally her love of camping outdoors. In line with this trait is what can be said to be Rin\u2019s core motivation and desire in life which is her willingness to use her hobby to further challenge herself and improve herself by learning to be independent by finding new places to camp at and prepare the campsite herself something that I find most admirable about her. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series Rin was somewhat of a loner and while maintaining her normal life as a schoolgirl maintained mostly cordial relations with her fellow classmates with her main focus being split between her desire to find good places to camp at and school. The sole exception to this rule is her close relationship with her fellow classmate Satou and the two can be seen to be the best of friends. Because of her desire to keep out of the affairs of others at the beginning of the series Rin was somewhat wary of strangers that she encounters whether in school or during her camping trips and tries hard to stay away from them when possible. Apart from causing her to be a loner this also made Rin somewhat determined to camp solo rather than camp with friends as she felt that doing so would cause trouble for her especially if the other party was a rookie. As the series progresses this also conflicts with the pride that she has developed as a solo camper as the number of camping trips that she has been on is many. As the series progresses however and Rin encounters like minded girls that share her hobbies notably Nadeshiko this attitude of Rin\u2019s starts to change, and she starts to gradually open herself up to others becoming more cheerful and positive and be more willing to assist them by providing them with important camping tips as well as suggestions of camping locations for their use. The most significant change that came out of this development was without a doubt the bond that Rin managed to forge with Nadeshiko who despite their unusual first encounter soon become fast friends that shared the same hobbies. The little contests between the two as they compare camping locations as well as the exchange of photos between the two that show the night scenery I felt was pretty cute and heartwarming and was a great indication of Rin\u2019s development as a character and proof of the friendship that she had managed to forge with Nadeshiko and the others. As a character, I felt that Rin was a well designed and developed character and I felt that her seiyuu Nao Toyama really did an excellent job of portraying her.  \\n\\n\r\nNadeshiko \\n\\n\r\nNadeshiko Kagamihara voiced by veteran seiyuu Yumiri Hanamori is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the two protagonists of the series. A high school girl that recently moved into the area Nadeshiko is a positive and energetic girl that\u2019s also innocent and somewhat clumsy while also being happy about it. In terms of personality, Nadeshiko can be said to be something of a free spirit as while somewhat clumsy Nadeshiko is also relaxed and ditsy and can get excited with the most trivial of things. In this, it\u2019s perhaps fair to compare her with a puppy as both are similar in terms of temperament. A kind and caring girl by nature Nadeshiko is someone that does her best in all things and once she gets focused on an idea she will do her utmost to fulfil it no matter what that task entails. True to her nature Nadeshiko is someone that remembers the deeds that people have done for her and will always try to pay people back when possible. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, Nadeshiko had a rather fortunate encounter with Rin after they encountered each other during the latter\u2019s camping trip to see Mount Fuji. Though in the beginning of the series Nadeshiko had no experience with camping at all her first encounter with Rin and seeing first hand what camping entailed ultimately made her interested in taking up camping and along the way growing to love it. In line with her desire to take up camping was her meeting with members of the outdoors club that did well to improve the prospects of that club as it allowed them to fulfil that club's main goal of being able to go camping. As the series goes on Nadeshiko\u2019s personality gradually changes. While still somewhat clumsy and forgetful Nadeshiko by interacting with her fellow outdoor club members and with Rin gradually learns to be more responsible and learns to value the friendships and bonds that she forges with others more. Additionally, like Rin and the other members of the outdoor club, she also learns to appreciate the freedom and bonds that camping together with friends can help create. The character of Nadeshiko I felt was an interesting one and while she was a bit of a klutz at the beginning of the series I felt that her development from that and into someone that\u2019s responsible and motivated was well done. In a way, I felt that her meeting with Rin and her introduction into camping was what created a new-found goal within Nadeshiko\u2019s life. I felt that her seiyuu Yumiri Hanamori really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Nadeshiko. \\n\\n\r\nAoi \\n\\n\r\nAoi Inuyama voiced by veteran seiyuu Aki Toyosaki of Ange Vierge and Accel World fame is one of the main characters of the series and is a fellow member of the outdoors club. A high school girl that lives in the area Aoi is a kind, caring and intelligent person by nature that serves as a foil to her fellow outdoors club and club president Chiaki. In contrast to the hyperactive Nadeshiko and the overeager club president, Chiaki Aoi is, for the most part, a calm and relaxed person that brings logic and rational thoughts to the many discussions that the club partakes in. However, at times Aoi has the habit of endorsing ideas that sound somewhat unusable as well and often causing the said discussion to go into hilarity. While not as excitable as the other two members of the club Aoi is also someone that\u2019s clear-headed and can come up with plenty of interesting ideas that are more normal and fitting for the club than the ones that Nadeshiko and Chiaki can come up with. As a result of this within the club, Aoi can be seen to be the calmer member that keeps the antics of her club mates under control while also trying to be understanding and helpful to others that may not know what camping entails. While calm and composed for the most part it can be seen that Aoi also has a playful side to her as she loves to tease and joke with others a fact that really added charm to her character. A prominent trait of Aoi\u2019s is the speech mannerisms that she adds to her words which I felt was pretty unique and matched well with her personality. As a character, I felt that Aoi was an interesting character that served to balance out the members of the outdoors club a task that I felt she excelled in. I felt that her seiyuu Aki Toyosaki really did an excellent job in portraying her character. \\n\\n\r\nEna \\n\\n\r\nEna Saitou played by veteran seiyuu Rie Takahashi of Re Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series. A high school girl that lives in the area Ena is a cheerful, kind and positive girl by nature that approaches each day and situation with a smile and an easy-going attitude. A friend and a fellow classmate to Rin Ena is one of the few people that are close to Rin within the school and it can be seen they have a very deep bond with each other. Before meeting the members of the outdoors club and Nadeshiko, in particular, Ena was the closest friend that Rin had, and they often have long conversations with each other about the most random of topics. This aspect of their relationship I felt was interesting and I really enjoyed seeing the kind of conversations that the two had. While Kind and caring towards Rin Ena is also perceptive and through their long association is acutely aware of Rin\u2019s love of camping as well as her pride as a solo camper. Outwardly while supportive of Rin\u2019s solo activities and hobbies it can be seen that Ena is also somewhat worried about Rin\u2019s determined efforts to maintain a distance from people and avoid making any friends in the process. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Ena I felt was an interesting one as her main role within the series was to mainly act as a support pillar for Rin that acted to support her and guide her in the right direction as her personality gradually changed as she met Nadeshiko and the others. In addition to this role, she also acted as a sense of comic relief for the series with her actions of messing up Rin\u2019s hair and her walking in on Rin doing something being especially funny. All in all, I felt that the character of Ena was a well-designed one and that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job in voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I felt that the series really had some beautiful animation with regards to the scenery that main cast visit as part of their camping trips. This scenery I felt did a great job at showcasing the various camp locations that the cast visit as well as showing the vast number of terrain types that campsites can feature. The character designs for the anime I felt were also pretty well done with each character being well designed and unique enough in terms of appearance as they are in character. The music for the series I felt was also a strong point as it reflected well with the main theme of the series being a slice of life anime that had camping as its main theme. The relaxing music that was used for the scenes of the series I felt added a sense of calmness and a relaxed feel to them that had the effect of making you want to enjoy each scene slowly. Kinda like reaching a new location and trying to enjoy the view of the new area. The voice acting for the series I felt was pretty good and I felt that the main voice cast did an excellent job in voicing their respective characters. In particular, I felt that Nao Touyama, Yumiri Hanamori, Aki Toyosaki and Rie Takahashi deserve special praise as I felt that they did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. Aki Toyosaki\u2019s voice, in particular, was very calming as well and her speech mannerisms really made her stand out.  Along with the physical interactions between characters, I also felt that the text message exchanges between Rin, Nadeshiko, and Satou that were done via their assigned seiyuu\u2019s was also something that was well done and matched well with the theme of camping as it mimics the long distances that can separate the main characters from each other.  Along with the main cast, I felt that proper respect should also be paid to the narrator of the anime who narrates the helpful camping tips segments as the characters encounter them. These camping tips and insights I felt was really interesting and matched well with the theme. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Laid-Back Camp was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strengths being its unique theme, strong story, well designed and developed characters, excellent animation and music and excellent voice acting. The main theme and topic that Laid-back camp makes use of as its overall subject topic is camping outdoors with friends a common thing for sure but one that is seldom seen in animes. As a member of the indoors group I always wondered what it will be like if you were able to go about exploring new areas in the day and staying there in the night in a camp that you yourself had set. The thrill of finding a beautiful location that you can take the time to admire during both the day and night must have been something magical. While camping itself may sound like a simple thing when compared with other topics that we see in animes I felt that simplicity is what makes this anime\u2019s theme that much powerful as countries around the world would have many places that have stayed untouched by humanity places that one can still admire the beauty off. Sometimes its worth it to take the time off and just take a load off your shoulders and just relax and take in the sights something this series is able to accomplish well thanks to its masterful use of great music that is paired with a relaxing atmosphere. Along with the theme of camping and learning what that entails another theme that was tied in was the act of forging bonds with like-minded people that share your passion for camping and in the process forging lasting friendships. This theme I felt matched perfectly with the theme of camping as like everything in this world camping is an activity that is best done when you are with friends. Seeing Rin, Nadeshiko, Chiaki, Aoi and Ena all enjoy themselves while camping together really reminds you that activities like camping while also fun can also serve to forge strong bonds of friendship by doing something that they all enjoy. One surprising theme within the series that I really enjoyed seeing that I never actually expected was the many tasty looking food that we got to see the cast partake in during their many camping trips. While these items were mostly simple ones this matched well with the theme of having fun and enjoying the act of camping outdoors as out there food that is considered simple are also often the ones that are the most fulfilling which is especially rewarding after a long trek to the campsite. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series I felt was pretty interesting and seeing Rin gradually break out of her shell while bonding with Nadeshiko and the members of the outdoors club over a topic that they are both passionate about was something that I really enjoyed seeing. While Laid back Camp was an excellent anime that had a great premise and story I also felt that the anime also served well as an educational tool as it featured plenty of helpful tips and info segments on various camping tools and items that are used when camping. These are not merely limited to the tools but also extend to the food that the cast eat when camping something as well that was appreciated greatly. In terms of final score, I can say with confidence that I feel that it definitely deserves a final score of 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So far up until episode 9 i can't see nothing wrong with this. If you having a bad day and you watch this anime, i can guarantee that you will forget all the bad things that happen. I agree with some of the review that watching this anime will make you comfortable. If you enjoy something like K-ON this anime is highly recommended for you.\r\nStory: 8\r\nI gave it 8 because,  after in a couple of episode you kinda already know what is going to be happen next. The other reason is because the use of cliche that make the story line look like tooconvenient. But apart from that it really educational, from giving you a couple of tips for camping to giving you a small trivial things that you have to know if you want to go camping.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art and design of this anime is unbelievable. As if they using a very beautiful painting of Japan landmark, and it is really captivating. Not to mention they put on effort to animate the water around the magnificent scenery. The character art are enough to keep you distracted from the exquisite view.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI got no complaint for the sound team. Their works contribute a big part for making this anime really comforting to watch. Every BGM that played really sets the mood for the scene, and when you combine it with a wonderful art you got a perfect recipe. The opening and ending theme song is also really incorporate the playfulness and the other element that present in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe character are neatly design, and for the seiyuu casting i see a familiar faces and they did a great job making the character felt alive. For the development of the character you can see a progress of the relationship between character and the improvement of the personality are really interesting. (P.S. you can see the character designer are not slacking with the design for the clothes for each character especially for Shima Rin and Kagamihara Nadeshiko)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI give a solid 9 for enjoyment, for the reason that every time in the end of every episode makes me wanting for more. Because like i have mention before this anime really comforting, soothing, and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.2 ((8+10+10+9+9)/5=9.2)\\n\r\noverall for me this anime scores 9.2. It like this anime quite much with a reason that i have stated before. I didn't gave it a perfect score because the story is quite lacking. But apart from that this anime captivated my heart. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude my review, if you looking to watch some SOL anime that really relaxing and comforting then i will highly recommend to watch this anime. And in this anime i found a different side of one my favorite seiyuu which is Touyama Nao.",

            "content": "Update:\r\nYuru Camp is the anime that kick-started my love for SoL anime and brought me back to loving anime. It's one of the best SoL anime I've seen. To breakdown why this anime is so good, here are my talking points.\r\nStory: One of the most relaxing and casual storylines I've ever seen, coupled with tips about camping and the occasional laughter, very few anime storylines can match that. In addition, the storyline becomes more and more interesting as the anime goes on, finally ending with the whole group camping together! That to me is one of the highlights of the show. Plus, at the endof the anime, we finally get to see Nadeshiko go solo camping which to me really shows how much Nadeshiko has grown throughout the show Hence I give the story a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: One of the most beautiful, scenic and illustrious art I've seen in anime, Yuru Camp has got art on point. From the majestic Mount Fuji seen in episodes 1 and 4, to overlooking of the cities, the art makes one appreciate the skill of the animator making the art. A perfect 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Most catchy opening and one relaxing ending. In addition, I like the relaxing soundtrack that is played throughout the series. Add onto that the comforting sounds of the great outdoors. A solid 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Kudos to the producers for making the most unique characters I've seen thus far. Especially for Shimarin and Inuyama. Shimarin's purple eyes and long blue hair is very unique and one of a kind, while Inuyama's fangs makes her very funny. All the characters are likable which is good. Again, a perfect 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You know an anime is good when you have to rewatch some episodes while it's still ongoing. So a perfect 10/10! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: One of the best SoL animes I've seen and probably the best anime I've seen this season. So far from the episodes shown already, this anime definitely deserves a season 2! 10/10!",

            "content": "*im still a beginner writer, and english is not my native language. sorry. Also, please help me to get better on this :) *\r\nYuru camp or Laid-Back camp is a really relaxed and lighthearted Slice of life anime. It's served as a fun, comfy, and refreshing anime with a high-school cute girls It even has a comedy touch on it. However, this anime isn't only about the cute girls life. It's about camping.\r\nFor me, They've shown Camping as the main focus here, rather than the characters. Every episodes provide us with camping facts & lessons and they did it in a really fun way. Also,almost every episodes shown us different way to camp. Solo camp or group camp. Solo camp is a great way to relax, and group camp is a great way to have fun. I really can felt the difference here, especially because its supported by it's soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation and Sountracks did really well. Almost perfect for me. The landscapes, the music are really matching to each other, making me goosebumps everytime. They also did well on the camera work, giving a perfect feel for an outdoor activity. The landscapes are beautiful, pretty sure almost all of the locations based on real life and they are again, beautiful. For the soundtracks, it's perfect. Every soundtrack give me this different \"vibe\" from each of it. Solo-camping's OST has this beautiful guitar touch, making us feeling comfortable and relaxed just the way it really is. While group-camp's OST has this fun OST making us active to friends. The openings & the ending also did well, they are pretty jazzy which is really\\n\r\ncomfy.\\n\\n\r\nNothing special on the Characters. It shown less development on the characters besides their relationships. It has new girl that are very new on camping, leading us to learn about it just like her. It has a novice, that gave us facts about camping and even few spots refrences (XD). Nevertheless, it's still a good choice to use highschool girls as the character because they are really relaxing on some ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs the last few words,\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime.",

            "content": "What a cute and relaxing series! It combined two of my favorite things (winter camping and cooking) which is probably why I enjoyed it so much.\r\nThe simple concept of camping dissected, examined, and put together for a high school club. It seems easy enough, but the depth at which each episode goes into various camping gear, campsites, and tips was very impressive. The narrator was a great way to introduce pieces of information without having the characters explain everything. \r\nThe art style was very cute and the background scenes were done beautifully to capture the outdoor feel of each campsite. The details drawn for thecamping equipment such as the folding cooking stove and different types of tents definitely made it seem like the animators took the time to do research.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are very catchy and I have them on my playlist now. The guitar melody in the background was very laid back like the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn a 12 episode series I don't expect the characters to develop too much, but they definitely do stand out. Each character has their own set (albeit trope-ish) personality and style.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a great series about a group of girls finding friendship through their love of camping. I would recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "This was both one of the worst and best anime's I have ever watched. Pretty strange to say seeing as I rated it an 8/10 and possibly could of been higher. Well Yuru Camp is a very different kind of anime which seemingly doesn't fit into the rubric usually used to review anime, let me explain.\r\nThis show doesn't have most things which are required for a show to be average let alone great. Though somehow it doesn't need them. For example there is very little of what you could call a plot as the show purely consists of camping and preparing with some slight newfriendships which aren't even emphasized to a huge degree in the show, the same with character development. While the show not including all these aspects might seem shocking while reading this it's executed extremely well as there was rarely a time where I thought it needed them in the show at all, though it could of been a welcome sight it definitely wasn't needed for the type of show they are trying to produce.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment the show provided was something else entirely. The premise on paper sounding like an extremely poor anime which wouldn't be able to engross it's audience due to the boredom of watching people do tedious activities such as preparing for camping or setting up a tent, though in reality it was the polar opposite. I was engrossed from the first episode and kept wanting more, to the point I've been re watching many of the camping scenes to fill that extremely particular void the show fills. The enjoyment was one of the strongest aspects of the show so if that's the point which leaves you questioning about whether to start the show the answer seems very clear.\\n\\n\r\nPositives- The main attractive feature of the show is the atmosphere, which is described as many as cozy which is created through the wholesomeness, visuals, settings, music, sound effects, characters etc. The feeling of being wrapped in blankets while drinking a hot drink on a cold day. \\n\\n\r\nThis show always had me smiling from start to finish and would brighten my day whenever I watched it due to it's suttel and sometimes outlandish comedy which always landed, endearing characters and many other features. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters from what I've seen are great to, not in the sense there is a ton of development but how there is almost a character to fit each personality allowing you to project yourself therefore getting more connected to the show also the dialogue between the characters was extremely endearing especially the text message conversations.\\n\\n\r\nIt's portrayal of camping was brilliant, they managed to replicate the atmosphere in which you experience while camping almost to a tee, especially showing the differences between solo camping and with a group.\\n\\n\r\nAnother positive, one of the main drawing factors is the visuals which were breathtaking every time no matter if showing scenery, a beautiful mountain view or a lake side camp site which only added to the immersion experienced. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives- The character development or lack of  though not necessarily crucial would of been able to add upon the show in a way which would've drastically boosted it's score and add upon the experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes of the season were quite a huge let down. Mainly due to the fact of how high the standards were due to the previous episodes and the show not increasing its quality or at least sticking with it which made the ending feel extremely lack luster and lacking that memorable punch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an extremely touching and endearing show which doesn't hold up to the standards of most successful anime's instead creating it's own not making it any lesser instead creating a unique experience you have to see to believe.",

            "content": "AHHH YES! A series about moe but loveable anime girls who desire to go camping, aka Girls Gone Camping (jk LOL)! Now, it doesn't seem so appealing at first, considering it's slice of life and mostly focuses on girls, with pretty much NO males in sight. But it's honestly a heartwarming, laid-back (no pun intended), and funny series to follow with characters you can actually relate to well from real-life experiences.\r\nSo I'll try to keep it as simple as possible while making my cases clear.\r\nSTORY: Honestly, it doesn't need a story structure like that from almost all action, mecha, shounen, and thriller series; that's notits role. This is basically following the development of friendships between a group of girls who share similar interests when it comes to camping. Granted, it's not the most appealing, and most slice-of-life shows like this usually have \"story\" as one of their weak points. Could this story be developed better? Honestly, I don't know, because I don't really see how changing up the structure right now would have a positive effect. Besides, the series is more laid-back, so the need for a serious plot, as I may have touched on previously, is unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nART: The animation doesn't try to shout and impress anyone, but it has its own charm, especially when it comes to hilarious situations. I feel that the \"derp faces\" (which are actually drawn quite well and fit the situation) work so well here in depicting the lightheartedness of the series. It's funny how the animation style isn't supposed to be mind-blowing, but it is, anyway, imo, due to it being the perfect style for series like this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Just like with the art style, the sounds are very good with depicting the lightheartedness of situations, as well as having \"chill\", laid-back soundtracks at the appropriate times. In a way, it kinda makes one feel like they're right in there with the characters themselves. One more thing: that OP is catchy as hell!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: THREE WORDS: BUNDLES OF FUN! Rin is mostly antisocial and solitary, and acts more mature than most of the others, but she's not completely against making friends, especially with the likes of the crazy and energetic yet lovable girl that is Nadeshiko. As for the latter herself, her naivety is literally the heartbeat of the abundance of comedy; pretty much everything that happens in the series involving her cluelessness and kindhearted nature is gonna give you at least a good chuckle or a hearty laugh. The other characters have their own perks when it comes to the lightheartedness as well. Another thing is that these characters can actually be relatable to one's own real-life experience; for example, Nadeshiko can be relatable to that one particularly hyper and noisy friend who you can't really hate at all, and Rin would be that one person you notice in school who tends to be alone with a small friend circle, but yet is open to talk and converse with (though may feel uneasy when dealing with very talkative people).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Even as a \"former\" ygo fan and a person who likes watching action, romance, and supernatural series, this series is one of the handful of lighthearted series that really put me at ease, especially if I've recently watched a tense, action-packed episode from another show. Due to this, my enjoyment level is almost through the roof, and I could've picked 11 or higher if I have the choice.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nEven if you're mostly someone who just watches to see action, action, action, plot, plot, plot, climax, climax, climax....this series can give you a good breather while making you a fan of it. I highly suggest watching the first few episode before deciding what to do next. If it doesn't entice you, it's fine, though you'll be missing out a lot, honestly.\\n\r\nJust enjoy, and be \"laid-back\", while watching this series....I now rest my case :D",

It manages to make you feel so warm inside, like the whole episode is just one big hug. While the charactersaren't anything unheard of, they're lovable beyond belief and all add so much to the show as a whole. Rin and Nadeshiko's relationship throughout the show applies such a thick layer of fluffy goodness, it keeps the viewer's face straining from smiling too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and scenery in the show is beyond spectacular. While some characters have somewhat similar faces, it's downplayed by the surplus amounts of nature and scenery shots. Don't even get me started on the food art! As an artist myself, I'm so envious of the skill that the artists of this show display, truly inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nYuru Camp is a show you should watch if you've had a rough day, if you need cheering up, or if you just want to feel really warm and happy. Without a doubt, one of my favorite seasonal anime so far this year.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely watch this one",

            "content": "Yuru Camp definitely represents the most perfect illustration of the \"Slice of life\" anime genre. It brings a really fresh & peaceful story, without anything negative (or if so, the negativity is more like something funny, with a kind of exageration from the characters : example, one girl starts crying out loud in a funny way because she forgot something).\r\nThe story settled 5 high-school girls who all have a passion (or will learn that they do) for camping and outside activity. Basically, the universe tries to be as close as possible to the viewer, so that everybody can desire camping and should be able to.However the plot is centralized around Rin & Nadeshiko's relationship : their meeting represents the beginning of the whole story. In a certain way, the 3 other girls are relegated to the secondary characters, even though they will grow up in importance later. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, even before starting watching Yuru Camp, you know they will camp all together AND you await this moment with impatience. Although the anime will take its time to set up a constructive relationship between characters. They don't come up like that : \"poof\" because it had to give a special message. Or by special I just mean it tells you that sometimes the happiness appears in its simplest form : a friendly journey with those you like, in the nature without anything but joy and DIY spirit.\\n\\n\r\nThat was obviously the most important point to cover by the whole show. A basic and funny return to a childdish activity which entertains the youngest and the oldest (as we could notice with the grand-father camping alone). It gives a desire to leave everything like work, studies, school etc for a moment, just to ressource yourself with good air, beautiful backgrounds, friends et cooked-by-yourself food. A real evasion from the real world happened during the plot and brings a refreshing moment to spend watching these girls planning their trip, experiencing DIY lifestyle and just being happy by meeting all together around a fire, to eat something (talking about that, avoid watching any episode if you are hungry : it would just grow up worse & worse until you actually get something in your fridge).\\n\\n\r\nIf I had something to add in the good points list, I would gladly say that the backgrounds were really beautiful (especially for an anime !). The graphic representation of Mount Fuji figured in the best plans I could watch, alongside with the vehicles animations (on the road). \\n\\n\r\nAt last, a point which could either be relevant but also irrelevant : the characters' backgrounds remain quite unknown. Surely a choice, to deliver a story without usual dramatic / sad past so that the viewers would just need to focus on the main plot. I always appreciate learning as much as possible about the main characters but this time it wasn't really necessary. You get to know the strict necessary about everyone and won't need more. The universe also \"lives\" by itself : what I mean is that it is not a bubble where the characters are just camping, no. They go to high school, have their own families (you could see Nadeshiko's parents & sister, Rin's mother & grandfather, Aoi's sister, etc), they work and sleep like everybody else.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as mentionned previously, the meeting between the 5 girls is expected & awaited. Nevertheless I grew a bit disappointed because it just takes happens during the 2 last episodes (not full duration) and I desired to see more of their moment passed around the fire. Probably a lack of time available... understandable, especially with the existence of a 3-4 minutes epilogue.\\n\\n\r\nEven though, a few questions might remain unasnwered, like : how come does Rin have such a passion for solo camping ? How the hell do their parents allow them to travel that far during week-end, to do camping ?(would have never happened with mine lol)?\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Yuru Camp filled up exactly what we could expect from it : a realistic slice of life anime where every character could be replaced by real persons. For those who never did camping, it also gives a few explanations about how this thing or that thing works : pretty handful. I'm really glad they decided to make a second season ! Each episode will surely become my weekly natural evasion.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This Is One of the Coziest Anime I Have ever seen.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nIt is about a Group of Girls Camping. It is very self explanatory. Most \"plot development\" that happens is Nadeshiko's growing love for camping since she met Rin. \r\nCharacters: 8/10\r\nThis Part is where the Show really excells. Most shows Use Cookie cutter tropes without adapting them to the context of their show. This Show grabs common tropes used in CGDCT shows and makes them fit with camping. The Easiest one to adapt was Nadeshiko's Clumsy-ish nature and Rin's serious personality similar to a Kuudere but the others were nicely adapted. My Favorite was theGeeky nature of Chiaki. She Is Best Girl For me but the others are fine too.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe Art on this Show is AMAZING. Most of the Places the Characters go Camping are extremely Detailed and make me want to Go Camping. The Characters are Well designed as well. There are a lot of Wallpaper Quality Shots on this show, Mostly of Landscapes Near Fuji.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI Feel Like This Segment is a Bit biased. I Really liked the Ost of the show. Most of the Show are really relaxing. Iwant to look for a place where to listen to it when relaxing/reading/Studying. The Op is really good but a bit too similar to a Certain song by the Jackson5. The ED is really Cute too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI Really Liked this Show. It was a Nice Relaxer after a Tough day at school and a Nice Bring me up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou must Be Thinking \"How is a CGDCT Show this highly rated?\". It is Because this is an Example of the Genre donde right. A lot of them try to Squeeze a Plot into the show that feels forced or is not that interesting. If Someone Ask me to Reccommend I Would lead them to this, K-on, Lucky Star and Maybe Love Live even though that one is mostly because of My Biase. I Reccommend you watch this show if Your are looking for something to cheer you up or you just want something really Cozy and Cute to Watch.",

            "content": "Yuru Camp Final Review\r\nIn my preliminary review early on I said that there was not a single bad thing I could say about this anime. Now that this series had ended I can say with complete and honest sincerity that that statement hasn't changed one bit. While I do have one minor complaint, which I'll get to later, it's not enough to bring this down this gem of a show.\r\nEASY TO UNDERSTAND\r\nYuru Camp is an anime that appeals to anyone who enjoys camping and the outdoors in general. Even in an age where just about everything is now digital, the old -fashioned ways of theoutdoors going all the way to the beginning of mankind still resonates with us, and that's exactly what this show does well through its animation. It shows the beauty of the outside world around us and how camping, whether solo or with friends and family, can be memorable experience even when the hard work may be required.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that it also goes into detail of what to do(and not to do) on a camping trip and the things you could do to make it more memorable is also a nice touch for this series. In addition you learn quite a few things, including stuff you never knew about. For example, the Canadian/Scandinavian style camp fire is something is something I never knew about even in my Boy Scout days. As I mentioned before, the level of attention to detail is nothing short of astounding.\\n\\n\r\nEASY TO FOLLOW\\n\r\nWhile the animation and the attention to detail are to be met with high praise, it's really the characters that make this show so enjoyable to watch. From a energetic air head to a teacher with a drinking habit, they all represents ourselves when it comes to the joy of camping.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is easy enough for it's a story of a group of young ladies of different backgrounds and personalities who form a special bond by sharing one thing: The Great Outdoors, especially for the first two girls you see in the opening episode.\\n\\n\r\nNadeshiko herself is one those characters you just can't get enough of for she has a habit of making everything and not just camping more enjoyable that it should be. Even if you find her annoying you can never truly hate her because she'll make you smile and laugh no matter what. Rin Shima on the other hand is more of a kuudere character since she doesn't socialize much at school and she when she goes camping she usually goes solo. \\n\\n\r\nIt's through Nadeshiko's energetic personality that causes Rin to open up more and to explore new things about camping, especially with others instead of just going by herself. Seeing their friendship grow from a simple understanding to a very close bond was the biggest highlight of this show when you consider how different they were when they first met.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are also fun to watch. Chiaki represents the character who always makes the most out things no matter how difficult or impossible it seems, Aoi being the easy going and always down to Earth character, and Ena is the rich girl who doesn't get out much but is always willing to learn new things, such as camping.\\n\\n\r\nMy only real complaint, as I mentioned earlier, is the teacher character. It's not the character herself that was the problem for she was fun to watch with her hilarious drinking habits, it's the way she was handled in this series. I feel that the anime should have brought her into the story an episode or two sooner than they did. The fact that they brought her in so late makes me wonder if she was a last minute addition to the cast for she wasn't given enough time to properly develop. In the end, she ends up being nothing more than a character only put in for comedic purposes and not adding anything to the story. But as I said before this one one complaint isn't enough to bring this show down in any significant manner.\\n\\n\r\nEASY TO CARE ABOUT\\n\r\nAs a writer myself, I follow a very specific motto: KEEP IT SIMPLE. And that's exactly what this  anime did. It kept it simple. It would have been very easy for the studio to force in some kind of pointless drama, like one of the characters getting seriously hurt, or forcing in some equally pointless romance, like adding random boys to the cast or teasing us with Yuri(like what Slow Start). But it didn't, instead the studio stayed focused on the what the main premise of this anime is all about, and I cannot thank C-Station enough for the fantastic work they've done for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nYuru Camp gets a solid 10 from me. It may seem like a generous score but its the honest truth. It does bug me, however, that some people find this show boring because nothing \"big\" happened or that they outright despise it because they think that a show that needs to explain everything is insulting their intelligence. Well, I have three questions for those people.\\n\\n\r\nWhy are you here?\\n\r\nWhat exactly where you expecting out of this anime?\\n\r\nWhy the hell do you care so much?\\n\\n\r\nI understand that Slice Of Life anime isn't for everyone, especially for a niche genre such as this but I have to ask: SO WHAT? The fact that they're making such a big issue out of it makes me question their intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nYuru Camp may not be a masterpiece in a literally sense or a entertaining perspective, but it was never meant to be. It was done to be to be it's own thing. It knew what is was and it shined from start to finish. And that's exactly why I say this anime is a masterpiece. So if any of you ever go camping again, especially with others, watch this anime with because it is a perfect example of what camping is: Creating memories that will last a lifetime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned!",

            "content": "Yuru Camp is  a fully Slice of Life anime whose objective is to give some sort of calming and \"healing\" effect to the viewers. Some people are accustomed to calling this kinds of anime an iyashikei anime. Yuru Camp does this job very well.\r\nIf you don't know what to expect about the story of Yuru Camp, it's basically nothing. Well, not actually nothing, but more of the story not being the main driving point of the show as it doesn't go very far. The setting is girls doing camping in different campsites. Every episode, you should expect the cast to have fun doing camping(and also the journey to the campsite). Some episodes are may not focus on the camping but instead focus on things the girls go that are usually related to camping. Another thing you can find in the episodes is the silly things or conversations the characters do that may put a smile to your face.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Yuru Camp succeeds so well is its use of its art and music. You may find yourself relating the beautiful sceneries drawn to some places in real life. Other than that, you should expect scenes of food being cooked and eaten. Food in this show looks delicious, actually made me feel jealous with the characters (You should be wanting to eat those delicious BBQ as well). The music is what really brings out the relaxing tone of the show. Yuru Camp has a good soundtrack to support its goal and uses it well with the flow.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Yuru Camp every week has been a nice rest from my busy everyday life. A fun and relaxing tone to watch. If you haven't been watching any Slice of Life anime that came out, this one would be a good one to try. The scenery, music, and characters having fun will soothe your soul.\\n\\n\r\nExtra note : It also actually shows some tips for actual camping, spoken by usually a narrator while a character is doing it. It is a nice addition for those who became interested with going camping after watching this.\\n\\n",

Rin and Nadeshiko are especially enjoyable characters with one being a moreintroverted and the other being more outgoing. Their interactions together are never boring to watch and are one of the big reasons why this show is so fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I like about this show is its bit of comedy mixed in and how the narrator seamlessly educates you on a lot of camping related things.\\n\\n\r\nNow you are not going to get any real story from this show but to be honest there really isn't any reason to have one since this is a slice of life show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is a nice change of pace from most anime and is actually making me want to go camping at some point. I personally give this show an 8/10. This show was a pleasant surprise in a season full of disappointments.",

            "content": "Have you ever played Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley? Why do you play them? If I had to guess, it is to escape your everyday life for a little by stepping into someone else's shoes. That is the pleasure that Yuru Camp provides. It's a lovely show, and I recommend it.\r\nStory: 0/10. There isn't really a story. Four girls go to school together and like to camp. That's all, really. As such, I didn't think that it was fair to evaluate the story, since there is little in the way of plot. That's not a bad thing, though. You can be watching it, spaceout while thinking about things, life, etc., and pop back in when something catches your eye without worrying about missing some big story element. It brings the relaxation of camping and solitude to TV. It doesn't reuse the same jokes, so each episode or pair of eps is its own unit, so the show is free of pacing and limitations. The camping tips provided throughout Yuru Camp are both adorable and helpful. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. The illustrations are beautiful. Mountain facades, city overlooks, wide open fields with lil critters, all lovely. Each character is visually unique, so it is easy to tell them apart most of the time. Animations are always smooth, not much else to say!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. Embracing the peacefulness of the outdoors, the show takes cues from softer bluegrass sounds as most of the ambient music. The tunes are catchy guitar, banjo, fiddle melodies that stick in your head, forcing a smile when they come up. OP is surprisingly exciting, and very upbeat. It reminds me a lot, and I mean A LOT, of One Up Girl, the main theme from Super Mario Odyssey. I'm serious, listen side by side and it's nuts. ED is softer, allowing you to bask in calm merriment at the conclusion of each ep. Make sure you stick around, since a little extra scene plays after each ED, and the stills running behind the track and credits change every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10. Super cute and likeable, the main characters are definitely the centerpiece. The older sisters are a little more strange, but they don't appear much. Rin is the quiet loner, not as an outcast but just due to her introverted nature. The others understand and respect this, and it is clear that she is already liked in her school. It's nice to have an introverted protag that isn't the social outsider that we often see. Kagamihara is energetic and silly, but not overbearing. The other two girls in the Outdoors Club are pretty similar so far, both dedicated club members with a passion for food and fun. I hope we get a little more info on the more minor club members, but either way they're still charming. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. I'm surprised at how much I like this show. I didn't know what to expect, I definitely expected drama of some sort. Instead, Yuru Camp a laidback show about enjoying what you have with whoever you want, even if that whoever is just yourself.  I hate the outdoors (heck, I'm on MAL so that should be a given) but Yuru Camp makes me want to take a trip up to the mountains.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. Having no story is kind of what gives Yuru Camp the breeze to fly on. It allows total freedom with the adventures the girls take. The girls are funny in a more subtle, chuckle inducing sort of way. The scenery is as beautiful as a sunrise view over Mount Fuji, and the soundtrack really bolsters the splendor of each scene. I look forward to finishing the season!",

            "content": "\"Yuru Camp\" or \"After watching this, where can I camp outdoor near my home?\"\r\n     Yuru Camp is the story of a bunch of girls doing camping, sounds wonderful isn't it? The story focuses on two particular characters with opposed personalities: the first one is Nadeshiko, always cheerful and hungry, the second one is Rin, more introverted but as food lover as Nadeshiko. Rin is a regular camper whereas Nadeshiko is a girl who would love to camp. These girls appear to be in the same schools and will be led to share their camping experiences.\r\n     The artis quite simple, not very fluid sometimes, and is very colorful. The camping sites appearing in this anime exist IRL and it's amusing to compare the art of Yuru Camp and a real photography, obviously making us wanting to go camping there. Panoramas hold a great significance in the series and in the art, giving this slice of life tone to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n     Concerning the sound design, the opening and ending are great but not transcendent, like the whole OST, which is correct but quite redundant every now and then.\\n\\n\r\n     The two central characters have two different personalities and embody two styles of camping: camping alone and camping with friends, respectively applied by Rin and Nadeshiko. Each one has its charms:  for the first one, it's the charm of being alone in the nature, adapted to introspection and to the enjoyment of small things (like Rin enjoying meeting dogs on her road); for the second one, it's more about the sweet feeling of sharing a moment with your friends; each one are conveying tranquility and this is what makes this anime a very good slice of life. Rin will influence Nadeshiko in her style of camping and reciprocally.\\n\\n\r\n     I have enjoyed so much this anime that I'm planning on going camping outdoors some days with a bunch of friends :)\\n\\n",

You can feel it when you watch the anime, even if you start watching the anime from random episode. Its like, every single episode has different meaning with the other, and on every single episode can give different atmosphere to us. That atmosphere come from art that have cool atmosphere and then supported by great soundtrack and best voice actress.\r\nIts sad knowing that the series only have 12 eps.

The characterization within that concept is presented well though. We haveRin who is a bit of a lone wolf who slowly learns to enjoy the company of others outdoors, Nadeshiko who is a camping novice who wins over others with her pure aura of Genki, and a myriad cast of characters such as the camping green members of the High School Outdoor Activities Club.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fairly shallow but they mingle well. There's some slight amount of cliche with different characters feeling a bit one note personality wise, but it's nothing that took me out of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals here were quite good with sweeping camera shots of Japan's outdoors that made me very nostalgic of my time in the Saitama prefectures countryside not too long ago. Some of the facial animation was a little lazy albeit cute and there was a minimal amount of CG car. I suppose the budget was mainly focused on selling camping in Japan to us, the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack here was great. The Op [Shiny Days] has to easily be my favorite since Dragon Maids ED [Ishukan Communication]. The episode tracks are very calming and folksie as well. The whole sets a delight.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you want something cute, comfortable, and filled with camping trivia then give this one a shot. Cleanse your palate of all those violent, gory anime.",

            "content": "Some might see another 10 rating, and even that Yuru Camp is in my top 10 anime, and think I'll just be another person that showers unfathomable praise for the show.  I feel like the show really can be made or broken by simply your first impressions with the content and its characters.  If you can't like the characters, the show isn't for you.  If you have no interest in the camping or the scenery, maybe it's not a 10 show for you.  That's not the main thing I want to praise here.  This might be one of my largerreviews, let me know how I did.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Art:\\n\r\nI'm tossing these two together because it follows a similar feature.  Camping.  There are two things that come with camping, it being the feature of the story, which isn't exactly too engaging outside of just \"hey we want to camp, where are we going camping\" and all the antics that have to do with Slice of Life anime.  The art is the scenery of the campsites, which they do a phenomenal job of, including a special thing in the last episode that mirrors the first episode.  Some might have seen the pictures, some might not have.  Watch out for it, even watch the first ep again when you've finished the last episode of the show just to see what I'm talking about.  The scenery is gorgeous, especially seeing the mountains (I grew up seeing a mountain from view of my house, so I appreciate those views).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHere we have basically 5 characters, though three are somewhat minor.  The first two are Rin and Nadeshiko.  Rin is an active camper and is seen throughout the show on her own solo adventures, which inspires Nadeshiko to start on some camping.  Nadeshiko is hyper and is often compared to Kirby with her eating habits.  I can actually only remember the name of Aoi past this, to show how minor the other three are, and I'm not going to cheat by looking them up.  I think there's something about the characters each having a different accent that's actually neat to look up if you have an interest in it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is the main thing I want to cover.  The OST is phenomenal, it really represents each nature of the show quite well, and is topped off with the Opening and the Ending are utilized in each episode.  Think of Nadeshiko each episode.  She starts off hyper every episode, but as night hits and the camp gets quiet, even she calms down and is relaxing in the comfy levels the show is intended... now look at the two songs that surround the show.  Shiny Days is a fast paced opening that really starts up a day feeling good, while Furu biyori is a calm, slow song that really fits with the relaxing aspect of the show.  Which is actually entertaining since that's how an episode starts and ends too, it starts hyper, it shows off the scenery, and then steadily gets you comfy.\\n\\n\r\nSo enjoyment?  If you love the idea of camping and seeing forests, rivers, just grasslands and don't mind seeing some cute girls doing the camping for you, watch away.",

And if you are not convinced, then sit back, relax and get ready for my review.  \r\n-------------------------------  \r\nI've never camped in my life. I can maybe count those times when I camped on the grass fields of my sport club (I play korfbal, google it), but that was more two days of training that coincidentally had sleeping in a tent as activity. So I'venever camped in a forrest or something like that, but Yuru Camp made me interesting in camping. Yes, a anime suddenly made me interested in something I've never had interest in. So made did this show me interested in camping? Well, get your backpacks and be ready to say ''Rin-chan!'', this is my review of Yuru Camp.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10  \\n\r\nThis is a very simple story, but that isn't a bad thing which I will get into later. Rin is girl who really loves camping, so she decides to go on a solo camping trip. When arriving at the destination, she notices a pink-haired girl sitting alone, but quickly forgets about her. After preparing the tent and a few hours of book reading she decides to go to the bathroom. She gets jumpscared by the pink haired girl and the pink haired girl follows her to the tent. Apparently the pink haired girl is named Nadeshiko and she went on a biking trip but got tired on the way back home. After a bowl of ramen Nadeshiko gets picked up by her sister and Rin continues her camping. A few days later Nadeshiko joins a Camping club because she loved the time she was camping with Rin. In this Camping club are Aoi and Chiaki. From this point it doesn't become a story but more of events that just happen. Again, very simple story, but that isn't a bad thing. The story is clearly not the foccus point and it does its job fine.  \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 10/10 (I would've given a 11/10, but that isn't possible)  \\n\r\nThe backgrounds are beautiful. Full of detail and laid-back colors that look stunning. Some of these backgrounds could hang in Louvre. The beautiful backgrounds get complemented by the music, which is... ooh.. oooooh.. ohhoooohoooh... it is so beautiful! The OP is so happy (even if it reminds me of I Want You Back by the Jackson Five), the ED is so relaxing and everything else in between is comfy, relaxing and happy.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10  \\n\r\nThis anime is the most relaxing anime I have ever seen. The sound and the backgrounds combined with excellent pacing makes for a anime that is just a joy from beginning to end. Every episode was comfy. Every episode gave me a chuckle (oh yeah, this anime has comedy). Every episode was perfect.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nWatch it.",

            "content": "I love the Japanese landscape in real life. So a show featuring it is a must-see for me by this merit alone.\r\nThis anime is far exceeding my and perhaps anybody's expectation. Perhaps the first hint of it being a hit was the VA's list: Touyama Nao, one of the three \"magicians\" VAs highly praised by the Chinese (the other two are Taneda Risa and Sakura Ayane). Toyosaki Aki, the Yui in K-On! and a member of Sphere. Apart from them, nothing else was really eye-catching at first glance.\r\nBut the opening with Rin riding her bike along the road towards Motosuko in Autumn Japan was alreadya treat. Japan is really that beautiful - an industrial country still spotted with pristine landscape. And the show knows it and capitalizes on it. It alternates camping site for camping site in the late Japanese autumn. It was a good change since most audience were quite exposed to the Sakura Japanese Spring by many other animes (Shigatsu wa kimi no uso, Hyouka and on and on). Red sugar maple trees with other golden trees lined up the shores of Shibireko in ep 6 & 7 were breathtaking. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best episodes, the Chinese and Japanese crown it with \"\u795e\u56de\" (godlike episode), is ep. 5. The outside Hottokeya onsen with a view over Yamanashi city was a killer. 40\u00b0C water, the best weather, under the most relaxing music, the girls just were submerging themselves in all these- Nadeshiko summed it up \"\u6975\u697d\u3001\u6975\u697d\" (heavenly comfort, heavenly comfort). On the parallel side, Rin's repeating \"\u6e29\u6cc9\uff01\u6e29\u6cc9\uff01\u6e29\u6cc9\uff01\" just makes the whole thing more comforting.\\n\\n\r\nThen it comes to camping and finally the sweet night photo scene - Nadeshiko sent Rin a photo of Yamanashi while Rin sent Nadeshiko a shot of the picturesque Suwa lake, all under orginal music with the title \"\u9ad8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c1\u3001\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9\" (the names of two camping sites). Especially when Rin took her shot, the uplifting background music with a female voice chanting in it was just pure gold. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime, where the joy for camping, the awe in front of the night scenery and the quiet environment are all there. But it is also an anime about friendship among our 5 heroines. They were happy camping because they had each other. Even in ep. 1 which looked like a Rin's solo, it was only heating up after Nadeshiko's joining. And ever since then, the fun of camping had never been the same: culminating in episodes 3, 5, 7 and the last two, all with Nadeshiko.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the anime was also special. It followed a A-B-A-B-A rhythm, where a camping episode was followed by an intermission (traveling, planning and shopping) so that we didn't get too much a camping overdose and didn't soon lose our appetite. Without a question, the camping episodes were the highlights, but we would have enjoyed them slightly less if it those filler episodes weren't there.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the educational aspect of the show is refreshing. Ootsuka Akio voiced the narrative insert with quite a humor sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe music OP+ED+OST is perhaps one of the most anticipated of the season. The OP is high-spirited song that kicked open most of the episodes. While the OST and the EP are just max comfying. The OST, played with whistles, string instruments and guitars, is just delivering everything we need for the show and then some.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that many viewers around the world, me included have thoroughly enjoyed this show so very much. It will be perhaps some years away for a season 2. But let's just wait. And in the meantime, go to Japan to see the landscape ourselves!",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review in MAL. Since I really enjoyed Yuru Camp, might as well tell you why I gave it an overall 9. \r\nArt - 10\r\nAh, yes. Clearly seen from the first throughout the last episode, the atmospheric background and complimentary colours feel so natural and appealing to the eyes. There is no dull moment, everything is full in colour yet pleasing. It also allows you to feel the vibe of warmth or coldness as if you were part of the scene. \r\nThere is also good colour harmony with character designs like how Rin and Nadeshiko compliment colours (see theireyes and hair colour) or the characters' outfit. Also liked how they chose pastel colours for this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nAt first glance, the art style seemed cutesy and well having watched 300+ anime, my first impression was the clich\u00e9 fan service and typical personality types but there was none which I really liked. I like my slice of life with a sense of realism and relives the mind when watching. The characters can be grouped between calm and hyper but all unique in their ways. For example, Saitou and Rin are both calm but Rin is more active. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also made good use of when to use supporting characters or when they should enter. Supporting characters are usually portrayed as props but here they are memorable and likeable. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nThe setting & plot is already unique for me, camping... in winter. Setting: outside of the norms like not at home, no beach.. or festivals which most of us already know what event takes place. Yuru Camp shows you a different place or experience. One selling point of this is the mysteriousness of what the next campsite would be.\\n\\n\r\nI think it thought well of its audience.. relativity. What I studied in Media class is that most people like to relate. (I try my best to be spoiler free so..) The show sometimes add scenarios which the audience had experience like malfunctions of equipment and audience wanting to camp would be like 'oh yeah.. this could happen.. oh no.' then they leave tips on how to avoid it just to leave satisfaction and stop the uneasiness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nIts a thoughtfully well-crafted work. I, evidently, gave it a high praise.\\n\r\nHowever, I find myself watching it and stopping halfway. Maybe just self-preference but I truly did enjoy. Hoping to see more from Kyougoku, Yoshiaki! Its his debut anime but did an awesome job.  \\n",

            "content": "There are some days when you just don't feel like doing anything. You want to lie down, roll in your bed, have a cup of coffee near you and binge something that doesn't make you work up that much. Yuru Camp is just that kind of anime.\r\nThere's not much stories, no sudden plots and jumps, no romance(thankfully) and no excessive emotional stuff. It's just like the river which flows on and on, peacefully, without disturbing anybody. Yuru Camp is just like that. Sit back and get prepared for a comfy ride.\r\nThe art is soothing. Not great, not bad, just plain, simple soothing. The one thatmakes you feel happy and warm.\\n\\n\r\nSound is topnotch. The background music is just perfect and it does an excellent job portraying the calm mother nature. As for the OP, it is a bit catchy and has a nice vibe to it. The real gem is the ED, probably the best this season. So peaceful and calm. I loved it!\\n\\n\r\nYuru Camp deals with your average cute high school girls going on camping trips. Don't expect to find some huge character developments. Just watch the girls enjoy. It feels damn real. Nadeshiko, as the bubbly cheerful girl, instantly makes everyone love her. Rin, on the other hand, gives off a solemn vibe at the beginning, but it slowly dissapears, and you get to see her friendly and cheerful self. The other girls are also great. Cheerful, happy and each with their own brand of self.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd ask everyone to watch Yuru Camp. It's the perfect definiton for Iyashikei, something which heals your soul. Sit back, leave your critical thoughts aside, and enjoy watching a group of normal girls enjoying camping. I swear that after watching a few episodes you'd want to pack up, and go camping too. At least I know I am going to a trip soon with my friends.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Yuru Camp is one of the best shows this season. It heals, it pleases and it wants to make you go camping. If you loved Flying Witch, be sure to watch this. If you didn't, watch this still. I promise that Yuru Camp won't dissapoint. \\n",

The show accurately captures the fun emotions involved with the process, from the preparation all the way to the camping itself. Even those unfamiliar with outdoor camping will be charmed by how joyfully the anime presents the idea.\r\nC-Station has opted to use soundtrack inspired by traditional Celtic / Irish music, which fits the primarily outdoor setting. The pretty visuals aresimple but detailed enough in areas that matter. Both synergise well to give the show a very pleasant and comfy atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== \"Story\": 7/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of the show can basically be summed up as: showcasing the joys of outdoor camping (with friends). I have already mentioned it does a great job of this, and I have no complaints in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nAs for what literally happens in any given episode, seeing what the characters get up to is always fun, and I always look forward to their future shenanigans.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the crux of the show revolving around watching them have a great time, it always feels like the show is progressing towards a goal of some kind. This gives it that sense of direction that I find a lot of Slice of Life shows lack, which in turn gives birth to that feeling of pointlessness you sometimes get.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Characters: 7.5/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are cute in both design and personality. Going about everything with lots of energy + great chemistry on top of that makes them very fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNormally in SoL / CGDCT shows, there's a standout character that I enjoy watching more than the rest. But in Yuru Camp, I can honestly say I love watching them all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment: 8/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment from Yuru Camp comes in the form of warm fuzzy feelings, wearing a goofy grin on your face, and occasionally dying from the comedy. Needless to say, it's a lot of fun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf all this sounds like your cup of hot cocoa, give this a watch already!",

            "content": "Probably LA's most relaxing and \"comfiest\" anime of Winter 2018 and LA loved it!\r\nYuru Camp\u25b3 is an all girls cast slice of life anime about camping and even though LA is a rather \"indoor\" type rather than an outdoor type like the majority of the cast, LA doesn't need to say that this kind of slice of life anime won't get LA to camp any time soon, but nonetheless it's definitely one of those animes that you don't need TOO much investment in and you can just relax just like the cast and see them eat delicious food in the process.\r\nYuru Camp\u25b3 DOES have astory as much as it's usually about our main cast just camping in different spots of actual real life Japanese locations. One of the focal points of this anime is Rin Shima voiced by Nao Touyama, a loner-type camper who gradually opens up to group camping later on thanks to newcomer Nadeshiko Kagamikara, a rather eccentric bottomless stomach character who joins the Outdoor Club with their two founding members Aoi Inuyama voiced by Aki Tyosaki and Chiaki Oogaki voiced by Sayuri Hara. The other more informative parts of Yuru Camp\u25b3 is talking about camping equipment to how much of an actual expensive or cheap hobby camping is with the narrator voiced by Akio Ootsuka.\\n\\n\r\nSo by in large we see the majorty of the screentime with Nadeshiko and Rin, what with Rin's solo camping and by that end Rin was LA's favourite character, both in terms of her tsukommi routine with Nadeshiko, personality (as LA is similar) aaaaaaaaand...Nao Touyama (you know LA was gonna say it). Nadeshiko is a good character as well what with her allowing Rin to open herself up to the Outdoor Club and being the boke to Rin's tsukommi and soon doing duo camping with Rin to group camping by the end of it. Aoi and Chiaki have extremely good chemistry with each other, both character and voice acting wise as they too have a boke to tsukommi routine (Chiaki boke to Aoi's tsukommi) and their interactions with the rest of the cast is fun and interesting as well. We do have a fifth and sixth ranger to the cast which are Rin's friend Ena Saitou voiced by Rie Takahashi who teases her at times (for comedy of course) and also tries to open Rin up to the Outdoor club AND Minami Toba voiced by Shizuka Ito, who becomes the Outdoor Club's advisor and one hell of lovable drunk.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as Yuru Camp\u25b3 sounds like a lull and uninteresting of an anime to get through, LA by all accounts had ALOT of fun relaxing with the cast and what their next camping expedition is and for a slice of life, it did it's job well, both being informative about it's main focus of camping as well as having a great and interesting cast (coupled with some of comedic moments that landed ALOT) and all having a atmospherically intentionally relaxing tone to it just made this anime a breeze to get through with NO sign of boredom for LA.\\n\\n\r\nSo if there were any flaws Yuru Camp\u25b3 has then it's on how Yuru Camp\u25b3 goes on highs then lows, by that LA means the highs being the episodes where the characters are actually camping and the lows being when the characters are NOT camping and more or less prepping for equipment or locations for their next camping place, to Yuru Camp\u25b3's defense, LA WILL say in those lows we do get to see the characters interact with someone different (at times) or just get to know them personality-wise outside of camping and that can help getting to like the cast better.\\n\\n\r\nYuru Camp\u25b3 does have some minor revelations mostly concerning family members reveal but for this kind of anime, you can either take it like you will or ignore it but nonetheless Yuru Camp\u25b3 does have some details to it that you can keep an eye out for or again...just go with the flow of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by C-Station, well for a slice of life anime centred around camping, the backgrounding work was gorgeous to say the least what with real life locations animated beautifully AND deliciously animated food to the point you'd ALSO want to eat something at the same time and even though the animation tends to go chibi or the like, it is used for comedic effect and it works like it should. The character designs are unique enough with some \"like mother, like daughter\" scenarios here and there but that's expected as well. If C-Station's merits are anywhere it's in the backgrounding and it's comedic timing animation.\\n\\n\r\nNow voice acting...well if you know LA, you'd know that Nao Touyama would be MVP and your right but in all seriousness for this kind of anime, LA really enjoyed the ENTIRE voice cast, from Aki Toyosaki's tsukommi moments with Sayuri Hara's genki eccentricties to Nao Touyama doing a her kuudere cadence and Yumiri Hanamori once again doing her genki schtick as well as Rie Takahashi's typical vocals all of whom doing it WELL and finally Shizuka Ito's drunkenness meta-joked cadence as Minami Toba. LA LOVED this voice cast, what else is there to say?\\n\\n\r\nWell if you haven't already guessed it but LA will say what LA said at the start of this review, \"Probably LA's most relaxing and \"comfiest\" anime of Winter 2018 and LA loved it!\", well it shows by the end of this. LA didn't expect to enjoy Yuru Camp\u25b3 as much as LA thought but it did was better than LA expected. Though the Winter 2018 was packed with ALOT of contenders for best anime of the season, LA would at least give Yuru Camp\u25b3 LA's best slice of life anime for the Winter of 2018 if at that for being a relaxing anime without being boring, excellently done characters with great chemistry with one another along with good comedic routines that doens't get stale and focusing on the slice of life hobby of camping all wrapped into one.",

Aunque lo que m\u00e1s destaco de Yuru camp \u25b3 es lo amigable que fue, tiene la capacidad de hacer que te quedes pegado a la pantalla sin que desaparezca tu sonrisa en lo que dura el cap\u00edtulo y a la vez traspasarte la amistad que fluye entre los personajes.\\n\\n\r\nNunca fui fan de salir mucho de mi casa, menos de acampar, pero con Yuru camp \u25b3 logr\u00e9 relajarme como si estuviera mirando un hermoso paisaje en un d\u00eda helado mientras beb\u00eda una buena taza de caf\u00e9",

That being said, if anyone is motivated to camp by this show that is an absolutely wonderful thing. You should find no shame in it, hell, I bought my own tent because of this show.\r\nThis was actually the first CGDCT I started watching. While I finished Girls und Panzer before the end of this series, I actually only startedit because Yuru Camp along with Slow Start made me realize I was avoiding it for the wrong reasons. Now, Yuru Camp didn't necessarily blow me out of the water, but it did have a few things going for it:\\n\\n\r\n1. The food presentation was amazing. You could have told me this was a camping cooking show for the first six episodes and I might have believed you. The preparation of the food is toned down by the second half, yet it still plays a big part. I had to be drinking tea or water whenever I watched this, or I got cravings for every little thing.\\n\\n\r\n2. The show is cute.\\n\\n\r\n3. The character interaction is decent. No one really changes over the course of the \"journey\" except one character, however it at least sets out its goal from the start.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say this delivers on good food animations, cute cast, decent location panoramas, and it sets its atmosphere very well. If that's all you're really looking to get out of a show, then this isn't a bad place to start.",

I entered without a huge expectation of it and was watching it for the hell of it. However after just 1 episode I was engrossed and found myself excited and anxious for the next episode after each one ended even becoming my favourite of the season. The show itself is very calming with very good music and a cast of likeable and cheerful characters (Rin is my personal favourite) . All in all avery good and calming show recommend it to just about anyone who is into or is willing to try out the slice of life genre I promise you will not be disappointed. I now pray to the anime gods for a second season in the near future. P.S listen to the opening song then listen to the Jackson 5 I want you back. O_O",

However, an eight is the mark of a very enjoyable anime.\\n\r\nSumming up, camping stuff, cute girls, quietness and lack of plot, that is Yuru Camp.",

            "content": "Ahh, Yuru Camp. One of the most relaxing anime I have ever watched. Don't let the hype around it confuse you. Watching the anime is like drinking alcohol to forget your problems. It really made my week everytime I watched it.\r\nFirst of all, let me talk about the story. This is obviously where this anime is weak because there's not really much going on besides girls going out camping. At least it's not another generic high school slice of life anime because the anime barely had any story about the school the main characters attend to. This can be either good or bad depending onthe viewer but a change in location is good every once in a while. The story isn't really that bad but I would place it between 4-5 since the story wasn't good enough to be called mediocre while it also feels unfair to give it a 4 (Fair). Since MyAnimeList doesn't allow decimals in reviews, I would still consider it a 5 since I think that the story is actually closer to mediocre than fair. The story isn't really memorable in this anime so if you're looking for an anime with a really good story that will blow your mind, this anime isn't the one you are looking for.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the artwork. Boy, this anime had one of the most stunning screencaps I have ever seen. Mount Fuji looks so beautiful in this anime and against the real Mount Fuji, I'd even say that there were moments in the anime where the scenery looked better and more realistic than in real life. Regarding the artwork on characters, I have no complaints. I'd even throw lots of compliments to C-Station for nailing the cuteness of the characters. They got Nadeshiko's faces to work without looking like garbage while also maintaining her cuteness. Although the artwork carried this anime's score, it was also one of the causes for me not considering this anime as a masterpiece. While the animation was mostly good, there were times that the bad qualities of the animation were obvious to the viewer's vision. I'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler but the animation in episode 8 was clearly one of the worst in the entire show. I tried reading more about this and found out that another studio handled the animation on this episode. While some may give it consideration, it still hurts the score for me since I'm rating the overall anime here. While most errors in animation were minor, it's still a fact that this anime has lots of amazing screencaps and potential wallpapers or maybe even some profile pictures for your social media needs. And because of that, I'm sure with myself that this anime's art deserves a score of 9/10 for all the amazing eye candy that it showed.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also one of the reasons why I love this anime so much. First of all, you have lots of amazing music to choose from the soundtrack if you want a music session. The two songs that I liked the best were the OP and the ED. Personally, this is the 2nd anime where I don't skip the OP and ED while watching (New Game S1 being the first).\u300eSHINY DAYS\u300fand \u300e\u3075\u3086\u3073\u3088\u308a\u300fwere so amazing and so catchy that I couldn't stop listening to the both of them. Of course, the soundtrack in the anime which feels old-timey was also fitting for the theme of camping because the music makes you feel like you are also camping even if you're just watching at home. The only complaint that I have regarding the sound is that while watching the anime, Most of the music would just be repeated again which is fine but they overused some background music and that just made some scenes mediocre. I pick a rating based on the description of the number and judging what each of the numbers says, I picked 8 since \"Very Good\" is what comes into mind when I first thought about the soundtrack of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, the two main characters (Rin & Nadeshiko) were pretty much the only characters that feel unique. Rin is there so she can be herself (Lonely camper) with her camping equipment while I can almost classify Nadeshiko as average but her obsession with Mount Fuji saved her character. The other characters feel like they don't even need to be in the show. I'm not talking about the characters that the girls meet along the way but I'm talking about the secondary characters such as Chiaki, Aoi, and Saitou. First, regarding Chiaki, her character doesn't really fit in the show for some reason. Aoi had her \"Seyana\" but it wasn't enough to prevent her from being generic while Saitou's presence was mostly just in texts. These three characters had the potential to become better but I guess you can't really fit that much character development in 12 episodes so I won't judge the creators or having mediocre characters. For the score, I would of have given this portion of the rating 8 if all the characters were like Nadeshiko and Shimarin in terms of having a good character but since they were mediocre, I gave a rating of 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is pretty much self-explanatory. This is one of the most relaxing anime I have ever watched and I'm not ashamed of giving this portion of the rating a 10/10 because watching this anime pretty much removed a week's worth of stress. For those who are still reading this review up to this part, congratulations. I will tell you the best way of enjoying this anime. First of all, DON'T BINGE. Watch the episodes in intervals of 1 week as if it's in broadcast because this anime isn't that enjoyable if you binge it all in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude all of these, The weak points of this anime were the story and character but it was countered by beautiful art, an amazing soundtrack, and the overall comfiness of this anime. If you are planning on watching this anime, please use the method that I wrote in the enjoyment section because that really is the best method of watching this anime (At least for me). This anime made me (shut-in) want to go outside and camp. That's something that this show should be proud of since it isn't easy making a shut-in leave the house.",

However the story itself isn't bad at all. it is relaxing without any dramas, conflicts, etc and that is what i want from this show and it delivers it well. So no complaint, a solid 8 from me.\r\nArt 9: the scenery is so good. The foods also look delicious. The character design is also spot on. They all are cute to be expected from an anime about cute girl doing cute thing. Moreimportantly that the art's quality is consistent every episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10: A relaxing soundtrack one of the strong point of this anime I think. The music and the scene perfectly fit together. The ED is amazing one of the best for me this season. I really loving it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: All girls have their own personalities, that's all. Sadly they are not memorable enough for me. They are kinda generic. Rin is loner which open up a bit as the series progress, Nadeshiko is a noisy, carefree which easy to befriend anyone. And the others, I even couldn't remember their name.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8 + 9 + 10 + 7 + 10 = 44 / 5 = 8.8) : An easy to pick series. A good show to acompany you while you are eating or just want to relax. Just about girls go camp with a slight education about how to do it right. \\n\r\nIf you are tired of actions, blood, conflicts, or dramas pick this series to remedy those. \\n\\n\r\nI love the simple story, the great OST, a delicious looking foods, a beautiful scenery.\\n\r\nAlthough the characters are kinda generic, they still do their job well enough to not hinder the other aspects of this series.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go camping, contact me if you have any plan to go camping, I might join you!

Well, that's it. the story isn't the most complex, but it works for this type of anime.\\n\\n\r\n  The art and the sound, are done very well, you have beautiful landscapes and good sounds around the camping parts, good enough to make you want to camp too.\\n\\n\r\n  The characters are pretty basic, they have their personality, which is quite remarkable in each character. The motivations are basically: they want to camp.

In fact, it was a show I would just watch since I just wanted to watch more but it surpassed my expectation and saw how amazing this show is. This show made me love CGDCT(Cute Girls Doing Cute Things) Anime much more and it made me look for shows as outstanding as this.\r\nYuru Camp's story is just simple and it was easy to follow through. Friendshipsbetween the camp-mates, adventuring in a campsite, sitting by a campfire, having the ideal camping gear, sleeping in a tent, having stories and so many more, Yuru Camp made these simple camping activities into an experience in which it is memorable and enjoyable. The show does not try so hard to hit audiences with an overwhelming storyline but it made a simple show about camping with friends a calming show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great with the characters having special features to each of them and the amazing background or sceneries which gives a realistic feel. The sceneries in Yuru Camp gives off a relaxing vibe by just looking at it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the features of this show, especially the OST. It is one of my favorite OSTs that I have ever heard. The soundtrack of Yuru Camp really fits the scenes and it makes it memorable. It also gives off a cozy and jolly feeling which enhances the watching experience. The OP and ED songs are also great especially the opening which is catchy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Yuru have different personalities that suits each other and with their amazing VAs gives off a nice chemistry. Shimarin and Nadeshiko are the most memorable characters for me. Their friendship started off with just camping and shows that friendship can grow from interests. The Aoi, Chiaki and Ena are also great with their chemistry it makes the show relatable and it is enjoyable to watch their random conversations which are simple but fun.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Yuru Camp really well and it is my favorite show last 2018. Having to watch this show every week after school, usually end of the weekdays is one of the greatest things that happened to me last year. It helped me reduce my stress and anxiety which was kicking off since it was very busy and I found myself at a hard situation last year. With the comfy, calm, relaxing and cozy feeling this show gives off, it can make me forget my problems to bounce back and resolve it. I could have not asked for a show to be this amazing coincide with the hard times.\\n\\n\r\nThus, this show is a masterpiece with a simple but memorable story, an outstanding art which gives a great viewing experience, the best and comfy soundtracks that runs fluidly with scenes, the fun characters and a stress reliever makes this Anime one of a kind.\\n\\n",

While the main setup is simple, the point of the show is to express the grandeur that is to be found in simple pleasures.\r\nThe main cast members are all in love with camping in the great outdoors. it isn't exactly a cheap nor popular hobby. To them the experience is worth the hassle.\r\nAnd this is what the show exists to do. It frames their relationships as comforting, their desperate efforts to collect money to fund their hobby as something worth admiringand the final outcome of their efforts, the time they spend on their trip, as an experience worthy of envy. This is supported by the visuals. Most interpersonal moments are portrayed in a super deformed style to convey intimacy and a sense of comfort. Meanwhile the hard work, the effort required for such a hobby is shown in a relatively realistic style so that the viewers associate it with reality. This is backed by a soundtrack that is reminisce of folk tunes, to usher in memories of the great outdoors.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is technically impressive and showcases just what can be done in a standard TV budget if the creators pour in enough passion. But the main draw to Yuru Camp is the emotions it inspires in it's viewers and not the sum of it's parts.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it, especially if you need something akin to a pick me up, so that you can feel just a bit better.",

            "content": "Reviewing Yuru Camp with a numeric value is a difficult task, because while it accomplishes everything that it attempts quite beautifully, it admittedly doesn't attempt much. This begs the question, should something be praised for not trying to be more than it needs to be? Or should ambition be commended, even in projects that miss the mark?\r\nDespite the fact that it is a breath of fresh air amongst countless projects that try to be all things for all people, only to end up being poor in every regard, Yuru Camp happily sets its own ceiling not too far from above average, and that is whereit must be met. This is an anime that ventures to be nothing more than cute, comfy, and cozy and successfully epitomises all three.\\n\\n\r\n(I must also make the disclaimer that I don't care much about food, and food gets more screen-time in this anime than most characters)\\n\\n\r\nYuru Camp shines when the Outdoor Activities Club members' antics are on display, with Chiaki, Aoi, and Nadeshiko bouncing off each other hilariously.  This is balanced well with 'Shimarin' bringing a more relaxed atmosphere with her solo camping endeavours that present us with some beautiful visuals, occasionally mixed with genuinely informative narration on camping. Without much of a story to speak of, the only real motivation to watch Yuru Camp is to decompress. This is why its slow pacing and repetition are non-issues - it really is about the journey because there is no destination. The characters themselves are nothing exceptional, but are unique enough to be likeable in their own ways and some show a decent amount of growth considering the lack of story or conflict as the episodes go on.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also worth mentioning that as the season nears its end, it shows the potential for more entertainment in the future as all the characters interact with each other more frequently. While I can understand if other viewers prefer the chilled solo camping or food montages that consume a fair amount of time per episode, I do believe the comedic group atmosphere is a strength that could be doubled down on successfully in the upcoming sequel and movie.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Yuru Camp stands out among its peers. The catchy background ditties remind me of playing Animal Crossing growing up, and always work to enhance the tone of the foreground. The opening theme, Shiny Days, is nothing short of a mf banger, making it one of very few openings I refuse to skip.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yuru Camp is the perfect example of a \"healing\" anime - something to shut your brain off to, or calm your anxiety. It is not, however, a particularly memorable watch, and that's okay. Yuru Camp is almost situational: like a cold beer after a long day, you'll know when you need it, and when you do there's nothing out there that could replace it.",

            "content": "It often seems that, once an established trend forms in anime, it gets increasingly hard to remove the trend from the possible story pool. Mecha, the post- or slightly pre-World War II or similar setting, and the \u201ctransported to another world\u201d genre as of late constitute a few different examples. During the last half to full decade the obsession with cute girls doing cute things firmly established itself, whether that be daily life, playing in a band, or piloting tanks. \r\n     Yuru Camp is very much a cute girls doing cute things show, with itsunique distinguishing feature being a focus and even informative take on camping in the colder months of the year. With its unique selling point firmly established, Yuru Camp doesn\u2019t so much dive into cute girls doing cute things as gently sidle up, wrapped in a warm blanket and carry cup noodles.\\n\r\n\tThe animation can be split into two specific compartments of the actual art and the animation of the moving parts. The art is wonderful. The character art lacks extreme detail, but incorporates the same soft and comfy ideals the rest of the show revolves around. Many of the landscape shots appear slightly fuzzy, but still recognizable in their subject matter, and have a great personalized unique unique to Yuru Camp as a whole. \\n\r\n      The backgrounds often consist of landscapes and other open areas where such things as individual trees and blades of grass are not important, but their representation gives a flair to the rest of the show due to the amount of care and stylization put into backgrounds. Buildings, structures, and other man made objects are still done in a softer, subdued color palate, but stand out from the natural backgrounds as much more detailed. The contrast blends well and helps distinguish different parts of each frame from one another and for their respective uses.\\n\r\n\tActual animation is very average and contains minimal detailing. The difference and flatness of the cast and other moving objects causes them to be clearing distinguished from the background, but feel out of place against then more stylized backgrounds. The animation is by no means a detractor to the show as a whole, but certainly does not offer an improvements. Detailed and precise animation, while potentially the icing on the cake of an action series, is not particularly important for one like this where the fasts movement is the chop of wood or the eating of good, warm food.\\n\r\n\tMusic often fills little purpose beyond filling in the background silence, but Yuru Camp absolutely excels in standing out from anime of any genre. The instrument choice in itself is unique, full of plucking string instruments and gentle strumming. The whistle and harmonica accompaniment really brings forth ideas of mountains, quiet streams, and bright days spent outdoors under the sun. The tone of the music also pairs nicely with the laid back nature of the show, setting the mood for weekends and holidays from work and school spent preparing for trips and setting off into the great outdoors. \\n\r\n\tThe characters and their actions create the central draw of the show. Each character has an incredibly distinct personality that, while perhaps predictable based on appearance, interacts well with the other characters. Some are more accident prone than others, some are more experienced, and some have the capabilities to take care of, and teach from, the different experience newer campers face. The result is a situation of constant characters growth as each of the main cast is put in new situations that are not their strong suit and must learn to work with the others to have successful camping outings. Bringing all the characters together comes back to the central premise of cute girls doing cute things during their teenage years. \\n\r\n\tThe main plot is fairly simple, building each episode upon the events of the last, yet each even being mostly contained in a single episode. Characters learn about camping, proper methods for the campsites, and how to deal with problems that arise during their trips. There is also a fair amount of information provided on real world proper methods, inviting the viewers to learn along with the cast and gain a greater appreciation for camping as a hobby. Events and experiences learned in earlier episodes are then exemplified and continued in later ones to reinforce the expanding knowledge of the main cast. The growth and increased capabilities of each character reinforces that passing of time and the growth of the character themselves.\\n",

            "content": "The \u201ecute girls doing cute things\u201d genre has a lot of supporters, yet people who find it boring are also present. Their main accusation is that these anime are too similar and many of them lack originality. Yuru Camp, however,  takes us off the beaten track \u2026 literally. \r\n  What really distinguishes Yuru Camp from other adorable slice of life anime is the fact that the main interest of the series is placed on, as you can figure from the title, camping. Instead of already explored concepts, this show takes us to a new outdoor scenery. Characters will be spending timein the mountains, near lakes or in the woods and performing activities like putting up the tent, collecting wood or cooking on a campfire.  Besides actually doing something, we will also have enough time to easefully enjoy landscapes, which are truly gorgeous. Yuru Camp offers miscellaneous views, ranging from solitude mountainous regions to towns illuminating among the darkness of the night. All of them have high-quality graphics and vivid, lively colours. This harmonizes well with the cosy BGM, somewhat similar to the Scandinavian folk music. In fact, before I knew about this anime I had first come across its soundtrack on Youtube and honestly, this was the reason I started to watch it. Beautiful animation and well fitted music create a calming atmosphere of leisure. This kind of \u201cfeel good\u201d vibe is reminding me of other show: \u201cNon Non Biyori\u201d, so if you liked one of these anime, it might be worth checking out the other.   \\n\\n\r\n  During our journey into the wild outdoors, we will be accompanied by a bunch of likeable characters. Among them, Shima Rin can be considered the main one. She is a bit reserved girl and an introvert who prefers to camp alone. Her personality is being confronted with sociable and lively Nadeshiko. This duo works well, as these two act a bit like a counterweight to each other. Over the show, we will see how their chemistry evolves, as Rin starts to accept a vigorous nature of her friend, which is breaking her solitude and eventually making her more sociable. Nadeshiko herself is a cute and a bit clumsy girl with tones of positive energy that she constantly transfers to the viewer.  This character works as the main drive force for the comedy in the show, which is on a decent level.  From simple puns to situational gags, we are offered with an intelligent and original humour (free of sexual jokes); most of which is derived from character\u2019s distinguished personalities and their mutual relations.\\n\\n\r\n  Even though I am speaking highly of this show, to be fully honest I need to mention some of its drawbacks. I have already described how well this anime does when it shows characters on camping. However, there are also some episodes in between \u201ccamping sessions\u201d, in which Nadeshiko and her friends are at school or work, earning money to go on a next trip. While it does add some realism to the story, in my opinion, it could have been omitted, so that we would spend more time camping in the wild, which is, after all, the main theme of this show. Another flaw of \u201cYuru camp\u201d is the marginalization of some characters. Rin and Nadeshiko are both well designed and we spend a lot of time with them, however other characters are a bit on a sideline. We do not have a chance to explore their personalities and mutual chemistry; they appear rather episodically, which is especially a waste in terms of Inuyama Aoi, a character voiced by Aki Toyosaki, an extremely talented seiyuu (she also voiced Yui Hirasawa from K-on!).  Sadly, in this show, she is not able to show her full potential, as not much focus is placed on Aoi. \\n\\n\r\n  If you like slice of life, \u201cfeel good\u201d anime, then Yuru Camp would probably suit your taste. It is a neatly crafted show, both in terms of audiovisuals and the characters. While having minor drawbacks, it is definitely able to distinguish itself among alike anime and will probably be a part and parcel of every annual top anime list in 2018.  \\n",

            "content": "This anime is definitely a must-watch of the season, a simple anime with a huge impact.\r\nStory: 8\r\nYuru Camp has a simple story that portrays a bunch of girls having a passion of outdoor camping and as they embark on the various trips, the story paces itself well and allows time for the narration and this way, not only can we admire the beauty of outdoor camping this anime displays, we are able to learn something new every episode.\r\nArt: 9\r\nHaving moe blob designs can potentially ruin an initially good anime if not carefully utilized. However, this simple yet cute character designs really complements the direction ofthe show, with it being an enjoyable \"slice of life\" anime. As they enjoy their camping trip, together with its character design, the depiction of the campfire and the nighttime ambiance, it really managed to make the audience feel warm and fuzzy inside, making us feel as if we are right beside them enjoying the scenery. Also, the scenery is realistic, yet once again beautifully depicted and really captures the beauty of each and every one of the must-see destination spots in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe OST is easily one of, if not the very best of the season. The tune being unconventional and new, yet perfectly setting a calm scene where the characters are free of the stress we are exposed to in reality. In this anime, the times they spend are always adventurous and fun, and the OST of the show brings you into the scenes at the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 \\n\r\nEven though the characters are not the highlight of the show, the characters are brilliant in a way where every one of them are unique and really catches your attention, especially Nadeshiko and Rin, who are 2 of the main characters of the show. These 2 characters really show great chemistry together as both of them help each other out, making their camp fun and exciting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nPersonally, I enjoyed the anime a ton lot, as it really managed to, using camping as the main plot, which may seem to be a turn off due to the effort and time required in the preparation, to appeal to the audience. At the end of the day, it really changed my views on camping into a more positive one. Being able to enjoy the adventures as if you are with them was one of the few unique experiences the anime managed to let the audience have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is a brilliant 9 out of a 10.",

Mainly show different venue of camping (mostly around Mt Fuji) and the life of that few girls.\r\nThe show is really relaxing (including the song) and sometimes veryfunny.

            "content": "I\u2019m just going to start off with a little piece of advice. This anime is EXTREMELY chill. If you\u2019re looking for the slightest bit of adrenaline rush then this isn\u2019t the right one for you. However, if you\u2019re looking for a heartwarming experience like you\u2019ve never seen before then you\u2019re just in the right place.\r\nStory: Not much of a story; Rin is a student who likes to go solo camping in her free time in winter when no one else does so that she can get to enjoy the scenery and quiet all by herself. Nadeshiko meets her while she\u2019s camping and the two becomefriends right away. Most of the episodes are either about camping or preparing for camping in a way or another. There aren\u2019t many characters and there is no need. It\u2019s just a warm, cosy marshmallow of an anime and that\u2019s all it needs to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: the drawing style matches the intention of the anime as a whole. It doesn\u2019t give the characters too much details or a distinguishable feel to their drawing. Yet, the scenery, the main focus, is way too beautiful it\u2019s ridiculous. Most of the campsites are around Mount Fuji, but each has a beauty of its own.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: This show isn\u2019t too conversation-focused with most of the attention given to the atmosphere and that just makes it even more natural. At times, you\u2019ll feel as if you\u2019re sharing the experience with Rin and the others as if you were there which makes it all the more heartwarming.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: I\u2019ve definitely developed an interest in camping after this anime and might try it. This is just the right dose you need after an emotional anime like Violet Evergarden so it acted as a medicine in my Thursdays. I also got to learn a bunch of stuff even if trivial about how camping is, a bunch of dishes and how beautiful the scenery in Japan is. If you\u2019re just about to start watching this, I\u2019d recommend getting as comfortable as possible and a warm drink for maximum enjoyment.",

            "content": "This series is one of the many Slice of Life (SoL) series that emerged in the winter of 2018. Anime with the premise of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things (CGDCT) which in this case the activity is camping in winter. This series I think is not just providing cute girls with funny behavior camping together, but the most gained from this series is the comfort in watching and educational elements about camping and outdoor activities are delivered completely.\r\nSTORY : 7/10\r\nstoryline in this series is the standard story on the SoL series. No significant story progress. Background as a high school student in one of theareas near Mount Fuji, each episode tells about various things around the fifth main character's camping activity. There were no conflict and no drama. The journey of the story was episodic with some characters going to a camping spot, enjoying the scenery, then returning home to plan where else they will go. Some episodes do not focus on camping like activities at school, shopping to outdoor stores and others. This moment that feels strange when looking at the characters in this series in 1 episode were not camping at all.. The thing that will be more we meet is the interaction between them and the properties of each character that strongly describes Cute Girls Doing Cute Things. The interactions that eventually collect them at the last camp on Episodes 11 and 12\\n\\n\r\nDIRECTION : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that makes this series so up and much watched is the comfort in watching this series. This series is very suitable to watch while sitting relaxed and drinking tea or coffee. Direction in this series is designed to make the audience comfortable viewing Mount Fuji scenery or just look at the smile of the characters when viewing the scene. Similarly, when a scene cooks or eats characters, I feel like I'm watching cooking anime than camping anime. The way the narrators explain each tutorial in this series is very complete. From start to set up tent, ignite firewood, to cooking. But because it is so complete, the narrative about the tutorials sometimes feels too long. The comedy shown is also very light but able to make us laugh very fast. As an SoL anime, storytelling in this series is executed well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : 8/10\\n\r\nCute Girls Doing Cute Things. Of course the girls in this series should be cute especially when they do camping. No significant character development. The only character development that was presented was when Shimarin who had always camped alone could accept that camping with many people can also be fun. The rest, every character remains on his cute character from beginning to end of series. Nadeshiko is plain but incredibly hyperactive, Shimarin who seems cold but when it's smiling makes your heart touched. Similarly Aoi, Chiaki, and Saitou are honestly their character is not too embedded in my memory. Each character is supported with a very good voice acting. Not surprisingly, the existence of VA such as Rie Takahashi and Nao Touyama there.\\n\\n\r\nART : 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime is a series from Studio C-Station. Honestly I have never heard the studio and the anime series he made. In terms of character design and light color selection is perfect for SoL anime. The character design of this series reminds me of the Blend S series in the previous season. Probably because Yuru Camp \u0394 and Blend S are in the same manga magazine. But in adaptation to the animation media I have more execution on Blend S than this series. Animated execution feels like a low-budget animation. Some of the scenes are featured like a slide show. Even since the opening animation we can judge the quality of this series. 3D CG in the anime also feels very strange especially when showing Shimarin motorcycle. I do not know if this is because the studio is inexperienced or it's a little budget. But other than those things mentioned above, the other part I can still receive without disturbing me in enjoying this series. Art OK but animation still needs improvement. One thing that needs to be appreciated is how this series displays every beautiful scene seen by the characters. Starting from Mount Fuji to city lights at night. All presented well. So not only the characters who are amazed, but we also feel the beautiful scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : 8/10\\n\r\nOne of the things that make this series so comfortable to watch is the existence of the soundtrack. When the moment to see the scene will start then the soundtrack will begin to change the mood that was just normal to feel a sense of wonder something. The soundtrack in this series is also capable of supporting every conversation and comedy in this series. The whole soundtrack of this series seems very suitable to play while relaxing or maybe before we sleep. Because so comfortable every soundtrack to be heard. The opening song describes the passion for adventure or camping, but the ending song depicts the comfort coupled with the scene they are sleeping or sitting and watching the sun rise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is very comfortable to watch, perfect for watching with the family at night while relaxing or drinking coffee. The educational aspect of camping and outdoor activities is well presented. There are still some problems from this series especially in terms of animation. But it will not make us lose the comfort shown by this anime.",

It\u2019s not particularly because it\u2019s a winter season show and every single character seem to be wearing multilayered clothings and they\u2019re camping in the middle of winter but because it manages to evoke a familiar warm and fuzzy feeling inside me. I can only feel calm watching this every week after a hard day at work. \r\nImagine a situation where on that day your boss is shouting at you for no apparent reason and suddenly there\u2019s piles upon piles of work given to you that needs to be doneby the end of the week, for sure you\u2019d be stressed out to the maximum you\u2019d want to quit as soon as possible. As the day end, you decided to take a walk at your nearest neighborhood park. There you can see birds chirping, dogs running, people having picnics smiling and laughing and then the wind catches the leaves on the trees and they fall on to the river stream. You look down on the leaves and watch a clear reflection of yourself. You\u2019re unhappy not because of your own incompetency but it\u2019s because other people are weighing down on you. That\u2019s what creates the stress. Now look up around you and see why other people are smiling when you don\u2019t. It\u2019s because they appreciate the world around them and values mother nature above all else. They know that people can be annoying, cruel and non-sympathetic but they make the most out of what life can offer. \\n\\n\r\nSo don\u2019t quit that job just yet. Take a leave or simply do it on the weekends, buy/rent a moped and go to the great outdoors. Go camping. Take a hike. Climb a mountain. Nature will help ease your pain. Bring a friend or two along if you\u2019re feeling lonely. Hopefully, after that trip you return a rejuvenated man/woman with a new and positive outlook on life. If the boss is still yelling at you for no apparent reason, tell him/her to fuck off and quit so you can go on more camping trips.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s what I learned from this show. It makes we want to go camping every weekend. Great show. Can\u2019t recommend it any more. Luckily, I\u2019m still employed.",

If you wanted more then don't watch slice of life. If you liked this show I'd recommend Yama no Susume. It's different but it certainly encourages one's outdoor spirit as much as Yuru Camp did.\r\nI loved it. \r\nMy mom loved it. \r\nIt's hard to see that YOU won't like it.\r\nNow only if wehad Mt.

            "content": "Story: Honestly it's a really nice story. You have Nadeshiko who becomes interested in camping after seeing Rin solo camping. Which results in her joining the Outdoors Club, which is basically just a camping club, and we get to see not only her but the other girls learn about camping, take on responsibilities in life, and become closer as friends.\r\nI also showed this anime to a friend of mine who camps on a regular basis and he told me that most of the situations when it comes to Camping is accurate in this anime.\r\nArt and Animation: I felt like the animation was simple whichis not a bad thing. It was really unique as well, I don't think I watched an anime before with this sort of animation and character design. It was really enjoyable. The background images were fantastic as well. I enjoyed how the camp sites were still frames and not animated. It actually made it feel more real.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I really enjoyed the OST for this anime. So much I bought the CD with every song on it. Super Enjoyable. Add in the fact that the Opening was probably the best opening of the season and the Ending was very nice to listen too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The five main high school girls are so awesome. Rin and Ena had their close nit relationship while Chiaki and Aoi had theirs, Nadeshiko was the glue which brought all of them together which I really enjoyed. Add in Toba-Sensei and Sakura (Nadeshiko's older sister) and you really have one awesome cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It's nice to not have to watch an anime and stress over \"Is this person going to die\" or \"Please let my ship happen.\" No man just watching a nice slice of life anime is enough sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall I would consider this a Masterpiece of an anime when it comes to the slice of life genre. The fact that people not only in Japan but all over the world are being inspired to go outdoors after watching this anime is awesome. Oh yeah...AND IN THE WINTER TOO!!!",

            "content": "Yuru Camp, otherwise known as Laid Back Camp has ended today. Laid Back Camp is about cute girls going camping. Specifically Winter camping. That is all for the most part. With this show, all you get is cute girls and some camping tips. This is the type of anime that is trying to teach you things through the medium of cute girls, which I am completely down with. Although, while the girls do their job so much better then I normally see in moe shows, I don't much care about the camping aspect of the show. To be honest, I can't find the concept anymore boring. I'm sure it might be exciting/informative for someone who is interested/experienced in camping. Its just not for me. Again, I'm watching this for cute girls. I must make a comment about background art, which in this show is stunning. It enhances the likeness camping aspect for the show tenfold, especially with its depiction of Mount Fugi. The animation is nothing to speak of, not that it needs to be. Music is very good for the atmosphere its depicting. Very chill, almost laid back. The OP and ED simulate that well.  This show, to me, is a 5 out of 10. I didn't enjoy this show very much, but I'm sure others would. I can recommend this to anyone and everyone. This has been your spoiler free but not really review of Yuru Camp.",

It is like K-ON in a sense where you have a goofy girl with lots of friends who accept her. She has a hobby of camping. Yuru Camp is also those great anime that you can't wait for the next episode, when airing in season.\r\nStory: It's basically about girls who like to camp. One girl in particular loves camping. The girls meet each other and become great friends.  Kagamihara, Nadeshiko is my favorite goofy, outgoing, friendly, without acare of what others think.  She those character that you really like. She is like Hirasawa, Yui from K-ON.  I also like Shima, Rin. She the one that loves camping. She even camp alone. She becomes friends with Nadeshiko in the first episode. If I would base a character similar to Rin from K-ON, I say it be Manabe, Nodoka. In K-ON, Yui and Nodoka are close friend who communicate by phone, and in class yet do their own thing. Nadeshiko and Rin do the same. They text each other when camping  alone. They do camp together occasionally. At the end, well you'll see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: We, same thing I posted above. It really is comforting and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's a must anime too watch. It be awesome for another season.\\n",

            "content": "I rarely gives out 10's, and if I do, it is usually for subjective reasons of personal preference, so bear that in mind.\r\nStory 8/10 - Considering the theme, it is pretty good.. Well executed from opening, middle, and conclusion for each episode. I rate the consistency of episode progression from an objective standpoint, since a standard for scene progression is closer to a science in the industry.\r\nArt 9/10 - There are some scenes that are beautifully drawn, and that made me want to get out and go explore nature. However, there are also some less than stellar scenes that look like the drawings were draftedon a budget or during crunch time, so I take one point off. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 - When an anime gets this right, for many people, it can absolutely impact the entire atmosphere and memorability that a show provides. Happily enough, Yuru Camp pulls off the sound excellently, and it ends up conveying a very positive and happy mood in the OP, which engages the viewer and gets them excited to tag along for an adventure. Then at the end of the episode, the ED chosen is a very relaxing song that you might imagine yourself lounging back to under dim lights before peacefully going to sleep after a long days adventure filled with good memories. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 - The sort of moe archetypes you find in Yuru Camp are just that, common archetypes. However, they fit perfectly in theme with the anime, so it's hard to argue the need to reinvent the wheel when it spins just fine. The uncommon anime settings that the characters are placed in (camping!), however, gives their archetypal nature some much appreciated diversity that prevents the characters from coming across as a redundant cliche.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - This is where I express my subjective take. I love a variety of genre's in Anime, and generic Moe is... One of those genre's that I'm not a huge fan of. However, I've always had a soft spot for Slice of Life and unconventional themes in Animation, and that's what this anime is, with it's uplifting theme of hopeful, joyous happiness that is reminiscent of youthful ignorance and optimism. Truly, it's a show that depicts a completely unprejudiced, non-judging, peaceful world devoid of any of the hardships that are prevalent in real life, and \"camping\" is the metaphorical vehicle used to express the optimism, peacefulness, wonder, and exploration of the unknown in a positive, fun light.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 - The show acted as a temporary cure/escape from my long term, high functioning depression. It is incredible at lifting spirit and was a joy to watch. Other users are not far off in calling this anime therapeutic. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I could have just as easily given this anime an 8/10, which I'd say is closer to an objective score. However... You know, sentiment and all. I like to round up the score to reflect the individual impact the show had on me as a viewer, and hopefully to encourage others to look past some of the meta number crunching and go with what they feel they will enjoy.",

            "content": "Quick summary of the review : \r\nYuru Camp conveys really well the feeling of camping : the great OST and sound effects have a huge part in this, the rest is with the details they put into the sceneries and camping scenes. You might even actually learn a thing or two about camping. It's a show for relaxing yourself and for that it's ridiculously good.\r\nStory :\r\nThere isn't much to say about the story, it really isn't the point of watching Yuru Camp\r\nArt :\r\nThe art, while not outstanding, is pretty solid. They paid special attention to all scenes where camping was involved, and all of thecamping spots are beautiful\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nThe sound ambience of this anime is INSANELY good. The OST alone make you feel comfy and like you are in the middle of camping somewhere. They also made efforts in the sound effects related to camping and it greatly contributes to building the overall ambience of Yuru Camp.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nAgain, there isn't much to say about the characters. You can classify this show as \"cute girls doing cute things\", moe or whatever similar. And for that particular field it's good, all the girls have differents personnalities and are not redundant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nNow, this is where all the interest is : This anime just show girls camping around various places, talking about it and making preparations for it. It properly build an atmosphere because they made efforts in drawing the camping spots and the sceneries, and they show things that you would probably do when camping (setting up your tent and installing yourself, enjoying the scenery, preparing and eating food...). But the real strength of Yuru Camp lies in its amazing sound ambience : the OST is incredibly fitting (and is excellent) and the sound effects are pretty immersive (cracking sound of wood on fire, sounds of setting up the camp, the sounds of manipulating tools for cooking...). These convey REALLY well the camping aura of the show and create a convincing atmosphere.\\n\r\nThey took advantage of the fact that Nadeko is a complete beginner in camping to give us various informations about camping, and you may learn things about camping with Yuru Camp. While it's not extraordinary, it's a nice addition. However keep in mind that this anime primary goal isn't being educational.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are into moe, you will surely enjoy Yuru Camp. If you are not, don't let it prevent you to watch it, because it's not all about that. It's a comfy show that you watch to become comfy yourself.\\n\r\nThis show actually made me want to go camping myself.",

Rin-chan gives her some of her food while she camping then she becomes interested in rin chan and camping.   \r\nArt: The art style has a beautiful landscape with cute characters drawn in the moe style. \r\nCharacters: \r\na. Rin-chan is a bit of a loner who does not like Nadeshiko at first because she stalking her when she goes camping but eventually she starts growing on her and begins to appreciate the company.\r\nb.Nadeshiko is like a little curious childand that goes over the top with everything and wants to learn more about camping after her experience with rin chan and eventually joins the outdoor club, hoping to learn more about camping herself but also to find rin-chan and where she is camping at. \\n\\n\r\nc.There is a narrator in this anime which gives you some camping pointers, some may find it distracting but he's there to help you.\\n\\n\r\nd.sideline character: I find most of the time the outdoor club to be more of side characters than main characters because it seems like most of the girls in their have had no clue what camping is about despite being called the outdoor club. \\n\\n\r\ne.Sakura Kagamihara is Nasiahko older sister who drives her everywhere but is sort of the mature type of the group and if Nakisko is oversleeping she holds her nose to wake her up. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The opening is very upbeat tune to it but it seems to take you out of the anime and what it's trying to portray which is its beauty of nature but in the middle is some music not sure what it is but enhances the sense of discovering new while the ending has a  soothing experience. \\n\\n\r\nSound:  The sound is really good is especially when they go camping you here the nature of the birds, cicadas, and wind breeze and in those little moments makes it a memorable experience. \\n\\n\r\nFanservice: There is could hot springs episodes nothing is shown except a little cleavage other than no other fan service. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\\n\r\nThe second one is I feel like the outdoor club is sort of pushed to the side in this anime since they focus on rin-chan and Naskido for the 6 episodes so they less memorable even though they were main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe third thing is there are drinking and mention of beer or wine in the anime so beware of that. \\n\\n\r\nconclusion:  Other than those issues I brought up I think this incredible anime that fairly clean with maybe few curse words here and there but not something be concerned with. So if looking for some calming and relaxing then this the anime for you.  \\n\\n\r\nPlus I learned this these campsites are actual real locations in Japan you visit so be sure to check them out.",

But would have liked to see other parts of the characters lives.\r\nVisuals: 10: Honestly, I loved it. The character style worked really good and the backgrounds were amazing. \r\nMusic: 9; Many were forgettable, but worked excellently well with the tone of the show.\r\nCharacters: 9; Has many great characters, but a few predictable and one-sided ones (but they were not in a big part of the show)\r\nEnjoyment: 10; Super relaxing, pretty funny and cute\r\nOverall: 9\r\nSpoiler review:\r\nPlot:\r\nI thought it was very good.It was realistic, funny and just great in general. But I have two complaints. The first one is that the reactions that the characters get when eating something feel very overexaggerated. Second, I would have liked to see other parts of the characters lives and not just camping. I mean, it's good that they actually camp in the show, *cough* K-on *cough*, but they barely show anything else. BTW, they actually made camping very appealing. good job! \\n\r\nEdit: I just remembered. That last scene is (I think) exactly the same as the first one. Every single shot.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals:\\n\r\nI loved it. The art style is great and the backgrounds were fantastic. A good anime for backgrounds\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nOP: I really liked it, but it didn't really fit the tone of the series in my opinion\\n\r\nED: Loved it, fit perfectly with the tone\\n\r\nThe rest of the music: Pretty forgettable but with amazingly well with the tone of the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I love Rin Shima. She felt VERY realistic and I could relate to her many times. The rest were also great. Nadeshiko may seem one-sided (that's what I thought she wou\u00f6d be) but she wasn't. Next, Chiaki. I didn't like her the first time watching this show. I thought she was weird and not funny. But this time I actually really liked her. She wasn't one-sided or predictable and I actually found her pretty funny sometimes. Aoi was as cute as ever. Then we had Ena, who I didn't really like. She was very one-sided. But she wasn't a big part of the show so it didn't affect the characters much. Then we have Toba which I found very predictable, especially in the last two episodes. But again, she wasn't a big part of the show. I just have one more character to talk about. She was probably my second favorite character. Nadeshiko's sister Sakura. She felt very realistic. Many anime shows have siblings that are cute and get along excellently, but that isn't very realistic. I'm not saying that Nadeshiko and her sister didn't get along, but they weren't the usual sibling characters in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was relaxing, funny, cute. What more can I say?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "Yuru Camp gathers people around the campfire, immersing them in nature and good feelings. This is the kind of anime that can help relieve a lot stress\u2014especially after a hard day\u2019s work. Some may even categorize it as a \u201chealing anime.\u201d From its cozy visuals of nature to its cute, lovable characters, Yuru Camp takes the simple concept of camping with friends and transforms it into an anime that emits a relaxing sensation in every episode. With this in mind, this review will demonstrate why Yuru Camp is a must watch for those looking for a good feel-good anime.\r\nBecause Yuru Camp is a laid backanime, it does not have a detailed plot. It simply follows the days in the life of its characters as they do camp related things. Instead of a complex story, the anime presents camping sequences that produce a relaxing feeling and light-hearted, comedic scenes that manage to give good laughs. By not having a complex story, the anime takes on a relaxing tone which encourages people to take life easy and absorb the beauty of nature through Yuru Camp. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the anime does not have a complex story, Yuru Camp does have a lovely bunch of characters. Each of the characters has their own unique personalities which makes them memorable and adds life to the anime. Interestingly, the cast is introduced in a way such that the audience \u201cbefriends\u201d the characters, so to speak. The viewer meets the characters and just starts hanging out with them as friends. Consequently, the characters possess some ambiguity because the anime does not answer the question: \u201cHow did the Yuru Camp girls get into camping in the first place?\u201d This fact alienates the characters from the audience. But, this would be an important case if the anime develops some sort of plot later. \\n\\n\r\nAside from its characters, Yuru Camp\u2019s artwork involves immersive backgrounds and landscapes that bring the Japanese natural sceneries to life. This beautiful art evokes a relaxing feeling similar to the feeling of seeing a breathtaking view from a mountaintop. The character designs are cute and stay true to the manga but, do not take away any realism from the backgrounds. In short, the anime has awesome art which immerses the audience into the world of Yuru Camp. As a result, the artwork is indeed an essential quality that makes Yuru Camp a relaxing watch.\\n\\n\r\nTo embellish the art, Yuru Camp\u2019s music creates the anime\u2019s country-side atmosphere that fits the overall camping theme very well. The music from acoustic guitars, violins, and the occasional banjo provides the country-side feeling which enhances the beauty of nature depicted in the anime. In a sense, the music evokes a feeling that is comparable to strolling in a park or hiking a nature trail with friends and family. Such is the nature of Yuru Camp\u2019s music which is ideal for a camping anime.\\n\\n\r\nUpon evaluation, Yuru Camp proves to be a good feel-good anime that induces a relaxing feeling through its art, soundtrack, and characters. This anime relaxes the mind and gives audiences a chance to take a walk in nature without having to go out. But, on the other hand, Yuru Camp does inspire people to go outside once in a while to enjoy nature.\\n",

It tells the story of the members of the Outdoor activities club, the solo camper Shima Rin and lastly the clueless Nadeshiko who happens to get involved due to her clumsiness.\r\nThe plot is pretty straightforward and it involves a lot of information about camping. Using narratives and other presentations that makes it easier to understand for those who haven't really tried going out to do this kind of activity.\r\nWith great art illustration of the landscapes it tends to give you the feel to want to go camping. Combinedwith the upbeat opening song that sets the mood to get up and go there, if you know what I mean. Topping it off with all diverse but likable personalities of each characters that makes this series a mix of all possible good things to happen. And I wasn't wrong.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yuru Camp is a wholesome, heartwarming and relaxing series. If you want to watch something with your family or just enjoy a laid back anime this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes we all need to enjoy the simpler things in life. Recommended!\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is one of those animes where you watch it and you think, \"Huh, why haven't anyone come up with this before?\"\r\nTo be fair, this is what I thought about agricultural/4H school anime before Gin no Saji, but I digress.\r\nTL;DR: Any anime that has non-humans \"talking\" is going to score moar points with me. \"The pine cone.\" \"hi there.\" \"A chestnut.\" \"yo.\"\r\nTwo words I've heard to describe this anime that were very very good: Wholesome, and Practical. I'd add Hilarious as well.\r\nWhile this is about how five girls eventually go on a winter camping trip together, central to that journey are the journeys of Rinand Nadeshiko. You couldn't imagine a couple of polar opposites: Rin, the quiet, thoughtful, introverted solo camper girl (but loves a good joke like anyone else), very \"cat-like\" in anime parlance, contrasted with Nadeshiko, the hyper-extroverted, easily distracted, silly girl with the bottomless appetite, very \"puppy-like\". Together, they develop some really good chemistry, and the gags they turn out together always put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nThose who have read the manga may notice that the character designs only resemble the originals. Personally, I like them, as they lend themselves to expressiveness and just plain look \"anime\". Perhaps the only exception to that is Aoi's design, but I guess they wanted a diversity of... endowment. The set backgrounds, especially the campgrounds, combine photorealism with the bright saturated tones of anime. For an unknown studio, pulling off this level of quality is quite the accomplishment.\\n\\n\r\nIn many shows, the soundtrack does one of two things: It shows off as one of the stars (think Yoko Kanno or Naoki Sato, among others), or it blends into the background. The soundtrack of Yuru Camp is like a companion, expressing perfectly what's on screen, going \"Wow!\" when you do with a glorious sunrise, and giving you a nice folksy background otherwise with bluegrass instruments. Any track that effectively uses kazoos and old school radio sound effect instruments during \"fun time\" is a good one, I think. Each campground has its own theme track, though some bits and pieces are repeated elsewhere in similar scenes. The soundtrack is so good, I'm using it as background music for when I work and when I play Minecraft. The opening and closing credits music is like the characters of Nadeshiko and Rin: one cheerful (almost Jackson Five-like), and the other relaxed. A very good complement to the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone can watch this anime, even to just kick back and snooze. Aside from \"Miss Chug\"'s... habit and a few bathing scenes, this is a very G/PG-rated anime. Seriously, for the most part you can watch with the kiddos, it's that wholesome.\\n\\n\r\nOr take notes during the scenes reminiscent of Goofy's \"How To\" videos (with minimal klutz factor) and learn all about city slicker camping in Japan. Perhaps if there's a next series, they'll include basic survival skills like what to do when you want a fire but your matches are all wet and you're out of lighter fluid. The practicality of the show even extends to rough estimates of the cost of quality camping gear. And lest anyone think the girls are doing nothing but set fires and drink cocoa, they also participate in their own experiments MythBusters style. Those are some of the funniest moments on the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe various camping meals, while largely made of bought rather than foraged ingredients, always made me hungry. But the fact that the enjoyment in a camping situation is very different plays to this show's greatest strength: it doesn't just go nuts with the girls' reactions to what's happening, it also steps back and lets you take in and enjoy the view. At times it'll choose that moment to deliver a well-timed punch line, so that's fun too.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, without spoiling the plot, I absolutely loved how the finale \"bookended\" the first episode, calling back what happened before with some variations.",

            "content": "tl;dr: Comfy, cute, camping. A super light hearted, easy going anime that is perfect for people who like cute girls or camping.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nFor the kind of show that Yuru Camp is, I went expecting small, short stories per episode with not muc interconnected story arcs. I got what I expected all wrapped up in a nice, evenly paced show. It doesn't try to bog itself down with trying to create some major conflict or character development at the end of the show. It paces itself well to show the small growths of each character and the lives they live. It felt very natural and organic.As I am loathed to use random words to describe a show, Yuru Camp's story was comfy af. Its very strongly paced but nothing to really push it into that 9 or 10 category.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI love it when a show's art style fits the shows central theme and purpose. For a story that's focused on camping and friendship, the bright happy tones of the show really fits this show to a T. The color palette and the animations really sell the bright, bubbly feel of the whole show.\\n\r\nAlso the background picturesque depictions of the camp grounds and Mount Fuji are really beautiful. I think the studio did a good job of getting just the right angle in and having it drawn from all different angles too. Overall a solid job in the art and animation department. (Bonus points for a creative and fun OP)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI would say its the weakest portion of the whole show but that's not saying much given how great this show was overall. The OP and ED are very defining to the themes of the show with the bright bubbly OP that is contradictory to the mellow and chill ED. They both perfectly describe the show: both happy and laid back. The rest of the sound I have no complains about but nor was I blown away by them. So its an easy 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nMaybe it was because this was just another cute girls doing cute things show but I really appreciated the characters in this show. Nadeshiko annoyed me as this super annoying and obnoxious character, the typical main character as you will. However, as we continued onward she really grew on me throughout the show as she did for Rin and the rest of the club. Her bright and happy nature really livened up the show which really fit her character and purpose for her being on this show.\\n\r\nRin on the other hands plays as the more mellow character who highly contrasts Nadeshiko. Her solo demeanor and the way she carriers herself all the way to the end of the show is simply refreshing to see. The writers didn't forcefully give her a characterization arc just because she's the cool and silent type. I also relate to Saitou on a spiritual level of being able to sleep in until past noon when given the opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall:\\n\r\nMan this show was amazing. I loved almost every aspect of it but its far from being on of my top favorites. It does everything well but not perfectly if you get what I mean. I strongly recommend this for anyone who likes moe/cute girl shows as it will deliver. You should also watch it if you like camping. It's always interesting to see how other countries camping culture/rules are different than the ones back in America. Overall 8/10 but I highly recommend it none the less.",

You get Yuru Camp. I completely understand this Anime isn't for everyone. This is an Iyshikei (Healing) anime, meaning it supposed to soothe or calm people watching it, man does it ever. Its slow pace and lack of action tho might turn off those who like the frenetic pace of a My Hero Academia or Darling in the Franxx.\r\nThe story starts with a character named Rin Shima, a gentle soul who loves books and the outdoors. Sheis a solo camper meaning she goes to locations by herself and takes in the peace and quiet alone. Contrast that with Nadeshiko Kagamihara the other main character whom she meets at Lake Motosko, she is a free spirit, loud, knows nothing about camping but wanted to take in the picturesque view of Mt. Fuji. The anime then in 12 episodes tells the story of how the act of camping and learning about how, bonds these two characters together. Throw in great side characters, a teacher (later adviser) who drinks in excess while camping and it forms a wonderful comfy show you can sit and relax to with some cocoa or put on right before sleeping as the ED song is almost like a lullaby. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 for me wonderful show with great attention to detail and a great advertisement for Yamanashi Prefecture should anyone ever want to go camping in the Fall in Japan.",

Both had some rookie advice about stuff you must have or could have while others had more complex information about stuff both things. \r\nThis one had a minor sub-plot on food-porn. Each time they made outdoor food I thought WHY do I have a kitchen if I could only a mini-stove and do it all? It's sad...\r\nLets be real, Yuru Camp is way better and the ratingon MAL proves it. The art and animation are way better. The characters as well. In this one we have pro Shina Rin while on Long Riders you had 3/4 girls but both had a clueless girl Nadeshiko in this one and Ami in the other one. This also follows a trend I enjoy about anime trying to educate anime fans about stuff we don't even care.. or think we don't - Hinako Note made about a trope of Theatre, Urara Meirochou about a fictionalize divining school, Stella no Mahou  about a computer company, Konohana Kitan & Kabuki-bu about Kabuki.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong - it's interesting that anime can make this stuff a shows us that those things can be good. Geez I wanna go camping and I hate bugs. \\n\\n\r\nSo why the high rating? Well it's a blend of very Cute Girls doing Cute Things with incredible landscapes you could have on your PC, interesting music. It's relaxing and watching before bed will grant you passage to nightmare-zone free zone. I smile while I watch this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the food! \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to relax, explore and watch do stuff you either don't feel confortably doing OR if you love it and do it this anime is to you.

            "content": "Slice of Life Cute Girls Doing Cute Things show all follow the same formula. You take some sort of hobby that's niche, but not too niche, and you have a bunch of cute girls going to school, eating food, and occasionally doing that hobby. When you see complaints about the CGDCT \"genre\", that's why - they're all the same show with slightly different characters and a slightly different premise, with no real substance beneath it.\r\nLaid-Back Camp seems to fit that description on the surface, but this really is a shining gem in the genre. Why it escapes the bog of mediocre CGDCT can be boileddown to what are, in my opinion, its two main strengths.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the majority of the focus is on the premise of camping. This is actually a show about cute girls *camping*, as opposed to your K-On!s of the world, which is about *cute girls* in a band. The idea of a slice of life actually focusing on the premise or the gimmick is not uncommon, of course. Encouragement of Climb is both a recent and similar example of one that did it well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat pulls Laid-Back Camp ahead of Encouragement of Climb is its second strength - its cast. Usually the process of filling out a cast of Cute Girls is picking four or five of the main archetypes in the genre and make them all friends. While Nadeshiko could easily be classified as your Genki Girl, Rin is a very complex and unique character, which you could honestly just sum up as being a very realistic introvert - a little standoffish, but is easily able to make and maintain a couple close friendships, and is very passionate about the things she likes.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond just Rin being a good character, the whole cast is less defined by their own personality quirks and more defined by their unique relationships with each other. You have a core cast of five, but they're not just some group of close friends - they all have different relationships with every other character in that cast. Old friends, new friends, clubmates, classmates who don't really interact much. By the time episode 11 rolls around, one of the five main characters very reasonably still doesn't even know everyone's full name.\\n\\n\r\nBut ultimately even all of that is just detail - the substance beneath the main draw. And the main draw is a nice, relaxing story with beautiful scenery. Even if you don't care about the attention to detail and nuances in the actual camping activity or the character building, you're still left with a wonderfully peaceful show to just help you full of charm and relaxation.",

The character designs are all unique and memorable, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the scenery is taken from real life locations.\r\nSound - 10 \r\nThe OP and ED are both catchy (as well as being good to look at). The background music fits the tone of the series perfectly.

Everyone from the one-episode side characters to (and especially) the two mains are likable.

It's a perfect anime to sit down with after a long, hard day and just, relax. There's no grand, world ending problem, there's no melodrama or love triangles. You want to relax, turn this show on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the series I debated whether or not to give it a 9 or a 10, but, in the end I decided to give this a 10 \"masterpiece\" score.

            "content": "This series serves one major role and that is to be a healing/relaxing series to make the viewer smile, for which it does an amazing job. It is a CGDCT series about a group of high school friends sharing in their enjoyment of camping.\r\nThere is no major story arcs or character development but instead the \"story\" (a loose usage of the word) is more focused on character interactions in different camping settings. It also acts a educational series of sorts as a narrator voices over parts to explain basics on camping as in fire starting, tent set up, cooking, site rules, etc. \r\nWhile the characteranimations are nothing to be overly impressed about, they are also not corner cut or look cheap. Where the series really shines visually is in the backgrounds and landscape view shots of camp sites and areas around Mt. Fuji. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs are uplifting and fit the series well. The OP can be a bit catchy but doesn't stand out too much. The voice actors (Japanese as no English dub available at this time) do a great job as they each voice their character's personalities perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters play off each other very well and each one fits their role. They can be stereotypical for a CGDCT series but they never reach the point of being over-the-top that plague the genre. They act very down to earth with only occasional moments of minor absurdity that supply the series its humor.\\n\\n\r\nThe series humor is a  not a laugh out loud humor but instead designed to leave a smile with the occasional joke causing a light chuckle. There is only one emotion this series is meant to cause and that is happiness.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I used this series as a pick-me-up, saving each episode's viewing as to end a bad day on a happy note or to end viewings of more story driven/emotional series to wind down.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar Series: Non Non Biyoro, Sweetness and Lightning",

            "content": "After seeing exactly half of this anime I'm very pleased with what I got to enjoy. Slice of Life is one of my favourite genres. While there are many this season, Yuru Camp stands out with it's interesting premise.\r\nThe focus on camping is not the only thing that makes it stand out, but it's the main one for me. The visuals certainly help in making the experience relaxing, calming and comfortable. Music is very good and, most importantly, quite creative in terms of instruments used. I have to praise this anime for it's mastery in managing the mood. Yuru Camp does it spectacularly well, keepingevery episode calm but not boring. Occasional lively and funny bits kep me from getting bored too easily, while not disturbing the overall atmosphere of the show. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, the Characters are likeable and well-written. There is introvertic Rin, who behaves like an actual introvert. This means that she has legit reasons for prefering to be alone while still being capable of spending time with other people and enjoying it. Then we have puppy-like Nadeshiko, who isn't just another cute, cheerful moe cutuot. Her character really shines whenever she interacts with Rin. Watching those two get closer is one of the highlights here, at least in my opinion . As for the other characters, they're not as enjoyable to watch. The supporting cast does well it's job of filling in the spaces between the two main girls when they're not together .  However, I have to admit they didn't impress me as much , except for Rin's friend. All the little situations with her were very fun to watch. She added some necessary insight into Rin's personality. Other than her, the remaining girls mainly support either Rin or Nadeshiko, rather than being particularly entertaing on their own. It's not that bad of a thing though. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there's still half of it left, I can already see it as probably the best Slice of Life anime this season. For now I rate it 8, but with a little bit of improvement in the latter half I may consider giving it a 9",

There are no explosions, chase scenes or giant robots. There is a lot of beautiful scenery on about the level you would expect for a medium budget anime series. The artwork is adequate.\r\nThe story, such as it is through four episodes, revolves the four girls and only two of them are developed at all. Rin, the experienced camper, prefers camping alone in the winter (fewer people) and Nadeshiko, the novice camper, develop their friendship with the common bond of their love ofcamping. The other two friends could be anyone at all and it wouldn't make any difference to the story. The \"story\" is almost more about the joys of camping than it is about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that will sooth your nerves and leave you with a peaceful, easy feeling.

I don't see enough people talking about it and it's a shame. I think that because people already watches a lot of shows this season and that this ne didn't start earlier like another pleasant surprise a place further than the universe it doesn't get it's recognition while it's at least as good and one of the best this season. \nplot (7/10):\nthe plot ispretty good. I really like how they write it so far but I do find it lacking in a few points. I think that overall the plot is good but not amazing. now I just want to address that since the plot is about ccamping in the winter I cant help but feel it was an amazing choice to wait to winter season to get this show out as I feel it might not have been as good to me if it was released in the summer or spring. \\n\nI also want to note some great things the show does which is to use a lot of texting to make the plot move and show the characters better and the fact that they simply explain camping things so well. I really like it. \\n\\n\ncharacters (8/10):\\n\nI really thought about what to do in this category and I might be wrong or change my mind because this show's characters are great. I do however think they are lacking in a way that they are too similar. they are still a bit different but I hope the show will improve them. with that said I really love how they made the characters. they feel like actual goofy not too serious teenagers and honestly I really like the moments they are texting I their phones because it is so real (they even put some sorts of emojis in there). it also help building the characters and overall I found it great. \\n\\n\nart (9/10):\\n\nwhile not being overwhelming or amazing like other shows in the season (amb and violet everarden) the art here is great especially for this show. it had miments of me bursting out laughing not because the moment was funny (I think the humor in this show isn't amazing on it's own)but rather because how the art conveyed it. it had a few moments where it tried to make something really beautiful but honestly I think it was ok at that. the art here really have a better impact at characters interactions.\\n\\n\nsound (9/10):\\n\nlet's talk about the soundtracks. I don't thnk they are amazing or anything but they have moments that are really good and the show knows how to use them.\\n\nnow let's talk about the op. i usually dont talk much about the op but here the op is so good and i cant bring myself to skip it. it got humor, it got really nice music and the way it plays with visuals and credits is so good. really a great op.\\n\nnow i think this category got most of it's point from va. they do such an excellent job! i mean seriously, i said the humor wont really work well without the art but the same for the characters. the acting can be so funny and so great. i could really symphatize with some of the characters at certain moments and i think a great deal to that shuld g to the va for doing such an excellent job.\\n\\n\noverall (8/10):\\n\nlisten guys if you got time watch this. so far it's a really good show and one of my top 5 and maybe even 3 of the season. it is really something special that made me, one of the laziest people youll ever meet thinking about going to camp. it's a great show, I recommend it very much, and let's hope this show will keep being great.\\n\n note: after watching 5 ep.",

But this kind of show don't attracted me so many times is wasn't paying attention in the anime and just listening the OST - i rewatched this parts -, the narrator pissed me off, i think he wasn't necessary for the show, butok it didn't ruined it.

Seeing the characters travel around Kanto and Chubu discovering new places and camping out, eating tasty food, taking pretty pictures... it's great.\r\n I love how the characters aren't constantly connected, too; main character Rin is mostly separate from the rest of the castthroughout the series, and the energetic Nadeshiko often does her own thing as well. It makes the rare occurences when they do activities together all the more exciting, especially when all of them (except for Nadeshiko) aren't direct copypaste stereotypes from other slice-of-life mangas/animes.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the show is so educational on the ways to camp successfully by yourself or with others is icing on the cake, and has legitimately made me want to start camping as soon as the icy wastelands of Shimokita give way to better temperatures and better weather. A TV show inspiring me to take up outdoorsy activities seems insane but if I actually go through with it, that will mean Yuru Camp truly was something special.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the OP and ED are both fantastic. The series soundtrack is also fantastic. Even if the animation is perfectly mediocre, the music in this show is top-tier.\\n\\n\r\nSo... no romance, no drama, just teenaged friends exploring Japan and having fun. That's what Yuru Camp is.",

Yuru Camp is a cute girls doing cute things anime, so if your not into those then this win't be for you. If you are into that genre, and you like the camping, then this show is perfect for you. Through out Yuru camp you'll see cute girls going in detail about the different aspects that comes with camping. Setting up a tent, keeping warm, making food, it's all hear and it's surprisingly informative. It also really helps when the sound design teleports you to the outdoors. This isn't tosay that this is a camping documentary. There are characters... They just don't have any depth and really is just there to be cute, which I guess is fine, but I would of preferred less of a focus on the clubs dynamic since they didn't do anything with it. Honestly you'll probably get bored at certain points because even with this anime only being 12 episodes. This is not a show you binge, this is a show that you watch occasionally when you want to chill while watching a relaxing atmospheric show. Yuru camp isn't for everyone, but it's defiantly worth checking out if you're interested.",

No challenges to overcome, no skills to master, no crush to ask out. Simply a gang of lovely young people relaxing with camping, with nothing doki-doki ruining their good times.\r\nBecause sometimes, that is all you need to enjoy an anime. To just kick back and relax to a \"cute girls doing cute things\" series which doesn't rely on pink heart-shaped magic or high-pitched voices yelling \"kawaii\".\r\nThis succeeds so very well. You get engaged in the girls and their journeys, andare able to very closely immerse yourself in the cold winter air and their steaming food. You can focus on the feeling conveyed instead of following a narrative that will lead someplace. And when there is some kind of narrative - Shimarin travelling far or Nadeshiko discovering a piece of equipment - it is done in the lightest and most subtle way. The well-being of the characters is always the supreme priority for the audience, and it is a wonderful feeling to experience that principle.\\n\r\nI only wish there were more of these girls-just-want-to-have-fun-esqe stories out there!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the visuals are absolutely gorgeous! The food they eat looks just like in a commercial, and the backdrops are almost hyper-realistic to capture the feel of cosiness. The moonlit Mt Fuji in the first episode was so amazing I could almost feel the cold air!\\n\\n\r\nPerfect for watching before sleep or after a rough day!

            "content": "If we talk about a slice of life anime, especially when it\u2019s related to Iyashikei. It always gives us a good vibe from the simplicity of anime which is funny and moe, we don\u2019t need to think anything hard and complex because Iyashikei itself is an anime genre that means \u201chealing\u201d. So, the Iyashikei anime is the anime that gives us anything relaxing atmosphere, less drama, even the perfect choice for your watchlist before bedtime. \r\nYama no Susume did a job as an example of Iyashikei anime, where everything about the anime is a joy of mountain climbing, entertaining informative guide of how to climba mountain, and the story of each mountain(loli) climbers that gives you an amazing relaxing mood. The same thing goes to Yuru Camp, but they more oriented to camping \\n\\n\r\nYuru Camp follows the story of the \u201ccampers\u201d(ofc), that do camping activity(OFC). Starring the cutest anime lifeform who has a memeable hair, Shimarin. A basic cheery & energetic girl which sometimes she looks completely idiot, Nadeshiko. A girl with unique Japanese accent but at the same time, she is fanservice clickbait, Aoi. And\u2026\u2026 the rest of them(lol, I don\u2019t remember the others, but you just can look it at character list tho). Yeah, the show is all about camping, where they making foods, prepare a tent, and watch them talking in the night scenery which I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s relaxing to watch(apparently, the same thing goes on when I watch Nijisanji for hours)\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about this show is they just giving you a basic moefication camping show without giving anything weird about the show, like a kinda looked old girl but she is actually 9 years old or they were camping in the isekai world or whatever that is. It\u2019s just giving you a real camping show(but ofc it has been moeficated). When I watch this show, I\u2019m expecting like \u201cWell, this is just a moeshit show, nothing special about it\u201d. But actually, they give a special value because they put the moe \u201cwhich is\u201d definitely guaranteed to attract people for the first sight, an amazing beautiful scenery that perfectly drew to gain a comfy atmosphere, a real camp location and an information guide of how to camp which it made accurate and fun to watch, then it all combined into one show and it\u2019s mixed very well. Also, the entire show filled with all comedy which makes the show more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think I got of what I don\u2019t like about this show. But, from their location, is all around of Mt Fuji, this need to be a concern because I think they are much popular camping sites beside around Mt Fuji, I think for the next season, I think they should put another\u2026. no, they should put more popular camping site outside Mt Fuji. That would be more great, but depends on their story\\n\\n\r\nAnother plus point of this show is their catchy OP/ED songs, the show opens with SHINY DAYS by Asaka which give us an uplifting hype as the show begin to give the spirit of camping. Asaka did a great job for singing the hype song which matches with the anime atmosphere. And closed with Fuyubiyori by Eri Sasaki, which give us chills after all day of camping activities. This song is really comfy, even it\u2019s perfect for your song to listen before bedtime\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is really family friendly, really good to watch. I probably suggest you if you want to camp, you don\u2019t need book or anything, just watch Yuru Camp and you good to go, but keep in mind not everything in Yuru Camp you can do it (lol). I really loved everything from this anime, I\u2019ll give this 8.5/10 for the joy of camping series.\\n",

            "content": "Rin Shima is a regular off-season camper who enjoys the quiet time alone. While camping out at one of the popular five lakes around Mount Fuji, Lake Motosu one day she comes across cheery but also klutzy, overly naive Nadeshiko Kagamihara who just moved into the area nearby. Nadeshiko had just happened to sleep through the day near the camp site while trying to get a view of the mountain. Fortunately for her, she meets Rin and manages to get some food before calling someone to pick her up again. Mesmerised by the moonlit view of Mount Fuji, she is determined to go camping againand so she joins the Outdoors Club at her new school Motosu High where Rin just also happens to attend.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation itself is a bit average which is also the same for the backgrounds. Sometimes the character proportions can look a bit off and the 3D animation isn't well blended like other studios. A lot of the time places are completely deserted too so there isn't as much to render and animate. Quite a low budget show. Other than that, I think the only other thing stopping me from recommending this show is the setup which is your commonly used group of girls doing silly funny things.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the title says, it's a very laid-back show based on a Manga of the same name. There's no drama unlike A Place Further Than The Universe, just a group of girls camping and chatting away leisurely with your usual funny reactions so it's a great show to wind down with. It's also a bit of an edutainment show where you end up learning about camping which is always a bonus when watching Anime. You'll also see this show's interpretation of Lake Suwa in Nagano which was also the same lake Lake Ito from Your Name was based on. There is the odd episode of fan service with your usual obligatory hot spring/bathing scene but that's about it. They're really brief and don't have any awkward actions or camera angles to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nBeware of the blankie monsters.",

There is not much character development here in this anime as it focuses on the enjoyment part which I'm glad they did.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe background music perfectly synced into the moment and makes u feel warm and cozy inside. The ending and opening themes matched the theme of the anime and were good. Now coming to the voice of the characters, it was great,cute and refreshing to hear, therefore justifiying my rating of 9/10 in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nWhen you finish the anime, it will leave u with a \"heartily content\" look and u will look at the environment around you with an optimistic aproach and a bright smile (like this \" :) \" lol). So this will have to get a whooping 10/10 for giving me the pleasure of watching such an art peice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime is all about the experience it gives while watching and not about the plot or characters.If u are like me who was fed up watching these typical harem , shonen and gore /horror and want escape this madness to watch something else,then this is exactly \"your cup of tea\". I personally would put it to the \"must watch category\" to all those casual anime watchers out there.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT : If these conditions apply ,then i gaurantee that you will have a refreshing experience so what are you waiting for just stop thinking and GO FOR IT!!",

            "content": "When the Winter Season started I did not have high hopes for it nor did I expect it to be bad or anything - I was only looking for your usual Cute Girls Doing Cute Things and lots of camping, but what I got instead was a sweet and lovely anime about friendship between girls with different personalities that do not have to do everything together, but can still have a strong bond.\r\nStory - 8\r\nWhat started as a simple camping anime developed into an anime about creating a friendship over marshmallows and grilled meat. Rin has always enjoyed solo-camping trip, but during one of heradventures she meets Nadeshiko and that's how Nadeshiko falls in love with camping. While Rin goes on camping trips with Nadeshiko and mostly on her own, Nadeshiko joins the Outdoor Club and discovers the joy of group camping. The entire anime is about the girls' friendship, although it doesn't follow the usual formula of girl doesn't like camping with others but then she changed her mind. Rin can go camping with other people and on her own, and Nadeshiko is not trying to change that.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art style and character design are really cute, but I can't say there's anything special about it. However the nature shots are amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nIt fits the story really well. It is soothing and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nProbably my favourite part, although Nadeshiko and Rin are the most developed from the bunch. What I liked the most was the emphasis on introvert-extrovert personalities and how they can go well together. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI obviously loved it! But I discovered that if I watch too many episodes in a row then I get bored. But once a week or maybe twice, it's simply perfect to make my week better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nIt is a great anime if you are looking for an anime that doesn't have a lot of action, but it's all about nature, food and the little pleasures of life.",
