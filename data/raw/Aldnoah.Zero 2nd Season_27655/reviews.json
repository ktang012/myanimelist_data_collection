            "content": "[THIS ENTIRE REVIEW WILL CONTAIN HEAVY SPOILERS FOR WHAT LITTLE PLOT THIS ANIME HAS]\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nPLOT 1/10\r\nThe ending of season 1 was quite unexpected. It was a great cliffhanger that made everyone speculate how the story would continue after 4 of the most pivotal characters of the show seemingly get killed. Disappointingly, nothing happens. None of them died. Welcome to my review of AldNoOne Dies Season 2. Did I mention that none of the main characters die? None of them die. Seriously. The only thing that dies is the plot, and this review will be my morbid attempt at describing the dead carcass that is \"the plot\"as I poke it with a stick.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, season 2 starts off with the princess stuck in a comatose state for a long period of time after Slaine forces Count Sassy-bum to keep her alive. Slaine becomes an angsty asshole and obtains a position of power within the Vers empire after murdering Count Sauce-bomb by 360 no-scoping him with timey wimey powers and succeeding him as count. Then he has where-the-fuck-did-she-come-from Princess Asseylum v2.0 marry him into royalty so he can unify the Vers empire and start a full scale war against earth for no clearly understandable or reasonable goal. From what I understand he does it to \"protect the princess\". Which makes absolutely no fucking sense because now that he is the fucking king of the fucking Vers Empire he already fucking has the needed political fucking power and support to fucking stop anyone else from fucking stealing his fucking girl. The fucking princess is already fucking fine, not to fucking mention everyone doesn't even fucking know that the fucking princess is actually in a fucking coma and that she is being fucking impersonated by her fucking sister. Meaning that any attempted assassination wouldn't fucking work because they would be fucking killing the fucking body double. YOU KNOW, LIKE IN THE VERY FIRST EPISODE OF THE FUCKING SHOW ALL THE FUCKING WAY BACK IN SEASON FUCKING ONE, FOR EXAMPLE. JESUS TAP DANCING CHRIST. Not to mention war goes against EVERYTHING THE PRINCESS STANDS FOR. WHAT THE FUCK SLAINE, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU GET A GIRL TO LIKE YOU. YOU ABSOLUTE RETARD.\\n\\n\r\nI guess his actions can be rationalized a bit from the perspective of Slaine as the king of the Vers Empire, and not from the perspective of Slaine as the desperate, sex-starved virgin he is, since what he is doing could be seen as a political ploy to obtain more support amongst the other orbital knights and other members of nobility, who are unanimously pro-war. (Which he doesn't need.) And on top of that it will cause the Vers empire to become a better place free from an oppressive class system and widespread poverty among the working class that is caused by a lack of natural resources. (Which could be solved diplomatically through trading.) (Or stealing it without the genocide.) (Which would make him unanimously supported by the working class even if some of the nobles still don't like him, lessening the threat of their influence and cementing his legitimacy as king.) (Which again, doesn't matter because he already has all the political support he needs.) But really now... He doesn't care too much about any of that. He just in this for the PU$$Y. (SPOILER: HE DOESN'T GET ANY)\\n\\n\r\nThe real princess eventually wakes up, then plot hole after plot hole she finds out what Slaine is doing and manages to escape with Inaho's help. Princess Ass-pump marries some random dude named Count Cocaine and takes over rule of the Empire. Then Slaine gets wrecked. They use him as a scapegoat to blame the entire war on. The entirety of earth apparently completely forgives Princess Ass-plumber after her impostor shit talks everyone and their mother with obscene levels of hate and Aryan supremacy. Apparently decades of indoctrination, hatred, prejudice, racism, discontent with poverty and human greed disappeared just like that. The war ends. Earth and Mars hold hands and circle jerk over each other in a new golden age of peace and prosperity. Happy happy fine and dandy. Wouldn't it be nice if actual conflicts in the real world could be solved so easily? Just blame every little problem on one person. Then kill him. Poof. Problems solved just like that. \\n\\n\r\n\"Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.\" The motto of the show clearly represents Princess Asseylum's goal of peace no matter the cost. It really shows just how spoiled and unrealistic her standards are. Princess Ass-plum seriously used her love of birds as a valid reason to possibly jeopardize the long term unity and betterment of her entire empire. Don't get me wrong, war is bad. But a leader should realize when war is the best and most realistic option for her people. Good thing the shit writing this show has kicks in and everything somehow turns out alright anyways, and no one suffers from the consequences of their actions except for Slaine.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really simplify it. The entire plot of season 2 is basically a war caused by a mans quest to seduce a woman through the romantic gift of genocide; and predictably, hilariously, painfully, and stupidly enough- it completely backfires. He gets friend zoned and gets sent to prison for the rest of his life. She'd rather enter an arranged marriage with a man she has never met before than be with you. How does that feel, you fucking cuck? Holy shit, someone give this a man a medal for the worst rejection in history. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously that's the entire plot. Yup. The end. Aren't you fucking glad you watched this show?\\n\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe general artstyle is pretty good, and the characters are drawn very well with a distinctive style. One of the strongest points of this show is aesthetic originality, even though sometimes \"originality\" becomes synonymous with \"bad writing\", as in, it's original how bad the writing is. Martian kataphrakts are pretty cool looking, despite just how bad the CGI in this show is. Their designs are strange, exotic, and unique, but at the same time completely absurd. For some reason the orbital knights care more about making flashy and cool kataphrakts over actually effective weapons. You would think that a robot with access to seemingly unlimited energy would make use of all of the ridiculously overpowered technology they have, but every single kataphrakt has some gigantic weakness that is so obviously intentionally added. For some reason, a robot that is nigh indestructible has no weapons on it besides some over-sized fists, and despite the fact that it has a nigh indestructible force field, it is covered in thick plates of armor that makes the thing look like the girl from Willy Wonka that turns into a giant blueberry. For some reason, a mech attacks by shooting re-attachable, remote controlled ROCKET ARMS at the enemy when they have the technology to rapid fire death lasers with the destructive power of a small nuclear bomb with a seemingly infinite amount of ammunition to accompany it. It just simply makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how it works kids. If you aren't good enough at writing to make a character look brilliantly smart, just make all the bad guys so incompetently stupid the hero look better in contrast. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music was composed by none other than Hiroyuki Sawano, so as expected, it is quite good. Too bad they keep on replaying the same fucking song over and over again for every single god damn fight scene that you begin to hate the song. Good music is important, but making sure the music is used in a timely and appropriate manner is also important. This show succeeds in the former part, but fails in the latter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHere comes the juicy part. CHARACTER.\\n\\n\r\n2/10 Inaho: Absolutely no character development. Though it wouldn't be fair to expect character development from him. Inaho is literally God. Perfection personified into a Japanese school boy. He cannot further develop because he is already perfect. Getting shot in the head doesn't change that. He is still perfect. He is still an emotionless machine. The fact that he is now partially a cyborg doesn't help with that analogy either. He saves the day every single god damn time like he always does except now he does literally everything to the point where basically 60% of the entire show just focuses on circlejerking over how awesome he is. The writers made this man an autistic savant because they simply aren't smart enough to write an intelligent character well, and clearly even with that the job was still difficult for them. Because in season 2 they had to up the ante and make him even more overpowered than he already was so they can shoehorn more shitty excuses as to how he completely defeats the Vers Empire yet again by blessing him with some unreasonably overpowered god eye that can see everything. Like Inko's BMI for example. Inaho uses his eye to calculate Inko's weight so he can make fun of her. What the fuck dude? Asshole. And he knows he can get away with it since Inko wants his D for some reason. Why ya got to play a girl like that man? And to top it all off, the writers also gave him Aldnoah powers all willy-nilly to act as a convenient plot device to reactivate the Deucalion. How? Through oral transfer of royal blood and saliva. HAHA WHAT THE FUCK. In other words. This all powerful source of unlimited energy is pretty much some alien STD Ass-plump gave to Inaho. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Inaho's robot eye: A new character. Yes. The eye has its own character. Yes. THE EYE GETS MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN INAHO HIMSELF. At first the eye is nothing but a tool, but then it starts taking over parts of Inaho's brain and becomes its own thinking entity. It even starts chatting up the princess while Inaho was unconscious. Look at that development. Oh yea. Such character. Inaho's eye x Asseylum is my OTP.\\n\\n\r\n1/10 Slaine: Is basically the only character that gets any \"development\", which means jack shit because he just continually makes the most retarded nonsensical decisions a sane individual wouldn't ever consider. Honestly, calling it \"character development\" is a little too generous in the first place since his character is completely off the charts inconsistent. He doesn't really do anything that can be considered normal human responses. His level of intelligence and decision making is all over the place. His goals incomprehensible, and the reason behind this is because the writers just continuously use him as a cheap plot device to add drama and conflict to the story instead of treating him like how a reasonable or sane human being would act. Inaho and Slaine are both foils to each other in this regard. Slaine advances the story by adding unnecessary conflict to it through irrational decision making. And Inaho advances the story by solving the stupid problems Slaine causes with his own stupidly written god-like abilities. In the end, Slaine fails horribly due to his ridiculous levels of incompetency. Then the writers pretentiously rip off Monster by making Slaine pull off some bullshit Johan Liebert crap. \\n\\n\r\n1/10 Princess Ass-lump: She doesn't change character. Still this overly happy and naive dumb bimbo that can barely act like a responsible leader. She forces her childish idealistic views on everyone regardless of the effect it might have on her people. She tried to man up once and points a gun at Slaine and threatens him. Then he casually walks over and just takes the gun. AHAHA. Seriously. She is so worthless. Did I mention she likes birds? She likes birds. Apparently more than the possible long term prosperity of not only her Empire, but the entirety of humanity as well. Amazing judgment of importance there. \\n\\n\r\n4/10 Princess Ass-lump v2.0: Yea the second princess with the weird hair. I forgot her name. Where the fuck did she even come from? She just appears suddenly as a new character. Basically she pretends to be Asseylum and slanders earth with her space Nazi propaganda. She does it because she has some extremely creepy as fuck obsession with Slaine. She is just weird. \\n\\n\r\nCount Crouton or something. IDK it's hard to spell. Best character 10/10. Some new guy that shows up for like 10 minutes of screen time. Manages to NTR the princess away from Inaho and Slaine like immediately. What a badass. \\n\\n\r\n5/10 Harklight. Gets seduced by Slaine's bishounen powers. I forgot whether or not he dies trying to get senpai to notice him. I don't really care.\\n\\n\r\n5/10 Inko. Arguably the most likable girl in the show. Acts all cutesy and compassionate with Inaho and worries about him. Daww so cute amirite? Kind of I guess... Gets pushed away and assigned as Inaho's side bitch. She gets shot at 10 more times than any of the other characters but she always survives. Absolutely bullshit levels of plot armor. For some reason, every single kataphrakt instantly explodes into a million pieces of shitty pixelated CGI the moment it gets touched but nothing like that ever happens with Inko. But I guess they have to keep her alive as a romantic interest for Inaho. FOR THE NEXT SEASON OF COURSE. HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED.\\n\\n\r\n4/10 Female Inaho. Yuki Kaizuka, the bastard love child prototype that made way for the masterpiece of perfection that is her brother Inaho Kaizuka. Knowing just how hopelessly inferior she is to her perfect brother she tries to mimic her brothers robot like persona by getting a robotic arm to assist her broken one. But fails miserably at acting utterly emotionless like her brother does. As well as being perfect in every way possible like him. Seriously Yuki its not that hard to be a completely flawless human being. Way to break character, you fucking poser. She acts all lovey dovey over Inaho but comes off a bit more bitchy and possessive than Inko does when she tries to stop him from saving the damn world out of fear for his safety. At least wanting your brother to live is a slightly better excuse than liking birds. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the other characters basically get sidelined and don't do anything or have anything worthwhile to say about them. 0/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe action was enjoyable enough. The only saving grace was the okay action. (And seeing Slaine's beautiful face marred with his salty tears at the end.) It follows a pretty cookie cutter formula of: Scary new Martian bad guy with fancy unique kataphrakt appears. It rains pain down, destroying a bunch of faceless Terran mooks, as well as miraculously damaging but never killing any of the minor characters that happen to be fighting. Then Inaho comes and saves the day with his tactical and scientific brilliance as his signature battle theme plays for the umpteenth time. Rinse and repeat. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it's still fun to see some generic mech on mech action. But it's pretty average really. Some of the battles have some interesting strategies and events, but it's all methodically predictable. So if for some reason you are reading this review without even starting the show I wouldn't recommend this if you aren't a huge fan of action and mech anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have already watched season 1, I wouldn't really recommend you to either continue or discontinue the show, that's up to whether or not you are one of those masochists that don't drop any shows they started.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell that concludes my review. Now if you excuse me I'm going to see what kind of horrific yaoi fanfiction fujoshis are making between Inaho and Slaine.",

            "content": "A mecha show like Aldnoah Zero isn\u2019t without controversy. They say controversy creates attention, and honestly, it\u2019s a bit of an understatement with this show. From the way the first season concluded, one could not help but wonder how they will craft the contents for the sequel. It should be no surprise that many viewers will wonder the fate of our main protagonists (such as Inaho and Asseylum), the state of the war, and what\u2019s in stored for Slaine. However, what blasts off this season is nothing short but predictable clich\u00e9 writing, a stack of weakly balanced characters, and in general a disappointment that doesn\u2019tseem to be able to correct itself from what season 1 got started on.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, the sequel begins directly from where the season 1\u2019s events left off except with a time skip. Characters still look the same but some things have changed. Included with these include the absence of Asseylum on Earth. Then, there\u2019s also Slaine who has now devoted himself entirely to the Martians. And in a state of war, Aldnoah Zero Season 2 seems to continuously shove down the audience\u2019s throats of the personal struggles of certain characters. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. I like how the show expresses its interest to show how our main characters\u2019 lives are going in season 2. The problem I find is how it constantly recycles the same ideas over and over again. In general, it fails to ensnare a viewer\u2019s interest with the frequent ideology clashes. Less emphasis is put on the development of our characters but instead showing them their roles with a lot of badly stitched tropes. Furthermore, season 2 seems to highlight on even more problems with plot holes and writing for certain supporting characters. Logic itself also makes the audience question sometimes if the show knows what it\u2019s doing.\\n\\n\r\nFor our main characters, most of them play their roles in the war. Although many characters has certain objectives, it\u2019s clear that the show has a weakness with its character development. Only on occasions do certain side characters shine in this second season. This is because the sequel seems to emphasize on building up the story with various interconnected events. However, the grim reality is that it\u2019s predictable down to the earth and nothing really stands out besides our main characters. Season 2 also seems to have forgotten some of the major supporting characters on their development. (Rayet anyone? Calm?) In short, it\u2019s neglecting their chance to shine and seems to constantly try to shove down the main characters down our throats. New character such as Harklight and Lemrina doesn\u2019t gain any strong characterization at all. For instance, Harklight seems to play the sort of devoted servant for his \u201cmaster\u201d, Slaine. On the other hand, Lemrina is has a borderline obsession with him. It\u2019s kind odd really. The sequel almost seems to devote its entirety on Slaine\u2019s ambitions and ultimatum. Some of the diverting romance sub-plot is hardly anything interesting with the lack of interest between Slaine and certain characters. In general, it\u2019s messy with its characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do have to give credit to certain characters that makes their name more known compared to the previous season. One such name is Mazuurek that viewers may have forgotten about. His role in this season is expanded and in fact, even interesting to see considering where his loyalty lies. This seems to be a sharp contrast with other Martians who holds their close minds about pursuing peace. Instead of conquest, Mazuurek is devoted to Asseylum and believes her to be alive. So what does the man do? Take the risk and find her. Unlike the rest of the Martians who are too busy trying to stack up body counts or flexing their mecha biceps, the show offers a more thrilling insight on his mission. Unfortunately, this is still mostly overshadowed by our main character/antagonist Slaine. Season 2 really tries to show what he is capable of and his ambitions but it\u2019s not working. His emotions gets the better of him and even some of the people that trusts him deeply now have turned against him. It\u2019s hard to feel sorry for him because his own actions previously caused these consequences. And not to mention, his rivalry with a certain guy he dubbed \u2018Orange\u2019 isn\u2019t going to forgive him. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough not overbearing, some good portions of the show concentrates on action. However, it still remains the style it portrays with its gimmicky fighting. In particular, certain mecha now has ability to clone themselves, use piercing threads to slice and dice, or even make frost out of their enemies. Technology seems to have unlimited boundaries in the series as we even see the conscious of an electronic eye take hold of a person\u2019s mentality. As fascinating as this all sounds, there\u2019s really not much to get hold with these creative ideas. No matter how outrageous some of these ideas gets, the end result is almost always the same. The familiar strategies used through teamwork or taking a chance by calculations. Season 1 did that and the sequel doesn\u2019t really express itself any differently. The modus operandi seems to be that wherever battles happen, the result is almost predictable. Certain build ups and death flags are also become more like false advertisements as well. Talk about disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nOn the more technical side, I do give praise to some of the artistic direction the sequel handles itself. Action is fluid and the coordination is attractive. Even some of the new style of the music can be appealing when combined with the intense elements of sci-fi warfare. The OP and ED songs also holds some degree of symbolism along with a few recapping of the first season. Character voice mannerism on most parts remains solid and character expressions show credibility with the events of the sequel. However, it can be cringe worthy to hear some of the stereotypical emotional scenarios because honestly, it\u2019s all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, Aldnoah Zero Season 2 is a slick and empty hollow shell of its prequel. Many events are predictable with a lesser degree on character building but more so on their grand roles. And to be honest, it\u2019s annoying to see the same repetitive angles used over and over. At times, it even looks fake with a wrestling-like drama with faces and heels. It\u2019s not only that but the story itself also introduced certain characters out of nowhere. While certain characters do get more emphasis compared to the first season, some of the previously established characters seems to lack focus on-screen. Instead, we are constantly being fed by Slaine and his preposterous ambitions that can be ridiculous dull. I can\u2019t say for a fact that the sequel is complete utter trash though as it is mildly interesting to watch the development of the Vers/Earths War. It\u2019s somewhat thrilling to see which side will win in the end and whether or not certain characters will meet their endgame goals. But for now, season 2 doesn\u2019t get any better. Not by a damn long shot.",

            "content": "-This review will contain spoilers of season one as it relates to season two-\r\nThere's something extraordinary about trainwreck titles. Its ability to draw in viewers like moths to a flame, watching as the work fold in on itself, seemingly out of breath from the layers of its incompetence. The likes of which forming something like a toxic gas that stifles every bit of its production. Good ideas immediately dying off from screenplay pesticide, hovering over everything like a merchant of death and decay. You see, there's a kind of beauty to it all. The way everything topples over like a game of Jenga, with eachpiece representing a bad aspect of the overall project. The act of \"being bad\" in itself isn't due to a lack of inherently good attributes, but the fact that what little good is there can't survive because the ground it's growing out of is a complete landfill. When your base foundation is toxic, the only thing left to do is watch creativity wither and die, as it foolishly tries to eke out a meager existence in a place not meant for its type of inhabitants. \\n\\n\r\nA bad show making a bad continuation is one thing, but seeing an average one that maintained a steady course of passable grade content, effectively take a kamikaze nosedive into an endless sea of stupor\u2014now that's when things really get interesting. Vanilla content turned into a chocolate turd with sprinkles. Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is a serving of just that. A vaudevillian display of secreted nonsense, all standing out for the wrong reasons. \\n\\n\r\nSo where do we start with this one? It seems like a reach out in any direction to describe what went wrong would seemingly send you spiraling down a bottomless pit. Proceeding with caution isn't much of an option when this follow-up has the logistical density of walking on eggshells. I guess we could start by addressing the \"story and characters,\" or whatever chicken scratch this anime is attempting to pass off as such. And since I seem to be running with the poultry metaphors, we'll touch bases with our egg connoisseur and master tactician first, Inaho. This season sees our Gary Stu coming out of his shell, abandoning his brick wall personality to emote occasionally, almost like he's a \"character\" or something... well, almost. Where he served as a bodysuit for the audiences to roam about the world before, now he's effectively turned the autopilot off and began doing things for himself. More specifically, he's given an end-goal to motivate his actions. Where the problem lies is what he's given to obtain this end-goal, as the screenplay bends over backwards to hand him any and all tools necessary to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the first season was grafting its existence by using the template of Gundam as its skeleton, this season travels off the beaten path to problematic results. The ability of \"Aldnoah\" is no longer treated as a guarded inheritance by selected users, as now its power can be gained through a trading system. This system in question was possibly the worst written transferring mechanic to debuted in 2015\u2014A kiss. No, that wasn't a joke, the second season of A.Z quite literally makes Inaho an Aldnoah user by way of a fucking kiss. This is something other stories would use as a joke, as is the case with High School DxD's \"Boosted Gear\" which is powered by boners, being done as a sexual innuendo to parody shounens. But that's a comedy, A.Z isn't. And so this season can be seen as a joke of itself without an inkling of self-acknowledgment of that fact. \\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't stop there, as egghead Inaho is also granted another major advantage. This time diving more into the realm of 80s cinema cheese. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're reading this, I'm going to assume you've already watched season one, and if not, I will have to address the events of the finale to help explain the origin of Inaho's next hackneyed powerup. Season one's finale was concluded by a big shootout involving all of our key players up to that point. A shootout that saw Saazbaum and Asseylum gunned down by Slaine. This included Inaho, who received a gunshot wound to the head. Which, by the way, is a wound with a 5% survival rate, not even accounting for the smaller 3% chance of maintaining a good quality of life after recovery. Being the Gary Stu that he is, Inaho pulls through, seemingly getting rewarded a cybernetic eye for his troubles, which grants him an even greater tactical advantage. Now he can integrate his knowledge base with access to an infinite pool of information via the internet from his eye implant. He becomes part Terminator, part egg lover, and 100% HAX; why do these circumstances make him act more human as a result is beyond my comprehension (and the scriptwriters, for that matter). I guess it took getting shot in the head and being part cyborg before Inaho could act less robotic; on a meta-level, there's a bit of irony in there worth exploring, but I'll leave you to indulge in that on your own time. For now, we have more nonsense to explore. \\n\\n\r\nFor one, The yin to Inaho's yang, Slaine, has finally gone \"full retard,\" and as the wise words of Kirk Lazarus from Tropic Thunder once said: \"Everybody knows you never go full retard.\" After his failure to kill the men that have been the ire of his existence\u2014despite putting a hole through the skull of one and firing off a dozen shots into the body of the other\u2014Slaine decides to help out Saazbaum \"cuz reasons.\" Entrusting his life in his hands, Slaine vows to serve under  Saazbaum ranks for the final battle to come. You know, the \"normal\" thing to do after you empty a clip into someone with murderous rage. At this point, to say Slaine is a poorly written character would be a gross understatement. His personality from scene to scene is a complete coin toss. From pragmatic at one moment to pure lunacy by the next, there's really no predicting what the screenplay has in store for him. The only guarantee given is consistent inconsistency; the ultimate oxymoron made into human form. \\n\\n\r\nBringing these two sides of the autistic-character spectrum together is the ongoing war that reaches its final chapter. One that takes towards the heavens, as the earthlings and people of Vers turn the leftover remnants of the Moon into their Battle of Gettysburg. This was brought to life in shitty fashion, as it seemed that the people responsible for the post-production coverup magic in season one has finally succumbed to the same level of complacency plaguing the rest of the staffing. Likely due to the new battle locations not allowing for the use of inclement weather and structural landmarks to hide the issues, the mech suits are now left naked in the vacuum of space. Their gross textures, impersonal designs, and robust movement placed one center-stage, as they're sent jettisoning awkwardly across the sky. It's a real visual eyesore, made even worse with the stark backdrop hanging in the background of a majority of the shots. Clunky pieces of CGI just bumping ugly in the open emptiness of space that surrounds it. \\n\\n\r\nThis wouldn't be so bothersome had everything else been done to a bare minimum, but surprisingly enough, the character models and sparsely used landmarks were done with a semblance of quality control behind it. By contrast, the mechs just stick out even further. It's a distracting mix of artificiality and decent content. Of course, Hiroyuki Sawano does what Hiroyuki Sawano does best, making the soundtrack the real star attraction amidst all the mismanaged production issues. Other than that, this 2nd season leaves very little to be desired, serving better as a drinking game for every time the show shelled out a new asspull than it does a \"decent\" continuation. \\n\\n\r\nEven if the first season was a ripoff, it was, at the very least, a ripoff of something good. Season two isn't that. There's nothing to sugar coat here; this was a complete disaster. Very few shows have failed to the degree in which this one does. It's almost impressive just how little they manage to get right. But perhaps the greatest irony is that this season failed not because it was an off-brand like its first season but because it actually tried to do something different for once. It took a leap of faith only to be greeted by the ground below, and while that would be funny in most scenarios, here, it's nothing short of embarrassing.",

            "content": "With how much I loved season one, I was so excited for season 2 to start. Please, I'm begging you, do not watch season two. Stop at episode 12 of season one. Season two will ruin the entire experience for you. No matter how much you love season one, don't do it. Just don't. Anyway, on to the review:\r\nSTORY:\r\nBasically, they take the entire ending of season one, take everything back, and then proceed to stop all over the plot and tear it apart, piece by piece. It's a mess. I'm honestly so upset with hoe bad this was. \r\nART:\r\nIt's almost like they forgot how todraw their own characters. Inaho looks off the entire time, Asseylum looks like a baby whale when she's sad, Slaine doesn't look nearly as good as he did in season one, I could go on. I loved the art of season one. This was a mess, none of the characters ever looked quite right, and frankly the fight scenes were also boring to watch and were always anticlimactic. Oh, and the second ending song, which plays for episode 11, looks like it's drawn by a two year old\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is still amazing. Luckily that didn't change between season one and two. same great songs, and some great new songs. By all means, download the season two songs, but don't watch the show, please.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nBasically they took all character development and recked it. the first two episodes of the season makes it seem like Inaho is gonna be better in this season. The first two episodes lie to you. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI absoluetly LOVED season one. To the point where I had it listed as my number one favorite anime, and I was constantly making gifs of it. Second season makes me ashamed to like season one. I vote that we delete this season from existence, pretend episode 12 of season one is where Aldnoah.Zero really ends, and move on from there. on a final note: PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS SEASON, EVEN IF IT'S JUST AS A JOKE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW BAD IT'S GONNA BE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. IT WILL DISAPPOINT YOU. DO NOT DO IT.",

            "content": "\"BAM!\" \"BAM!\" \"BAM!!!\". This was how season 1 ended. I was rather thrilled by the sudden plot shift, and dearly looked forward to season 2. Oh how wrong I was back then. \r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe very first episode of season two should have been a warning to me NOT to continue watching. It totally invalidated what season 1 had tried to build up(in the last episode). There was no major plot progression at all. Majority of the episodes followed this simple recipe: \r\n1)Enemy(Martians) attacks \r\n2)Non-Inaho personnels try to fight Martians \r\n3)Martians engage their special weapon \r\n3)Non-Inaho personnels struggle \r\n4)Inaho to the rescue! \r\n5)Enemy Martians get defeatedby Inaho\\n\r\nIt then spirals to meaningless battles between The Deucalion and The Martians. There was no clear motive by Slaine, the antagonist. I wouldn't even call him an antagonist. People were just fighting in the series to waste screen time. They could have better spent that time detailing about Dr Troyard and the history of Aldnoah. Sadly, they did not. To be honest, there was no story whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nThe mechas and their animation just did not fit the space background. It felt out of place. The facial expressions of Slaine were, at times, poorly drawn. Asseylum sometimes appear to look somewhat like a whale. Inaho's face looked derpish too during certain scenes. This season's art was sorely inconsistent, which was rather surprising since season 1 had a rather decent art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm sorry but sound alone cannot save a series. Sawano Hiroyuki should not have wasted his talent on a show like this. The opening to the second series was well done. It has this rock-ballad feel to it which is just HNNNG. In fact, I felt that this season's opening was better than that of S1(by Kalafina). The OSTs were reused from S1 but everytime they came on I just realized why I continued ploughing through this series week after week. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nHuh? What character? \\n\r\nINAHO appealed to me at first because I thought he had some backstory to him that gave rise to his stoic mindset. I was wrong yet again. He is basically the solution to every problem. He gained a power-up too this season which made him even more God-like, less sensitive, and more emotionless. I can't say much about him because there isn't exactly anything else to say.\\n\r\nSLAINE was my favourite. Was. Then he became a confused maniac - he suddenly wanted to destroy Earth for no plausible reason. While Slaine may be suffering, watching Slaine in season 2 act like a complete fool gave me more suffering. However, he was the most fleshed out character of the entire series - that I can say for sure. His dedication to Asseylum, his determination to rise up the ranks, and his cunningness pleasantly surprised me at times.\\n\r\nASSEYLUM. Nope I'm not gonna waste my time talking about a character who barely made a difference in S2(Some may argue that she did something in the last episode, but did the Orbital Knights listen to her?) \\n\r\nLEMIRA. I actually don't know what happened to her after the 'finale'. She was your typical jealous girl character who wants to get into the pants of a guy that adores her sister. \\n\r\nI HAVE TO TALK ABOUT MARITO. He is the most pretentious character I have ever come across in any form of entertainment. \"OHNO I HAVE HAD EMOTIONAL TRAUMA FROM MY PAST WAR(which wasn't even explained properly); I DRINK TO EASE MY PAIN; I CANT KILL AN ENEMY\". He wins the title of most pretentious character. Period. A pity that he is voiced by my favourite seiyuu who also voices Hijikata(mayonnaise). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI only enjoyed two and a half things from this series: the music, me being able to laugh at the ridiculousness of this series, and the last 1/2 goes to Slaine. If you have read till here(thanks for reading btw), do yourself and I a favour by skipping this season. Season 1 was all right. Just.skip.this.season. If you want mecha anime, there are better ones out there. (TTGL, E7, CG, Gundam Unicorn, FCLC) \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\n+2 points for music. I have stated earlier that music alone cannot save a series. You can have the best composer in the anime industry on your production team, but if your story has no substance, your characters no proper development, and your art no consistency, it is impossible for your anime to be worth watching at all.",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers\r\nAldnoah Zero is quite possibly the most disappointing show I've watched since last summer. It's up there with Zankyou as a failed collaboration between an otherwise promising writer/director combo that ends up being a ruse to make a quick buck.\r\nThis review covers both seasons.\r\nAldnoah is an action anime primarily. However, even t its core, the action in this series can be easily summarized in this simple step-by-step list:\r\n1. Evil Martian in mecha shows up and decimates Earth Redshirts\r\n2. Secondary characters get caught up and say it's hopeless\r\n3. Inaho shows up, theme music power up, and uses OP BS (Magic Eye in 2ndseason) and destroys evil Martian mecha.\\n\r\n4. Everyone is glad\\n\\n\r\nBut formulaic action isn't the main issue, nor is the decent animation quality, it's how soulless and unnecessary these fights are. These fights can feel longer than they should due to padding and how little is actually happening in the fight storywise.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's discuss the story, or what little there is that drives the whole series forward. Aldnoah is a story about the struggle of the good Earth people and the dog-kicking evil people of Mars. Remarkably, the writers manage to screw up an otherwise simple and interesting premise thanks to bland characters, bad filler, and rushed plot development near the end. To make this review easier on the eyes to read, I'll be talking about each facet in great detail in their individual paragraphs.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah stars 2 incredibly bland main characters, Inaho and Slaine. As mentioned above, Inaho is incredibly OP, to the point where the entire Earth military relies entirely on him to win their battles for them. It doesn't help that Inaho's personality is very soulless and utterly devoid of emotion (2nd season is slightly better in this regard, but too little too late). Slaine on the other hand is initially the more interesting fellow, but his one-dimensional personality is often ruined by his sheer incompetence in the series. Slaine can't do anything right, even if it's in his capability to do so. It's hard to pity him however, as he becomes very much unlikable as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other noteworthy character is the Princess, who is just...there. She is a MacGuffin item given life but still a hollow item inside. She's the main reason why this plot exists, but she's ultimately nothing. It's hard to form an emotional connection with her (which is what I believe is the main intention of the writers) because of how bland she is. \\n\\n\r\nEvery other character in the series is so incompetent/unnecessary they might as well be trees in the background. (Aside maybe Saazbaum, he's so hammy and fun it's a shame he doesn't appear often).\\n\\n\r\nThere is very little plot progression in the series beyond the first few episodes and the last few episodes. Most episodes are just filler with boring fight scenes or with characters talking about nothing and accomplishing nothing. This rushed progression is so bad, the series actually introduces a plot-important (relatively speaking anyway) character 3 episodes before the series finale. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the series is generally quite messy. The composer's soundtracks for the battle scenes are the standard samey generic \"One-Woman Waling in the background with orchestral rock\" stuff you've heard before in anime with this guy composing. The one notable soundtrack which I find was not only used quite well within context, but quite pleasant to listen to is the theme that accompanies Lemrina and occasionally Count Klancain near the end of the second season. \\n\\n\r\nI've talked about the fight scenes in great detail previously, but to emphasize how bad they really are, lets take a look at this gif made by one person on they're own free time with some simple software.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1959599\\n\\n\r\nEven without context, this fight scene conveyed in the gif is more intense, interesting and communicates all the information that is needed to be told to the viewer. In the gif, we can tell the two girls fighting are rivals, with the short-hair girl being a degree more powerful than twintails girl, to the point where she's just toying around with twintails. We can also see that twintails is persistent and despite knowing she's way outta her league, still gives it her all and tries her damnedest to not give up. Eventually, we see that even though she lost and knows that her rival is merely toying with her, she still has a feeling of admiration for her rival, hinting that this battle may yet to conclude.\\n\\n\r\nThese few seconds in the gif has more going on in it than any fight scene, hell, any given scene in Aldnoah. The incompetence of the people involved in Aldnoah still baffles me to this day. \\n\\n\\n\r\nReally now, if you want a good mecha series with a half-decent story, go watch Gurren Lagan or something. This isn't worth you time. \\n\\n\r\nNow some of you may wonder, why I made myself watch this trite series when I could've gave up on episode 2. Thing is, ever since the first episode, I've always held up the belief that the series may redeem itself somewhere down the line. It is that hope, that I cling to, that pushes me onward through adversity. And now I'm here, as a beacon to guide potential viewers away from this farce. Save yourself.\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n",

I could be talking about Guilty Crown, but unfortunately is Aldnoah Zero.  \r\nAfter the end of season one, i thought \"This can't be another guilty crown, right?\" I was so wrong. \r\nThe season two started really well, but don't be fooled, the story will progress to a point that you will finding yourself hating the characters you used to love and forgetting some of them because it only focus on the trio Inaho, Aseylum and Slaine. The end is weird, rushed and does not make any sense to me.\r\n(spoilersfrom here)\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the end isn't what you could say \"sad\", it was one of the more unpleasant endings i ever saw, they focused so much in the main trio and at the end not a single one seemed happy nor sad, it was the \"so so ending for everyone\", Inaho is just Inaho, in love with Aseylum and keeping his nemesis alive by her wish, Slaine is \"saved\" by the wish of Aseylum, but this is the worst punishment for him, and Aseylum, who loved both Inaho and Slaine marry a random count (A pointless marriage, since it didn't really stop the war)  that appeared in two episodes and is happy because earth is in peace now.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers end here)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately i'm in love with the soundtrack, so this is another anime that will be haunting me, every time i listen to it, i remember how unpleasant that second season was.",

            "content": "Thank you, Winter 2015 for producing another disappointing sequel. I enjoy it.\r\nSTORY (3):\r\nThe story continues where season 1 left off. The story involves the war between Earth & Martians. How will they solve their resolutions? \r\nI enjoyed season 1. It had fun characters and an excellent build-up. Unfortunately, just like Tokyo Ghoul season 2, this sequel suffers from tensionless fight scenes and boring characters.\r\nART (4):\r\nThe animation is nothing special.\r\nSOUND (4):\r\nThe music is not memorable.\r\nCHARACTER (3):\r\nOh boy? Where do I begin?\r\nInaho is so overpowered that he gets the job done easily. The rest of the cast members are relying heavily on Inaho all the time. Inahobarely shows any emotion, just like Edward Cullen. Inaho is just a wish-fulfilment character.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine was an interesting character, he could be an anti-hero. If he was given a better material, he could have been a memorable villain. However, his character was handled terribly.\\n\\n\r\nAsseylum Vers Allusia was useless all the time. She barely did anything. In the 1st season, she contributing something. However, in the second season, she become more useless. What are you writers doing? Give better roles to women. C'mon. First was SAO, then its Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, and now this.\\n\\n\r\nRayet Areash, OMG. She is the most annoying character I have seen in my entire life. All she does is cry and moan all the time. She showed determination in the 1st season, however in the second season, she became more annoying that usual. If I thought Stephanie Dola was annoying, she is way worse than Stephanie Dola. At least Stephanie Dola didn't moan or cry all the time. I don't care if you say \"Her parents are dead so that's why she acted like that\". There are characters whose parents are dead, and they learn how to become determined to succeed. Example Shinji Ikari, he might be annoying however he showed some determination inside him.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are bland.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3):\\n\\n\r\nI am not going to waste my time talking about it because I have better things to do. I enjoyed the 1st season however, the 2nd season is a mistake to watch. \\n\\n\r\nWhat ultimately makes this sequel worse than Tokyo Ghoul's sequel is the characters. At least the sequel of Tokyo Ghoul have characters that never annoyed me.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give this anime a 3 out of 10.",

            "content": "Note: this review encompasses both seasons 1 and 2 of Aldnoah.Zero\r\nOne thing as an anime fan I've never really been able to get into is the idea that a single name behind a project can generate hype. I think it's better to prioritize looking at the scenario, and the studio's track record first and foremost as opposed to getting excited because of the reputation of one individual. Of course that \"one individual\" in this case just so happens to be one of the most controversial writers in the business to date, Gen Urobuchi. I'm not really here to get into my personal stance on Urobuchiobviously, though If I was to be honest with you, I am for the most pretty indifferent to his output. So I wasn't necessarily excited to hear that this was his brainchild nor was it much of a cause of alarm to hear he jumped ship. Considering how the quality of Gargantia and the Psycho-Pass franchise suffered after he handed those off (and not to mention the fact that the guy who took his place was the same dude who brought us Boku no Pico AKA everyone's favorite meme recommendation) perhaps some serious red flags should've been raised. I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. After an OK start, the writing really unravels itself into complete oblivion in the most uninteresting way imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is that none of it's battles feels particularly weighty or meaningful in the long run. The show doesn't really manage to make up for that with sheer entertainment value since the skirmishes between the two factions feel very samey-samey and repetitious to the point where you can make a sort of drinking game out of it. A shot every time UFE (United Forces of Earth) soldiers shoots repeatedly to no avail at overpowered marauders from Mars and end up becoming death fodder. A shot for every time Inaho appears, analyzes the enemy and finds out their weakness just minutes into the battle and wins. A shot for every time the plot isn't impacted in any meaningful way and all named characters come out alive. A shot for...OK, I think I've made my point. What also doesn't help is that the battles somehow turn a strong Sawano OST and turn into a negative. The issue here is that the music selection is incredibly shallow and overstated. They literally play the same theme for every battle against each Martian onslaught, only swapping themes once after the season break and continuing to do the same afterward. This way the OST not only makes otherwise good tracks seem stale, it also assigns the same level of importance to the battles with random irrelevant bad guys as it would the season-ending climaxes. Gimmicks are the only thing that set the battles apart from each other, the only real question is what broken power will the Martians bring to the table for a high schooler to overcome. From the mech that erases everything he touches to the mech that can freeze surroundings to the mech that can clone itself endlessly, it still manages to feel rote. The impenetrable layers of plot armor and the uninteresting hold-overs from skirmish-to-skirmish eventually make the action in Aldnoah.Zero a complete bore.\\n\\n\r\nEverything I've brought up this far has only really been enough to make the show completely mediocre at worst, but the characters are what make Aldnoah.Zero a true failure. It's hard to not feel anything but the deepest of apathy for the UFE in particular since most of them aren't given a lick of depth and the only character arcs that are thoroughly set-up (Marito and Rayet's) fall off the face of the Earth in the 2nd season because they become entirely irrelevant. Honestly, the entirety of the UFE may as well be renamed the United Job-squad of Earth since they'd be about as capable as an infant in front of a bloodthirsty pack of hyenas if not for Inaho, which finally brings me to everyone's favorite autistic ace-pilot. There really isn't much to say about the guy that isn't incredibly obvious from the 1st few episodes and that's what hamstrings the show most out of all of it's problems. There's no getting around it, Inaho is just one massive, expressionless plot-win button to the point where the likes of Kirito and Tatsuya Shiba. They try to make it seem as if he actually gives a damn about anything by having other people talk behind his back about the guy he really is underneath, but even then he fails to stir much in the audience besides boredom since he would swear vengeance upon the enemy for the death of a friend with same level interest one would put into ordering a carton of discount eggs, possibly less. He has no interesting backdrop, development or anything resembling catharsis. He's just \"competence\" incarnate and that's fucking lame.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mars side fares better in the writing department considering, but that's pretty faint praise by my estimation. Of course, the only interesting character to follow throughout the entire series is Slaine Troyard for better of or worse. He has the benefit of not only being allowed to make mistakes, yet he also drives the story forward so he's already much better than any of the characters from Earth for that alone. The 2nd half mostly revolves around him and the decisions he makes that don't necessarily line up with the desires of the princess he once tried to rescue. His actions and his ambitions essentially run in opposite directions in the latter half. Without going into specific-spoiler territory, everything that befalls him in the second is completely a result of his own lack of foresight and thus it becomes difficult to feel bad for the guy. His evolution from a chicken running around with its head cut-off in the name of the Princess to some sort of Machiavellian-type mass-murderer overnight and it's hard to buy. The logic behind this character feels tacked on and silly. Sauzbaum had potential as a true antagonist because he was an actual character as opposed to most of the crazy warmongering elites, but even his character is wasted in a fairly stupid manner.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is just one of those titles I've completed only to question why I ever bothered with it in the 1st place. It sure as heck isn't smart enough to win over Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Gundam fans, nor is it stupid or edgy enough to capture the appeal of Valvrave or Cross Ange. Of course Aldnoah.Zero is full of nonsense too, but it takes nonsense far too seriously to the point where laughing at the writers is the best reaction I could possibly hope for. It never even manages to become a complete trainwreck at the end because the resolution in the final episode just feels too damn simple and lacking in pay-off. Character arcs and plot-points (like the research of Slaine's father, the origins of the alien technology, the issues with Inaho's eye, etc) are tossed into the wind since the series has wasted too much time in the 1st 23 episodes to do anything but fizzle out in a way that makes much of what the viewers subjected themselves to feel even more pointless than before.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show for nobody, not even the most die-hard Urobuchi-philes since his influence on the majority of the story is non-existent and no attempts were made to even provide a cheap imitation of his voice. Want a mech series with romance, plenty of action and a strong OST? Watch The Vision of Escaflowne or Macross. Want a full-blown epic-scaled war between two sides with plenty of history behind it? Go check out Legend of the Galactic Heroes or get into the Gundam. As far as I see it, Aldnoah.Zero offers a war without weight and politics that lack intrigue.",

            "content": "After watching the entirety of the Aldonah.Zero series (except for the recap, I didn't consider it necesary for obvious reasons), I decided to write my very first review on MAL.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to clarify something: I'm not a diehard mecha fan. I only watched other three mecha animes, specifically Neon Genesis Evangelion (including EoE and the Rebuilds), Gurren Lagann and Code Geass R1 and R2, and I could say I'm used to the genre by now.\r\nAfter clarifying this, now I can talk about what are my thoughts about Aldnoah.Zero season 2.\r\nI'll try not to spoil much, but I do need to talkabout some stuff that really bothered me. A lot.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 3/10:\\n\r\nSo we begin 19 months after the events of the first season. The war between Earth and Vers continues as we find out everyone who presumably 'died' in season 1's finale is actually still alive.\\n\r\nWe find out, through flashbacks, that Slaine Troyard spared Saazbaum's life after he shot the princess, but with the condition of taking her with them to save her life. Later on, the Earth people find Inaho unconcious and managed to save him, even though he was shot in the face.\\n\r\nBack to the present day, Inaho Kaizuka is back to kick some martian ass and be as emotionless and flat-written as always, only now he can know EVERYTHING thanks to his new fancy cyborg eye.\\n\r\nOh, but how will the Earthlings fly their Aldnoah-powered ship now without the princess around? Simple, Inaho has the power to activate Aldnoah now. Just because he did CPR to her after she choked on her french fries on season 1. That's it, a fucking 'kiss' can give you the mystical power of Aldnoah, passed on generation after generation, something probably genetical, easier to get than contracting AIDS!\\n\r\nEveryone else depends on Inaho, as always.\\n\r\nMeanwhile, a fake princess Allusia appears, declaring that Earth must be invaded and stuff. We find out she's Allusia's half-sister and that she also has this shape-shifting power thing. The real princess stays in a comatose stage and only Slaine, Saazbaum, Eddelrittuo (the princess's loli) and the half-sister know about her.\\n\r\nSlaine gets greater and greater ranks between the Vers soldiers, and with the help of the fake princess, gets everyone to try to fight the Earthlings and take over Earth, even thought this was AGAINST what princess Allusia desired.\\n\r\nThe ending is the stupidest thing ever.\\n\\n\r\nART 5/10:\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty neat, but the animation can be a bit confusing at times. The fighting scenes are 100% CGI and may be hard to follow. The character design is not very outstanding. Some characters look very much alike, at least between the Vers counts.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7/10:\\n\r\nThe music for this series felt adecuate, but it's a bit repetitive. It fulfills its purpose, but nothing else. The Kalafina opening was a lot better than this one. The ending theme is okay...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 2/10:\\n\r\nUntil the end of season 1, the only likeable character was Slaine Troyard... but they fucking ruined him.\\n\r\nInaho is still as boring and uninteresting as in season 1. He's the clichest character I ever seen, OP'd a lot, as smart and tactical as Light Yagami and Lelouch combined, and now he's even half cyborg, as if he wasn't emotionless enough. He has no backstory, no clear motivations, no nothing. I can't even consider him as the protagonist.\\n\r\nSlaine was the only character with actual character development, even until season 2. We saw him rise from the bottom to become almost Emperor of Vers. But after the princess was retrieved from Earth, the writers forcefully turned him into the 'bad guy', with no clear motivations, other than 'I DO THIS FOR TEH PRINCESS', so he goes against Earth, even though, once again, THIS WAS AGAINST WAHT THE PRINCESS DESIRED.\\n\r\nThere is not much to say about the other characters without spoiling stuff, but I'll just say that they're not very outstanding and there's practically no one else is very relevant in the story. Well, maybe Alussia's sister, but there's not much to say about her either.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 3/10:\\n\r\nThis second season felt very promising when first announced, even though there it seemed hard to have a new and fresh start with most of the main characters 'deceased'. I even thought Slaine was going to become the main protagonist, but I wasn't sure what to expect of him.\\n\r\nThis season felt clich\u00e9-er than ever. No one dies, in contrast with the first half of the series (lol), the good guys always win and never lose, the bad guys, even with their dozens years advanced technology, are brutally defeated, and the ending is the worst shit I've ever seen.\\n\r\nThere are a lot of plot holes in the story, no plot twists or sudden relevant changes, the non-battle scenes are boring as hell, and the battles themselves... well, all praise Inaho the all-mighty. He can do EVERYTHING.\\n\r\nBTW, why do their mechas look so much like Code Geass's Knightmares? They even have that harpoon shooting thingy... Hmmmmmm, I smell lack of originallity.........\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 3/10:\\n\r\nDisgusting.\\n\r\nThis felt as a huge step backwards compared to the first series. Actually, the first series wasn't that good either, but the second season is actually worse. The characters are even lazier written (and more unrealistic than ever), the story fucking sucks, the ending fucking sucks, they don't even have Kalafina, and it's all plain boring.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed season 1, go watch it, but you may be VERY disappointed.",

Or maybe it's the comfort of bed instead of the treadmill. Whether it is mental or physical, there are those times where one just doesn't want to do whatever it is that needs doing. In other words, there is a lack of motivation. So maybe it's the joy your parents would feel by seeing a good grade, or the elation you would have at obtaining that tone body, that motivates you to accomplish that ever elusive goal. Motivation, like those \"blocks,\" isalways present; you just need that initial push to really get going. And Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is a prime example for when such motivation is sorely lacking.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nZero Two (the moniker to be used) takes place several months after the conclusion of the first season. Inaho has miraculously survived, Slaine has climbed the Vers' ranks, and Asseylum is currently in a coma. Irrespective of their situations, war continues.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Zero Two, like its predecessor, mostly focuses on is the action that permeates much of the show. The space battles, the cool robots, the random technology; it's an anime that is entertainment first and purpose second. And for the most part, the anime gets this right. While everyone outside of Inaho is fodder or useless, the range of scenarios that the action encapsulates are wide and varied. Whether it be taking down a Kataphrakt from the Earth's orbit or using a multi-lock-on system to eliminate the enemy in a solitary strike, Zero Two is always looking to switch up the formula in order to keep the show both refreshing and fun. There are always two issues that persist through all of the fights, though: Inaho and his robotic eye. Inaho is a \"Gary Stu:\" he's infallible, un-killable, and nonnegotiable when it comes to battle. He never has any problems dealing with the enemy (a reason that is never really explained) and thus the skirmishes follow the same pattern and predictability: good guys are losing, Inaho devises plan, and Inaho wins. These repeated events occur at an even higher probability due to his newfound eyeball. Acting as a sort of supercomputer, Inaho's already unfair level of tactical skills is amplified by his trusty ocular, making what goes down between Inaho and the enemy seem more like hide-and-seek rather than war.\\n\\n\r\nThere is another problem that persists, but not between the battles but instead between the seasons. And that is Zero Two's inability to properly utilize the very assets that it holds. The show has a lot of material to work with outside of the war, the main cast -- Inaho, Slaine, and Asseylum -- and the overarching plot. But it doesn't use any of it for some baffling reason. In fact, it even introduces new facets that go unused. Some easy examples include: Rayet and Marito's backstories, perceptions, and ideas; Inko and Magbaredge's role in the grander scheme of things; the political subterfuge that exists within both the Earth government and Vers Empire; Lemrina's and Maazurek's overall influence on the people that they were connected to; and Yuki's and Harklight's relationship with the person they were \"protecting.\" There's a lot that is going on, mostly because there is a literal interplanetary space war happening in the background. And subsequently these myriad of relevant plot points are generated, and for good reason; they contain a breadth of potential that the anime can catapult off of. Yet, it never does: such elements stagnate and are sadly wasted by the time the anime finishes.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the dust settles and the eggs are counted, Zero Two does contain some semblance of theme. Like the introduction stated, motivation is a factor that is omnipresent; it's the kind of \"entity\" that allows someone to do or not do an action based upon the amount given. And for our main trio, this idea is displayed nicely enough. Inaho is wholly guided by Asseylum's light, and wants nothing more than to make her wishes come true; Slaine's motivation is at first Asseylum's protection but devolves into a thirst for power; and Asseylum herself discovers through the actions of these two boys that the brokered peace that she had always dreamed about was within her grasp. And this kind of thinking, that motivation takes on multiple forms, is manifest in all parts of the show. The Martian fighters rally to fight for Slaine's cause, Yuki and Inko look to support Inaho, and Lemrina is spurred on by Slaine -- the only person who shared even a shred of caring for her. So, while the actual narrative is a package filled with unused goods, Zero Two's motivational theme is tried and true.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nZero Two's art was often quite nice to look at. This is mainly due to the landscapes that the anime found itself in. There were grassy plains with overcast, arid deserts with relevant sand dunes, and dilapidated cities that harbored past transgressions. Alongside the art, the show does a nice job of keeping the choreography of the fights easy to follow due to nice use of the camera. The Kataphrakts' abilities and the general dueling that occurred never felt overly difficult to read, making these bouts that much more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for the anime are nothing too notable. It's a \"realistic\" setting, so many of the characters are given realistic designs. Of note are Asseylum and Lemrina for their more stand-out dresses and hair styles. But beyond them, the rest of the cast is rather unimpressive, especially in comparison to the art.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation for the show was normally about average. The anime heavily relied on CG, namely with the Katphrakts and the Deucalion. One becomes desensitized to the three-dimensional usage after a time, but when it isn't showcasing this kind of animation, the rest is often static scenes with characters talking or lamenting.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nZero Two places the majority of its bets on two separate couplings: Asseylum and Lemrina, and Inaho and Slaine.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the pair of princesses, it's not immediately obvious who the better of the two is. One was sidelined into a coma and contracted amnesia for three-fourths of the show, while the other saw insignificant progression in her emotional balance. These descriptions fit Asseylum and Lemrina, respectively. The former does nearly nothing for the entire season, with her only act of importance coming through in the way of a radio message. She sees no development, serves no purpose, and has no worth outside of her name. She literally becomes a tool to be used -- for both sides of the war -- whenever the plot sees fit to take her out of the drawer. It's an unfortunate outcome that came to be because of her sister; Lemrina's inclusion in the story is not only sudden, but a direct byproduct of Asseylum's condition. For without the lovable, kindhearted girl, someone had to take her place. Therefore, the sibling does. But instead of being filled with good, Lemrina is filled with evil; her scorn of the position she's in, her jealousy of the sister she has, and her feelings of loneliness stir within her the makings of a mentally unstable being. She often talks of the moon base as being \"her home,\" simply because it's the only location where things have gone right for her. She's accepted, her sister is gone, and Slaine is by her side. Yet, her home, like her character, explodes. By the anime's end, while her characterization exists, she, like her sister, means nothing to the story outside of a few radio appearances. In other words, the two are bound both by blood and badness.\\n\\n\r\nThe second pair is more of a seesaw than a level playing field. Inaho is the all-mighty warrior, the de facto champion of the Earth's soldiers. He begins the season compliant of the higher-ups that are guiding their hand, simply engaging in feud after feud to much success. And while Inaho always manipulates the outcome of the fights in his and his comrades' favor, there isn't any manipulation of his actual character. He without a doubt plays the biggest part in regards to everything that goes down, but lacks in personal development. Which might just be a corner he was written into thanks to the writing; his unbeatable status, his ridiculously overpowered eye-friend, and nonexistent emotions make such growth impossible. He cannot be challenged and he cannot be affected; he's as much a robot as the machine in his brain.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the higher side of that seesaw. Slaine Troyard is a man with a mission, one that he will do anything he can to accomplish. Initially, this goal was to save Asseylum, to keep her safe. But it slowly morphs into something more sinister: the attainment of absolute power. And this progression in his character makes complete sense; his previous passiveness nearly caused him to lose that which was most dear to him. So, this season, he moves from being reactive to active. Slaine's gall gradually grows, and as the people around him note, he no longer acts as a mere cub but as an unrelenting wolf. But as his ruthless behavior begins to amass, his unending bloodlust blinds him. Instead of caring for Asseylum, he cares only for the structure around her; he lies to her, deceives her, and undermines her, all for the sake of \"keeping her safe.\" Yet, his actions sacrifice everything that Asseylum not only held dear around her but also held dear in him. And when Slaine realizes the folly of his ways, it's too late; he's been saved, forced to atone for the sins he mistakenly created. A poetic end for a poetic character.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP starts with soft singing that accompanies some hard guitar and a simple drum beat. Yet, it works; it's catchy and sounds quite pleasant to the ear. The near halfway mark causes the singer to adopt a more prominent role in the piece, with grander singing and more skip-like lyrics. But past this point, the instruments work to overtake the singer, causing the piece to lose its established \"oomph.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is also a strange beast. It is filled with background ambient effects to sound more space-like and mysterious, but drowned out by powerful vocals and more rambunctious drum playing. At the very least, the opening and ending choir-like singing is quite captivating.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the OST contains specific pieces that are quite good, such as the lone female singer that follows along with the show's signature beat -- the one obtained from the previous season's ED. Others definitely fit the mood for the show, too, such as the slow violins during the tense buildups. The tracks certainly sound like Hiroyuki Sawano composed them, but they don't feel like his music. There isn't anything from them that is truly memorable or standout, despite everything sounding so nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice-acting, the cast involved performed somewhere around average. Nobody involved was truly given the opportunity to shine, but Sora Amamiya as Princess Asseylum did a wonderful job capturing that innocently tender way of speaking.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason for watching this one, at all, was in wanting to see where the characters ended up. And upon seeing them all return, that wasn't extremely off-putting. Sure, it's completely implausible, but getting to watch the main three head toward a conclusion was going to be fun to see.\\n\\n\r\n\"Was\" is the keyword. For what was given wasn't fun, it was lame. Not only is the final \"duel\" between Orange and Bat absolutely boring but Asseylum doesn't even end up with either of them, and more specifically the obvious choice in Inaho. I'm a huge romance guy -- it's my favorite genre. So watching her marry some random boy -- after having someone like Inaho chase after her, after giving him a beaded necklace from her, and after she starts to cry as she says, \"I also think of you as a part of myself\" -- is quite infuriating. Maybe his eye mistranslated his feelings towards Asseylum or maybe her decision was circumstantial. But it's clear from her and his actions that there was something between the two. And wouldn't it have been an even better sign of peace between the two sides if a Terran and a Vers became betrothed instead? Goading people on then forcefully throwing the rug out from under them is not enjoyable; it's frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero 2nd Season starts off precariously, seems promising throughout its run, but ultimately ends on a very sour note. The story is misshapen, the characters are shoddy, and the rest is lackluster. While Asseylum, Inaho, and Slaine may be smiling by the show's end, I most certainly am not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, focused yet predictable entertainment, abundance of unused plot elements, motivational theme\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice art style, okay character designs, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Slaine cannot support how awful Asseylum, Lemrina, and Inaho are\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, good soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, the out-of-left-field \"romance\" is very frustrating to handle\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "*Review for both 'seasons'. This is simply one series split into two halves*\r\nAldnoah Zero is a mecha anime that pits the forces of the earth against a Martian empire whose technological superiority is underscored by a ruthlessness and pride resemblant of the great empires of earth with centuries of history. The year is 2014, and it has been forty-years years since the Martian empire was founded.\r\nWait.\r\nForty-two years?\r\nOkay, let's try this again. Aldnoah Zero is a mecha anime that features plenty of drama, action, and even a hint of romance, but fails to set up its story and characters in a way that any of theseelements can resonate with the viewer. The lead character, Kaizuka Inaho, takes the stereotypical self-insert main character to ridiculous length by having no emotions for the great majority of the series. Meanwhile his rival and series antagonist, Slaine Troyard, is a significantly more human and interesting character, far more so than the rest of the cast. But whereas Inaho's actions are guided by some sort of logic, Troyard's motivations for his absolutely insane schemes are never explained, shown, or slightly conveyed to the viewer in a believable way.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, it doesn't matter if the Vers empire has existed for forty-two years, forty-two days or forty-two centuries. Either could work if there's some kind of impetus for the conflict presented, something tangible that makes us empathise with the circumstances of both sides. But throughout the entire series, not once are we given some kind of deep glimpse into the Vers Empire. There are a lot of remarks about how the masses of Vers are poor, but we never, ever see them. We only see the handsome knights, soldiers and gleaming technology. So as far the viewer is concerned, the behaviour of Slaine Troyard, the Vers Empire, in fact most of the characters in this decrepit series is inexplicable.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I am getting increasingly bored and frustrated of Aldnoah Zero's boring, creatively frustrated plot, it has a little party trick to pull. Decent fight scenes. Watching Inaho figure out and exploit the weaknesses of the Vers Empire's high-powered mechs is one of very few enjoyable parts of this series. Ultimately, it's just a deus ex machina if you break it down enough, but it means the fight scenes are quite varied and sometimes surprising, even if the overall structure is predictable.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah Zero is nothing if not well-produced. Having the mechas entirely animated by 3D models is going to be a turn-off for many, but they're quite detailed, the designs are good, and while the animation can seem clunky, the choreography is emphatic. This is also one of the many recent series scored by Hiroyuki Sawano, and while his music often comes across as bombastic, it's distinctive and forms a great accompaniment to the action. Though, while the art and character designs in Aldnoah Zero are decent, the colour palette of the series is cool and miserable, which only serves to mirror the boredom of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, with a project as large as this, a good presentation is the minimum I expect. This is what Aldnoah Zero is, the minimum of expectations. By refusing to have any kind of personality, whether figuratively in terms of story and setting, or literally in terms of characters, it doesn't offend enough to put its audience off from buying it, but it never elevates itself above mediocrity either. The question is, do I rate this a 5 to acknowledge its workmanlike averageness, or a 3 for not even trying to hide its identity as a cynical monetary franchise? Let's split the difference.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3, Art: 5, Sound: 7, Character: 3, Enjoyment: 4,  Overall: 4",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nIt's a shame it all had to end up like this. If you were to flashback to about a year ago, the first season of Aldnoah.Zero was the most anticipated anime of 2014 for many(including me): the latest brain-child of Gen Urobuchi, directed by Ei Aoki, with music by esteemed composer Hiroyuki Sawano. It was a super-star of the 2014 summer anime season, but by the time it had finished airing it had fallen quite roughly from the spot-light. Problems plagued it: a lackluster cast, odd pacing, as well as mediocre writing, as it soon became the butt of the animecommunities jokes. But even so, it wasn't a terrible anime; at least in my opinion. It had problems, but it was still enjoyable, and even showed an occasional spark that it could be something more then it was, that it could maybe meet those hefty expectations that the community had set for it before it had begun airing. This was my mind-set as we headed into the second, and concluding season of Aldnoah.Zero. It wasn't the right one.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, and today, we take a look at the second season of Aldnoah.Zero, and maybe we can figure out where it all went wrong. I won't be boring you with the studio who animated it or the writers involved, all that information is already available in my review of the first season. What I will tell you is that Aldnoah.Zero 2 is a 12 episode anime TV series that aired between January 10th to March 28th of 2015, airing in that year's winter season. Now, let's jump right into where we left off in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSo, as a slight refresher, where did we leave off? Well, if you recall, everyone was dead. Princess Asseylum had been shot in the head, Slaine had shot Inaho in the face, and now it is 19 months later. The war between Earth and the Vars Empire has continued, though after the events of the finale of the first season, the core pieces have been shuffled, and now everyone stands in different places. Slaine is now a well-respected knight for the Vers Empire, as he has the backing of Count Saazbaum, a penance for Slaine saving the count's life at the end of the first season. Slaine, with the help of Count Saazbaum has rescued Asseylum from her certain death on Earth, and now they hold her in permanent status within Ver's military base on the moon, unsure whether she will ever wake up from her coma. With the Princess now out of commission and the last chance for peace between Earth and Vers completely gone, Slaine has devised a new way to rally troops against Earth: as now Asseylum's half-sister Lemrina impersonates Asseylum, using the princess' influence to ignite the hatred between Earth and Mars to drive the war effort onward. Slaine in the meantime, works his way up Ver's military, with a final goal in mind that only he knows, as he leads the charge against Earth's military and gains the support of various counts and knights around Vers. The situation is made even more complicated as Slaine must work through his own personal stigma of being \"a terran\", a fact which places various barriers in the way of his path into a commanding position, and now, Princess Lemrina has started to develop feeling for Slaine, and she could potentially reveal herself as an impostor at any moment out of jealousy of Slaine's feelings for Asseylum or if he reject her advances, effectively putting an end to his plans before he even has time to instigate them.\\n\\n\r\n     On the Earth side of the war,  Inaho has miraculously survived as well, due to some, let's be fair, bullsh*t involving Aldnoah.Zero that allowed him get medical attention. Inaho lives on as a soldier, now equipped with a new robotic eye that allows him to perform all kinds of life-hacks(including being able to tell if somebody is lying, scanning distance between targets and make predictions, scan for coordinates(and really this thing is just completely over-powered)). Inaho is the only one who suspects that the current Princess Asseylum is an impostor, and is determined to find where the real princess is and rescue her, even if that means he will be putting himself directly in the way of Slaine Troyard, setting the stage for an inevitable showdown between the two that may determine the fate of the entire war.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I'll talk about positives first. As a the plot for a \"second cour\" of a series goes, it could be worse. It has pust both main characters into more commanding roles that allow more radical plot-points to occur, and it does well to recognize that these things must always have a sense of escalation as now most of the battle scenes take place in space, which, let's be honest, is pretty awesome no matter what context. But that's really all the good I have to say about it. The idea for this second season might have worked, and worked very well,  but ultimately, the execution is so lack-luster that all positives it had just sort of steadily seep out as the anime buries itself deeper under its own stupidness.\\n\\n\r\n     The inherent problem is probably that the writing really isn't that good, rendering all ideas the anime had pretty much pointless. Characters often make stupid or unrealistic decisions that only serve to drive the plot onward, and certain plot-points only occur because of amazing coincidences or logic that fails to hold any sort of weight. I mean guys, are you really telling me that Slaine missed Inaho's head from literally point blank range when he shot him at the end of the first season? We all know the only reason Slaine missed is so this \"second cour\" could happen, and so Inaho could get his stupid robotic eye. And another thing, that robotic eye is complete bullsh*t. I don't care how smart the show tells us Inaho is, that eye is pretty equivalent to a Geass in terms of unfairness(though to be fair, they do add consequences later on for that plot-point, though it never really goes anywhere). It's things like this that make the whole thing hard to take seriously, though Aldnoah.Zero does undoubtedly want you to take it seriously. You can really tell it's trying to be an epic space adventure, filled with interesting politics and awesome characters, but... it just isn't. It's not like, say Valvrave, that pretty much just insulted your intelligence and credibility as an anime fan by just watching it; Aldnoah.Zero legitimately wants you to be pulled into this world, to care about these characters, and to really be on the edge of your seat as events play out. But the writing just can't support these good intentions; no matter how good it wants to be, just the act of treating itself like a good anime when it really isn't only adds to the stupid factor, and makes the show easier to insult. I don't want to insult Aldnoah.Zero. Hell, I still rather like the first season at the end of the day. But it's really not doing itself any favors by behaving the way it does, because by doing so, it's only going to sink lower and lower down people's \"good lists\", when arguably it doesn't belong there, at least not as much as some other shows I could mention.\\n\\n\r\n      But here's the last, and maybe even the biggest problem that this second season has: it's just sort of boring, and I think I can offer two possible reasons about why it's like this. First, if you were to rewind to the pacing of the first season, what you might recall is that it was a little weird. There were two very specific \"highs\" of the series that were exciting and adrenaline pumping, those two moments being the very beginning(or to be more specific, those first three episodes), and of course the very end, where, you know, everyone dies. The space in between was where the first season lost nearly all of its momentum and promise; a space where Inaho just sort of inexplicably beat whatever soldiers the Vers Empire would throw at him, and nothing really happened besides some half-asked attempts to throw in drama(like when Rayet chokes Asseylum in the show, only for Inaho to revive her five minutes later). That's what season 2 largely consists of. I don't think the reason per say is that it actually is as boring as that mid-section of the first season, but because we've already jumped the shark in terms of dramatic tension. I mean, when you \"kill\" everyone as the finale of your first season, you can't really top that can you? Also(and I've mentioned this before in other reviews but whatever), when you sacrifice your narrative integrity, or in this case, \"killing\" all your characters and then bringing them all back literally the next episode, it sort of just renders everything pointless after that. What's the point of caring about what happens in this war between Earth and Mars when you feel that anything that you're told can be taken right back if the creators feel that is would increase the drama, or have a target audience return for your crappy second season just so they can see what happened. Pair this with, as I've already said, how seriously the show takes itself, which means there are plenty of politically driven scenes that really aren't interesting, and yeah, it's all sort of boring.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this season largely consists of is Inaho and Slaine circling each-other like sharks, breezing through whatever challenge is in their way because both of them are extremely overpowered, until it is time for the final showdown 12 episodes later. Sure, some interesting stuff happens in that time that could have potentially lead to something intriguing: Lemrina's mental state, Slaine's own doubts about his attack against Earth and Inaho's slowly emerging humanity, but nothing really goes anywhere. There's only one sub-plot that really dramatically effects how events play out, but I can't mention it because, you know, spoilers. What I will give the anime credit for is the ending, which while a lot of people seem to find problems with, I thought it was just fine. It's dramatic, there's a certain bitter-sweet aura that I really liked, and hell, even a emotional moment for Slaine at the very end that I thought actually worked. Well, more so than much of anything else in the anime at least.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about how this second season has changed our two main characters: Slaine and Inaho, I'll about the only significant addition to Aldnoah.Zero's cast in this season: Princess Lemrina. At first, when she was introduced, I thought she had potential. Her relationship with Asseylum was sort of interesting, as she was jealous of her sister's beauty and how she was loved by her people, something that Lemrina would never be able to achieve due to her legs being bound in a wheel-chair and her status as a princess born illegitimately from her father, who was Vers royalty, and an unnamed woman.  This leaves her a sort of bitter and manipulative person, fully aware of how she is despised, and taking that hatred to use for her own advantages, which makes her position as currently impersonating her sister to inflame tensions between both sides of the war sort of unique. However, what really annoys me about her is her nearly blinding devotion to Slaine, which drives her motivation for pretty much everything. And here's the fact of the matter: she really has no reason at all to like him so much; he treats her pretty crappy all things considered. She even offers to be a \"replacement for her sister\", if that is what he wants, and none of it just doesn't make any sense, because you will always have this burning question of \"why?\" in your head. The anime doesn't really have an answer. It has the decency to question this devotion later on, leading to a couple interesting scenes which I won't talk about because spoilers, but like most things in the anime, it doesn't go much of anywhere. \\n\\n\r\n     So, let's talk about Inaho first. He was a character that I thought could potentially develop into something interesting when the first season ended, because I still had no idea why he was so emotionally repressed, and as a matter of fact, I still don't. What could have been interesting is completely ignored, the most we get in terms of development is that he smiles a little more than he used to, and occasionally tells us profound emotional statements with the same blank look on his face. And I appreciate that I guess, but we still have absolutely no reason why he was like this in the first place. Was it because of his parents deaths? Because he tries to be the perfect soldier? We have no idea. And that's not good enough.\\n\\n\r\n     And here's the character I've been saving for last, because undoubtedly, Slaine is the star of this second season, as he makes his transition from narrative limbo into a primary antagonist. In hindsight, that's something that the anime had been building up to, and rather well at that, there's a clear progression in the ruthlessness of his actions, going all the way back to season one. I rather liked it. But the problem with his character is that his motivation as \"the big bad guy\" is practically non-existent. At first, you think it's just because he's doing everything for Princess Asseylum like always, but in light of events that happen later on, that theory doesn't seem to hold much water. I honestly don't think Slaine himself or the writers knew what he was trying to accomplish by the end of the series, sure he throws around cliche lines like \"trying to make a better world\", but I don't think that really makes sense either. Like many things in this anime, I like the idea of it. You could see what they were trying to go for, a good man following his heart as he tries to do the right thing for the girl he loves, but eventually everything falls apart as he digs himself deeper and deeper into his sins, and in the end isn't even sure what he's trying to accomplish as now everyone he cared about has turned against him. However, his reasons for ending up how he does by the end don't seem justified and logical, and he's ultimately flat and uninteresting as a character. Again though, I do like the moment of self-reflection at the end of his arc, even if I can't talk about without spoiling the ending of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n     As for everyone else, well they don't really matter. Yeah. All those side characters that the first season built up: Rayet, Inko, Lt. Marito, they don't really do crap in this season, so much to the point that I question why they're all here in the first place, or why we spent so much time with them in the first season. Another waste. And if you recall, my favorite character of the first season was Princess Asseylum herself: I found her interesting as well as pretty bad-ass when she wanted to be, but again, she's in a comatose state for pretty much the entire time so... yeah. Those three characters above are really the only ones you need to worry or care about. \\n\\n\r\nTurning to animation, while I never went as far to compare side-by-side, I'd say the animation is just as high-quality or better than it was in the first season, and that's nice to see, when some shows with great animation will cut corners in their second seasons, like Sword Art Online 2. But no, everything looks great, from background, to character designs, to the aesthetics of this futuristic world. The deal-breaker for a lot of people is undoubtedly going to be the mechs rendered in CG. Yes, it doesn't look particularly nice, but after two seasons of watching these things, I can say you just get used to them after awhile, it's a not a legitimate reason not to watch the show(there's plenty of other better reasons not to watch it), because it's simply a matter of getting used to them. The fight scenes are rather good too, as now they've moved largely from Earth into space. I've already stated the benefits of space battles(they're awesome), but Aldnoah.Zero really uses them to enhance the fight scenes, with the battles seeming to take full advantage of the three-dimensional nature of space, and the various factors of it which come into play during fights.\\n\\n\r\n     Hiroyuki Sawano has returned to do the music for this second season, and as most sound-tracks he does are, it's fantastic. Some might find problems with how often certain tracks are repeated, but those tracks in question are so good that I really didn't mind in the slightest. Nothing more to say about the OST: it's great. However, special mention must be called to the OP of this season: \"&Z\". You might remember that I altogether wasn't too fond of the first season's opening: \"Heavenly Blue\", but \"&Z\" is a truly magnificent song, especially the full version, which is exhilarating, exciting, yet somewhat melancholy at times, like it's a reflection of all that was lost in the Vers/Earth war. If you close your eyes while listening to it at the start of every episode, you could almost trick yourself into thinking that you're watching some epic space opera, but unfortunately when you open them, it's always going to be Aldnoah.Zero. I wouldn't go as far to say it's the biggest reason for watching Aldnoah.Zero 2, but... yeah it is actually. \\n\\n\r\nSo, here we are, standing at the end of this unfortunate franchise. It's all over; undoubtedly, a third season is(hopefully) not in the works; this is what Aldnoah.Zero is at the end of the day, the kind of show that we will look back on years from now. And despite all the promise, despite all the ways it could have succeeded, Aldnoah.Zero's second half is equivalent to a slow, sinking decent in mediocrity. Various life-lines appeared during its run: possibly interesting plot-lines and characters, but it failed to grab anything significant, as it sank too fast under its own expectation and incompetence. What is Aldnoah.Zero at the end of the day? A very typical, very mediocre mecha. And that, is a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I didn't know Inaho was Solid Snake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "Witnessed a lot of bad reviews so it's high time to introduce something different - positive review to this show.\r\n==============================================\r\n~PLOT SYNOPSIS~\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nSeason 1\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nStory revolves around the difficulty of what happens when humanity, hypothetically in the future,\r\nis split up into two categories:\r\n- humans who inhabited the Earth, known as Terrans\r\n- humans who migrated to Mars and settled at the barren planet (Mars), known as Martians\r\nThe humans who migrated to Mars, known as Martians, settled in the barren planet for a long span of time and eventually, the inhabitants established their own government system that portrays their independence from those governing bodies that control the Earth. As thegeneration that migrated to Mars perished and the forthcoming Martian generations soon gained a wrong notion that they're solely different from their Terran counterparts just because they've inhabited a different planet, the notion that they're ancestors used to inhabit Earth fades, as time passed by.\\n\\n\r\nFast forward to the future, Martians soon faced scarce resources as the barren planet gets populated. Due to the lack of bounty and infertility of the land of Mars, the Martians decided to perform a coup d'etat (intentionally used this term since the Martians' ancestors used to inhabit Earth) in order to obtain Earth resources. Not before long, due to the Martians' ulterior motive, the hostilities started in order to gain what they've been longing for. \\n\r\nBut in order to do that, the Martians need a stronger war trigger, a trigger that will supplement the reason as to why they need to invade the Terran's inhabited planet and loot. And so, an assassination attempt to the Martian Princess was framed/conspired by a Martian knight (not going to be named to prevent spoilers) in order to do just that. \\n\r\nBy making it look as if the Terrans planned to assassinate the Martian emperor's daughter, the Martian knight managed to persuade the nation of Mars migrants to ensue an all-out war. \\n\r\n(This is all done just for the sake of the intent of garnering Earth resources as well as expanding their dominion.) \\n\\n\r\nThe war breakout caused many casualties on the Terran force's side as they're overpowered by Martians through the means of higher spec mechas that makes use of a powerful energy source that can solely be derived on Mars - Aldnoah. (hence the origin of the anime's name is deduced) \\n\r\nWhen all hope seems lost and Terrans seems to be on the brink of absolute annihilation due to the unfathomable difference in military power, whether it'd be mecha (known in the show as Kataphrakts) or warhead strength,\\n\r\nhope sheds light as a Terran prodigy spearheaded a movement in order to prevent the Martians' goal from taking into full swing. \\n\r\nThe Terran prodigy, named Inaho, prevented the colonization not by brute force, but by sheer intellect; this is achieved through the means of strategic and tactical style of warfare - exploiting the enemies' flaws, flaws that are somewhat unperceivable to a regular human's analysis and plans that are inconceivable.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSeason 2\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFollowing the war ignited by the Martian knight, the Terran prodigy, Inaho, after a near-death experience in Season 1, managed to survive the conflicts and became stronger than ever, intellectually speaking, in Season 2\\n\r\nvia cybernetic implant which was brought forth by war repercussions. On top of that, Inaho gained Martian accomplices,who just like him and other Terrans, wanted to make peace and form a pact/treaty.\\n\r\nGenerally speaking however, most Martians, including the emperor of the Martians himself, opposed this idea and hence, war continued to resonate. \\n\r\nDue to the Martians' immense military powers, conceit-driven, they have no intention of giving in. The same goes for the Terrans, whose trump card is Inaho who comes up with ridiculous plans with his strategic/tactical prowess. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize Season 2 in a nutshell, the continuation of the war and the conclusion of the hostilities is portrayed in the 2nd Season.\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~MORALE OF STORY~\\n\r\nEver heard of the terms Rayleigh's Scattering, Leidenfrost Effect, Meissner Effect or Quantum Teleportation?\\n\r\nObviously, those who have physics background would know pretty much some, if not, all of these. But for a regular person, that won't be the case. \\n\r\nAnd so, here comes the anime called 'Aldnoah' which incorporates these scientific jargons and exposes viewers to the realm of science. \\n\r\nNot only are you watching anime, but as the anime progresses, the creators of Aldnoah explains to you why that's happening, why that didn't happen, what's the scientific explanation behind it and whatnots. \\n\r\nThereby, by the end of the show, the viewers gains more knowledge in the aspect of science.\\n\\n\r\nThe real life scientific terminologies aforementioned are embedded and is used as basis in the creation of this show.\\n\r\nMagnificently, if you think of all the animes one has watched over the course of his/her lifetime, there's only a handful, if not none, has encountered an anime which adheres to technicalities as in-depth as Aldnoah.\\n\r\nAlso, general knowledge is taught there indirectly via the mecha battles and conversations amongst the characters.\\n\r\n(ex: negating smoke screens via electricity as part of the plan to counter the enemy forces' smoke screen. Scientific reasoning behind it?\\n\r\nThe phenomenon occurs as colloids are absorbed by ions which in turn...ah forget it. \\n\r\nWatch the anime and you'll learn more of such things.)\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\r\nIt's safe to assume, or declare to be more precise, that Aldnoah has reached the pinnacle when it comes to \\n\r\ngraphics. When one might ask me, \"How does modern anime graphics look like?\" I'll simply answer, \\n\r\n\"Watch Aldnoah and you'll know.\"\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~CRITICISMS~\\n\r\nAll in all, it was definitely a worthwhile show to watch. I'm bothered though, about the amount of negative reviews the show's \\n\r\nreceiving. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, frankly speaking, I was expecting this since I know for a fact that Aldnoah goes in-depth; not a lot of animes have that approach and hence, viewers are not used to it and tend to get annoyed by it to the extent \\n\r\nthat they started hating the show and instead of being straightforward and confess that they don't understand much of the show due to the adherence of the show to scientific technicalities,viewers have the tendency make \\n\r\nunnecessary excuses (unnecesary whining, to be more precise), specifically, stating that the plot's cliche, apparently.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot more complaints but I'm too dismayed to read them, all the more, list those things in my review.\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~COMPLIMENTS~\\n\r\nUp next, I'll discuss my 'compliments' to this show after briefly discussing about the cause of criticisms.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike some shows that includes unnecessary fillers, flashbacks, etc. Aldnoah doesn't have that trait.\\n\r\nAldnoah utilizes every episode well, carefully selecting appropriate moments at which a particular flashback \\n\r\nis necessary. Furthermore, the pace is wonderfully decided, upon realizing that every episode ends at a well-timed \\n\r\ncliffhanger. And finally, Aldnoah doesn't need a deus ex machina to make the protagonist prevail over the antagonists. (unless being a genius tactician is not considered a deus ex machina, my argument crumbles apart)\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~MUSIC~\\n\r\nOne of the key triggers for me to give this anime a try is because of the 1st season's catchy opening song.\\n\r\nJudging by the melody of the opening and closing songs of both season 1 and 2, they're highly fancy. On the aspect of OST (background music), one thing that must be made known is that OSTs are incorporated to enhance a particular mood portrayed in a scene, whether it'd be action, depressing, joyful scene, etc.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I was too immersed on the technicalities embedded in the anime which resulted for me to become unaware of the OSTs, all in all; not to mention, OSTs are mood enhancers, so they're not meant to be noticed in the \\n\r\nfirst place. PS: Opening songs of both seasons are so melodically attractive, to the extent that the songs still constantly reverberate in my mind approximately a week after I finished watching the series.\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~CONCLUSION~\\n\r\nIf you take the fact aside that Mars cannot be inhabited due to its lack of bounty of oxygen in its atmosphere, then the show will be worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a show that has a protagonist who takes advantage of the antagonists by outdoing the antagonists strategically, like Lelouch and Blank from the renowned animes 'Code Geass' and' No Game No Life' respectively, then I hereby announce that Aldnoah is a kind of show that you'll enjoy, inasmuch as I did.\\n\r\n==============================================",

            "content": "It has been quite awhile since I have enjoyed a well made Mech anime. Season 2 of this anime has some twisted moments but all in all, the plot was developed nicely. Some might say that episode 1's revival of the main cast is bullshit. If you just call it plot armour that like 99.9% of anime out there have, you can deal with it better. \r\n-------Story-------\r\nThe plot of this season was somewhat twisted. Slaine took a 180 degree turn and became the main antagonist for a reason that is deep and shall not be spoiled by me. There are as much moments of frustrationwhen you wished something to happen and it took a left turn and crashed down the chasm. Most of the plot devices are somewhat explained in this season though. The ending was one of the best and most complete ending I have ever seen for awhile. \\n\\n\r\n--------Art---------\\n\r\nThe animation used in battles was phenomenal. Each battle scene would take your breath away and when you thought its the end, the final battle between Slaine and Inaho is even better. Definitely worth watching just for the battle scenes. You wont see another mech battle with such amazing animation anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\n-------Sound-------\\n\r\nWhat? There is music? Basically it blends so nicely and emphasises each scenes to bring out its excitement that I dont even notice its there.\\n\\n\r\n-------Character-------\\n\r\nMost of the characters are more or less well developed. Some of the Counts seem to not have any back story or just a one episode description of their story.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine's character... You can call him the typical \"Twisted\" antagonist where he do something thinking he was right and at the final turn, crushed by his most important friend saying something that turns him completely. Only thing is, the twisted part is REALLY twisted.\\n\\n\r\n--------Overall---------\\n\r\nGo watch it. You may end it at season 1's ending and call it quits. Its a good ending. But Season 2's ending is better. If I was to judge, Season 2 has weaker characters but stronger plot. Well. Stronger in the sense of the ending.",

            "content": "{Contains Spoliers}\r\nDamn the ending really pi**ed me off, clearly rushed, was forced on the viewers and to be honest makes all the fighting between the 2 main characters pointless. \r\nStory - The second series carries on after ending of the first. Inaho is still alive and was revealed to be shot in the eye and has had it replaced with a bionic eye capable of predicting algorithims. Slaine has risen through the ranks and has gained the trust of several Orbital Knights, and continues thier plan to invade earth from the moonbase. Now onto the most annoying MC, Asseylum who spends much of the seasonin a comatised state within the moonbase, she wakes up at the ending of the season but has lost her memories. She eventually regains them and during an attack on the moonbase by Terran (Earth) forces, she tries to escape from earth soldiers firing on her. She then bumps into Inaho who falls unconcious before her but his bionic eye takes control telling Asseylum that Inaho had infiltrated the base to get the, she states her feelings towards Inaho and asks him something which isn't seen to the viewer until the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs we get to the last episode, Asseylum takes over from the grandfather's position upon his death, announces her intention for the war to end and that she is to marry Count Klancain (nothing but a character that is used as a plot device). Slaine and Inaho upon hearing that decide to have a final battle, it is also revealed that Asseylum had asked Inaho to save Slaine. Slaine ends up in imprisoned, Asseylum ends up with Klancain and Inaho ends.. well to be honest I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nArt - Nicely designed environments and mechas and the battles are nice as well. Character designs aren't too bad either, nothing really worth noting. \\n\\n\r\nSound - The soundtrack is definitely the best thing to do with AZ, brings epicness to the battles as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I enjoyed the sense of rivalry between Slaine and Inaho but because of the ending all of it seemed rather pointless. I do end up feeling sorry for the both of them and to be honest, after all the two have done for Asseylum, she really does let them down, I can't help but consider her a bi**h.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The battles are enjoyable and the music is brilliant, the art is good but as I have already stated, the ending would most likely let many down. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - good but unfortunately stopped from becoming great by a poorly written and rushed ending to the anime \\n\\n\\n",

That's really all I can say. Even as a fanboy of S1, I'll admit that the story was at most, poor. From the cliffhanger of the first season, I'm not sure what I was expecting, exsctly. Inaho might be missing a few brain cells, or there may be a new main character introduced instead. Even that I would've been fine with.\r\nInstead, Inaho is given a new, shiny, Deus ex Machina eye that canpull off spatial calculations in seconds.\\n\r\nOk, I can work with that.\\n\r\nOh, the eye apparently has a will of its own.\\n\r\n... \\n\r\nI f*cking hate you.\\n\r\nThe main focus of this season, to me, was mostly slaine. But, I'll get into that in the character sections.\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nThe art follows the style of the last season.\\n\r\nExplosive action scenes with close to flawless use of CG (In my opinion),\\n\r\nAnd all around pretty good art.\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nIt's Hiroyuki Sawano.\\n\r\nFrom the seeping vocals to the flawless OST arrangements, the sound is amazing.\\n\r\nAnd that's all I'll say.\\n\r\nCharacters- 2\\n\r\nThis is where I really, really wanted to see some improvement.\\n\r\nThe characters weren't that great (understatement) from S1, so I was hoping that Inaho ' s presumed death might force them to mature in some ways (and we all know how well that went) in addition, the one non-onedimensional character also fell flat.\\n\r\nSlaine kidnapped Seylum, and what happens?\\n\r\nHe puts her in a healing tank of some sort and looks at her.\\n\r\nBesides a few moments, he really doesn't have as much development as he did.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 5\\n\r\nI'll admit, I enjoyed it for the numbing action scenes, but.. that's about it.\\n\r\nOverall- 4\\n\r\nMeh.\\n\r\nSo much potential gone to waste from the first season.\\n\r\nIt really saddens me.",

            "content": "[THIS ENTIRE REVIEW WILL CONTAIN HEAVY SPOILERS FOR WHAT LITTLE PLOT THIS ANIME HAS]\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nPLOT 1/10\r\nThe ending of season 1 was quite unexpected. It was a great cliffhanger that made everyone speculate how the story would continue after 4 of the most pivotal characters of the show seemingly get killed. Disappointingly, nothing happens. None of them died. Welcome to my review of AldNoOne Dies Season 2. Did I mention that none of the main characters die? None of them die. Seriously. The only thing that dies is the plot, and this review will be my morbid attempt at describing the dead carcass that is \"the plot\"as I poke it with a stick.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, season 2 starts off with the princess stuck in a comatose state for a long period of time after Slaine forces Count Sassy-bum to keep her alive. Slaine becomes an angsty asshole and obtains a position of power within the Vers empire after murdering Count Sauce-bomb by 360 no-scoping him with timey wimey powers and succeeding him as count. Then he has where-the-fuck-did-she-come-from Princess Asseylum v2.0 marry him into royalty so he can unify the Vers empire and start a full scale war against earth for no clearly understandable or reasonable goal. From what I understand he does it to \"protect the princess\". Which makes absolutely no fucking sense because now that he is the fucking king of the fucking Vers Empire he already fucking has the needed political fucking power and support to fucking stop anyone else from fucking stealing his fucking girl. The fucking princess is already fucking fine, not to fucking mention everyone doesn't even fucking know that the fucking princess is actually in a fucking coma and that she is being fucking impersonated by her fucking sister. Meaning that any attempted assassination wouldn't fucking work because they would be fucking killing the fucking body double. YOU KNOW, LIKE IN THE VERY FIRST EPISODE OF THE FUCKING SHOW ALL THE FUCKING WAY BACK IN SEASON FUCKING ONE, FOR EXAMPLE. JESUS TAP DANCING CHRIST. Not to mention war goes against EVERYTHING THE PRINCESS STANDS FOR. WHAT THE FUCK SLAINE, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU GET A GIRL TO LIKE YOU. YOU ABSOLUTE RETARD.\\n\\n\r\nI guess his actions can be rationalized a bit from the perspective of Slaine as the king of the Vers Empire, and not from the perspective of Slaine as the desperate, sex-starved virgin he is, since what he is doing could be seen as a political ploy to obtain more support amongst the other orbital knights and other members of nobility, who are unanimously pro-war. (Which he doesn't need.) And on top of that it will cause the Vers empire to become a better place free from an oppressive class system and widespread poverty among the working class that is caused by a lack of natural resources. (Which could be solved diplomatically through trading.) (Or stealing it without the genocide.) (Which would make him unanimously supported by the working class even if some of the nobles still don't like him, lessening the threat of their influence and cementing his legitimacy as king.) (Which again, doesn't matter because he already has all the political support he needs.) But really now... He doesn't care too much about any of that. He just in this for the PU$$Y. (SPOILER: HE DOESN'T GET ANY)\\n\\n\r\nThe real princess eventually wakes up, then plot hole after plot hole she finds out what Slaine is doing and manages to escape with Inaho's help. Princess Ass-pump marries some random dude named Count Cocaine and takes over rule of the Empire. Then Slaine gets wrecked. They use him as a scapegoat to blame the entire war on. The entirety of earth apparently completely forgives Princess Ass-plumber after her impostor shit talks everyone and their mother with obscene levels of hate and Aryan supremacy. Apparently decades of indoctrination, hatred, prejudice, racism, discontent with poverty and human greed disappeared just like that. The war ends. Earth and Mars hold hands and circle jerk over each other in a new golden age of peace and prosperity. Happy happy fine and dandy. Wouldn't it be nice if actual conflicts in the real world could be solved so easily? Just blame every little problem on one person. Then kill him. Poof. Problems solved just like that. \\n\\n\r\n\"Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.\" The motto of the show clearly represents Princess Asseylum's goal of peace no matter the cost. It really shows just how spoiled and unrealistic her standards are. Princess Ass-plum seriously used her love of birds as a valid reason to possibly jeopardize the long term unity and betterment of her entire empire. Don't get me wrong, war is bad. But a leader should realize when war is the best and most realistic option for her people. Good thing the shit writing this show has kicks in and everything somehow turns out alright anyways, and no one suffers from the consequences of their actions except for Slaine.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really simplify it. The entire plot of season 2 is basically a war caused by a mans quest to seduce a woman through the romantic gift of genocide; and predictably, hilariously, painfully, and stupidly enough- it completely backfires. He gets friend zoned and gets sent to prison for the rest of his life. She'd rather enter an arranged marriage with a man she has never met before than be with you. How does that feel, you fucking cuck? Holy shit, someone give this a man a medal for the worst rejection in history. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously that's the entire plot. Yup. The end. Aren't you fucking glad you watched this show?\\n\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe general artstyle is pretty good, and the characters are drawn very well with a distinctive style. One of the strongest points of this show is aesthetic originality, even though sometimes \"originality\" becomes synonymous with \"bad writing\", as in, it's original how bad the writing is. Martian kataphrakts are pretty cool looking, despite just how bad the CGI in this show is. Their designs are strange, exotic, and unique, but at the same time completely absurd. For some reason the orbital knights care more about making flashy and cool kataphrakts over actually effective weapons. You would think that a robot with access to seemingly unlimited energy would make use of all of the ridiculously overpowered technology they have, but every single kataphrakt has some gigantic weakness that is so obviously intentionally added. For some reason, a robot that is nigh indestructible has no weapons on it besides some over-sized fists, and despite the fact that it has a nigh indestructible force field, it is covered in thick plates of armor that makes the thing look like the girl from Willy Wonka that turns into a giant blueberry. For some reason, a mech attacks by shooting re-attachable, remote controlled ROCKET ARMS at the enemy when they have the technology to rapid fire death lasers with the destructive power of a small nuclear bomb with a seemingly infinite amount of ammunition to accompany it. It just simply makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how it works kids. If you aren't good enough at writing to make a character look brilliantly smart, just make all the bad guys so incompetently stupid the hero look better in contrast. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music was composed by none other than Hiroyuki Sawano, so as expected, it is quite good. Too bad they keep on replaying the same fucking song over and over again for every single god damn fight scene that you begin to hate the song. Good music is important, but making sure the music is used in a timely and appropriate manner is also important. This show succeeds in the former part, but fails in the latter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHere comes the juicy part. CHARACTER.\\n\\n\r\n2/10 Inaho: Absolutely no character development. Though it wouldn't be fair to expect character development from him. Inaho is literally God. Perfection personified into a Japanese school boy. He cannot further develop because he is already perfect. Getting shot in the head doesn't change that. He is still perfect. He is still an emotionless machine. The fact that he is now partially a cyborg doesn't help with that analogy either. He saves the day every single god damn time like he always does except now he does literally everything to the point where basically 60% of the entire show just focuses on circlejerking over how awesome he is. The writers made this man an autistic savant because they simply aren't smart enough to write an intelligent character well, and clearly even with that the job was still difficult for them. Because in season 2 they had to up the ante and make him even more overpowered than he already was so they can shoehorn more shitty excuses as to how he completely defeats the Vers Empire yet again by blessing him with some unreasonably overpowered god eye that can see everything. Like Inko's BMI for example. Inaho uses his eye to calculate Inko's weight so he can make fun of her. What the fuck dude? Asshole. And he knows he can get away with it since Inko wants his D for some reason. Why ya got to play a girl like that man? And to top it all off, the writers also gave him Aldnoah powers all willy-nilly to act as a convenient plot device to reactivate the Deucalion. How? Through oral transfer of royal blood and saliva. HAHA WHAT THE FUCK. In other words. This all powerful source of unlimited energy is pretty much some alien STD Ass-plump gave to Inaho. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Inaho's robot eye: A new character. Yes. The eye has its own character. Yes. THE EYE GETS MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN INAHO HIMSELF. At first the eye is nothing but a tool, but then it starts taking over parts of Inaho's brain and becomes its own thinking entity. It even starts chatting up the princess while Inaho was unconscious. Look at that development. Oh yea. Such character. Inaho's eye x Asseylum is my OTP.\\n\\n\r\n1/10 Slaine: Is basically the only character that gets any \"development\", which means jack shit because he just continually makes the most retarded nonsensical decisions a sane individual wouldn't ever consider. Honestly, calling it \"character development\" is a little too generous in the first place since his character is completely off the charts inconsistent. He doesn't really do anything that can be considered normal human responses. His level of intelligence and decision making is all over the place. His goals incomprehensible, and the reason behind this is because the writers just continuously use him as a cheap plot device to add drama and conflict to the story instead of treating him like how a reasonable or sane human being would act. Inaho and Slaine are both foils to each other in this regard. Slaine advances the story by adding unnecessary conflict to it through irrational decision making. And Inaho advances the story by solving the stupid problems Slaine causes with his own stupidly written god-like abilities. In the end, Slaine fails horribly due to his ridiculous levels of incompetency. Then the writers pretentiously rip off Monster by making Slaine pull off some bullshit Johan Liebert crap. \\n\\n\r\n1/10 Princess Ass-lump: She doesn't change character. Still this overly happy and naive dumb bimbo that can barely act like a responsible leader. She forces her childish idealistic views on everyone regardless of the effect it might have on her people. She tried to man up once and points a gun at Slaine and threatens him. Then he casually walks over and just takes the gun. AHAHA. Seriously. She is so worthless. Did I mention she likes birds? She likes birds. Apparently more than the possible long term prosperity of not only her Empire, but the entirety of humanity as well. Amazing judgment of importance there. \\n\\n\r\n4/10 Princess Ass-lump v2.0: Yea the second princess with the weird hair. I forgot her name. Where the fuck did she even come from? She just appears suddenly as a new character. Basically she pretends to be Asseylum and slanders earth with her space Nazi propaganda. She does it because she has some extremely creepy as fuck obsession with Slaine. She is just weird. \\n\\n\r\nCount Crouton or something. IDK it's hard to spell. Best character 10/10. Some new guy that shows up for like 10 minutes of screen time. Manages to NTR the princess away from Inaho and Slaine like immediately. What a badass. \\n\\n\r\n5/10 Harklight. Gets seduced by Slaine's bishounen powers. I forgot whether or not he dies trying to get senpai to notice him. I don't really care.\\n\\n\r\n5/10 Inko. Arguably the most likable girl in the show. Acts all cutesy and compassionate with Inaho and worries about him. Daww so cute amirite? Kind of I guess... Gets pushed away and assigned as Inaho's side bitch. She gets shot at 10 more times than any of the other characters but she always survives. Absolutely bullshit levels of plot armor. For some reason, every single kataphrakt instantly explodes into a million pieces of shitty pixelated CGI the moment it gets touched but nothing like that ever happens with Inko. But I guess they have to keep her alive as a romantic interest for Inaho. FOR THE NEXT SEASON OF COURSE. HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED.\\n\\n\r\n4/10 Female Inaho. Yuki Kaizuka, the bastard love child prototype that made way for the masterpiece of perfection that is her brother Inaho Kaizuka. Knowing just how hopelessly inferior she is to her perfect brother she tries to mimic her brothers robot like persona by getting a robotic arm to assist her broken one. But fails miserably at acting utterly emotionless like her brother does. As well as being perfect in every way possible like him. Seriously Yuki its not that hard to be a completely flawless human being. Way to break character, you fucking poser. She acts all lovey dovey over Inaho but comes off a bit more bitchy and possessive than Inko does when she tries to stop him from saving the damn world out of fear for his safety. At least wanting your brother to live is a slightly better excuse than liking birds. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the other characters basically get sidelined and don't do anything or have anything worthwhile to say about them. 0/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe action was enjoyable enough. The only saving grace was the okay action. (And seeing Slaine's beautiful face marred with his salty tears at the end.) It follows a pretty cookie cutter formula of: Scary new Martian bad guy with fancy unique kataphrakt appears. It rains pain down, destroying a bunch of faceless Terran mooks, as well as miraculously damaging but never killing any of the minor characters that happen to be fighting. Then Inaho comes and saves the day with his tactical and scientific brilliance as his signature battle theme plays for the umpteenth time. Rinse and repeat. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it's still fun to see some generic mech on mech action. But it's pretty average really. Some of the battles have some interesting strategies and events, but it's all methodically predictable. So if for some reason you are reading this review without even starting the show I wouldn't recommend this if you aren't a huge fan of action and mech anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have already watched season 1, I wouldn't really recommend you to either continue or discontinue the show, that's up to whether or not you are one of those masochists that don't drop any shows they started.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell that concludes my review. Now if you excuse me I'm going to see what kind of horrific yaoi fanfiction fujoshis are making between Inaho and Slaine.",

            "content": "A mecha show like Aldnoah Zero isn\u2019t without controversy. They say controversy creates attention, and honestly, it\u2019s a bit of an understatement with this show. From the way the first season concluded, one could not help but wonder how they will craft the contents for the sequel. It should be no surprise that many viewers will wonder the fate of our main protagonists (such as Inaho and Asseylum), the state of the war, and what\u2019s in stored for Slaine. However, what blasts off this season is nothing short but predictable clich\u00e9 writing, a stack of weakly balanced characters, and in general a disappointment that doesn\u2019tseem to be able to correct itself from what season 1 got started on.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, the sequel begins directly from where the season 1\u2019s events left off except with a time skip. Characters still look the same but some things have changed. Included with these include the absence of Asseylum on Earth. Then, there\u2019s also Slaine who has now devoted himself entirely to the Martians. And in a state of war, Aldnoah Zero Season 2 seems to continuously shove down the audience\u2019s throats of the personal struggles of certain characters. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. I like how the show expresses its interest to show how our main characters\u2019 lives are going in season 2. The problem I find is how it constantly recycles the same ideas over and over again. In general, it fails to ensnare a viewer\u2019s interest with the frequent ideology clashes. Less emphasis is put on the development of our characters but instead showing them their roles with a lot of badly stitched tropes. Furthermore, season 2 seems to highlight on even more problems with plot holes and writing for certain supporting characters. Logic itself also makes the audience question sometimes if the show knows what it\u2019s doing.\\n\\n\r\nFor our main characters, most of them play their roles in the war. Although many characters has certain objectives, it\u2019s clear that the show has a weakness with its character development. Only on occasions do certain side characters shine in this second season. This is because the sequel seems to emphasize on building up the story with various interconnected events. However, the grim reality is that it\u2019s predictable down to the earth and nothing really stands out besides our main characters. Season 2 also seems to have forgotten some of the major supporting characters on their development. (Rayet anyone? Calm?) In short, it\u2019s neglecting their chance to shine and seems to constantly try to shove down the main characters down our throats. New character such as Harklight and Lemrina doesn\u2019t gain any strong characterization at all. For instance, Harklight seems to play the sort of devoted servant for his \u201cmaster\u201d, Slaine. On the other hand, Lemrina is has a borderline obsession with him. It\u2019s kind odd really. The sequel almost seems to devote its entirety on Slaine\u2019s ambitions and ultimatum. Some of the diverting romance sub-plot is hardly anything interesting with the lack of interest between Slaine and certain characters. In general, it\u2019s messy with its characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do have to give credit to certain characters that makes their name more known compared to the previous season. One such name is Mazuurek that viewers may have forgotten about. His role in this season is expanded and in fact, even interesting to see considering where his loyalty lies. This seems to be a sharp contrast with other Martians who holds their close minds about pursuing peace. Instead of conquest, Mazuurek is devoted to Asseylum and believes her to be alive. So what does the man do? Take the risk and find her. Unlike the rest of the Martians who are too busy trying to stack up body counts or flexing their mecha biceps, the show offers a more thrilling insight on his mission. Unfortunately, this is still mostly overshadowed by our main character/antagonist Slaine. Season 2 really tries to show what he is capable of and his ambitions but it\u2019s not working. His emotions gets the better of him and even some of the people that trusts him deeply now have turned against him. It\u2019s hard to feel sorry for him because his own actions previously caused these consequences. And not to mention, his rivalry with a certain guy he dubbed \u2018Orange\u2019 isn\u2019t going to forgive him. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough not overbearing, some good portions of the show concentrates on action. However, it still remains the style it portrays with its gimmicky fighting. In particular, certain mecha now has ability to clone themselves, use piercing threads to slice and dice, or even make frost out of their enemies. Technology seems to have unlimited boundaries in the series as we even see the conscious of an electronic eye take hold of a person\u2019s mentality. As fascinating as this all sounds, there\u2019s really not much to get hold with these creative ideas. No matter how outrageous some of these ideas gets, the end result is almost always the same. The familiar strategies used through teamwork or taking a chance by calculations. Season 1 did that and the sequel doesn\u2019t really express itself any differently. The modus operandi seems to be that wherever battles happen, the result is almost predictable. Certain build ups and death flags are also become more like false advertisements as well. Talk about disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nOn the more technical side, I do give praise to some of the artistic direction the sequel handles itself. Action is fluid and the coordination is attractive. Even some of the new style of the music can be appealing when combined with the intense elements of sci-fi warfare. The OP and ED songs also holds some degree of symbolism along with a few recapping of the first season. Character voice mannerism on most parts remains solid and character expressions show credibility with the events of the sequel. However, it can be cringe worthy to hear some of the stereotypical emotional scenarios because honestly, it\u2019s all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, Aldnoah Zero Season 2 is a slick and empty hollow shell of its prequel. Many events are predictable with a lesser degree on character building but more so on their grand roles. And to be honest, it\u2019s annoying to see the same repetitive angles used over and over. At times, it even looks fake with a wrestling-like drama with faces and heels. It\u2019s not only that but the story itself also introduced certain characters out of nowhere. While certain characters do get more emphasis compared to the first season, some of the previously established characters seems to lack focus on-screen. Instead, we are constantly being fed by Slaine and his preposterous ambitions that can be ridiculous dull. I can\u2019t say for a fact that the sequel is complete utter trash though as it is mildly interesting to watch the development of the Vers/Earths War. It\u2019s somewhat thrilling to see which side will win in the end and whether or not certain characters will meet their endgame goals. But for now, season 2 doesn\u2019t get any better. Not by a damn long shot.",

            "content": "-This review will contain spoilers of season one as it relates to season two-\r\nThere's something extraordinary about trainwreck titles. Its ability to draw in viewers like moths to a flame, watching as the work fold in on itself, seemingly out of breath from the layers of its incompetence. The likes of which forming something like a toxic gas that stifles every bit of its production. Good ideas immediately dying off from screenplay pesticide, hovering over everything like a merchant of death and decay. You see, there's a kind of beauty to it all. The way everything topples over like a game of Jenga, with eachpiece representing a bad aspect of the overall project. The act of \"being bad\" in itself isn't due to a lack of inherently good attributes, but the fact that what little good is there can't survive because the ground it's growing out of is a complete landfill. When your base foundation is toxic, the only thing left to do is watch creativity wither and die, as it foolishly tries to eke out a meager existence in a place not meant for its type of inhabitants. \\n\\n\r\nA bad show making a bad continuation is one thing, but seeing an average one that maintained a steady course of passable grade content, effectively take a kamikaze nosedive into an endless sea of stupor\u2014now that's when things really get interesting. Vanilla content turned into a chocolate turd with sprinkles. Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is a serving of just that. A vaudevillian display of secreted nonsense, all standing out for the wrong reasons. \\n\\n\r\nSo where do we start with this one? It seems like a reach out in any direction to describe what went wrong would seemingly send you spiraling down a bottomless pit. Proceeding with caution isn't much of an option when this follow-up has the logistical density of walking on eggshells. I guess we could start by addressing the \"story and characters,\" or whatever chicken scratch this anime is attempting to pass off as such. And since I seem to be running with the poultry metaphors, we'll touch bases with our egg connoisseur and master tactician first, Inaho. This season sees our Gary Stu coming out of his shell, abandoning his brick wall personality to emote occasionally, almost like he's a \"character\" or something... well, almost. Where he served as a bodysuit for the audiences to roam about the world before, now he's effectively turned the autopilot off and began doing things for himself. More specifically, he's given an end-goal to motivate his actions. Where the problem lies is what he's given to obtain this end-goal, as the screenplay bends over backwards to hand him any and all tools necessary to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the first season was grafting its existence by using the template of Gundam as its skeleton, this season travels off the beaten path to problematic results. The ability of \"Aldnoah\" is no longer treated as a guarded inheritance by selected users, as now its power can be gained through a trading system. This system in question was possibly the worst written transferring mechanic to debuted in 2015\u2014A kiss. No, that wasn't a joke, the second season of A.Z quite literally makes Inaho an Aldnoah user by way of a fucking kiss. This is something other stories would use as a joke, as is the case with High School DxD's \"Boosted Gear\" which is powered by boners, being done as a sexual innuendo to parody shounens. But that's a comedy, A.Z isn't. And so this season can be seen as a joke of itself without an inkling of self-acknowledgment of that fact. \\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't stop there, as egghead Inaho is also granted another major advantage. This time diving more into the realm of 80s cinema cheese. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're reading this, I'm going to assume you've already watched season one, and if not, I will have to address the events of the finale to help explain the origin of Inaho's next hackneyed powerup. Season one's finale was concluded by a big shootout involving all of our key players up to that point. A shootout that saw Saazbaum and Asseylum gunned down by Slaine. This included Inaho, who received a gunshot wound to the head. Which, by the way, is a wound with a 5% survival rate, not even accounting for the smaller 3% chance of maintaining a good quality of life after recovery. Being the Gary Stu that he is, Inaho pulls through, seemingly getting rewarded a cybernetic eye for his troubles, which grants him an even greater tactical advantage. Now he can integrate his knowledge base with access to an infinite pool of information via the internet from his eye implant. He becomes part Terminator, part egg lover, and 100% HAX; why do these circumstances make him act more human as a result is beyond my comprehension (and the scriptwriters, for that matter). I guess it took getting shot in the head and being part cyborg before Inaho could act less robotic; on a meta-level, there's a bit of irony in there worth exploring, but I'll leave you to indulge in that on your own time. For now, we have more nonsense to explore. \\n\\n\r\nFor one, The yin to Inaho's yang, Slaine, has finally gone \"full retard,\" and as the wise words of Kirk Lazarus from Tropic Thunder once said: \"Everybody knows you never go full retard.\" After his failure to kill the men that have been the ire of his existence\u2014despite putting a hole through the skull of one and firing off a dozen shots into the body of the other\u2014Slaine decides to help out Saazbaum \"cuz reasons.\" Entrusting his life in his hands, Slaine vows to serve under  Saazbaum ranks for the final battle to come. You know, the \"normal\" thing to do after you empty a clip into someone with murderous rage. At this point, to say Slaine is a poorly written character would be a gross understatement. His personality from scene to scene is a complete coin toss. From pragmatic at one moment to pure lunacy by the next, there's really no predicting what the screenplay has in store for him. The only guarantee given is consistent inconsistency; the ultimate oxymoron made into human form. \\n\\n\r\nBringing these two sides of the autistic-character spectrum together is the ongoing war that reaches its final chapter. One that takes towards the heavens, as the earthlings and people of Vers turn the leftover remnants of the Moon into their Battle of Gettysburg. This was brought to life in shitty fashion, as it seemed that the people responsible for the post-production coverup magic in season one has finally succumbed to the same level of complacency plaguing the rest of the staffing. Likely due to the new battle locations not allowing for the use of inclement weather and structural landmarks to hide the issues, the mech suits are now left naked in the vacuum of space. Their gross textures, impersonal designs, and robust movement placed one center-stage, as they're sent jettisoning awkwardly across the sky. It's a real visual eyesore, made even worse with the stark backdrop hanging in the background of a majority of the shots. Clunky pieces of CGI just bumping ugly in the open emptiness of space that surrounds it. \\n\\n\r\nThis wouldn't be so bothersome had everything else been done to a bare minimum, but surprisingly enough, the character models and sparsely used landmarks were done with a semblance of quality control behind it. By contrast, the mechs just stick out even further. It's a distracting mix of artificiality and decent content. Of course, Hiroyuki Sawano does what Hiroyuki Sawano does best, making the soundtrack the real star attraction amidst all the mismanaged production issues. Other than that, this 2nd season leaves very little to be desired, serving better as a drinking game for every time the show shelled out a new asspull than it does a \"decent\" continuation. \\n\\n\r\nEven if the first season was a ripoff, it was, at the very least, a ripoff of something good. Season two isn't that. There's nothing to sugar coat here; this was a complete disaster. Very few shows have failed to the degree in which this one does. It's almost impressive just how little they manage to get right. But perhaps the greatest irony is that this season failed not because it was an off-brand like its first season but because it actually tried to do something different for once. It took a leap of faith only to be greeted by the ground below, and while that would be funny in most scenarios, here, it's nothing short of embarrassing.",

            "content": "With how much I loved season one, I was so excited for season 2 to start. Please, I'm begging you, do not watch season two. Stop at episode 12 of season one. Season two will ruin the entire experience for you. No matter how much you love season one, don't do it. Just don't. Anyway, on to the review:\r\nSTORY:\r\nBasically, they take the entire ending of season one, take everything back, and then proceed to stop all over the plot and tear it apart, piece by piece. It's a mess. I'm honestly so upset with hoe bad this was. \r\nART:\r\nIt's almost like they forgot how todraw their own characters. Inaho looks off the entire time, Asseylum looks like a baby whale when she's sad, Slaine doesn't look nearly as good as he did in season one, I could go on. I loved the art of season one. This was a mess, none of the characters ever looked quite right, and frankly the fight scenes were also boring to watch and were always anticlimactic. Oh, and the second ending song, which plays for episode 11, looks like it's drawn by a two year old\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is still amazing. Luckily that didn't change between season one and two. same great songs, and some great new songs. By all means, download the season two songs, but don't watch the show, please.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nBasically they took all character development and recked it. the first two episodes of the season makes it seem like Inaho is gonna be better in this season. The first two episodes lie to you. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI absoluetly LOVED season one. To the point where I had it listed as my number one favorite anime, and I was constantly making gifs of it. Second season makes me ashamed to like season one. I vote that we delete this season from existence, pretend episode 12 of season one is where Aldnoah.Zero really ends, and move on from there. on a final note: PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS SEASON, EVEN IF IT'S JUST AS A JOKE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW BAD IT'S GONNA BE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. IT WILL DISAPPOINT YOU. DO NOT DO IT.",

            "content": "\"BAM!\" \"BAM!\" \"BAM!!!\". This was how season 1 ended. I was rather thrilled by the sudden plot shift, and dearly looked forward to season 2. Oh how wrong I was back then. \r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe very first episode of season two should have been a warning to me NOT to continue watching. It totally invalidated what season 1 had tried to build up(in the last episode). There was no major plot progression at all. Majority of the episodes followed this simple recipe: \r\n1)Enemy(Martians) attacks \r\n2)Non-Inaho personnels try to fight Martians \r\n3)Martians engage their special weapon \r\n3)Non-Inaho personnels struggle \r\n4)Inaho to the rescue! \r\n5)Enemy Martians get defeatedby Inaho\\n\r\nIt then spirals to meaningless battles between The Deucalion and The Martians. There was no clear motive by Slaine, the antagonist. I wouldn't even call him an antagonist. People were just fighting in the series to waste screen time. They could have better spent that time detailing about Dr Troyard and the history of Aldnoah. Sadly, they did not. To be honest, there was no story whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nThe mechas and their animation just did not fit the space background. It felt out of place. The facial expressions of Slaine were, at times, poorly drawn. Asseylum sometimes appear to look somewhat like a whale. Inaho's face looked derpish too during certain scenes. This season's art was sorely inconsistent, which was rather surprising since season 1 had a rather decent art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm sorry but sound alone cannot save a series. Sawano Hiroyuki should not have wasted his talent on a show like this. The opening to the second series was well done. It has this rock-ballad feel to it which is just HNNNG. In fact, I felt that this season's opening was better than that of S1(by Kalafina). The OSTs were reused from S1 but everytime they came on I just realized why I continued ploughing through this series week after week. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nHuh? What character? \\n\r\nINAHO appealed to me at first because I thought he had some backstory to him that gave rise to his stoic mindset. I was wrong yet again. He is basically the solution to every problem. He gained a power-up too this season which made him even more God-like, less sensitive, and more emotionless. I can't say much about him because there isn't exactly anything else to say.\\n\r\nSLAINE was my favourite. Was. Then he became a confused maniac - he suddenly wanted to destroy Earth for no plausible reason. While Slaine may be suffering, watching Slaine in season 2 act like a complete fool gave me more suffering. However, he was the most fleshed out character of the entire series - that I can say for sure. His dedication to Asseylum, his determination to rise up the ranks, and his cunningness pleasantly surprised me at times.\\n\r\nASSEYLUM. Nope I'm not gonna waste my time talking about a character who barely made a difference in S2(Some may argue that she did something in the last episode, but did the Orbital Knights listen to her?) \\n\r\nLEMIRA. I actually don't know what happened to her after the 'finale'. She was your typical jealous girl character who wants to get into the pants of a guy that adores her sister. \\n\r\nI HAVE TO TALK ABOUT MARITO. He is the most pretentious character I have ever come across in any form of entertainment. \"OHNO I HAVE HAD EMOTIONAL TRAUMA FROM MY PAST WAR(which wasn't even explained properly); I DRINK TO EASE MY PAIN; I CANT KILL AN ENEMY\". He wins the title of most pretentious character. Period. A pity that he is voiced by my favourite seiyuu who also voices Hijikata(mayonnaise). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI only enjoyed two and a half things from this series: the music, me being able to laugh at the ridiculousness of this series, and the last 1/2 goes to Slaine. If you have read till here(thanks for reading btw), do yourself and I a favour by skipping this season. Season 1 was all right. Just.skip.this.season. If you want mecha anime, there are better ones out there. (TTGL, E7, CG, Gundam Unicorn, FCLC) \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\n+2 points for music. I have stated earlier that music alone cannot save a series. You can have the best composer in the anime industry on your production team, but if your story has no substance, your characters no proper development, and your art no consistency, it is impossible for your anime to be worth watching at all.",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers\r\nAldnoah Zero is quite possibly the most disappointing show I've watched since last summer. It's up there with Zankyou as a failed collaboration between an otherwise promising writer/director combo that ends up being a ruse to make a quick buck.\r\nThis review covers both seasons.\r\nAldnoah is an action anime primarily. However, even t its core, the action in this series can be easily summarized in this simple step-by-step list:\r\n1. Evil Martian in mecha shows up and decimates Earth Redshirts\r\n2. Secondary characters get caught up and say it's hopeless\r\n3. Inaho shows up, theme music power up, and uses OP BS (Magic Eye in 2ndseason) and destroys evil Martian mecha.\\n\r\n4. Everyone is glad\\n\\n\r\nBut formulaic action isn't the main issue, nor is the decent animation quality, it's how soulless and unnecessary these fights are. These fights can feel longer than they should due to padding and how little is actually happening in the fight storywise.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's discuss the story, or what little there is that drives the whole series forward. Aldnoah is a story about the struggle of the good Earth people and the dog-kicking evil people of Mars. Remarkably, the writers manage to screw up an otherwise simple and interesting premise thanks to bland characters, bad filler, and rushed plot development near the end. To make this review easier on the eyes to read, I'll be talking about each facet in great detail in their individual paragraphs.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah stars 2 incredibly bland main characters, Inaho and Slaine. As mentioned above, Inaho is incredibly OP, to the point where the entire Earth military relies entirely on him to win their battles for them. It doesn't help that Inaho's personality is very soulless and utterly devoid of emotion (2nd season is slightly better in this regard, but too little too late). Slaine on the other hand is initially the more interesting fellow, but his one-dimensional personality is often ruined by his sheer incompetence in the series. Slaine can't do anything right, even if it's in his capability to do so. It's hard to pity him however, as he becomes very much unlikable as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other noteworthy character is the Princess, who is just...there. She is a MacGuffin item given life but still a hollow item inside. She's the main reason why this plot exists, but she's ultimately nothing. It's hard to form an emotional connection with her (which is what I believe is the main intention of the writers) because of how bland she is. \\n\\n\r\nEvery other character in the series is so incompetent/unnecessary they might as well be trees in the background. (Aside maybe Saazbaum, he's so hammy and fun it's a shame he doesn't appear often).\\n\\n\r\nThere is very little plot progression in the series beyond the first few episodes and the last few episodes. Most episodes are just filler with boring fight scenes or with characters talking about nothing and accomplishing nothing. This rushed progression is so bad, the series actually introduces a plot-important (relatively speaking anyway) character 3 episodes before the series finale. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the series is generally quite messy. The composer's soundtracks for the battle scenes are the standard samey generic \"One-Woman Waling in the background with orchestral rock\" stuff you've heard before in anime with this guy composing. The one notable soundtrack which I find was not only used quite well within context, but quite pleasant to listen to is the theme that accompanies Lemrina and occasionally Count Klancain near the end of the second season. \\n\\n\r\nI've talked about the fight scenes in great detail previously, but to emphasize how bad they really are, lets take a look at this gif made by one person on they're own free time with some simple software.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1959599\\n\\n\r\nEven without context, this fight scene conveyed in the gif is more intense, interesting and communicates all the information that is needed to be told to the viewer. In the gif, we can tell the two girls fighting are rivals, with the short-hair girl being a degree more powerful than twintails girl, to the point where she's just toying around with twintails. We can also see that twintails is persistent and despite knowing she's way outta her league, still gives it her all and tries her damnedest to not give up. Eventually, we see that even though she lost and knows that her rival is merely toying with her, she still has a feeling of admiration for her rival, hinting that this battle may yet to conclude.\\n\\n\r\nThese few seconds in the gif has more going on in it than any fight scene, hell, any given scene in Aldnoah. The incompetence of the people involved in Aldnoah still baffles me to this day. \\n\\n\\n\r\nReally now, if you want a good mecha series with a half-decent story, go watch Gurren Lagan or something. This isn't worth you time. \\n\\n\r\nNow some of you may wonder, why I made myself watch this trite series when I could've gave up on episode 2. Thing is, ever since the first episode, I've always held up the belief that the series may redeem itself somewhere down the line. It is that hope, that I cling to, that pushes me onward through adversity. And now I'm here, as a beacon to guide potential viewers away from this farce. Save yourself.\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n",

The end is weird, rushed and does not make any sense to me.\r\n(spoilersfrom here)\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the end isn't what you could say \"sad\", it was one of the more unpleasant endings i ever saw, they focused so much in the main trio and at the end not a single one seemed happy nor sad, it was the \"so so ending for everyone\", Inaho is just Inaho, in love with Aseylum and keeping his nemesis alive by her wish, Slaine is \"saved\" by the wish of Aseylum, but this is the worst punishment for him, and Aseylum, who loved both Inaho and Slaine marry a random count (A pointless marriage, since it didn't really stop the war)  that appeared in two episodes and is happy because earth is in peace now.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers end here)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately i'm in love with the soundtrack, so this is another anime that will be haunting me, every time i listen to it, i remember how unpleasant that second season was.",

            "content": "Thank you, Winter 2015 for producing another disappointing sequel. I enjoy it.\r\nSTORY (3):\r\nThe story continues where season 1 left off. The story involves the war between Earth & Martians. How will they solve their resolutions? \r\nI enjoyed season 1. It had fun characters and an excellent build-up. Unfortunately, just like Tokyo Ghoul season 2, this sequel suffers from tensionless fight scenes and boring characters.\r\nART (4):\r\nThe animation is nothing special.\r\nSOUND (4):\r\nThe music is not memorable.\r\nCHARACTER (3):\r\nOh boy? Where do I begin?\r\nInaho is so overpowered that he gets the job done easily. The rest of the cast members are relying heavily on Inaho all the time. Inahobarely shows any emotion, just like Edward Cullen. Inaho is just a wish-fulfilment character.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine was an interesting character, he could be an anti-hero. If he was given a better material, he could have been a memorable villain. However, his character was handled terribly.\\n\\n\r\nAsseylum Vers Allusia was useless all the time. She barely did anything. In the 1st season, she contributing something. However, in the second season, she become more useless. What are you writers doing? Give better roles to women. C'mon. First was SAO, then its Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, and now this.\\n\\n\r\nRayet Areash, OMG. She is the most annoying character I have seen in my entire life. All she does is cry and moan all the time. She showed determination in the 1st season, however in the second season, she became more annoying that usual. If I thought Stephanie Dola was annoying, she is way worse than Stephanie Dola. At least Stephanie Dola didn't moan or cry all the time. I don't care if you say \"Her parents are dead so that's why she acted like that\". There are characters whose parents are dead, and they learn how to become determined to succeed. Example Shinji Ikari, he might be annoying however he showed some determination inside him.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are bland.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3):\\n\\n\r\nI am not going to waste my time talking about it because I have better things to do. I enjoyed the 1st season however, the 2nd season is a mistake to watch. \\n\\n\r\nWhat ultimately makes this sequel worse than Tokyo Ghoul's sequel is the characters. At least the sequel of Tokyo Ghoul have characters that never annoyed me.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give this anime a 3 out of 10.",

            "content": "Note: this review encompasses both seasons 1 and 2 of Aldnoah.Zero\r\nOne thing as an anime fan I've never really been able to get into is the idea that a single name behind a project can generate hype. I think it's better to prioritize looking at the scenario, and the studio's track record first and foremost as opposed to getting excited because of the reputation of one individual. Of course that \"one individual\" in this case just so happens to be one of the most controversial writers in the business to date, Gen Urobuchi. I'm not really here to get into my personal stance on Urobuchiobviously, though If I was to be honest with you, I am for the most pretty indifferent to his output. So I wasn't necessarily excited to hear that this was his brainchild nor was it much of a cause of alarm to hear he jumped ship. Considering how the quality of Gargantia and the Psycho-Pass franchise suffered after he handed those off (and not to mention the fact that the guy who took his place was the same dude who brought us Boku no Pico AKA everyone's favorite meme recommendation) perhaps some serious red flags should've been raised. I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. After an OK start, the writing really unravels itself into complete oblivion in the most uninteresting way imaginable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is that none of it's battles feels particularly weighty or meaningful in the long run. The show doesn't really manage to make up for that with sheer entertainment value since the skirmishes between the two factions feel very samey-samey and repetitious to the point where you can make a sort of drinking game out of it. A shot every time UFE (United Forces of Earth) soldiers shoots repeatedly to no avail at overpowered marauders from Mars and end up becoming death fodder. A shot for every time Inaho appears, analyzes the enemy and finds out their weakness just minutes into the battle and wins. A shot for every time the plot isn't impacted in any meaningful way and all named characters come out alive. A shot for...OK, I think I've made my point. What also doesn't help is that the battles somehow turn a strong Sawano OST and turn into a negative. The issue here is that the music selection is incredibly shallow and overstated. They literally play the same theme for every battle against each Martian onslaught, only swapping themes once after the season break and continuing to do the same afterward. This way the OST not only makes otherwise good tracks seem stale, it also assigns the same level of importance to the battles with random irrelevant bad guys as it would the season-ending climaxes. Gimmicks are the only thing that set the battles apart from each other, the only real question is what broken power will the Martians bring to the table for a high schooler to overcome. From the mech that erases everything he touches to the mech that can freeze surroundings to the mech that can clone itself endlessly, it still manages to feel rote. The impenetrable layers of plot armor and the uninteresting hold-overs from skirmish-to-skirmish eventually make the action in Aldnoah.Zero a complete bore.\\n\\n\r\nEverything I've brought up this far has only really been enough to make the show completely mediocre at worst, but the characters are what make Aldnoah.Zero a true failure. It's hard to not feel anything but the deepest of apathy for the UFE in particular since most of them aren't given a lick of depth and the only character arcs that are thoroughly set-up (Marito and Rayet's) fall off the face of the Earth in the 2nd season because they become entirely irrelevant. Honestly, the entirety of the UFE may as well be renamed the United Job-squad of Earth since they'd be about as capable as an infant in front of a bloodthirsty pack of hyenas if not for Inaho, which finally brings me to everyone's favorite autistic ace-pilot. There really isn't much to say about the guy that isn't incredibly obvious from the 1st few episodes and that's what hamstrings the show most out of all of it's problems. There's no getting around it, Inaho is just one massive, expressionless plot-win button to the point where the likes of Kirito and Tatsuya Shiba. They try to make it seem as if he actually gives a damn about anything by having other people talk behind his back about the guy he really is underneath, but even then he fails to stir much in the audience besides boredom since he would swear vengeance upon the enemy for the death of a friend with same level interest one would put into ordering a carton of discount eggs, possibly less. He has no interesting backdrop, development or anything resembling catharsis. He's just \"competence\" incarnate and that's fucking lame.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mars side fares better in the writing department considering, but that's pretty faint praise by my estimation. Of course, the only interesting character to follow throughout the entire series is Slaine Troyard for better of or worse. He has the benefit of not only being allowed to make mistakes, yet he also drives the story forward so he's already much better than any of the characters from Earth for that alone. The 2nd half mostly revolves around him and the decisions he makes that don't necessarily line up with the desires of the princess he once tried to rescue. His actions and his ambitions essentially run in opposite directions in the latter half. Without going into specific-spoiler territory, everything that befalls him in the second is completely a result of his own lack of foresight and thus it becomes difficult to feel bad for the guy. His evolution from a chicken running around with its head cut-off in the name of the Princess to some sort of Machiavellian-type mass-murderer overnight and it's hard to buy. The logic behind this character feels tacked on and silly. Sauzbaum had potential as a true antagonist because he was an actual character as opposed to most of the crazy warmongering elites, but even his character is wasted in a fairly stupid manner.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is just one of those titles I've completed only to question why I ever bothered with it in the 1st place. It sure as heck isn't smart enough to win over Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Gundam fans, nor is it stupid or edgy enough to capture the appeal of Valvrave or Cross Ange. Of course Aldnoah.Zero is full of nonsense too, but it takes nonsense far too seriously to the point where laughing at the writers is the best reaction I could possibly hope for. It never even manages to become a complete trainwreck at the end because the resolution in the final episode just feels too damn simple and lacking in pay-off. Character arcs and plot-points (like the research of Slaine's father, the origins of the alien technology, the issues with Inaho's eye, etc) are tossed into the wind since the series has wasted too much time in the 1st 23 episodes to do anything but fizzle out in a way that makes much of what the viewers subjected themselves to feel even more pointless than before.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show for nobody, not even the most die-hard Urobuchi-philes since his influence on the majority of the story is non-existent and no attempts were made to even provide a cheap imitation of his voice. Want a mech series with romance, plenty of action and a strong OST? Watch The Vision of Escaflowne or Macross. Want a full-blown epic-scaled war between two sides with plenty of history behind it? Go check out Legend of the Galactic Heroes or get into the Gundam. As far as I see it, Aldnoah.Zero offers a war without weight and politics that lack intrigue.",

            "content": "After watching the entirety of the Aldonah.Zero series (except for the recap, I didn't consider it necesary for obvious reasons), I decided to write my very first review on MAL.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to clarify something: I'm not a diehard mecha fan. I only watched other three mecha animes, specifically Neon Genesis Evangelion (including EoE and the Rebuilds), Gurren Lagann and Code Geass R1 and R2, and I could say I'm used to the genre by now.\r\nAfter clarifying this, now I can talk about what are my thoughts about Aldnoah.Zero season 2.\r\nI'll try not to spoil much, but I do need to talkabout some stuff that really bothered me. A lot.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 3/10:\\n\r\nSo we begin 19 months after the events of the first season. The war between Earth and Vers continues as we find out everyone who presumably 'died' in season 1's finale is actually still alive.\\n\r\nWe find out, through flashbacks, that Slaine Troyard spared Saazbaum's life after he shot the princess, but with the condition of taking her with them to save her life. Later on, the Earth people find Inaho unconcious and managed to save him, even though he was shot in the face.\\n\r\nBack to the present day, Inaho Kaizuka is back to kick some martian ass and be as emotionless and flat-written as always, only now he can know EVERYTHING thanks to his new fancy cyborg eye.\\n\r\nOh, but how will the Earthlings fly their Aldnoah-powered ship now without the princess around? Simple, Inaho has the power to activate Aldnoah now. Just because he did CPR to her after she choked on her french fries on season 1. That's it, a fucking 'kiss' can give you the mystical power of Aldnoah, passed on generation after generation, something probably genetical, easier to get than contracting AIDS!\\n\r\nEveryone else depends on Inaho, as always.\\n\r\nMeanwhile, a fake princess Allusia appears, declaring that Earth must be invaded and stuff. We find out she's Allusia's half-sister and that she also has this shape-shifting power thing. The real princess stays in a comatose stage and only Slaine, Saazbaum, Eddelrittuo (the princess's loli) and the half-sister know about her.\\n\r\nSlaine gets greater and greater ranks between the Vers soldiers, and with the help of the fake princess, gets everyone to try to fight the Earthlings and take over Earth, even thought this was AGAINST what princess Allusia desired.\\n\r\nThe ending is the stupidest thing ever.\\n\\n\r\nART 5/10:\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty neat, but the animation can be a bit confusing at times. The fighting scenes are 100% CGI and may be hard to follow. The character design is not very outstanding. Some characters look very much alike, at least between the Vers counts.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7/10:\\n\r\nThe music for this series felt adecuate, but it's a bit repetitive. It fulfills its purpose, but nothing else. The Kalafina opening was a lot better than this one. The ending theme is okay...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 2/10:\\n\r\nUntil the end of season 1, the only likeable character was Slaine Troyard... but they fucking ruined him.\\n\r\nInaho is still as boring and uninteresting as in season 1. He's the clichest character I ever seen, OP'd a lot, as smart and tactical as Light Yagami and Lelouch combined, and now he's even half cyborg, as if he wasn't emotionless enough. He has no backstory, no clear motivations, no nothing. I can't even consider him as the protagonist.\\n\r\nSlaine was the only character with actual character development, even until season 2. We saw him rise from the bottom to become almost Emperor of Vers. But after the princess was retrieved from Earth, the writers forcefully turned him into the 'bad guy', with no clear motivations, other than 'I DO THIS FOR TEH PRINCESS', so he goes against Earth, even though, once again, THIS WAS AGAINST WAHT THE PRINCESS DESIRED.\\n\r\nThere is not much to say about the other characters without spoiling stuff, but I'll just say that they're not very outstanding and there's practically no one else is very relevant in the story. Well, maybe Alussia's sister, but there's not much to say about her either.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 3/10:\\n\r\nThis second season felt very promising when first announced, even though there it seemed hard to have a new and fresh start with most of the main characters 'deceased'. I even thought Slaine was going to become the main protagonist, but I wasn't sure what to expect of him.\\n\r\nThis season felt clich\u00e9-er than ever. No one dies, in contrast with the first half of the series (lol), the good guys always win and never lose, the bad guys, even with their dozens years advanced technology, are brutally defeated, and the ending is the worst shit I've ever seen.\\n\r\nThere are a lot of plot holes in the story, no plot twists or sudden relevant changes, the non-battle scenes are boring as hell, and the battles themselves... well, all praise Inaho the all-mighty. He can do EVERYTHING.\\n\r\nBTW, why do their mechas look so much like Code Geass's Knightmares? They even have that harpoon shooting thingy... Hmmmmmm, I smell lack of originallity.........\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 3/10:\\n\r\nDisgusting.\\n\r\nThis felt as a huge step backwards compared to the first series. Actually, the first series wasn't that good either, but the second season is actually worse. The characters are even lazier written (and more unrealistic than ever), the story fucking sucks, the ending fucking sucks, they don't even have Kalafina, and it's all plain boring.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed season 1, go watch it, but you may be VERY disappointed.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nSomething that everyone struggles with are \"blocks.\" Maybe it's procrastination for that next exam. Or maybe it's the comfort of bed instead of the treadmill. Whether it is mental or physical, there are those times where one just doesn't want to do whatever it is that needs doing. In other words, there is a lack of motivation. So maybe it's the joy your parents would feel by seeing a good grade, or the elation you would have at obtaining that tone body, that motivates you to accomplish that ever elusive goal. Motivation, like those \"blocks,\" isalways present; you just need that initial push to really get going. And Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is a prime example for when such motivation is sorely lacking.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nZero Two (the moniker to be used) takes place several months after the conclusion of the first season. Inaho has miraculously survived, Slaine has climbed the Vers' ranks, and Asseylum is currently in a coma. Irrespective of their situations, war continues.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Zero Two, like its predecessor, mostly focuses on is the action that permeates much of the show. The space battles, the cool robots, the random technology; it's an anime that is entertainment first and purpose second. And for the most part, the anime gets this right. While everyone outside of Inaho is fodder or useless, the range of scenarios that the action encapsulates are wide and varied. Whether it be taking down a Kataphrakt from the Earth's orbit or using a multi-lock-on system to eliminate the enemy in a solitary strike, Zero Two is always looking to switch up the formula in order to keep the show both refreshing and fun. There are always two issues that persist through all of the fights, though: Inaho and his robotic eye. Inaho is a \"Gary Stu:\" he's infallible, un-killable, and nonnegotiable when it comes to battle. He never has any problems dealing with the enemy (a reason that is never really explained) and thus the skirmishes follow the same pattern and predictability: good guys are losing, Inaho devises plan, and Inaho wins. These repeated events occur at an even higher probability due to his newfound eyeball. Acting as a sort of supercomputer, Inaho's already unfair level of tactical skills is amplified by his trusty ocular, making what goes down between Inaho and the enemy seem more like hide-and-seek rather than war.\\n\\n\r\nThere is another problem that persists, but not between the battles but instead between the seasons. And that is Zero Two's inability to properly utilize the very assets that it holds. The show has a lot of material to work with outside of the war, the main cast -- Inaho, Slaine, and Asseylum -- and the overarching plot. But it doesn't use any of it for some baffling reason. In fact, it even introduces new facets that go unused. Some easy examples include: Rayet and Marito's backstories, perceptions, and ideas; Inko and Magbaredge's role in the grander scheme of things; the political subterfuge that exists within both the Earth government and Vers Empire; Lemrina's and Maazurek's overall influence on the people that they were connected to; and Yuki's and Harklight's relationship with the person they were \"protecting.\" There's a lot that is going on, mostly because there is a literal interplanetary space war happening in the background. And subsequently these myriad of relevant plot points are generated, and for good reason; they contain a breadth of potential that the anime can catapult off of. Yet, it never does: such elements stagnate and are sadly wasted by the time the anime finishes.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the dust settles and the eggs are counted, Zero Two does contain some semblance of theme. Like the introduction stated, motivation is a factor that is omnipresent; it's the kind of \"entity\" that allows someone to do or not do an action based upon the amount given. And for our main trio, this idea is displayed nicely enough. Inaho is wholly guided by Asseylum's light, and wants nothing more than to make her wishes come true; Slaine's motivation is at first Asseylum's protection but devolves into a thirst for power; and Asseylum herself discovers through the actions of these two boys that the brokered peace that she had always dreamed about was within her grasp. And this kind of thinking, that motivation takes on multiple forms, is manifest in all parts of the show. The Martian fighters rally to fight for Slaine's cause, Yuki and Inko look to support Inaho, and Lemrina is spurred on by Slaine -- the only person who shared even a shred of caring for her. So, while the actual narrative is a package filled with unused goods, Zero Two's motivational theme is tried and true.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nZero Two's art was often quite nice to look at. This is mainly due to the landscapes that the anime found itself in. There were grassy plains with overcast, arid deserts with relevant sand dunes, and dilapidated cities that harbored past transgressions. Alongside the art, the show does a nice job of keeping the choreography of the fights easy to follow due to nice use of the camera. The Kataphrakts' abilities and the general dueling that occurred never felt overly difficult to read, making these bouts that much more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for the anime are nothing too notable. It's a \"realistic\" setting, so many of the characters are given realistic designs. Of note are Asseylum and Lemrina for their more stand-out dresses and hair styles. But beyond them, the rest of the cast is rather unimpressive, especially in comparison to the art.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation for the show was normally about average. The anime heavily relied on CG, namely with the Katphrakts and the Deucalion. One becomes desensitized to the three-dimensional usage after a time, but when it isn't showcasing this kind of animation, the rest is often static scenes with characters talking or lamenting.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nZero Two places the majority of its bets on two separate couplings: Asseylum and Lemrina, and Inaho and Slaine.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the pair of princesses, it's not immediately obvious who the better of the two is. One was sidelined into a coma and contracted amnesia for three-fourths of the show, while the other saw insignificant progression in her emotional balance. These descriptions fit Asseylum and Lemrina, respectively. The former does nearly nothing for the entire season, with her only act of importance coming through in the way of a radio message. She sees no development, serves no purpose, and has no worth outside of her name. She literally becomes a tool to be used -- for both sides of the war -- whenever the plot sees fit to take her out of the drawer. It's an unfortunate outcome that came to be because of her sister; Lemrina's inclusion in the story is not only sudden, but a direct byproduct of Asseylum's condition. For without the lovable, kindhearted girl, someone had to take her place. Therefore, the sibling does. But instead of being filled with good, Lemrina is filled with evil; her scorn of the position she's in, her jealousy of the sister she has, and her feelings of loneliness stir within her the makings of a mentally unstable being. She often talks of the moon base as being \"her home,\" simply because it's the only location where things have gone right for her. She's accepted, her sister is gone, and Slaine is by her side. Yet, her home, like her character, explodes. By the anime's end, while her characterization exists, she, like her sister, means nothing to the story outside of a few radio appearances. In other words, the two are bound both by blood and badness.\\n\\n\r\nThe second pair is more of a seesaw than a level playing field. Inaho is the all-mighty warrior, the de facto champion of the Earth's soldiers. He begins the season compliant of the higher-ups that are guiding their hand, simply engaging in feud after feud to much success. And while Inaho always manipulates the outcome of the fights in his and his comrades' favor, there isn't any manipulation of his actual character. He without a doubt plays the biggest part in regards to everything that goes down, but lacks in personal development. Which might just be a corner he was written into thanks to the writing; his unbeatable status, his ridiculously overpowered eye-friend, and nonexistent emotions make such growth impossible. He cannot be challenged and he cannot be affected; he's as much a robot as the machine in his brain.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the higher side of that seesaw. Slaine Troyard is a man with a mission, one that he will do anything he can to accomplish. Initially, this goal was to save Asseylum, to keep her safe. But it slowly morphs into something more sinister: the attainment of absolute power. And this progression in his character makes complete sense; his previous passiveness nearly caused him to lose that which was most dear to him. So, this season, he moves from being reactive to active. Slaine's gall gradually grows, and as the people around him note, he no longer acts as a mere cub but as an unrelenting wolf. But as his ruthless behavior begins to amass, his unending bloodlust blinds him. Instead of caring for Asseylum, he cares only for the structure around her; he lies to her, deceives her, and undermines her, all for the sake of \"keeping her safe.\" Yet, his actions sacrifice everything that Asseylum not only held dear around her but also held dear in him. And when Slaine realizes the folly of his ways, it's too late; he's been saved, forced to atone for the sins he mistakenly created. A poetic end for a poetic character.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP starts with soft singing that accompanies some hard guitar and a simple drum beat. Yet, it works; it's catchy and sounds quite pleasant to the ear. The near halfway mark causes the singer to adopt a more prominent role in the piece, with grander singing and more skip-like lyrics. But past this point, the instruments work to overtake the singer, causing the piece to lose its established \"oomph.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is also a strange beast. It is filled with background ambient effects to sound more space-like and mysterious, but drowned out by powerful vocals and more rambunctious drum playing. At the very least, the opening and ending choir-like singing is quite captivating.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the OST contains specific pieces that are quite good, such as the lone female singer that follows along with the show's signature beat -- the one obtained from the previous season's ED. Others definitely fit the mood for the show, too, such as the slow violins during the tense buildups. The tracks certainly sound like Hiroyuki Sawano composed them, but they don't feel like his music. There isn't anything from them that is truly memorable or standout, despite everything sounding so nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice-acting, the cast involved performed somewhere around average. Nobody involved was truly given the opportunity to shine, but Sora Amamiya as Princess Asseylum did a wonderful job capturing that innocently tender way of speaking.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason for watching this one, at all, was in wanting to see where the characters ended up. And upon seeing them all return, that wasn't extremely off-putting. Sure, it's completely implausible, but getting to watch the main three head toward a conclusion was going to be fun to see.\\n\\n\r\n\"Was\" is the keyword. For what was given wasn't fun, it was lame. Not only is the final \"duel\" between Orange and Bat absolutely boring but Asseylum doesn't even end up with either of them, and more specifically the obvious choice in Inaho. I'm a huge romance guy -- it's my favorite genre. So watching her marry some random boy -- after having someone like Inaho chase after her, after giving him a beaded necklace from her, and after she starts to cry as she says, \"I also think of you as a part of myself\" -- is quite infuriating. Maybe his eye mistranslated his feelings towards Asseylum or maybe her decision was circumstantial. But it's clear from her and his actions that there was something between the two. And wouldn't it have been an even better sign of peace between the two sides if a Terran and a Vers became betrothed instead? Goading people on then forcefully throwing the rug out from under them is not enjoyable; it's frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero 2nd Season starts off precariously, seems promising throughout its run, but ultimately ends on a very sour note. The story is misshapen, the characters are shoddy, and the rest is lackluster. While Asseylum, Inaho, and Slaine may be smiling by the show's end, I most certainly am not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, focused yet predictable entertainment, abundance of unused plot elements, motivational theme\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice art style, okay character designs, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Slaine cannot support how awful Asseylum, Lemrina, and Inaho are\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, good soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, the out-of-left-field \"romance\" is very frustrating to handle\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "*Review for both 'seasons'. This is simply one series split into two halves*\r\nAldnoah Zero is a mecha anime that pits the forces of the earth against a Martian empire whose technological superiority is underscored by a ruthlessness and pride resemblant of the great empires of earth with centuries of history. The year is 2014, and it has been forty-years years since the Martian empire was founded.\r\nWait.\r\nForty-two years?\r\nOkay, let's try this again. Aldnoah Zero is a mecha anime that features plenty of drama, action, and even a hint of romance, but fails to set up its story and characters in a way that any of theseelements can resonate with the viewer. The lead character, Kaizuka Inaho, takes the stereotypical self-insert main character to ridiculous length by having no emotions for the great majority of the series. Meanwhile his rival and series antagonist, Slaine Troyard, is a significantly more human and interesting character, far more so than the rest of the cast. But whereas Inaho's actions are guided by some sort of logic, Troyard's motivations for his absolutely insane schemes are never explained, shown, or slightly conveyed to the viewer in a believable way.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, it doesn't matter if the Vers empire has existed for forty-two years, forty-two days or forty-two centuries. Either could work if there's some kind of impetus for the conflict presented, something tangible that makes us empathise with the circumstances of both sides. But throughout the entire series, not once are we given some kind of deep glimpse into the Vers Empire. There are a lot of remarks about how the masses of Vers are poor, but we never, ever see them. We only see the handsome knights, soldiers and gleaming technology. So as far the viewer is concerned, the behaviour of Slaine Troyard, the Vers Empire, in fact most of the characters in this decrepit series is inexplicable.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I am getting increasingly bored and frustrated of Aldnoah Zero's boring, creatively frustrated plot, it has a little party trick to pull. Decent fight scenes. Watching Inaho figure out and exploit the weaknesses of the Vers Empire's high-powered mechs is one of very few enjoyable parts of this series. Ultimately, it's just a deus ex machina if you break it down enough, but it means the fight scenes are quite varied and sometimes surprising, even if the overall structure is predictable.\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah Zero is nothing if not well-produced. Having the mechas entirely animated by 3D models is going to be a turn-off for many, but they're quite detailed, the designs are good, and while the animation can seem clunky, the choreography is emphatic. This is also one of the many recent series scored by Hiroyuki Sawano, and while his music often comes across as bombastic, it's distinctive and forms a great accompaniment to the action. Though, while the art and character designs in Aldnoah Zero are decent, the colour palette of the series is cool and miserable, which only serves to mirror the boredom of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, with a project as large as this, a good presentation is the minimum I expect. This is what Aldnoah Zero is, the minimum of expectations. By refusing to have any kind of personality, whether figuratively in terms of story and setting, or literally in terms of characters, it doesn't offend enough to put its audience off from buying it, but it never elevates itself above mediocrity either. The question is, do I rate this a 5 to acknowledge its workmanlike averageness, or a 3 for not even trying to hide its identity as a cynical monetary franchise? Let's split the difference.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3, Art: 5, Sound: 7, Character: 3, Enjoyment: 4,  Overall: 4",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nIt's a shame it all had to end up like this. If you were to flashback to about a year ago, the first season of Aldnoah.Zero was the most anticipated anime of 2014 for many(including me): the latest brain-child of Gen Urobuchi, directed by Ei Aoki, with music by esteemed composer Hiroyuki Sawano. It was a super-star of the 2014 summer anime season, but by the time it had finished airing it had fallen quite roughly from the spot-light. Problems plagued it: a lackluster cast, odd pacing, as well as mediocre writing, as it soon became the butt of the animecommunities jokes. But even so, it wasn't a terrible anime; at least in my opinion. It had problems, but it was still enjoyable, and even showed an occasional spark that it could be something more then it was, that it could maybe meet those hefty expectations that the community had set for it before it had begun airing. This was my mind-set as we headed into the second, and concluding season of Aldnoah.Zero. It wasn't the right one.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, and today, we take a look at the second season of Aldnoah.Zero, and maybe we can figure out where it all went wrong. I won't be boring you with the studio who animated it or the writers involved, all that information is already available in my review of the first season. What I will tell you is that Aldnoah.Zero 2 is a 12 episode anime TV series that aired between January 10th to March 28th of 2015, airing in that year's winter season. Now, let's jump right into where we left off in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSo, as a slight refresher, where did we leave off? Well, if you recall, everyone was dead. Princess Asseylum had been shot in the head, Slaine had shot Inaho in the face, and now it is 19 months later. The war between Earth and the Vars Empire has continued, though after the events of the finale of the first season, the core pieces have been shuffled, and now everyone stands in different places. Slaine is now a well-respected knight for the Vers Empire, as he has the backing of Count Saazbaum, a penance for Slaine saving the count's life at the end of the first season. Slaine, with the help of Count Saazbaum has rescued Asseylum from her certain death on Earth, and now they hold her in permanent status within Ver's military base on the moon, unsure whether she will ever wake up from her coma. With the Princess now out of commission and the last chance for peace between Earth and Vers completely gone, Slaine has devised a new way to rally troops against Earth: as now Asseylum's half-sister Lemrina impersonates Asseylum, using the princess' influence to ignite the hatred between Earth and Mars to drive the war effort onward. Slaine in the meantime, works his way up Ver's military, with a final goal in mind that only he knows, as he leads the charge against Earth's military and gains the support of various counts and knights around Vers. The situation is made even more complicated as Slaine must work through his own personal stigma of being \"a terran\", a fact which places various barriers in the way of his path into a commanding position, and now, Princess Lemrina has started to develop feeling for Slaine, and she could potentially reveal herself as an impostor at any moment out of jealousy of Slaine's feelings for Asseylum or if he reject her advances, effectively putting an end to his plans before he even has time to instigate them.\\n\\n\r\n     On the Earth side of the war,  Inaho has miraculously survived as well, due to some, let's be fair, bullsh*t involving Aldnoah.Zero that allowed him get medical attention. Inaho lives on as a soldier, now equipped with a new robotic eye that allows him to perform all kinds of life-hacks(including being able to tell if somebody is lying, scanning distance between targets and make predictions, scan for coordinates(and really this thing is just completely over-powered)). Inaho is the only one who suspects that the current Princess Asseylum is an impostor, and is determined to find where the real princess is and rescue her, even if that means he will be putting himself directly in the way of Slaine Troyard, setting the stage for an inevitable showdown between the two that may determine the fate of the entire war.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I'll talk about positives first. As a the plot for a \"second cour\" of a series goes, it could be worse. It has pust both main characters into more commanding roles that allow more radical plot-points to occur, and it does well to recognize that these things must always have a sense of escalation as now most of the battle scenes take place in space, which, let's be honest, is pretty awesome no matter what context. But that's really all the good I have to say about it. The idea for this second season might have worked, and worked very well,  but ultimately, the execution is so lack-luster that all positives it had just sort of steadily seep out as the anime buries itself deeper under its own stupidness.\\n\\n\r\n     The inherent problem is probably that the writing really isn't that good, rendering all ideas the anime had pretty much pointless. Characters often make stupid or unrealistic decisions that only serve to drive the plot onward, and certain plot-points only occur because of amazing coincidences or logic that fails to hold any sort of weight. I mean guys, are you really telling me that Slaine missed Inaho's head from literally point blank range when he shot him at the end of the first season? We all know the only reason Slaine missed is so this \"second cour\" could happen, and so Inaho could get his stupid robotic eye. And another thing, that robotic eye is complete bullsh*t. I don't care how smart the show tells us Inaho is, that eye is pretty equivalent to a Geass in terms of unfairness(though to be fair, they do add consequences later on for that plot-point, though it never really goes anywhere). It's things like this that make the whole thing hard to take seriously, though Aldnoah.Zero does undoubtedly want you to take it seriously. You can really tell it's trying to be an epic space adventure, filled with interesting politics and awesome characters, but... it just isn't. It's not like, say Valvrave, that pretty much just insulted your intelligence and credibility as an anime fan by just watching it; Aldnoah.Zero legitimately wants you to be pulled into this world, to care about these characters, and to really be on the edge of your seat as events play out. But the writing just can't support these good intentions; no matter how good it wants to be, just the act of treating itself like a good anime when it really isn't only adds to the stupid factor, and makes the show easier to insult. I don't want to insult Aldnoah.Zero. Hell, I still rather like the first season at the end of the day. But it's really not doing itself any favors by behaving the way it does, because by doing so, it's only going to sink lower and lower down people's \"good lists\", when arguably it doesn't belong there, at least not as much as some other shows I could mention.\\n\\n\r\n      But here's the last, and maybe even the biggest problem that this second season has: it's just sort of boring, and I think I can offer two possible reasons about why it's like this. First, if you were to rewind to the pacing of the first season, what you might recall is that it was a little weird. There were two very specific \"highs\" of the series that were exciting and adrenaline pumping, those two moments being the very beginning(or to be more specific, those first three episodes), and of course the very end, where, you know, everyone dies. The space in between was where the first season lost nearly all of its momentum and promise; a space where Inaho just sort of inexplicably beat whatever soldiers the Vers Empire would throw at him, and nothing really happened besides some half-asked attempts to throw in drama(like when Rayet chokes Asseylum in the show, only for Inaho to revive her five minutes later). That's what season 2 largely consists of. I don't think the reason per say is that it actually is as boring as that mid-section of the first season, but because we've already jumped the shark in terms of dramatic tension. I mean, when you \"kill\" everyone as the finale of your first season, you can't really top that can you? Also(and I've mentioned this before in other reviews but whatever), when you sacrifice your narrative integrity, or in this case, \"killing\" all your characters and then bringing them all back literally the next episode, it sort of just renders everything pointless after that. What's the point of caring about what happens in this war between Earth and Mars when you feel that anything that you're told can be taken right back if the creators feel that is would increase the drama, or have a target audience return for your crappy second season just so they can see what happened. Pair this with, as I've already said, how seriously the show takes itself, which means there are plenty of politically driven scenes that really aren't interesting, and yeah, it's all sort of boring.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this season largely consists of is Inaho and Slaine circling each-other like sharks, breezing through whatever challenge is in their way because both of them are extremely overpowered, until it is time for the final showdown 12 episodes later. Sure, some interesting stuff happens in that time that could have potentially lead to something intriguing: Lemrina's mental state, Slaine's own doubts about his attack against Earth and Inaho's slowly emerging humanity, but nothing really goes anywhere. There's only one sub-plot that really dramatically effects how events play out, but I can't mention it because, you know, spoilers. What I will give the anime credit for is the ending, which while a lot of people seem to find problems with, I thought it was just fine. It's dramatic, there's a certain bitter-sweet aura that I really liked, and hell, even a emotional moment for Slaine at the very end that I thought actually worked. Well, more so than much of anything else in the anime at least.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about how this second season has changed our two main characters: Slaine and Inaho, I'll about the only significant addition to Aldnoah.Zero's cast in this season: Princess Lemrina. At first, when she was introduced, I thought she had potential. Her relationship with Asseylum was sort of interesting, as she was jealous of her sister's beauty and how she was loved by her people, something that Lemrina would never be able to achieve due to her legs being bound in a wheel-chair and her status as a princess born illegitimately from her father, who was Vers royalty, and an unnamed woman.  This leaves her a sort of bitter and manipulative person, fully aware of how she is despised, and taking that hatred to use for her own advantages, which makes her position as currently impersonating her sister to inflame tensions between both sides of the war sort of unique. However, what really annoys me about her is her nearly blinding devotion to Slaine, which drives her motivation for pretty much everything. And here's the fact of the matter: she really has no reason at all to like him so much; he treats her pretty crappy all things considered. She even offers to be a \"replacement for her sister\", if that is what he wants, and none of it just doesn't make any sense, because you will always have this burning question of \"why?\" in your head. The anime doesn't really have an answer. It has the decency to question this devotion later on, leading to a couple interesting scenes which I won't talk about because spoilers, but like most things in the anime, it doesn't go much of anywhere. \\n\\n\r\n     So, let's talk about Inaho first. He was a character that I thought could potentially develop into something interesting when the first season ended, because I still had no idea why he was so emotionally repressed, and as a matter of fact, I still don't. What could have been interesting is completely ignored, the most we get in terms of development is that he smiles a little more than he used to, and occasionally tells us profound emotional statements with the same blank look on his face. And I appreciate that I guess, but we still have absolutely no reason why he was like this in the first place. Was it because of his parents deaths? Because he tries to be the perfect soldier? We have no idea. And that's not good enough.\\n\\n\r\n     And here's the character I've been saving for last, because undoubtedly, Slaine is the star of this second season, as he makes his transition from narrative limbo into a primary antagonist. In hindsight, that's something that the anime had been building up to, and rather well at that, there's a clear progression in the ruthlessness of his actions, going all the way back to season one. I rather liked it. But the problem with his character is that his motivation as \"the big bad guy\" is practically non-existent. At first, you think it's just because he's doing everything for Princess Asseylum like always, but in light of events that happen later on, that theory doesn't seem to hold much water. I honestly don't think Slaine himself or the writers knew what he was trying to accomplish by the end of the series, sure he throws around cliche lines like \"trying to make a better world\", but I don't think that really makes sense either. Like many things in this anime, I like the idea of it. You could see what they were trying to go for, a good man following his heart as he tries to do the right thing for the girl he loves, but eventually everything falls apart as he digs himself deeper and deeper into his sins, and in the end isn't even sure what he's trying to accomplish as now everyone he cared about has turned against him. However, his reasons for ending up how he does by the end don't seem justified and logical, and he's ultimately flat and uninteresting as a character. Again though, I do like the moment of self-reflection at the end of his arc, even if I can't talk about without spoiling the ending of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n     As for everyone else, well they don't really matter. Yeah. All those side characters that the first season built up: Rayet, Inko, Lt. Marito, they don't really do crap in this season, so much to the point that I question why they're all here in the first place, or why we spent so much time with them in the first season. Another waste. And if you recall, my favorite character of the first season was Princess Asseylum herself: I found her interesting as well as pretty bad-ass when she wanted to be, but again, she's in a comatose state for pretty much the entire time so... yeah. Those three characters above are really the only ones you need to worry or care about. \\n\\n\r\nTurning to animation, while I never went as far to compare side-by-side, I'd say the animation is just as high-quality or better than it was in the first season, and that's nice to see, when some shows with great animation will cut corners in their second seasons, like Sword Art Online 2. But no, everything looks great, from background, to character designs, to the aesthetics of this futuristic world. The deal-breaker for a lot of people is undoubtedly going to be the mechs rendered in CG. Yes, it doesn't look particularly nice, but after two seasons of watching these things, I can say you just get used to them after awhile, it's a not a legitimate reason not to watch the show(there's plenty of other better reasons not to watch it), because it's simply a matter of getting used to them. The fight scenes are rather good too, as now they've moved largely from Earth into space. I've already stated the benefits of space battles(they're awesome), but Aldnoah.Zero really uses them to enhance the fight scenes, with the battles seeming to take full advantage of the three-dimensional nature of space, and the various factors of it which come into play during fights.\\n\\n\r\n     Hiroyuki Sawano has returned to do the music for this second season, and as most sound-tracks he does are, it's fantastic. Some might find problems with how often certain tracks are repeated, but those tracks in question are so good that I really didn't mind in the slightest. Nothing more to say about the OST: it's great. However, special mention must be called to the OP of this season: \"&Z\". You might remember that I altogether wasn't too fond of the first season's opening: \"Heavenly Blue\", but \"&Z\" is a truly magnificent song, especially the full version, which is exhilarating, exciting, yet somewhat melancholy at times, like it's a reflection of all that was lost in the Vers/Earth war. If you close your eyes while listening to it at the start of every episode, you could almost trick yourself into thinking that you're watching some epic space opera, but unfortunately when you open them, it's always going to be Aldnoah.Zero. I wouldn't go as far to say it's the biggest reason for watching Aldnoah.Zero 2, but... yeah it is actually. \\n\\n\r\nSo, here we are, standing at the end of this unfortunate franchise. It's all over; undoubtedly, a third season is(hopefully) not in the works; this is what Aldnoah.Zero is at the end of the day, the kind of show that we will look back on years from now. And despite all the promise, despite all the ways it could have succeeded, Aldnoah.Zero's second half is equivalent to a slow, sinking decent in mediocrity. Various life-lines appeared during its run: possibly interesting plot-lines and characters, but it failed to grab anything significant, as it sank too fast under its own expectation and incompetence. What is Aldnoah.Zero at the end of the day? A very typical, very mediocre mecha. And that, is a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I didn't know Inaho was Solid Snake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "Witnessed a lot of bad reviews so it's high time to introduce something different - positive review to this show.\r\n==============================================\r\n~PLOT SYNOPSIS~\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nSeason 1\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nStory revolves around the difficulty of what happens when humanity, hypothetically in the future,\r\nis split up into two categories:\r\n- humans who inhabited the Earth, known as Terrans\r\n- humans who migrated to Mars and settled at the barren planet (Mars), known as Martians\r\nThe humans who migrated to Mars, known as Martians, settled in the barren planet for a long span of time and eventually, the inhabitants established their own government system that portrays their independence from those governing bodies that control the Earth. As thegeneration that migrated to Mars perished and the forthcoming Martian generations soon gained a wrong notion that they're solely different from their Terran counterparts just because they've inhabited a different planet, the notion that they're ancestors used to inhabit Earth fades, as time passed by.\\n\\n\r\nFast forward to the future, Martians soon faced scarce resources as the barren planet gets populated. Due to the lack of bounty and infertility of the land of Mars, the Martians decided to perform a coup d'etat (intentionally used this term since the Martians' ancestors used to inhabit Earth) in order to obtain Earth resources. Not before long, due to the Martians' ulterior motive, the hostilities started in order to gain what they've been longing for. \\n\r\nBut in order to do that, the Martians need a stronger war trigger, a trigger that will supplement the reason as to why they need to invade the Terran's inhabited planet and loot. And so, an assassination attempt to the Martian Princess was framed/conspired by a Martian knight (not going to be named to prevent spoilers) in order to do just that. \\n\r\nBy making it look as if the Terrans planned to assassinate the Martian emperor's daughter, the Martian knight managed to persuade the nation of Mars migrants to ensue an all-out war. \\n\r\n(This is all done just for the sake of the intent of garnering Earth resources as well as expanding their dominion.) \\n\\n\r\nThe war breakout caused many casualties on the Terran force's side as they're overpowered by Martians through the means of higher spec mechas that makes use of a powerful energy source that can solely be derived on Mars - Aldnoah. (hence the origin of the anime's name is deduced) \\n\r\nWhen all hope seems lost and Terrans seems to be on the brink of absolute annihilation due to the unfathomable difference in military power, whether it'd be mecha (known in the show as Kataphrakts) or warhead strength,\\n\r\nhope sheds light as a Terran prodigy spearheaded a movement in order to prevent the Martians' goal from taking into full swing. \\n\r\nThe Terran prodigy, named Inaho, prevented the colonization not by brute force, but by sheer intellect; this is achieved through the means of strategic and tactical style of warfare - exploiting the enemies' flaws, flaws that are somewhat unperceivable to a regular human's analysis and plans that are inconceivable.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSeason 2\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFollowing the war ignited by the Martian knight, the Terran prodigy, Inaho, after a near-death experience in Season 1, managed to survive the conflicts and became stronger than ever, intellectually speaking, in Season 2\\n\r\nvia cybernetic implant which was brought forth by war repercussions. On top of that, Inaho gained Martian accomplices,who just like him and other Terrans, wanted to make peace and form a pact/treaty.\\n\r\nGenerally speaking however, most Martians, including the emperor of the Martians himself, opposed this idea and hence, war continued to resonate. \\n\r\nDue to the Martians' immense military powers, conceit-driven, they have no intention of giving in. The same goes for the Terrans, whose trump card is Inaho who comes up with ridiculous plans with his strategic/tactical prowess. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize Season 2 in a nutshell, the continuation of the war and the conclusion of the hostilities is portrayed in the 2nd Season.\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~MORALE OF STORY~\\n\r\nEver heard of the terms Rayleigh's Scattering, Leidenfrost Effect, Meissner Effect or Quantum Teleportation?\\n\r\nObviously, those who have physics background would know pretty much some, if not, all of these. But for a regular person, that won't be the case. \\n\r\nAnd so, here comes the anime called 'Aldnoah' which incorporates these scientific jargons and exposes viewers to the realm of science. \\n\r\nNot only are you watching anime, but as the anime progresses, the creators of Aldnoah explains to you why that's happening, why that didn't happen, what's the scientific explanation behind it and whatnots. \\n\r\nThereby, by the end of the show, the viewers gains more knowledge in the aspect of science.\\n\\n\r\nThe real life scientific terminologies aforementioned are embedded and is used as basis in the creation of this show.\\n\r\nMagnificently, if you think of all the animes one has watched over the course of his/her lifetime, there's only a handful, if not none, has encountered an anime which adheres to technicalities as in-depth as Aldnoah.\\n\r\nAlso, general knowledge is taught there indirectly via the mecha battles and conversations amongst the characters.\\n\r\n(ex: negating smoke screens via electricity as part of the plan to counter the enemy forces' smoke screen. Scientific reasoning behind it?\\n\r\nThe phenomenon occurs as colloids are absorbed by ions which in turn...ah forget it. \\n\r\nWatch the anime and you'll learn more of such things.)\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\r\nIt's safe to assume, or declare to be more precise, that Aldnoah has reached the pinnacle when it comes to \\n\r\ngraphics. When one might ask me, \"How does modern anime graphics look like?\" I'll simply answer, \\n\r\n\"Watch Aldnoah and you'll know.\"\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~CRITICISMS~\\n\r\nAll in all, it was definitely a worthwhile show to watch. I'm bothered though, about the amount of negative reviews the show's \\n\r\nreceiving. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, frankly speaking, I was expecting this since I know for a fact that Aldnoah goes in-depth; not a lot of animes have that approach and hence, viewers are not used to it and tend to get annoyed by it to the extent \\n\r\nthat they started hating the show and instead of being straightforward and confess that they don't understand much of the show due to the adherence of the show to scientific technicalities,viewers have the tendency make \\n\r\nunnecessary excuses (unnecesary whining, to be more precise), specifically, stating that the plot's cliche, apparently.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot more complaints but I'm too dismayed to read them, all the more, list those things in my review.\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~COMPLIMENTS~\\n\r\nUp next, I'll discuss my 'compliments' to this show after briefly discussing about the cause of criticisms.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike some shows that includes unnecessary fillers, flashbacks, etc. Aldnoah doesn't have that trait.\\n\r\nAldnoah utilizes every episode well, carefully selecting appropriate moments at which a particular flashback \\n\r\nis necessary. Furthermore, the pace is wonderfully decided, upon realizing that every episode ends at a well-timed \\n\r\ncliffhanger. And finally, Aldnoah doesn't need a deus ex machina to make the protagonist prevail over the antagonists. (unless being a genius tactician is not considered a deus ex machina, my argument crumbles apart)\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~MUSIC~\\n\r\nOne of the key triggers for me to give this anime a try is because of the 1st season's catchy opening song.\\n\r\nJudging by the melody of the opening and closing songs of both season 1 and 2, they're highly fancy. On the aspect of OST (background music), one thing that must be made known is that OSTs are incorporated to enhance a particular mood portrayed in a scene, whether it'd be action, depressing, joyful scene, etc.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I was too immersed on the technicalities embedded in the anime which resulted for me to become unaware of the OSTs, all in all; not to mention, OSTs are mood enhancers, so they're not meant to be noticed in the \\n\r\nfirst place. PS: Opening songs of both seasons are so melodically attractive, to the extent that the songs still constantly reverberate in my mind approximately a week after I finished watching the series.\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\n~CONCLUSION~\\n\r\nIf you take the fact aside that Mars cannot be inhabited due to its lack of bounty of oxygen in its atmosphere, then the show will be worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a show that has a protagonist who takes advantage of the antagonists by outdoing the antagonists strategically, like Lelouch and Blank from the renowned animes 'Code Geass' and' No Game No Life' respectively, then I hereby announce that Aldnoah is a kind of show that you'll enjoy, inasmuch as I did.\\n\r\n==============================================",

            "content": "It has been quite awhile since I have enjoyed a well made Mech anime. Season 2 of this anime has some twisted moments but all in all, the plot was developed nicely. Some might say that episode 1's revival of the main cast is bullshit. If you just call it plot armour that like 99.9% of anime out there have, you can deal with it better. \r\n-------Story-------\r\nThe plot of this season was somewhat twisted. Slaine took a 180 degree turn and became the main antagonist for a reason that is deep and shall not be spoiled by me. There are as much moments of frustrationwhen you wished something to happen and it took a left turn and crashed down the chasm. Most of the plot devices are somewhat explained in this season though. The ending was one of the best and most complete ending I have ever seen for awhile. \\n\\n\r\n--------Art---------\\n\r\nThe animation used in battles was phenomenal. Each battle scene would take your breath away and when you thought its the end, the final battle between Slaine and Inaho is even better. Definitely worth watching just for the battle scenes. You wont see another mech battle with such amazing animation anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\n-------Sound-------\\n\r\nWhat? There is music? Basically it blends so nicely and emphasises each scenes to bring out its excitement that I dont even notice its there.\\n\\n\r\n-------Character-------\\n\r\nMost of the characters are more or less well developed. Some of the Counts seem to not have any back story or just a one episode description of their story.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine's character... You can call him the typical \"Twisted\" antagonist where he do something thinking he was right and at the final turn, crushed by his most important friend saying something that turns him completely. Only thing is, the twisted part is REALLY twisted.\\n\\n\r\n--------Overall---------\\n\r\nGo watch it. You may end it at season 1's ending and call it quits. Its a good ending. But Season 2's ending is better. If I was to judge, Season 2 has weaker characters but stronger plot. Well. Stronger in the sense of the ending.",

Slaine has risen through the ranks and has gained the trust of several Orbital Knights, and continues thier plan to invade earth from the moonbase. Now onto the most annoying MC, Asseylum who spends much of the seasonin a comatised state within the moonbase, she wakes up at the ending of the season but has lost her memories. She eventually regains them and during an attack on the moonbase by Terran (Earth) forces, she tries to escape from earth soldiers firing on her. She then bumps into Inaho who falls unconcious before her but his bionic eye takes control telling Asseylum that Inaho had infiltrated the base to get the, she states her feelings towards Inaho and asks him something which isn't seen to the viewer until the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs we get to the last episode, Asseylum takes over from the grandfather's position upon his death, announces her intention for the war to end and that she is to marry Count Klancain (nothing but a character that is used as a plot device). Slaine and Inaho upon hearing that decide to have a final battle, it is also revealed that Asseylum had asked Inaho to save Slaine. Slaine ends up in imprisoned, Asseylum ends up with Klancain and Inaho ends.. well to be honest I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nArt - Nicely designed environments and mechas and the battles are nice as well. Character designs aren't too bad either, nothing really worth noting. \\n\\n\r\nSound - The soundtrack is definitely the best thing to do with AZ, brings epicness to the battles as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I enjoyed the sense of rivalry between Slaine and Inaho but because of the ending all of it seemed rather pointless. I do end up feeling sorry for the both of them and to be honest, after all the two have done for Asseylum, she really does let them down, I can't help but consider her a bi**h.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The battles are enjoyable and the music is brilliant, the art is good but as I have already stated, the ending would most likely let many down. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - good but unfortunately stopped from becoming great by a poorly written and rushed ending to the anime \\n\\n\\n",

That's really all I can say. Even as a fanboy of S1, I'll admit that the story was at most, poor. From the cliffhanger of the first season, I'm not sure what I was expecting, exsctly. Inaho might be missing a few brain cells, or there may be a new main character introduced instead. Even that I would've been fine with.\r\nInstead, Inaho is given a new, shiny, Deus ex Machina eye that canpull off spatial calculations in seconds.\\n\r\nOk, I can work with that.\\n\r\nOh, the eye apparently has a will of its own.\\n\r\n... \\n\r\nI f*cking hate you.\\n\r\nThe main focus of this season, to me, was mostly slaine. But, I'll get into that in the character sections.\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nThe art follows the style of the last season.\\n\r\nExplosive action scenes with close to flawless use of CG (In my opinion),\\n\r\nAnd all around pretty good art.\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nIt's Hiroyuki Sawano.\\n\r\nFrom the seeping vocals to the flawless OST arrangements, the sound is amazing.\\n\r\nAnd that's all I'll say.\\n\r\nCharacters- 2\\n\r\nThis is where I really, really wanted to see some improvement.\\n\r\nThe characters weren't that great (understatement) from S1, so I was hoping that Inaho ' s presumed death might force them to mature in some ways (and we all know how well that went) in addition, the one non-onedimensional character also fell flat.\\n\r\nSlaine kidnapped Seylum, and what happens?\\n\r\nHe puts her in a healing tank of some sort and looks at her.\\n\r\nBesides a few moments, he really doesn't have as much development as he did.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 5\\n\r\nI'll admit, I enjoyed it for the numbing action scenes, but.. that's about it.\\n\r\nOverall- 4\\n\r\nMeh.\\n\r\nSo much potential gone to waste from the first season.\\n\r\nIt really saddens me.",

            "content": "Okay, so...I never intend to make a review for this, because of how little of time I'm having now; but seeing all the reviews so far are all so bad and mostly don't even pass 5, I need to write one for this. \r\nLet me ask you one question: What's the theme of this anime? Let's stop a moment and think back.\r\nMaybe because of the way it's directed, you lost track of the important messenger that Aoki wants us to understand: What's the cause of war, and how to prevent it.\r\nThe show simply shows it to us through the story of 3 main characters: Inaho,Slaine, Asseylum. Inaho believes in his aspect of war \"War is the continuation of negotiation, and it only stops when they get what they want\", Slaine believes in his aspect of war \"War is there because there is someone to go against, and it only stops when that boundary disappear\". Asseylum believes that \"Peace can be achieved when there is no hatred.' \\n\\n\r\nHow to prevent war? The series ended with everything return to 0, with the things that would happen in Ep 1 if Asseylum wasn't assassinated. Because there is no solution yet, to them, and to us in reality. This peace, again, is a false peace. Throughout the story, many parallels to WWII and Cold War have been made, and also many issues that are debated in Japan about their postwar situation, but let's not talk about that, since it would be out of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the basic plot of it, and IMO, the anime has done well in what it wants to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThe flaw of the anime, but also an unique style of directing, is the \"Talk less, show more\". We don't know what characters are thinking, we don't know what are their objectives. Everything is so ambiguous, unless you notice everything, the flowers, a tea cup, or a single line. You know the main characters from other characters, from what they say. And like Aoki did say, Slaine is he protagonist of this season, not antagonist, though maybe we see him as one. Why is Slaine interesting? Because out of all people, he is the most hard-to-understand character. He lied everytime, but then it these lies there are truths. Listen to them and the tone of him, figuring out what he really wants is really an art. I understand why people still say \"I don't get what's Slaine's plan\" even after the ending. Because it was never talked out, it doesn't mean that there wasn't any hint. So I suggest you to watch again. \"Poor written\", maybe, but it's surely interesting for me to analyze every single stuff.\\n\\n\r\n\"Let justice be done, though the heaven falls\" - the motto has been done in the series. Because all characters follow their aspects of war, that they made mistakes and eventually they got their consequence. \"Justice\" here doesn't mean \"The right thing\", but \"The thing that you believe in\", whether it's right or wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI don't get why we should compare this series to Guilty Crown, since it's not a train-wreck with the story of \"fighting for love\" and finished well what it wants to do. And moreover, I don't get why we should compare Slaine to Lelouch, since Lelouch is obviously smarter and all. Slaine can never become Lelouch, because his character is to be the ugly side of war, while Lelouch is the beautiful side of war, though Lelouch's way was really surrealism to me. \\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero is the story of reality. Whether you like it or not, this's what happening. At least, I think all the characters can start new lives now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Welcome to my review of Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season. At the time of writing this review, I have compelted watching the series. This review might be a little late, but do take a look and see what I think about it and give me some pointers as well on my Afterthoughts blog post on my profile so we can discuss and at the same time, let me improve on writing reviews so I can come up with better ones next time. \r\nI'll put this section here early in case you guys miss it. Do visit my blog section on my profile after reading my review foran Afterthoughts pertaining to this particular Anime for some healthy discussion. Thanks!\\n\\n\r\nHere goes:\\n\\n\r\n1) Story (3/10)\\n\\n\r\n- At this point, you would probably have finished watching the first season of this Anime. You wouldn't understand what was going on if you delved straight into the second season without watching the first. Read between the lines here. What I actually meant is that the story is kinda complicated and twisted in the fact that you have a war between Terrans and Martians and yet the one leading the Martians later on in the series is actually a Terran. Like I've said before, if you didn't watch the first season before starting on the second, you wouldn't understand what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nHaving loopholes in the story doesn't help as well. First season aside, the second one is another one where unless you are set up to intentionally be killed, you will never die. Not specifically mentioning scenes, there are points  in the Anime where characters get shot in seemingly vital areas, yet live. \\n\\n\r\n2) Art (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n- In all honesty, this area of the Anime is one of its saving graces. In a Mecha Anime, you'd expect the fighting scenes to be well illustrated, with the machinery, gunshots and whatnot to be well depicted. \\n\\n\r\nTake what I said with a pinch of salt, though. Even though I mentioned that the art was pretty decent, there were also some Kataphrakt designs that were ridiculously not in-line with their ability. If you didn't know before, every Count has a Kataphrakt that is associated with a special ability that is unique from the others. How they are not in-line, I will leave that up to your imagination as you watch the series.\\n\\n\r\n3) Sound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n- Another one of the areas in which I would watch the Anime for. Sound choices pertaining to whenever fighting was about to start was pretty apt and generic music choices were good too. One point to note is that the overuse of the same music whenever the two main characters, Kaizuka Inaho and Slaine Troyard, were about to go into an epic 1v1 battle will sound boring to those who have heard it multiple times.\\n\\n\r\n4) Character (5/10)\\n\\n\r\n- Passable in the sense that I was worried about how Inaho would develop as a character in the second season after getting shot in the head in the first. The same goes for Slaine, as well as Count Saazbaum. Saazbaum was a bit of a disappointment as [START OF SPOILER] he was killed off early by Slaine [END OF SPOILER] so he didn't have much time to develop. Inaho and Slain, on the other hand, were given the entire season to develop as I must say that I am somewhat disappointed as well. Sure, both of them have had big advances in their area as to the things they are able to do and their individual skill in controlling their respective Kataphrakts, but what they were able to do with them is disappointing. \\n\\n\r\n5) Enjoyment (6/10)\\n\\n\r\n-Despite the low score on the Story section, I actually enjoyed the Anime series as a whole. Action was good; the fight scenes were nothing too incredible but not bad at the same time. Interaction among the characters, not just the main ones, were pretty decent as well. There were some, but not too much, of those cheesy scenes whereby \"All right guys, we're at a disadvantage here. We need to band together through our strong feelings and we'll be able win.\"\\n\\n\r\n6) Overall (5/10)\\n\\n\r\n-Overall, I find the second season mediocre at best. If you've come to watch it because of the first season, then why not just go all the way and watch the second one as well. I personally wouldn't recommend the second season of an Anime to a person who hasn't watched the first, but if you're simply jsut a big fan of mecha Anime, why not?",

The setting shows potential from its very base, but this potencial is obscured by a hasty, shallow construction and not the best of executions, while battles seem to get heavier throughout the storytelling than the storytelling itself. There's a large number of characters, most of whom are nothing more than mere instruments for uplifting our gifted main character Inaho (without whom Earth would've been conquered in two weeks, seeing the incompetence of the rest of the earthling cast), whose intellect is not enough to offset his lack of depth and dynamism. On the otherhand, our antagonist Slaine is one of the very few well built characters, with complex motivations for his actions and a real influence on the plot development, as he grows and changes throughout it, specially during this second season.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all its failures, Aldnoah.Zero is an entertaining show with more than one unexpected twist, plenty of action, decent animation and a catchy soundtrack. If you're looking for something to hang, this series isn't a bad option. Overall score: 6/10.",

Aldnoah.Zero the second season of the series where bad and just ruined the series for it existance . I have once again discover an anime that i really like and yet , they fucked it up real good .\r\nStory:8\r\nSecond season continued where they left a cliffhanger on the last episodes for the first season where Inaho and the Princess Asseylum getting shot and we assume that they were dead right but miracle*cough* do happen sometimes . After two years of that cliffhanger thing , the earth is still at war with those Martians army and peace seems like a dream now . Some troops from the Martians army came to earth to have some war with them . Suddenly , our hero that was supposed to be death came like a shining knight to save humankind once again . He's now got an eye that can almost see everything that seems really badass for a moment . More and more events happen and that's all really . Basically nothing new . Everyone whose in the war is in trouble and their hero , Inaho came to the rescue and onto the next one . Repeat and repeat .\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nThe arts and animation is like before . Nothing new or anything really . The 3D animations is also the same as before .\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nSame voice actor and actress . Nothing new . Nothing change . The OP and ED were nice . Really like the OP and ED a lot .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nAgain , same characters like before . Nothing new really . Other than Inaho having a robotic eye , the son of Sir Cruhteo suddenly shows up , Asseylum twins suddenly come like a boss , that's all . Basically nothing new . Nothing at all .

I did enjoy only a few episodes of Aldnoah.Zero 2nd season . The other were not joyable . Now , it's only serious matter . Only a bit of comedy . Yes , no romance like i said before . Epic battles still exist which is good . More mecha-liciousness . That's it i guess .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\nI can't say i enjoy this one that much but i will say that i am dissapointed on this one . Watch if you have already watched the first season but remember , not everyone will like it . Like me *facepalm*",

U DUN FKD IT UP.\r\nMINOR SPOILERS, nothing that will surprise you.\r\nAldnoah Zero basically had the setup of Code Geass, Slaine = Lelouch , Lemnrina = CC .\r\n            The first season is relatively average, Inaho going seed mode every-time and destroying every enemy in their ``vastly superior mechs`` , Slain not having much screen time sadly.\r\nThe second season goes like this, skip everything to do with Inaho and his crew of generically boring friends. Enjoy watching what Slaine will do next.   \r\nEach episodegoes from 20 to 8-10 minutes of just watching Slaine and his Orbital Knights in action, literally the BEST part of the anime, Inaho pales incredibly had in comparison, it`s utterrly astonishing that they copied and pasted what he did from the 1st season instead of focusing on Slaine. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the last few ep`s Slaine totally loses his drive, his princess is in another castle, boo fkn hoo ._. \\n\\n\r\nMinor spoiler here. \\n\r\nAsselyum basically announces that she`s married some random Orbital Knight and want`s everyone to stop fighting, Slaine gives up. What he shouldve done is use his `Fake Princess`Lemrina and have her accuse the other one of being a fake all while being beside Slaine who would order his followers to continue their mission. \\n\\n\r\nBam, a stroke of genius from Slaine and the anime keeps going in a fking great direction instead of the train wreck it turned into. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe scriptwriters should`ve been replaced with someone competent.\\n\\n\r\n- Slaine was the best character, could`ve been better\\n\r\n- Inaho was overbearingly boring, shouldve stayed dead\\n\r\n- Whoever directed this was a moron.\\n\\n\r\nI rest my case.",

            "content": "I have somewhat a bias towards Aldnoah.Zero S2 because of the fact that it is the first anime I have watched in about 2 months. That being said, Aldnoah.Zero is an extremely entertaining and satisfying series, if bit here and there were a bit dissapointing. I've said in my review of Aldnoah.Zero S1 that I wouldn't have minded not having a sequel at all, and I still stand by that. However, this series was pretty great too. My one major problem with this anime is that it basically disregards everything the first season tried to set up. Everyone is still alive (*sad face*) and theone good part of Inaho's character (he's actually smart) is completely overrided by his new magical super eye. Most of the character development was halted, and each of the character arcs seem to have magically vanished, which was only a let-down to me looking back on it, but a let-down none the less. Those of the supporting cast who do seem to get some kind of closure in their development seem to have gotten it during the 19 month time skip between the series. The show instead focuses on one man and his rise and fall: Slaine. In the first series and the beginning of the second, I was on team Slaine, and in this second season there was nothing more satisfying than watching Slaine actually do something right. I believe in the Crunchyroll comments this was described as \"getting Slaine'd\", which I found very appropriate. More towards the middle of the series he turns into something very near an antagonist. I also liked the character of Lemrina, as she very much reminded me of Slaine in the first season, only slightly more lucky. The biggest triumph of this series to me would be the lack of climax. Okay, let me explain. There is indeed a climax, but not anything one would expect from a mecha anime. It's an unexpected turn in the story and it was very satisfying on a character perspective. However, to all of you meatheads who watch anime only for epic large-scale battles who think character development is Goku learning a new Super-Saiyan form, you will be dissapointed by this series. My favorite part of this anime was how it ended, but it left too many things open. I kind of want to see a series of OVAs that take place during the 19 month long time skip to actually develop some characters.",

            "content": "*THIS INNEVITABLY WILL SPOIL THE FIRST SEASON. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED*\r\nIf you were following this show when season 1 ended, you`d know how riled up everyone was at both the horrendous cliffhanger ending, and the argument of Inaho v Slaine. Now, with season 2, many people found it to be an absolute trainwreck, and both the premiere and finale episodes of this season BROKE everyone`s brains and temper. So, what did I think? Well, this is probably one of the more positive reviews of this show given how most people give it around a 3 in the reviews section.  So, what exactly made this fanbasego rampant? Let`s find out shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with a massive cop out, and string of some of the WORST WRITING I`VE EVER SEEN!!!!!! Both Inaho who got shot point blank in the head, and Asseylum who was shot by a VERS version of a shotgun in the head, are still alive with no major head or brain damage. Count Saazbum, despite being riddled with bullets, is alive, and Slaine takes both him and Princess Asseylum with him. 1 and 1/2 years later, Slaine has gone through the ranks of the VERS people, and with a now seemingly evil Asseylum leading, he feels that it is his turn to take charge and eliminate the humans of Earth to make it their new home. Inaho, and the rest of that military he was in, continue the battle, with little having being changed. As for the middle episodes, they`re just Slaine rising through the ranks and Inaho taking down more VERS and keeping one prisoner to help him find Asseylum. It really stagnates in quality, but is better than the first episode that has more plot holes that Saazbum had bullet holes. It also has an interesting, if stupidly flawed subplot involving the new princess who poses as Asseylim while Asseylum rests in healing stasis. Also, there`s one really stupid moment around episode 3 involving how Saazbum get`s dispatched, and it really made me frown at Slaine. The FINALE on the other hand, is one of the most rushed, un-answering, trite pieces of garbage ever that it honestly left me sad at how wrong it was, to put it that way. The script before then was middling and bad as it was but this was the final nail in the coffin.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIf we were to mention only the main leads and other heroes, this would get a 2 since both Slaine and Inaho are horrendously written in the context of the story and just badly written in general. so let`s go to what I like about this. The antagonists. Slaine, NO. He is so poorly written it almost hurts, and his actions to Saazbum despite all he did to make up to Slaine for being such a dick in season 1 really irked me. However, while his colleagues aren`t that interesting, they actually share a sense of camaraderie, which is honestly refreshing for a mech series, even if some are definitely better than others. For the bad, there`s everything else. Inaho doesn't develop... at all. Same could be said about his colleagues. They`re the exact same as where they left of in season 1, even if some are still kinda interesting. The villains aren`t that interesting either, despite the decent sense of camaraderie. Even the other princess isn`t that interesting, and she kinda annoys me at points. Asseylum and her companion aren`t good characters either. I get that they tried with some of the other characters, but the main protagonist and antagonist ruined everything.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYour enjoyment of the art comes soley down to one thing: how much you can stomach the CG mechs. Personally, I found the designs (even if the actual mecha are clunky and a bit it of place compared to the look of the world) to be appealing, as well as the other impressive action sequences, even if some start and/or end rather stupidly. Everything look great, like the blasts, the character designs, and in my opinion, mech designs. Plus, the battles were nice to look at, even if they ended stupidly at times.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe dub, is still rather good, even if some of the star power from season 1 is gone. What can I say, the dub was great. Hell, there were some really funny lines like Inaho calling Calm, played by Bryce Papenbrook, a nerd, and Rayet threatening to deck one of the girls. For the OP, it`s as great as Season 1`s op. The ending here, while not being able to topple Season 1`s secondary ending theme Aliez, is still rather impressive as well. They added some new songs into the mix, which, while not bad, aren`t as good as the songs of season 1 that get brought back, but overall, the OST is still great.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 pissed me off SO BAD!! I could not stand all the BS it pulled, and the finale made me anguish in sadness for how rushed, nonsensical, and poor it was. Other than that, I always got this empty feeling in my stomach when watching most of these episodes, even with the decent fights, and some battles ended stupidly, like with episode 3, probably because they were kinda boring. Overall, I didn`t really like this one, even less than last season.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4/10   RAW SCORE: 44/100\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, this wasn't very good...at all. It was riddled with plenty of plot holes, and it gave me a bad pit in my stomach. Sure, the fights are decent, and the music, voice acting, and visuals are all great, but not enough to really salvage this show thanks to its abysmal opening and closing episodes and overall terrible characters that are even worse than the first season's cast. Well, I can't truly recommend Aldnoah.Zero as a whole, and this less so, not even to mecha or war anime fans. Just watch Turn A Gundam instead for an actually good execution of a similar premise. With that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Aldnoah Zero.\r\nWhen I heard about this anime i dismissed it and didn't seem to care. But after wanting to watch something new I started with Aldnoah Zero. I loved how the story was about war,Sci-fic and the individual characters in the anime. I really enjoyed the whole season until the end where the main protagonists the princess and Inaho died. Of course I immediately continued with the second season and found that they were actually alive. This gave me hope again which let me continue watching.\r\nStory (7/10) : The story was perfect. Everything was interesting and understandable to  people that had watched the firstseason while paying attention. It might have been odd that the second season took place 19 months after the end of season one, but that didn't pose much of a problem. The sad and point-decimating point however was the ending of the anime in which the princess married a different Knight that had not even appeared in season 1. I would have personally preferred that she ended up with Inaho or Slaine. Speaking of Slaine. He really stepped up his game-plan and (to me) seemed like the main protagonist. In my opinion well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) : There is not much to say about the Art. The space battles were pretty good and the quality amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) : The Sound was perfect too. The voicing was well done and the Soundtrack even beat some Soundtracks of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): Character design was really good. I loved how they portrayed Slaine and his desire for power and of course the princess. They also did a good job portraying the other characters so once again-Well done!-\\n\\n\r\nSo overall the anime received an 8/10 from me. I dont know whether this ending occurred in the manga/light novel. An alternate ending would have been better though!! I would have preferred an ending in which Inaho married the princess......\\n\\n\r\nSadly this good anime has come to an end!\\n\r\nWell Guess I will have to re-watch it-.-\\n\\n\\n",

I haven't seen a sequel to an anime bomb this hard since Tokyo Ghoul Root A and Psycho-Pass 2. It is quite astonishing how an anime can do a complete nose dive in quality over the course of a couple of episodes and even though I thought that the first season of Aldnoah.Zero was mediocre I would think that it would stay that way throughout its whole span but I was proven wrong.\r\nStory: (2/10)\r\nThe story of Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season starts off 19 months later after the ending of the first season withSlaine rejoining the Martians and the whereabouts of Princess Asseylum being unknown. One of my problems with the story is how predictable it is with its writing and it definitely shows this the most during the battles. This is how most of the battles go, 1. Enemy shows up with a new mech that has a special ability. 2. The characters get into their own mechs to fight the enemy. 3. The enemy's mech shows its special ability by killing many no name characters. 4. The characters all panic because they can't find a way to beat the enemy. 5. Inaho comes out of nowhere and comes up with a plan to defeat the enemy and then immediately kills the enemy. It just gets so predictable that it gets really boring to watch and to make things worse is how they give Inaho a new ability to make him much more overpowered that he already was. Another problem this story has is how season 2 doesn't take the time to close up any plot holes that were left from the first season and it even adds new plot holes to the story. The way Aldnoah.Zero Season 2 ends is just very unsatisfying. It feels like a big slap in the face after finishing the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art stayed at the same quality like the first season of Aldnoah.Zero. The backgrounds still look pretty good and the character designs managed to stay consistent but the only thing that held the art back was the CGI which was also the main problem I had with the art in season 1. The CGI appears even more than it did in season 1 and seeing all these scenes with CGI makes things much more unappealing to look at. The animation still managed to stay consistent with its fluency.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is still the best part about Aldnoah.Zero. They still kept all the same good songs from the first season and the OP and the EDs are good. The voice actors were all solid and the sound effects were average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters yet again are the worst thing about this anime. All the new characters that were added into this season didn't add anything to the story and were very forgettable. Inaho and Slaine didn't improve at all, Inaho still stayed the same no personality character and his only purpose is being able to defeat all the enemies that appear. Slaine in this season became much more terrible because of how much more inconsistent his personality is. He pretty much changes his opinion on things every second just to further the plot. All the villains in this are either one dimensional or only appear for one episode because they die in that episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe only things I found enjoyable in this anime is the art, animation, and sound.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero's 2nd Season managed to make an already mediocre anime much more worse than it should have been and I would in no way recommend this anime.  \\n",

The combat was very enjoyable to watch but alike its predecessor, the story and characters kind of lacked substance. It seems that the writers were trying to evoke emotions out of Slaine, but you really just don't care enough about the story to feel empathy. There's nothing thought provoking about this season either, so you're really just here for the soundtrack and combat.",

            "content": "I usually look at overall rating in deciding what anime to watch then read the reviews after I've watched the anime. So as I look at the written reviews - there are so many 2s, 3s and 4s - I was thinking was the anime that bad? Had I lost 12 hours of my life watching a piece of unwatchable junk? What I can't understand is if people think it's worth a 2 or a 3 - why keep going? Why bother finishing it and wasting more time if it was that bad? Are there so many masochists with nothing better to do than watchbad anime after which they write scathing reviews, resulting in even more time wasted?\\n\\n\r\nObviously the answer is that the greater the promise, the more crushing the disappointment. And that is the problem with Aldnoah.zero (I will be reviewing the entire series - both 1 and 2 together). To be fair, it is a beautifully animated  and scored series with nothing to fault the character design or the setting. It promised much in the first 5 episodes of season 1 (some minor spoilers will be present).\\n\\n\r\nStarting off with some death and destruction - we see one of the school friends killed quite early on and also Rayet's father killed setting the stage for some potentially epic and emotional scenes which however never materialised. The series is entertaining enough but it never quite matched the early promise. No one else significant dies in the whole rest of the series and there are multiple plot lines which teases the audience only to slap them in the face, almost literally.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like falling for the girl, thinking she also likes you, leaning in for a kiss then you open your eyes and she's gone off with some random stranger instead. That basically sums up the ending. You are left thinking, what the hell is going on here? Am I really watching the show I thought and hoped I was watching? It's just so disappointing to see a series promise so much just crush itself by inconsistent plot 'twists' and character actions. \\n\\n\r\nI picked this series up because it just appeared on the Australian Netflix and I certainly don't regret it. It is entertaining enough to keep you involved but man, it could have been so much more. Greatness comes in small increments and by degrees. It's a real shame that the ending just lacked so much emotional impact and was anticlimactic in the extreme. For more epic endings watch gurenn lagann or my favourite code geass. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary - if you are a big fan of mecha, sci fi action - Aldnoah is fun and entertaining. A score of 7 is fair because it's definitely not abysmal. Yet I do understand why so many people are upset because if only they had changed a few elements, e.g. an ending with asseylum picking inaho only to have him die heroically or if only inko was used properly as a romantic interest - this would have been an awesome anime. Looking at it objectively, there are a number of other anime which are definitely better overall but I think for a superficially fun time but ultimately hollow experience you can certainly give this anime a shot.",

            "content": "he plot was developed nicely. Some might say that episode 1's revival of the main cast is bullshit. If you just call it plot armour that like 99.9% of anime out there have, you can deal with it better.\r\n-------Story-------\r\nThe plot of this season was somewhat twisted. Slaine took a 180 degree turn and became the main antagonist for a reason that is deep and shall not be spoiled by me. There are as much moments of frustration when you wished something to happen and it took a left turn and crashed down the chasm. Most of the plot devices are somewhat explained in this seasonthough. The ending was one of the best and most complete ending I have ever seen for awhile.\\n\\n\r\n--------Art---------\\n\r\nThe animation used in battles was phenomenal. Each battle scene would take your breath away and when you thought its the end, the final battle between Slaine and Inaho is even better. Definitely worth watching just for the battle scenes. You wont see another mech battle with such amazing animation anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\n-------Sound-------\\n\r\nWhat? There is music? Basically it blends so nicely and emphasises each scenes to bring out its excitement that I dont even notice its there.\\n\\n\r\n-------Character-------\\n\r\nMost of the characters are more or less well developed. Some of the Counts seem to not have any back story or just a one episode description of their story.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine's character... You can call him the typical \"Twisted\" antagonist where he do something thinking he was right and at the final turn, crushed by his most important friend saying something that turns him completely. Only thing is, the twisted part is REALLY twisted.\\n\\n\r\n--------Overall---------\\n\r\nGo watch it. You may end it at season 1's ending and call it quits. Its a good ending. But Season 2's ending is better. If I was to judge, Season 2 has weaker characters but stronger plot. Well. Stronger in the sense of the ending",

            "content": "I normally don't write reviews, in fact this is my first review on mal, but after watching AZ for a third time, I couldn't help myself from venting my anger at the execution of this anime and the ending it received. Be warned, there is going to be some harsh language, and plenty of SPOILERS; so if that's not what you are looking for, just do the TL:DR and move on.\r\nTL:DR\r\nAZ could've been one of the best mecha anime of recent times, however due to limited thought capacity and the 5 seconds effort given by the director and producers, the ending is sour AF andwill trigger you harder than seeing LBJ in yet another NBA finals with yet another team. So if you got anger management issues then do yourself a flavor and do not attempt to watch this, just leave now and forget Aldnoah.Zero ever existed cause you will be fuck pissed after watching the ending.\\n\\n\r\nLet me start off by getting this out of the way, I actually enjoyed the series as a whole. Season 1 was exceptional, easily the best anime of 2014. The problem was season 2 and the ending.\\n\r\nNow that I got that out of the way, let's move on to some ratings & spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10 - Season 1 easily rate at a 9/10, the emotions of the characters, the pace, execution, planning, and surprises actually captivates you as a viewer and captures your heart, however in season 2 this just drops flat to a 5/10 at best, like Kira's x105 running out of juice then getting shot down because it's not yet a freedom. Yes, there is nothing new about a war between Earth & Mars, they have been fighting ever since gundam invaded space UC0079. What makes AZ stand out is how ridiculously OP Inaho is, and how everyone from Vers has no brain. No, this is anime, it does not need to make sense. Hell, even if the story is a complete ripoff of Iron-Blooded Orphans /s (no it couldn't have been since AZ came first), and it would've been Negan if they gave AZ a proper ending. So rather I should be saying that the story is tried and true even gundams got off from it. Unfortunately, this happy but not happy, tragedy but not quite Othello ending just left everyone with their mouths opened making shapes that looks like wtf and dropping words that sound like duck. Atleast clockwork planet has an excuse for being bad: it's just plain bad, period. From all the way up the AZ story takes a scary drop, the decline is real, and it's a sad ride into the sunset yet you can continue expect shit like this from what you thought were decent studios such as A1. The story as a whole is still decent despite the horrible end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10 - I'm going to draw some parallels in this section in my futile attempt to justify why despite the characters being so bad I still gave it a 7/10 overall. Let's start with the protagonist Inaho, who shows no emotions whatsoever. Which is fine, better than hearing Sasuke whine and cry everytime he got sennen goroshi-ed. Asseylum loves you, but you let her go. Inko loves you, but you too dumb to do anything about it. All you know is how to blow up Katafuks (Kataphrakts). Seriously you could've done so much more than just giving blows. Then there is his love interest, or uninterested one side unrequited love, Inko. Give this girl a medal. I commend you for showing that idiot Inaho so much love and not committing seppuku for almost letting Inaho die multiple times because you totally could've prevented it. /s On a serious note, Inko really got shafted by authors for not letting her do shit. She could've been so much more being the main heroine of the second season and all; but ofcourse not, who are we kidding this is AZ we talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist, Slaine, I won't go into details here why his character design was a complete fail, there are plenty of 100 pages essays and discussions on that all over the net, just google it if you are interested. All I will say is that we viewers put more thoughts into this than the producers ever did. Kill the man, exile him, make him Yagami Light, but please, do not leave us hanging by locking him up in a prison smiling. That's the worse shit you can do in an ending, unless you are planning a sequel. Then finally his love interest, Asselyum. Omfg I don't even know where to start. I don't know if she's just effing dumb or playing dumb; but I do know one fact these producers are one tough act to follow. You don't go pinning your ending of the main heroine with some douche nobody called Crapkind (Klancain) who has less than 7mins54seconds screentime (Yes, I counted tyvm) in a total of the last 4 episodes they decided to dump him in. Who's that dude? I don't even know his name. Seriously I had to wiki dudes' name. There's so much you guys could've done that would've made the ending less sour, ie. pussyblock, cuckold, destroy her via anal probe and have Lemrina take over the world; anything would've made for a better ending but no, ffs you don't go putting your main character together unhappily ever after with some Cockain.\\n\\n\r\nLemrina - Respect. She's one of the only one in the series to stay true to her cause and her words despite getting the short end at every turn. I'm surprise she didn't just blow Slaine into space (moon base) with her autonomous moped.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters just didn't get the attention they deserved and that's where the series really ended up short.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 - I actually had no problem with the animations like some people did. If you have watched as many bad anime as me, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say this is pretty good - nor excellent, definitely not bad. For reference sake: Shana & fate/stay 10/10, Kakegurui -5/10. You get the point.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 - Kalafina & hiroyukisawano, enough said.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 - I'm by no means someone hard to please, I even think madoka is entertaining (at times), nor do I think very hard if the story in an anime make sense or not because lets face it, most anime isn't supposed to make sense (ie. valvrave); but the AZ ending has gots to be some of the least thought out, worse executed crap I have seen in recent years, even majestic prince didn't trigger me this hard. Don't believe me? Disagree? just google aldnoah zero ending on reddit and you will see my opinion is the majority. But hey, what do I know, I'm just a guy who spends most of his spare time watching anime and reading manga. My $0.02.",

            "content": "Now then, well to start?\r\nI suppose I will start with the good.\r\nSounds 7/10\r\nI enjoyed a handful of the score immensely but at the same time almost none stuck.\r\naLIEz is probably the song from the whole show, while rest just blur with one another and the moments of silence had more impact on me.\r\nArt 6/10\r\nThe art is the same quality more or less, although in couple scene the frame rate and quality of animation should be greater, with one of the most notable scene with those issues being one with Inaho and Slaine on the beach.\r\nThe CGI of the mechs was okay in the space scenebut when put next to buildings on Earth made them look plastic and comparable to CGI used in Initial D.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nThe main problem of the show is that the main cast is quite week. An average viewer starts to emphasize with Slaine after all the ordeals he goes through but his character is ruined as the anime progresses. There is also the fact that the Inaho's squads appears to be protected by the plot armor as none of the is even close to death, despite the fact that they have to go around without Inaho's tactical brilliance for 18 months + the duration of season one, unlike the Orbital Knights.\\n\\n\r\nInaho 2/10\\n\r\nEveryone jokes that he is emotionless since season one and rightfully so. For a split second the anime tries to mislead viewer that he got character upgrade as well as cybernetic upgrade, as Inko comments on him making a small talk, but in the end he is as emotional as ever. He generally shows his emotions only around his sister Yuki and Princess Asseylum, since the anime still tries to use this weak excuse for a romance similarly to Sword Art Online. While his tactical abilities in the first season could easily shutter the suspension of disbelief of viewers, his cybernetic eye takes the cake. The eyes is able to, among other things, map out the whole moon station despite not having any kind of access to the system, has zoom allowing to not only see battle on Moon from Earth, despite the fact that this kind of thing cannot be achieved with very specialized lenses, assess the enemy's geographical location without satellites. Had such technology been available to humans, they would actually have a read fighting chance against Marsians as they are also surprised at the Inaho's abilities, although they do not know it's mainly made by the cybernetic eye. Inaho is quite a hypocrite as well as he suggest Inko not to fight, despite the fact that seconds before his own sister asked him the same thing and he refused.\\n\r\nSpeaking of the cybernetic eye, Inaho is quite the hackers since he upgraded the provided software for his own means. Good to know.\\n\r\nWhile I always like Inaho's design as it makes him look more like a side character then lead, his \"tactical abilities\" are the only thing that gives Earthlings upper hand despite they far worse mech and spaceship technology. Deucalion boosted their defense as well, but the military mostly operates using Inaho's brilliance.\\n\\n\r\nCybernetic Eye 6/10\\n\r\nConsidering that it learned to lie, it went through more character development that the main character. But it's ability to detect lies is just as questionable as other crazy things it can do, as stress patterns can be caused by multitude of factors such as fear, disgust or anger.\\n\\n\r\nSlaine 7/10\\n\r\nSince Slaine has won multiple hearts of fans throughout the 1st season, being treated like a scum, betrayed by \"Orange\" just because, tortured and belittled, it wasn't surprising that he basically became star of the show. I found myself actually wanting the Martians to win, considering how little I cared for the Earthlings. It was interesting to see him go from a fierce protector of the princess to actually finding motivation to conquer the Earth even if it went against his princess's wishes. Had he remained loyal to his ideals I would have ranked him higher, but considering how quick he was to abound his plan and go suicidal mode I couldn't help but feel disappointed. He did however become a better tactician that was more believable that what Inaho has been pulling off those two seasons, and even when his plan doesn't turn out the way he planned, he is able to turn the outcome to his favor.\\n\\n\r\n<Spoilers>\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Asseylum 2/10 \\n\r\nApart from forgetting everything that have happened in season one, she had the chance to get an interesting spin on her character, but since the only thing that she did recall was seeing bird with Inaho, I guess the power of boner...I mean lady boner was stronger. She display the same level of na\u00efvet\u00e9 as in season one, but at least she took active part in fighting against her own people then. I hoped that she would take at least some responsibility for her actions, considering how kindhearted she is but it seems it only extends towards Earthlings. \\n\\n\r\nKlanclain plot/10\\n\r\nConsidering how suddenly and out of place he felt, I can't really say much about him other than he was a plot device. In one episode we see him traveling to meet Slaine with almost childlike friendliness and curiosity, the other he is off marrying the princess. If the writers needed some to seal the deal, they might have as well used Mazuurek as he was given actual character development and similar character traits to Asseylum. Klanclain is pretty much prince charming arriving to save the die out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nMazuurek 6/10\\n\r\nSpeaking of Mazuurek, he was definitely one of the most flashed out characters, especially among Orbital Knights, but in the end he was delegated to the sidelines more or less. The fact how easily he trusted Inaho is something hard to swallow however. Had Mazuurek knew the princess personally at least to some extend, which clearly he has not, it would be more believable that he considers Inaho's suggestion worth investigating, especially how Slaine was keeping her away from everyone. Then again, he might just be as naive as the princess. Fukuyama Jun did a good job with his character as well, so I was glad that he didn't die in two episodes like other Orbital Knights tend to.\\n\\n\r\nHarklight 8/10\\n\r\nI actually found him the most appealing out of whole Martian cast. Especially after he went ahead and returned to Slaine's side and thus directly going against his orders, which in turn inspired Slaine not to give up without a fight. Although I don't always like Hirakawa Daisuke's performance *cough* Itou Makoto *cough*, he shined in this particular role.\\n\\n\r\nEddelrittuo 8/10\\n\r\nIt was interesting to see her attitude change towards Slaine in comparison to season one. She definitely gained more maturity and understood Slaine better than someone who was friends with him for five years - Asseylum. \\n\\n\r\nLemrina plot/10\\n\r\nLemrina showed up kind of nowhere (I even joked after seeing the first season that Orbital Knights are silly for trying to eliminate Asseylum unless she has a sister hidden away somewhere) similarly to Klanclain and pretty much behaved the way I expected her too. I ended up liking her more that Asseylum since she had more depth despite being essentially a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast remained the same, without any major changes to their character. Since they haven't much to being with, they interactions were simply mundane. Inko had potential to go in an interesting direction, but the power of lady boner she has for Inaho stopped her dead in the tracks.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nThere is so much wrong with the plot, I can't even. Putting aside the obvious plot devices such as Cybernetic Eye, Lemrina and Klanclain, the final outcome is simply unbelievable. It's impossible for the Orbital Knights who were there just to fight, not counting the ones that were there for resources like Mazuurek, they wouldn't stand down simply because the princess said so. The show even points it out, but as soon as she takes the rains completely suddenly everyone decides to chill, of course fighting for \"earth scumbag\" was something that most of them didn't want in the first place but considering how trigger happy most of them are, it's came across as very unrealistic. The fact that Slaine immediately abounds his own plan, even after Lemrina shows him support was out of character as well. Slaine was at the point when he was going to do anything to achieve his goals: lying, killing, putting his princess in a cage, simple announcement of marriage should be something to steel his resolve. Besides, why he couldn't use Lemrina to counter princess's speech? There is no way of distinguishing between the two and as long as he would use a pirated signal like the real one did, everyone would be confused as to what is real. The fact that he stood up didn't prove anything as we have seen Lemrina stand as well.\\n\r\nLet's also talk about Asseylum's with to save Slaine. In what world is keeping someone, who basically destroyed everything in his path and was willing to die, alive is the merciful thing to do? He has no way of redemption. He was pronounced that and he cannot do anything other than live in prison for the rest of his life. It makes me actually wonder if Inaho didn't keep him alive for his own reasons, but told Asseylum that he put him out of his misery. Considering how he back stabbed Slaine in season one and would have shot him if Slaine wasn't first to pull the trigger, I wouldn't be surprised.\\n\r\n</spoilers>\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment 2/10\\n\r\nThe main reason why I had hard time fully enjoying that show is that I felt that my intelligence was being insulted. Recognizing that someone posing as the Princess in the first episode was as not surprising for me as the fact that the Nilokeras must not have the barrier on joint point and feet or that Mazuurek's mech has to be attacked from the top. The same goes for pretending to be Lemrina. As soon as she asked Slaine \"Would you mind explaining yourself\" it was obvious that it wasn't her. Those moments that were supposed to make me \"no way!\" simply ended up annoying me to bits. The only moment when I did end up surprised was when Slaine figured Herschel's weakness.\\n\\n\r\nIt was simple done better in different anime. \\n\r\nWant thick political plot, good mech fights, great character development?\\n\r\nGo watch Code Geass or Gundam series. At least you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "In last season we were left off at a cliffhanger.\r\n I was very eager to find out what happened to the characters, they seemed to be left in a desperate state. The opening song made an nostalgic appearance further making me want to die for more. You think I'm being too generous to giving the show a majority of 10's but let me tell you, the scores represent my rating completely. \r\nWarning (Spoilers)\r\nIn about two years later ...\r\nOf a very good way, the story had lots of really strong dynamic characters who changes as the story progresses to the next but you don't see alot of changes until the second season starts. I think their goal was to make the watchers comfortable and get to now the cast before the going on into the action. \\n\\n\r\n The series started out with Asseylum Princess in deep support to make peace with the earth ...  and it had ended with that. It was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThere was something daunting me that I didn't want to happen, after Cruhteo died by the hands of the enemy. It saddens me that they decided to eliminate him. I know he had it figured out but I didn't know it turned out that his realization made him face death. He was a strong believer, they could have saved him. May you rest in peace. \\n\\n\r\nThe second I heard Inaho and that the other main character survived I was happy to death. It meant I can watch them do their famous signature moves too. There were lots of surprises along the way that I just can't believe. happened (and you'll see) I was worried about Inaho to the end because of complications with his missing eye he had been shot earlier, that was two years ago. It made me afraid that he would be sacrifice. But of course not, it there was a third season, maybe likely not but I hope none of them will do that. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing, I absolutely loved the beginning and ending songs. Since I play an instrument it was easy to pick up the notes. Their 2nd ED song \"I Say Cry\" was very catchy and the lyrics seems to match everything about the plot. It isn't weird I'm just stating that it's a masterpiece. Maybe you guys could check it out too. It was last present in the first season. \\n\\n\r\n I don't have a firm grasp of my memory in the places names and named units but in general I understood the basic situation going on. For example, how bad a damage was and the objectives they had with them. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was a little bit difficult to interpret, it occurred that I had to stop once in awhile to understand what the character had just said.\\n\\n\r\n  It was nothing serious really. It's not the series fault, either the translator or the Anime itself was adapted to respond in some intellect dialogue. In short it depends on the individual if they understand. The thing wasn't impossible to interpret.\\n\\n\r\nbut.... If I can understand it, you could too. eheh\\n\\n\r\n  Enough said that's why I make reviews for this reason, I am always forced to forget even if I don't want to. Your experience might not go the way I did. You might go through a whole series without ever stopping. I on the other hand wanted to understand everything that was present in front of me and I did it.\\n\\n\r\n The series was a hit, there are lots of Kataphrakt battles (still trying hard to learn how to spell that Gigantic word). I hope you guys do watch the second season if you haven't. Aldnoah.Zero is a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Hunting!",

I had a lot of fun watching this badass mech anime. It ended on such a cliffhanger that made my head explode I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Boy did I wish I didn't know what happened next. \r\nWARNING SPOILERS BEGIN HERE:\r\nSo at the end of Aldnoah.Zero season 1, the Princess and our edgelord main character both are shot dead and that's the end. I was losing my shit cause it was sofucking incredible. But then there was a dissapointing turn over in the second season where they retconed their deaths to them both living and they didn't really die...FUCK THAT BULLSHIT! It now felt meaningless and all forms of excitment where you could build from that where we could see a background character rise up to become the real hero and keeps the memories of the Princess and edgelord in their hearts or whatever and it could have been a really exciting and very emotional. But no they brought them both back to life and nothing of consequence was lost. It was so shitty and from there on it went downhill. It was the sharpest nose dive I've ever seen in writing. Aldnoah.Zero 2 is absolutely trash. I am so angry and sad to say it but I dropped this show fast before it got even more painful. I felt cheated of a real story and series. This could have been, no wait, it should have been amazing but it just ended up shitting the bed and ruined some really amazing potential. I hate cop outs on the death of characters. It drove me up a wall during Attack on Titan and it did it here for me too.",

            "content": "As this is the second cour for the show Aldnoah.Zero, I will assume you have already seen the first half, but not the second. Going off this basis I will partially discuss major plot lines that occur within the first cour of the show. If you actually plan on wasting your time with the first and possibly the second cour after my (and many others) warning against such a path, I would suggest you find another review. Though I honestly don't know why you'd want to, as there are far many other mecha anime out there that both look better and are presented better. Butwithout further ado, here is my take on Aldnoah.Zero's second cour.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nPicking up nineteen months after the first half, we find not much has really changed on a whole. We discover that Slain is now a knight under Count Saazbaum. Princess Asseylum is in a bacta tank recovering from her gunshot wound at the end of the first cour, and is thus comatose. Finally, we find that Kirit- I mean Inaho, is not dead and now has a supercomputer in place of his eye, as he was shot in the face at the end of the first half. It appears almost nothing has happened in the last nineteen months, as the war is still on, but none of the characters have changed, or have changed so little its unnoticeable. All major developments have been stalled, and it seems like the only purpose for this time skip was to make it more dramatic when Asseylum inevitably wakes up, making the time skip wholly unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything that occurs in the second cour, this show story clearly had a lot potential, as The Urobutcher himself created the original concept and first episode. Being a big fan of Urobuchi anime, (Psycho-Pass, Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica, to name a few) this show had a lot going for it. However, with constant nonsensical character developments, and the walking Deus Ex Machina of an MC, we get a very unpolished product. This show had a direction, but it felt like the directors wrote the story into a corner, and instead of re-writing it, they just had Kiri- I mean Inaho, fix all the problems magically. While this is less annoying in the second half and more realistic due to the introduction of Cortana in the form of Inaho's left eye, it's still extremely annoy to watch the supposedly vastly inferior Earth forces constantly overpower and win out over the technologically superior Martian invading forces, because some kid is far too intelligent for his age.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nWhile the art is not godawful, for a mecha show, you expect your mechas to look nice. But when they are just mechas are all CG all the time, they look very choppy and out of place with the rest of the characters. The characters themselves are pretty boring, and only have a couple of unique features, but for the most part just look like your average KyoAni esque anime character. (Note, I realize Kyoto Animation did not animate this show, that's just the name I've given to characters that look like this, as they might as well be KyoAni characters) While I do like the KyoAni style design, it's getting really monotonous, when everybody looks the same. However, my major gripe and the reason why I score the art so low, is because the CG mechs. I cannot stand this trend of godawful CG showing up in shows. It's lazy, looks like garbage, and it needs to desist, as it brings down quality as a whole. Speaking of lazy...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\r\nTo me, sound might as well just mean soundtrack, and so that is the biggest factor for this low score. However, the voice acting in this show was of average quality, and I had no qualms with it. The actual SFX was decent as well, but wasn't anything all that unique, but was certainly not bad. Now my main issue with this series is Hiroyuki Sawano. This is a man who has taken the Call of Duty approach to sound design. The first show I saw that he worked on was Guilty Crown. Guilty Crown has one of my all time favorite OST's, and is a big reason I think so highly of it, even though it has some awkward plot lines here and there. The next show I watched that had Hiroyuki's name on it was Shingeki no Kyojin. This show also had a very good soundtrack, but I couldn't help but feel it was far too similar to GC's. Take Bios and The Armored Titan's Theme, for example. Both have German-ese vocals, loud orchestral music + bass. Not exactly the same but the style just feels stagnate. It only gets worse from there, as next was Kill La Kill, which like Aldnoah was also a disappointment. I feel this is also in part to Hiroyuki, but KlK had a lot of it's own problems. Again, the only song I even remember is \"Don't Lose Your Way\", and only because it's so campy. Finally, we get to A.Z's OST, and at this point it all just sounds like poorer versions of GC's OST, as if Hiroyuki has run out of conductive genius, and is just trying to emulate his previous successes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nI've already said basically anything that needs to be said about Inaho Kirigaya. Kazuto Kaizuka is Deus Ex Machina, and nothing more. He's a kuudere, but without the dere. He's completely unlikable, and I was very excited at the concept of him being dead at the end of the first cour, as it meant we'd hopefully get less plot convenience and more actual story. However, he comes in and saves everything every time, so much so that he's not even a character, he's more like a force within the series that pushes it forward because no one knew how to write a story without the Eagles coming in and saving the Earth and Company.\\n\\n\r\nNext is easily the best and most frustrating character in the series, Slaine. Slaine was the most relatable character within the series, and is thus the most frustrating because he is not given the proper development he needed to really shine and make this a series worth watching. In the end he just feels like a crappy version of Suzaku. He gets a very good arc that could have gone sooo perfectly for him, but you know he can't achieve his goals because the \"good\" guys have to win.\\n\\n\r\nAll other characters feel like set pieces, and are so distant they don't feel real. The only one I want to mention is Kouichirou Marito. This is a character that in the first cour gets a great amount of development and could actually be a great character fighting with his PTSD after encounter a Martian warship and his forces being devastated by it. But I can tell you exactly what's wrong with him, by simply quoting what is, at the time of writing this, is his bio on MAL itself: \"No biography written.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nVery few shows actually piss me off. Even shows I absolutely despise, like Mirai Nikki, were incapable of pulling this feat off. I knew exactly what was going to happen at every turn, and was never surprised. This show followed the most linear path it might as well have been a line on a piece of paper, it's about as generic as one too, so I'd have trouble distinguishing which was which. That's a lie of course, because one of the lines would make me extremely perturbed, telling me exactly which is which. I don't write reviews that often, but when I do, it's for shows that I love so much and think are underrated, or I hate so much I feel it's my civic duty to warn others to stay far, far away from them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I personally rate this a 1/10, but I think it's actually closer to a 3/10. This was a mainly negative critic, but I felt this show had so much potential, and because it didn't live up to it, I personally feel like it stole my time from me. And I want it back.",

            "content": "Story (7/10) : The story was perfect. Everything was interesting and understandable to people that had watched the first season while paying attention. It might have been odd that the second season took place 19 months after the end of season one, but that didn't pose much of a problem. The sad and point-decimating point however was the ending of the anime in which the princess married a different Knight that had not even appeared in season 1. I would have personally preferred that she ended up with Inaho or Slaine. Speaking of Slaine. He really stepped up his game-plan and (to me) seemed likethe main protagonist. In my opinion well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) : There is not much to say about the Art. The space battles were pretty good and the quality amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) : The Sound was perfect too. The voicing was well done and the Soundtrack even beat some Soundtracks of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): Character design was really good. I loved how they portrayed Slaine and his desire for power and of course the princess. They also did a good job portraying the other characters so once again-Well done!-\\n\\n\r\nSo overall the anime received an 8/10 from me. I dont know whether this ending occurred in the manga/light novel. An alternate ending would have been better though!! I would have preferred an ending in which Inaho married the princess......\\n\\n\r\nSadly this good anime has come to an end!\\n\r\nWell Guess I will have to re-watch it-.-",

            "content": "After so much hype from season 1, I was so keen jumping into season two of Aldnoah Zero. Lo and behold, I was on an express train to disappointment central. I didn't realise that it was possible for Inaho to be such a zero calorie cardboard like character even in this season. There is no character growth or development (unless you count surgical ones). This counts for most of the main characters who all seem to lack any credible depth in their personalities. You just don't really care for any of them, and the ones that are slightly interesting just get sidelined. Slaine on theother hand, gets written to be some poor man's Lelouch, trying to gain power with his brilliant keikaku. He is probably the only character with some development but he just becomes so unlikable because he just acts like an illogical dick most of the time. Death is cheap in this series, and it really brought it down for me. I am not sure if there was some studio meddling that happened between the seasons, but there just seemed to be no real climax after a good plot build up in season 1. I am going to say the saving grace for this show was the art style and music. You're unlikely to get too invested in the story or the characters. In summary, it's basically a show that is okay to watch while in between seasons or episodes of better shows.",

At face value aldnoah.zeroseason 2 appears to be a mess of plot holes and out-of-character development, but if you enjoyed season 1 enough to pay close attention,  the characters actions, while irrational, are not entirely unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nThe three main characters all represent a particularly singular trait, mostly in relation to the war. Inaho: the logical, Asseylum: the pacifist, and Slaine: the emotional. \\n\r\nInaho's drives remain logical ones, only wanting to end the war as soon as possible to keep his friends safe. He harbors no ill-will and hatred born from battle isn't something he submits to. \\n\r\n Asseylum's would do anything for peace, except mass murder. Asseylum's drive as a character remains the same, but some burdens of war attach themselves to her. \\n\r\nSlaine's endless emotional trauma continues to chip away at him. His character development is by far the most drastic. His goal of ensuring Asseylum's safety relies on him piling up bodies causing  him to lose pieces of his gentler self bit by bit, and in doing so loses the part of him that Asseylum is fond of.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint is the shows overly rushed ending and surface explanations for some of the events in between seasons 1 &2, as well as the final 2 or 3 episodes. This anime shows a lot without explaining everything. Sometimes that serves to benefit the show, but other times, as in its final moments some more character dialogue and interaction would have been much more satisfying. I think after 25 episodes of robot fighting it could have chilled out for one episode to just have the characters all sit down and talk. All in all it leaves far too much up to open interpretation and honestly I want another season on the political ramifications on the outcome.  It's one of those gloss over endings that kept the action going until the last possible moments.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime tends to rub salt in the wounds it creates(as most reviews for this anime demonstrate) but if you enjoy the feeling of a show affecting you emotionally, whether that be in anger, sadness, or frustration, then I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: This review contains minor plot spoilers, but I think it is a fair review. If you are overly worried about spoilers, skip over the character section, and only read the rating, but I do recommend the whole thing.\r\nI am VERY mixed about this one. It was a very hot and cold anime. I really liked Aldnoah.Zero as a series, but my last review was fairly mixed as well. I'm going to break it down:\r\nStory: This was both great and horrible. It had moments that I believe were pretty stellar, but overall it draggggggged on for a bit with events that were fairly boring onuninteresting. I was able to count several plot holes or Deus Ex Machinas, and that was upsetting for a series I had enjoyed. 6/10, for story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I think that the animation was very well done, and the people were all done quite well, with the exception of most Inigo's face scenes. Factoring all of these into account I believe a 9/10 would be fair, rounding from an 8.5/10. There is a lot more cool Earth imagery, and the space stuff is welldone for those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Yeah, I don't have much to say about the music in this season. The OST had fairly similar reviews for this, some good tracks some bad tracks, and an OP/ED that I didn't like.  Giving it a 5/10 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I hated Inaho as a protagonist, he just rubs me the wrong way. He just didn't live up to the potential he could have, and seemed very 2D. I LOVED THE POETIC, FULL-CIRCLE THAT THIS ANIME DOES! Without spoilers I cannot describe it, but in that moment, I was willing to give it a 10/10, for the sheer greatness of it. The reason it is here is because it involves a key moment of character development for some key characters. Slaine was horrible for some of this season, until after I had it explained to me, the key symbolism around his character, my love for him exploded once again as I realised how deep he was and what great imagery his character portrays (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD) if you just look into his eyes (END OF SPOILER). I think that with the explaining that it shouldn't have needed, it will get an 8/10, more if it was more easy to understand, but I feel like this entire anime may have gotten higher ratings and more positive reviews if that were the case.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is gonna be mixed, but I did like it all-in-all, and after I got over the initial questions and some of my disdain for the ending, I got have decided to give it a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Taking into account the not-so-great story, the great animation, the mediocre sound and great character development. I am going to give this a 7/10 overall, one lower than last season. If you've seen season 1, I recommend watching this and then checking out the thread that explains the ending, as I believe many people can be too harsh on this anime unless some of the great points are explained (I won't because I would prefer not to spoil it here, the thread is: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/37smuc/spoilers_why_aldnoahzero_ending_makes_senses/, it is worthwhile checking out after you view the anime, even for people who watched it a while ago and are just scrolling through the reviews). I really liked it in some areas, and disliked it in others, I still believe it is worth an initial watch, especially if you already finished season 1.",

            "content": "Honestly for all the bad rap that the previous critiques have given this show, especially the second installment, I feel they are undeserved. \r\nCHARACTER/PLOT\r\nElements of the first series remain but there is a bit more character development. But if all you're looking for is character development and a wicked story with crazy plot devices, you're not gonna find that here. The passage of time in the plot direction is a little messy as it compresses days, weeks and possibly months into disjointed scenes, but it's not a bad thing as you can still figure out that time actually passed.\r\nART/SOUND\r\nInstead the majority of the production budgetis on the soundtrack (by Hiroyuki Sawano) and 3D mech generation, which is fluid and smooth compared to the likes of Gundam.\\n\\n\r\nCOMPARISON\\n\r\nGundam is the popular modern standard of all mecha/sci-fi interplanetary warfare, and if you're going to compare this to any Gundam installment, Gundam will win almost every time. But appreciating Aldnoah.Zero for its uniqueness instead of its similarities to Gundam is what will really get you the most enjoyment out of this show.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, combat in Gundam essentially boils down to individual duels between pilots in a warfare setting. In Aldnoah.Zero however, characters work together in combat and defeat foes that have obviously more advanced technology through ad hoc calculation and strategy.\\n\\n\r\nBattleships in Gundam play a more active role and engage enemies with their own artillery. Whereas here you'll find that they are more of a resupply/comms station and do not engage as frequently.\\n\\n\r\nThere are obvious plot devices that span from the Gundam series of the 2000s and up, but for the same reason that Gundam is the modern standard, do not simply dismiss this anime as a 'cheap Gundam clone'.\\n\\n\r\nAs a longtime Gundam fan, I wasn't sure what to expect when watching Aldnoah.Zero but I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Gundam is to Aldnoah.Zero like two games of the mecha genre, but have very different combat systems and UIs. So if you like mecha sci-fi in general, I do believe you will like this.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero, also known as A/Z or whatever it is, wants to be a great anime. And it really does try to. You have everything you'd want to see in a mecha anime: action, cool effects, and maybe, and just maybe, even nice characters.\r\nSo, you may say, if Aldnoah.Zero has all of those things, why does it fails bad, so bad (in the second season even more) at shining like the jewel it wanted to be?\r\nThere's a lot to say about this anime, and I perfectly know that if they just tried, Aldnoah could have turned out even better than the train-wreck that actually is.\r\nWhen youwatch an anime, and of that anime, even after one year, you can't even remember the plot or the most important scenes, man, that's not a good sign.\\n\r\nYou didn't succeed in making something that people would remember. I clearly remember plots, stories and wonderful moments of anime that I've seen before Aldnoah, and I feel something when I remember them.\\n\r\nBut with this anime is impossible. And it pains me, 'cause the first season got my hopes up and gave me lots of feels.\\n\r\nEnough with this, let's get to the core of the review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'm not making a summary because it's boring for you who read it, and me to write it, and it's unneeded.\\n\r\nTo put it frankly... You never know how sequels will turn out.\\n\r\nThey can ruin the entire anime to the point you hope they never existed (Kuroshitsuji II), they can be freakin' awesome (...still have to find an example) or they can be horribly plain.\\n\r\nThat's the plain case.\\n\r\nIf the story ended with the last episode of the first series, it would have been better. The plot is static, they want you to believe it's dynamic, they want to give you action and character development but you never see any of them.\\n\r\nThe pattern is always the same: mighty enemy (that is always the same enemy), Mars people fighting Inaho's squad and the always and casually useless people of Earth that need Inaho's intellect to save the day.\\n\r\nWhoa. How convenient.\\n\r\nNo, seriously, you arrive at the end of the story and you already know that every fight will end the same, that at some point Inaho will do something that will turn the tables and the enemy will be defeated. Or even if he doesn't do that, he still goes on on living, he never really puts his life at stake, though they want you to believe so.\\n\r\nAnd again, it's useless to talk about the flaws of the plot, that are the same of the first season; the Martians, that in less than 70 years develop an unnatural hate towards people of Earth, and about all the moments the plot goes nowhere.\\n\r\nWant me to sum it up? Two twinks fighting over one woman.\\n\r\nAnd how does it end? It's a shitty ending, I guarantee you that much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot (and the characters as well) are really deplorable, the art is pretty good. Actually, what I really loved were the mecha fighting scenes and all the effects that were added. More plain and flat is instead the character design. Nobody is particularly outstanding. Though the animation is fluid and dynamic.\\n\r\nHm. Yeah, that's all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf hearing Hiroyuki Sawano's name doesn't ring a bell, let me make your sense tingling. Hiroyuki Sawano is the composer of lots of anime OST. Guilty Crown, Ao no Exorcist, Shingeki no Kyojin, Owari no Seraph and many others. I don't know many names of composers but I can tell that his music is something else.\\n\r\nHis soundtrack is what made me give to this anime a full 6. Sawano's music is what it takes to an anime to take a step and get in another rating \u2013in my opinion, of course.\\n\r\nThere's something really awesome and stunning in the ost he makes. If you're thinking the anime is a shipwreck (well, I think it's a train-wreck, but please, ignore me in this point), please, take at least an hour, or even half an hour of your time, to listen on Youtube to the songs of the ost. \"Harmonious\", but even the other titles.\\n\r\nThen, if you still feel the hatred for Aldnoah, I won't blame you.\\n\r\nBut if you feel the feels, you're on the right track, pal.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nNo. Just no. Don't give me this s**t that characters are original, that there's development and all, 'cause there's nothing.\\n\r\nThe side characters are there just to be some filler, and most of them are useless to the plot/nuisances to the core. You see some Inaho's friends, and yet you have to understand what's the meaning of them being there. They're pretty good, okay, but they're nothing compared to the almighty Inaho.\\n\r\nAnd maybe it's normal in some anime, that a bunch of friends gather around an overly strong MC, but this is not the case.\\n\r\nIn this case every side character is useless, their being on board doesn't really make a difference. And what about Inaho's sister? Yes, quite forgettable.\\n\r\nShe doesn't really shine.\\n\r\nWhere's the character development? In the martian girl?, that starts caring for terrestrials? But please.\\n\r\nThe ending is the stunning evidence that all they went through was useless to the means of their internal growth. The princess in particular, was the biggest delusion ever.\\n\r\nObviously is no needed me to tell you that this anime tries to be so original by recurring to absolutely-not plain personality models like the tsundere one.\\n\r\nHail for originality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we get to the enjoyment part. Watching Aldnnoah.Zero was a pain. But not watching the first season, that was rather enjoyable. No. It was watching THIS season. My excitement for the new episodes decreased and decreased even more and for the end of the anime, it all went downhill.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nWatch it when you have time to kill. When you want to watch a mecha anime but you don't want to weight yourself with a deep plot or with questions about the meaning of life. When you want to see a totally predictable fight. Or if you watched the first season and you thought you'd give it a try despite all of this.\\n\r\nDo it. You may even like it.",

            "content": "*****THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, albeit mild ones*****\r\n*****\r\n****\r\n***\r\n**\r\n*\r\nAldnoah.Zero 2nd Season was okay. About as okay as the first one.\r\nSo in the first episode, the main characters are reintroduced and a little recap plays, explaining how and why the characters are in the current positions. Once that's out of the way, the story runs forward.\r\nThe pacing in here is pretty 'meh'. Plots points are spaced out and built up enough to not seem contrived but only just. I can easily see how one would feel that it's too fast. As an example, one of the major side characters makes an extremely controversial declaration early on. Shortly after,another twist occurs. All the little stories such as this are paced in a similar fashion. They are introduced then tied up soon after, before the plot point can properly establish their significance to the characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, there are more battles against the Aldnoah-powered Martian mechs compared to the first one. Each presents a unique physics problem for the Earth protagonist, Inaho, to solve. Seriously though, he's the only one that really matters in these fights, everyone else is fodder, albeit less dumb than in the first season. These fights, for me at least, are the main draw of the show, so more is good. In these, whether Martians or Earth(lings?), I find myself rooting for whichever side the protagonist is on. This makes for an interesting internal conflict in me when both protagonists, Slaine and Inaho, are in the same battle. Except the last battle, that one didn't feel exciting enough for a final showdown.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is pretty much non-existent here. No one's personality changes and no one takes an out-of-character action that changes your opinion of them. The Martian protagonist, Slaine, may be considered to have character development if you watched the first season but even then, it isn't explained WHY and HOW anywhere. It just... happens. One other possible character development involves Inaho, in the last episode, and even then, Inaho himself isn't the one doing the developing. And it's not as if you didn't already know that part of his character...\\n\\n\r\nIt's evident that the anime is trying to be something great, with plot twists that could have been powerful and the fact that protagonists are on opposing sides but it falls flat and ends up with a lacklustre story with lacklustre characters.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I was able to somewhat push these problems out of my mind so they didn't reduce my enjoyment much despite my gripes with it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, it's kinda good; shiny robots with shiny bullets, robots zooming about, robots exploding. Nothing terrible, nothing really noteworthy. Just good overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is okay. Unfortunately, no especially booming, epic music to go with the finale or fights in general, unlike the first season with portions of \"aLIEz\", the ending song of said season. Instead, it's remixes of \"aLIEz\" and another song that didn't evoke excitement and was just kind of sat in the background.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show tries to be something great but is unable to live up to its ambitions. I DID enjoy watching, if only to find out whether it gets better. The unique Martian mechs are where the fun is at, each being something of a scientific puzzle which, as one who likes physics, I quite enjoyed. If it weren't for that, the score I'm giving would be 1 point lower.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, I dislike how the ending song is high-powered and fast in the first 10 seconds then suddenly relaxes. Those 10 seconds were literally (not exaggerating) the only part of the song I like.",

            "content": "Aldnoah.Zero is one of the most popular mecha anime that was released during the late 2014. It was able to catch the interest of many anime consumers due to its cast. Like come on, who would not like to watch an anime that was created by Gen Urobuchi with his signature nihilistic themes and tragic characters? The series was also able to gain popularity because of its \u201cuniqueness\u201d. It is not like the other mecha animes where the main protagonist pilots a state of the art powerful mecha and fighting against less advanced mechas. This story is about a less advanced mecha fighting very powerfuland super advanced mechas. Something like the opposite of Gundam. It is also unique because it does not focus on a single character but two characters, who are both equally the main protagonist but they fight in opposite sides. This makes the anime a lot more interesting to watch especially watching how all the characters interact with each other.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story of the 2nd Season of Aldnoah.Zero is the direct continuation of the first season of Aldnoah.Zero. It takes place about 19 months after the Earth Federation\u2019s victory against the Vers Empire on Earth. Since the battle on Earth has ended, most of the battles are now being performed in space. Yes, the war between Vers Empire and Earth Federation is still ongoing. In the story, Slaine has now become a knight for the Vers Empire working directly with Count Saazbaum. He is also now the pilot of the Kataphrakt Tharsis and is using it to defeat the Earth Federation. Inaho is also back and is fighting for the Earth Federation with his valuable skills in defeating the Martians. The story also give a lot of time with these characters such as their plans and their interactions with each other. \\n\r\nNew characters are also introduced as the story progresses such as the other princesses of the Vers Empire. In the beginning, the story is decently paced so it is unlikely that one would be able to lose interest in the series very quickly. It won\u2019t bore you to death.\\n\r\nHowever, the problem that I have for the series is that it could be too fast or too sudden which makes the series less emotionally impacting. Due to the fast speed, things that should have been emotional are not as emotional as it should be. The last few episodes was also very rushed like they just tried to fit something that could have taken at least four episodes long into one single episode. This problem is actually what made me give a lower rating for this anime even though I enjoyed it nearly from beginning to the near end.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is exactly the same as the first season of Aldnoah.Zero but with greater amount of fluid fight scenes. The movements and fights appears to be a lot more fluid than the first season but this is probably due to the fights are now often being performed in space so there is a lot less restrictions in movements. However, the CG is still as impressive as the first season and would always make you want to see more of the action.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound in this series is as fantastic and exciting as the first season. The music being played during the battles and fight scenes would get you pumped up and makes you want to watch more. It was also very well placed such as putting the right song in a battle scene or in an interaction scene. \\n\r\nThe opening was also amazing due to it being able to catch the emotions of the two main protagonists very well and how they are affected due to their losses. It is one those few anime openings that I could watch over 5 times without getting tired of it. The ending song aLIEz was also really catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe second season of Aldnoah.Zero has all the main characters from the first season. All the characters remain relatively the same in the beginning of the anime such as their personalities. They all have their own different personalities as the first season which might be better because it does help balance the ideologies in the series. However, the thing that the second season has that the first season did not was character development. Well, more on Slaine's side. Inaho only had extremely little character development. However, you could now see the main characters such as Slaine and Inaho changing very slowly as the series progresses. Inaho is becoming more emotionally responsive while Slaine is becoming more ruthless and cunning. One thing I enjoyed about the first and second season of Aldnoah.Zero is that you really feel for the characters (except Inaho), even the minor ones (except Rayet). The characters that you might hate in the first season, you might like them in the second season because a different side of them are now being expressed such as some of them are fighting to avenge their loved one or trying to protect the people that they care for.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\nI must say, I enjoyed watching this anime especially since I enjoyed watching the first season as well. However, the ending was a very big disappointment. As I said before, I found it too rushed during the final episode of the series as well as I didn\u2019t really enjoy the ending based on my personal preferences. It appeared very forced but that is only my opinion. Other than that, I recommend watching this anime.\\n",

            "content": "I really like season 1, it's an really good show. But like other said, just don't waste time and don't watch season 2, because Aldnoah Zero should stop at the end of season 1. If you want to look for something way more good but like AZ, look at Suisei No Gargantia.\r\nI can't explain without spoilers, so my review will be in two parts, second with spoilers.\r\nStory : \r\nWell, it's quite the same thing as season 1, it's interesting but not very original, i don't have much to say about it except that season 1 is likely identical and it's a fair enjoyment, but notgreat because of the main character, more on that later.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : \\n\\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of CGI, but i'm not totally against it, AZ have a great animation, with some very dynamic mecha fights. But it can be too unreadable sometimes. backgrounds are good and overrall it's looking great. \\n\\n\r\nSound : \\n\\n\r\nAZ have those incredibly beautiful songs that fulfill perfectly their job at making scenes epic af. \\n\r\nI don't have much to say about it. It's great and identical to season 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : \\n\\n\r\nLet's face it... Slaine and Inaho are the worst characters of all time. \\n\\n\r\nInaho first, he's a young man, very calm, obstinate, too intelligent AND skilled in fights. I seriously hate him, because he's just too strong compared to the others, goddamnit it's just the brother of the most normal soldier of all time, except that his sister does have a better background than him, and a better chara-design too, and everything !\\n\\n\r\nSlaine is... Uh just a reason to have season 2, that's all, he is just hateful. \\n\\n\r\nRayet and Inoko are better characters than those two guys, even if Rayet and Inoko are that kind of classic characters ! But they fill the story perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\\n\r\nIt's good to watch, but when you don't have something more interesting to see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : So, AZ Season should not exist, it's good when you just want to see some giant robots fighting each other, but that's all, and there are a lot of shows that are significantly better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you read after this, you'll see spoiler, take care.\\n\\n\r\n====================SPOILER==SPOILER==SPOILER==================\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about some characters that i pointed out the issues previously.\\n\\n\r\nInaho, this \"best genius of all time\", he should not be in this season. Why ? \\n\\n\r\nBecause in the end of season one, he's been killed, like Asseylum. Season 2 could have been way better with him dead, following the war in the eyes of Inoko, or Rayet for example, to see how they manage Inaho's death. Inaho were already a genius, but they had to him a computer in his eyes, because \"WE HAVE TRANSHUMANISM GO CHECK THIS OUT WE ARE SO ORIGINAL\", hell no. It's just more annoying to follow him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat's the main reason that AZ is a mess, and you should not watch it.After we have all of this :\\n\\n\r\n-Lemrina hime is a good character but completely messed up because of Asseylum Hime, she should be dead for this season too. Lemrina Hime is a girl that really loves Slaine, and that's a good story, but Asseylum should be a ghost that avoids Slaine to fall in love with her, not a girl falling asleep waiting her episode to wake up.\\n\r\n-Fights are just Inaho beating some guys with his skills that are incredible, and it's boring, when there's a fight you just wait to see how he will save others even if he's not there. It's okay it's the main character, but here he can just fight them alone with his excessive skills and intelligence.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this, don't waste your time.\\n",

            "content": "Aldnoah Zero season 2 begun exactly where the season 1 ended. I must admit that I loved season 1 of this anime and I had great expectations for the second season. After I finished the whole second season I begun to have different thoughts about it.\r\nFirstly, I don't really know if it was good or not. I think the anime should just stop on season one. Seriously, I think that anime makers had no ideas for the second season so they just made the second season on spontan.\r\nSecondly, I'm trying not to spoil anything, but I didn't like the Slaine's change. Like what the hellhappened to him? I understand that he was jelous, but he didn't need to do things he did. As well as I didn't understand this Inaho eye thing. Like I have so many questions about the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the only 10 I would give the second season is the characters. Okay I know that I said that I didn't like some changes in the characters, but I must admit that they're feelings and thoughts were very well made. In my opinion the best character in this series is Princess Asseylum. She is the only one that I think that did not change.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I can say that season 2 wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. The first season is definetly better than the second. I can say that you can watch the second season but don't have too big expectations for it. I recommend to stop watching it on the first seasom\\n",

            "content": "You know what makes Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season and Guilty Crown similar? Both shows have two characters that I liked do a complete 180 just because.....reasons. Which in turn completely ruined both of their characters. \r\nBUT...\r\nThat's one of the many reasons why I completely hated the 2nd Season of Aldnoah.Zero and this is coming from a guy who enjoyed the 1st Season. \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (2/10)\r\n\"People die if they are killed\"\r\nAppearantly, that's not the case for Aldnoah.Zero II. The first season of Aldnoah.Zero ended with one of the most shocking and disappointing cliffhangers I've ever seen. At that point, I thought tomyself \"How would they proceed with 2 main characters now dead?\". There's a part of me that made me believe they would be revived in some sort of way but another half of me made me believe that's BS because they would never do it......Except they did. I'll get to that later and for now I'll talk about the so called \"war story\" in Season 2.  \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I have no more idea what the 2nd Season is trying to tell. I feel like the story that they were trying to tell in Season 1 (The war between the Terrans and Martians) just diminished here in Season 2. The war story is still there but to me, it's a ridiculous war story that I would rather not take seriously anymore. So basically, the 1st Season ended where the war \"finally ended\" between the two races. Oho, but it turns out the war has re-ignited once again because of Slaine's sudden thirst for power and his twisted vision of bringing the Princess' vision of peace, or in other words \"to stop the fighting\", by completely eliminating the Terrans. Now, that's how you ruin a good (but not perfect) character. What in the mother of shit were the writers smoking? Seriously, for a character like Slaine, his vision just doesn't make fucking sense and seems like an asspull just so they can turn him into an antagonist.  \\n\\n\r\nWait a minute! Slaine's views does make sense! It's because of a weird ass love triangle going on between Slaine, The Princess, and Inaho. Slaine got jealous, he got mad at Inaho and he re-ignited a war between the two races just so he can kill Inaho and get the Princess all to himself and at the same time, achieve her vision.......Give me a fucking break. A war started for the 3rd time because of some guy who wanted the Princess' fucking pussy?! This is the absolute reason why I can't take Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season's story seriously. What started out as a dark and serious war story ended up as a fucking joke of a war story. I mean, just compare this show's story to Saving Private Ryan's story and you'll see how much of a joke this shit show is. Haha, \"shit show\"..A term I don't use often because it's rare for me to hate a show. \\n\\n\r\nYou can tell the writers were getting super lazy for this season when they decided to resolve all of the character's sub-plot points during the the 2 year timeskip. Rayet got over her father's death off-screen, the Lieutenant's PTSD doesn't seem to be an issue for him anymore and etc. Like what the shit?! What kind of a lazy character development is that? I wanted to see it on-screen and not during the time skip. Since they decided to do it during the time skip, they should have provided flashbacks on how or what they did to solve said problems. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe animation looks exactly the same as the first season so I'll give it the same rating. My opinion on Art, Visuals, Character Designs, Mecha Designs stays the same because I didn't really see any changes.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIt pretty sad how bad shows gets all the great soundtrack these days. I mean, I'm watching a show right now that's considered a masterpiece by many and the soundtrack is just absolutely bad. Even the OP and ED theme song for that show is bad. However, for this show, both the soundtrack and the OP/ED theme songs are great. I'm also still loving those goosebumps-inducing insert songs by Sawano. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is  &Z\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki and the ED theme song is \"Genesis\" by Eir Aoi. I'm actually bummed out that Kalafina didn't come back for the 2nd OP but Sawano did a good job on the 2nd OP. Though, I would have highly preferred if Kalafina came back. For the ED theme song, I just don't like it. Well, in general...I just don't like Eir Aoi and her songs. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (2/10)\\n\r\nEvery character that died in the Season 1 finale somehow f*cking lived in this season for whatever reason. Inaho, who got shot in the head and in the chest multiple times lived. Like tell me in what universe would a person survive after being shot in the f*cking head and in the chest multiple times? What's worse is when Inaho got shot in the head, it benefited him. He got this bad-ass bionic eye that made him even more overpowered than before. Now, he doesn't need to come up with tactics because his eye will literally do it for him. What in the hell have they done with Inaho? His personality is as boring as a rock and yet the gods of fortune are on his side and making sure he fucking lives no matter the outcome of the situation  \\n\\n\r\nSwitching to other characters who survived was the Princess. Though, her revival is a bit more believable since the Martians are a technologically advanced race so I wasn't really surprised that they managed to revive her. Speaking of revival, what's her purpose in the show? The Princess to me is more of a plot device. She doesn't develop any further..In fact, I don't think she received any character development at all. She's just there because....she's pretty much just a tool being used to advance the plot. Nothing more, nothing less.  There's also that red guy who lived after being back-stabbed by Slaine. Turns out Slaine spared his life because he has other ulterior motives.  \\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, every main characters/antagonist that we know lived to fight another day. What kind of a fucking war story is this shit? I have watched many war movies/TV shows and this is literally the first show I have seen where none of the main characters died. Only the characters who aren't really important to the show died. All this talk about the \"horrors of war\" in the show is just pure BS because I didn't see any. Also, what was the purpose of that shocking cliffhanger at the end of the 1st Season? \\n\\n\r\nThere's one more character that I haven't talked about and that's Lemrina Vers Envers. She's the Princess' half sister and I thought she was going to be a good character but that didn't happen. She's just your typical jealous younger sister and whines all the time like why her sister is more successful than her and why her sister gets everything while she doesn't. I wouldn't have cared about Lemrina's cliched personality but it's just poorly executed. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (5/10)\\n\r\nMy experience in watching Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is like watching a Michael Bay film. It's got great action and full of explosions but the story and the characters are just terribly written. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nAldnoah.Zero 2nd Season was just downright terrible. I really wanted to like the 2nd Season because I actually liked the first season but the writing is terrible, plus they ruined Slaine's character. The portrayal of war is a fucking joke and they decided to make Inaho more overpowered by giving him a bionic eye and making the other pilots of the Kataphrakt stupid just to make Inaho look like a smart tactician. The story, compared to the first season, was also terrible and this is because they decided to focus on the stupid love triangle which started the 3rd war. If you love or enjoyed the 1st Season then I don't recommend that you watch the 2nd Season.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (4/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\n+Awesome Action Scenes\\n\r\n+Awesome Mecha Fight Scenes\\n\r\n+Soundtrack + the insert songs are amazing\\n\r\n+Great Visuals and Animation\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Story is even more worse than the 1st Season\\n\r\n-Characters that died in the 1st Season somehow lived\\n\r\n-Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season's new war story is an absolute joke\\n\r\n-Stupid Love Triangle\\n\r\n-The show ruined Slaine's character\\n\r\n-Mediocre ending to the series",

            "content": "Such a problem child...that goes for both this anime and its love-him-or-hate-him anti-hero. Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first.\r\nThe plot has more howlers than a werewolves convention. The Martian war effort is enfeebled by the demands of the plot from start to finish. Putting the female lead on ice for a third of the series is not the way to develop character. Inaho's character is somewhat strikingly presented, but developed so little from season 1 that he really should have died back then. Even getting a portion of his brain removed doesn't slow him down! Supporting character might as well bedead, or very nearly, for the role they take in overcoming problems.\\n\\n\r\n The resolution of the war is maddeningly unsatisfying. If a war in which millions have died could ever be ended by a speech and a marriage, such things should not be, for the sake of human dignity. While convincing explanations can be contrived for most of the plot developments, as for Inaho's repeated victories, such things lean unsatisfyingly on the outlandish situations contrived by the writers. But as Kazuo Koike might have said, characters, characters, characters can still make such a frustrating story loved.\\n\\n\r\nGrand scale, of events, battles, and emotions, is the major draw of Aldnoah Zero, apart from the very decent score, and the unforgettable Byronic hero Slaine Troyard. Seriously. Making dreadful mistakes with noble but hopelessly flawed intentions is his tragedy; never giving up is his heroism; tragic anti-hero 101. Lelouch or Light Yagami never enthralled me like Slaine does, because his motives are nobler, his beginnings humbler, and he feels real pain and frustration as they never did. The thoughts behind his actions in season 2 are often quite an enigma, but discovery and retrospection are part of the story. The way events mould Slaine's character completely contrasts with Inaho's dead immobility. If only the writers had developed the grand events they conceived, rather than reducing an interplanetary war to a squabble between two boys. Slaine was such a human character and so gave the impression that he could accomplish anything, I could never think of him as a bad character, only badly used.\\n\\n\r\nLemrina deserves some credit as a strong, well-constructed character as well. Her ending, with no place for her on either Vers or Terra, was rather sad. Slaine's ending...I saw as a painful kind of redemption. But fans still talk about A/Z hell; despite the abysmal plot, the characters don't let go.",

            "content": "Hey guys,\r\nI hope this pro-con-review will be helpful to ppl who have and havent finished the second season so beware some general spoilers but dont expect too many.\r\nThis review was written after having read some other reviews and thus I am taking some things into account which I might not have realized otherwise.\r\n;;;WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS SHOW?;;;\r\nThe Second Season is just like the first season pretty much something for code geass fans but on a somewhat lower quantity and quality level. Its not just raw mecha brawling in case you might be afraid of that. Gen Urobuchi acted as director which usually makes the storytend towards the dramatic plotlines.\\n\r\nGenre tags might be: \\n\r\npolitical, action, mecha, sci-fi,drama\\n\\n\\n\r\n;;;NOTABLE THINGS ABOUT THE PLOT;;;\\n\r\n- The second season of AZ sadly starts off with a totally random beginning that contrasts the ending of the first season a lot which is my biggest problem (and that of a whole lot other people ;P ) with the whole aldnoah.zero anime. The rest of the story is rather consequent.\\n\r\n- The story of AZ2 pretty much centers around Slaine Troyard going on a political rampage just as badly as he got pushed around in season 1.\\n\r\n- The director Gen Urobuchi did not excert his hobby too much. (Which is something like killing people in unexpected situations)\\n\\n\r\n;;;MY OPINION;;;\\n\r\nI really loved the first season. And I guess that influences this review a bit.\\n\r\nBut one straight sentence right off: The main character Inaho and the start of the second season are trash.\\n\r\nI've gotten permission from ModeratelyHuman to quote him cause I couldn't have gotten the message about Inaho more on point than he did when he was rating the characters. \\n\r\n\"9/10 Inaho's robot eye. A new character. Yes. The eye has its own character. Yes. THE EYE GETS MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN INAHO HIMSELF. At first the eye is nothing but a tool, but then it starts taking over parts of Inaho's brain and becomes its own thinking entity. It even starts chatting up the princess while Inaho was unconscious. Look at that development. Oh yea. Such character. \"\\n\r\nDespite a lack in character personality details in generell, a lack in dynamic characters, the story sometimes being predictable, using many generic characters and a really shitty start off for the second season I still enjoyed the show a lot.\\n\r\nWhy? Because aside from lacking a lot of things the core elements are well refined. It has a consistent flow (except season 2 start) of the story with changes and betrayels being well introduced and happening not happening in seconds.\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. The soundtrack is awesome.\\n\r\nSlaine aside with his detailed and dynamic personality the rest of the static cast do complement each other rather well. Many characters (especially those form mars) in this anime do not act only because they have to but rather because they want to. They have values they are fighting and arguing for. Some of them go down still believing they died for the right thing. Which takes a lot of devotion. A character trait that isn't so prominent nowadays. (Most popular trait in our age seems to be envy which I am sick of.) And one thing is very important in my opinion: A character does not have to be dynamic to be beautiful. Im refering to characters like Count Saazbaum, Count Crutheo, Asseylum, Lemrina, Marito, Magbaredge and maybe some others. Just mentioning that being dynamic is not about overcoming some trials be they in your mind or real, but its more about the ability to change perspective. \\n\r\nAll of them together form a beautiful environment for a well made story wich is underlined by great art and really awesome music.\\n\\n\r\n;;;TO-SUM-IT-UP;;;\\n\r\nIf u can get past Inaho, the start of the second season and you prefer devote characters over envious ones than u will love the show.\\n\\n\r\nCredits to ModeratelyHuman for the quote and I recommend to take a look at his review which has more depth but more spoilers. Its a really nice read.\\n\r\nIf you've come this far I thank you for taking your time to read and be my guest to tell me what you think about AZ+AZ2.",

Kaizuka's older sister keeps saying he shouldn't be fighting despite the fact he's the only reason they're winning any battles at all.\r\nGreat way to kill 3 hours if you have nothing else on your list. Makes forgood background noise and pretty battle scenes with cool mechs. Not overly interesting and you don't have to worry about missing anything. Trust me, you will NEVER hit the rewind button during this series.",

            "content": "My review is about the entire anime. I didn't plan to watch it at first because I'm not a great fan of mechas. But since its debuts it received good critiques, and I wanted to know why.\r\nStory : 6/10\r\nThere were good ideas. A conflict between the Earth and the Vers Empire, the power of Aldnoah, etc... but sometimes I really felt like watching Code Geass. There were some similitudes between the main characters of both series, but also by the way that season 2 could have been better, instead of being really bad and poorly written. Moreover, I think it would have been better withoutthe emphasizing of the relationship between Inaho, Slaine and Asseylum. The anime should have been more centered on war, politics and action instead of a ridiculous triangle between the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 3/10\\n\r\nAs I started watching episode one, I felt disappointed. They started to present one of the main character : Asseylum Vers Allusia, the princess, and immediately I disliked her because she's the typical naive girl that doesn't know what's going on outside. And during the show, I felt like she wants to achieve peace without taking care of the ideals of the two sides, while she is supposed to be kind and gentle. For me she was empty. Her character doesn't evolve, neither for Inaho. Indeed he's smart, his actions were sometimes really good, but he doesn't show any emotions... My favorite one is Slaine, because although he did bad things, he's the only one to have evolved and to have been well-written. I think he doesn't deserve this kind of end. Asseylum receives all the merits although she did nothing since the start. \\n\r\nThe other characters could have been great but they weren't well-developped (such as Inko, Yuki...) and I wanted to see Marito in action more often, instead of Inaho. As the story progresses, different protagonists appear but I didn't find them interesting. Lemrina could have been a better character but for me it just looked like the writters created her to put someone on Slaine's side and to say \"Her sister Asseylum is better because she's nice\". Moreover, her design is not very pretty... I felt sorry for her.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 4/10\\n\r\nMany people says that the art in this anime is great, and I don't agree because I actually disliked it. The chara-design is too simple and looks like those on \"moe animes\". It doesn't match with the serious aspects of the series, and because of its simplicity, I wasn't caught by the different emotions shawn by the characters. Background and mecha designs were correct but I really disliked the chara-design.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\r\nThe best part of the anime. It's one of the main points that made me watch Aldnoah.Zero. I really like the first opening by Kalafina, but mainly the original soundtrack composed by master Hiroyuki Sawano. \"BRE@TH//LESS\" and the ending \"aLIEz\" are my favorites. The problem is that I found the music too great for this kind of anime. They were epic, but the actions were not.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I didn't really enjoy the show. It isn't one of the worst anime I've seen, but it could have been better, especially if Asseylum was not there, or if she wasn' too naive, and also if the story was better, and more interesting.",

It was minor but I think it is worth mentioning there was something I liked a bit less but couldn't put my finger it on. I knew it was either with the story or characters. It was not with the story. It was actually very well thought out and they did not force anything to make more money. They set out what they intended to do and did exactly that. It concluded in a way that was pretty satisfying in all honesty and I left content with the story altogether.\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nSame as season 1 review. It was great. The space battles were amazing to watch as well so it was an added bonus.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAgain same as season 1 review. It was really good all around. I didn't pay as much attention this season though being honest. I do think it was good though. Still flowed pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI'm a little Bias towards how it ends for one of the characters. To save confusion it is not Slane. Anyway yeah just a little salty over it.

            "content": "Intro\r\n\tThere were times where I don\u2019t really care about analytical way of seeing anime, and just watch them mindlessly. Yes, it is when I just came to this hobby. At that times, every single anime is actually stood out to me and I could pretty much talk about how good they are.\r\n\tNow its been roughly 6 years since I started, yes I am still new but there is one thing that have been bothering me since years ago, and that was Aldnoah.Zero. Honestly speaking, like any other anime on my early days, Aldnoah.Zero got a pretty high rank from me, but not to everybody else.Why? That is the question that I wanted to asked and I am here after I watch it few more time and oh boi I was wrong. So, without further ado, LETSGO!\\n\r\nStory + Character\\n\r\n\tIn the beginning of the series, humanity has divided into 2, the Terrans, humans that lived on earth, and Martians, humans that lived on Mars. This words is literally everywhere on the series like its forgetting the word \u201chuman\u201d and just go racist. Anyway, Martians lived on Mars due to the discovery of Aldnoah which literally fuel up everything. This makes them dissociate themselves from the Terrans. Even though that Aldnoah fuels up everything, resource in Mars is limited, so they invaded earth in search for resource (why the hell they didn\u2019t think about that in the first place? HMM). Coming long way from Mars, they bring their mechs or Kathaprakt, and their flying castle with them.\\n\r\n\tOn earth, humanity- I mean Terrans has developed their own kathaprakt after seeing them in the first war (which failed due to certain reason) but it lack of power due to fact that they don\u2019t have aldnoah.\\n\r\n\tThe premise is actually really good and the first episode will likely leave a strong impression on your mind. But things went downhill from that point. I\u2019ll get to the character first before going back to this.\\n\r\n\tThe characters are pretty much predictable, our main protagonist (which still in highscool), and his friends, the Princess of Vers (yes, im aware of spoiler so chill guys), and our main antagonist, any other character is poorly made (except Lt. Marito which is really good in season 1) to the fact that we dont and the story don\u2019t care about them anymore in the second cour. To make it simple ill introduce the mains as these: Bland-oversmart main character, too-plain Princess, and what-is-in-his-mind antagonist. I know justifying their character as that is horribly but like I said, to make it simple (and it hurts your hearts if you overthink about them).\\n\r\n\tNow back again to the main problems, the story has this particular way of telling which part is the main focus of now, not by following the \u201cplot\u201d, not by resolving around the main character, but the story resolve around the Princess. Some may think that the story changes a lot from season 1 to season 2 (which it is), but it\u2019s not random, it\u2019s just because of this not-so-popular formula.\\n\r\n\tThat and the fact that none of the main leads have a believable reason to develop their character is already enough to turn down this series. And I guess that is what happened.\\n\r\nAnimation + Music\\n\r\n\tAldnoah.Zero was a collaboration project of A-1 Pictures and TROYCA. The collab is actually good due the fact that TROYCA can cover what A-1 Pictures lack of: maintaining quality. That is why we got some solid animation throughout the season, heck even throuthout the series.\\n\r\n\tThe down side of the production is actually the use of BAD CG (INPUT GIGGUK sound) yes Gigguk, Bad CG. The use of CG is pretty much the same as Initial D. For tou who doenst know about Initial D, I mean that it is pretty bad. I guess it\u2019s the only thing that is good from second season, the fact that we don\u2019t really see the mech (In the space) so we didn\u2019t really bothered with it.\t\\n\r\n\tAldnoah.Zero has 2 famous composers on its back. Kajiura Yuki and Sawano Hiroyuki. Which is I don\u2019t know why but has much downside that the good side. The thing is that we cant have 2 primary color in a single anime. That\u2019s why the first season\u2019s OP and ED feels don\u2019t match. I appreciate the decision of letting Kajiura Yuki go and went full Sawano for the second season, even though that it\u2019s decent, but it has it\u2019s own colour.\\n\r\nWrap Up\\n\r\n\tSo in the end, it turns out that there is so many downside of the series. But even so, I still enjoy the times rewatching it for this review. I don\u2019t actually sure why, but I guess I just weak for main protagonist that smartly use his brain to win a fight. The first season, is actually quite enjoyable overall with pretty good climax. But things gotten worst in the second season thus the first season\u2019s climax feels not believable, which led to my biggest disappointment of all. Oh and by the way, Aliez is the only track that I listen to recently, and is the strongest that reminds me of this series.\\n\r\n\tSo I bring you Aldnoah.Zero with the final rank of B that it\u2019s up to you to watch it or not, but it has the \u201cgive it a try of your own\u201d from me. As for three of recommendations I give you, Tengen Toppa Guren Lagann, the obvious ones but I need to recommend it because Guren Lagann is the one that teaches me what is Mech anime and what it is to be a man, then I suggest you Darling in the FRANXX for some real character development, it is not finished yet but I have a strong faith in it, and lastly Heavy Object, it is written by my favorte light novel writer and the main protagonist also use his brain to save the day.",

            "content": "The series began really well with the Earth at total War with its former Martian colony and the ending of the first season was rather well done with an all out western style shootout. But the Second Season was brought back characters who should in all honesty have died for the sake of making a more compelling story. And the whole war in the second season suddenly took a whole new dimension in space which was never covered in the first season. The battles were rushed with one sided victory's to the protagonist characters, incompetent average joe pilots and the ending overall disappointing. \r\nI mean,after a whole genocidal campaign by the Martains, one would realistically be hard pressed to have the Terrans forgive them. But no, all its fine and dandy with the final leader of the \"Bad Guys\" Slaine being killed as an identity and secretly put in jail for life. While Slaines punishment is fitting for all the death and destruction he was responsible for, its a sad end to the character nevertheless, whos actions were all mostly selfless acts to help his beloved princess who is walking free and happy having done almost nothing but cause this whole mess in the first place \\n\\n\r\nWhile the character development of Slaine seemed completely odd, in hindsight it makes the most sense, in that the one and only person he cares for is the reason behind all his actions in the series. All his suffering, struggles and conflicts for the one person he cares about, only to realise that was not what she wanted and carrying on anyways because that is the only way he knows how to move forward. \\n\\n\r\nThe human actions and thought processes of Slaine, the very trait least associated with the technologically advanced Martians is in stark contrast to the robotic and logical thinking of Inaho, who is supposed to represent the raw humanity of Earth. Basically Inaho serves as a foil for Slaine, yet the contrast between the two and the factions they fight for is a redeeming part of the series, and Slaines development as a person is what boosts the character development score.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime itself was decent, the storyline terrible, but the character of Slaine and the contrast between him and is arc nemesis Inaho redeemed the series despite its rushed nature.",

If you are reading this and have not watched season2 then you may consider not watching season 2 and leave at the best point.\r\nBEWARE THERE ARE SPOILERS FROM NOW ON.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThere is an idiot blonde girl crying for peace in the universe, there are two boys fighting for the girl. At the end a third gentleman gets the girl. \r\nART:\r\nApart from sometimes I could not recognise which unit is fighting who there are no problems. Thanks god we have orange mecha so we can see if the bionic eyed boy dies or not... (unfortunately he does not.)\r\nSOUND:\r\nGood.\r\nCHARACTER:\r\nThe topcharacters are all idiots; the other characters have no depth other than Marito which plays nearly no important part in the series.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a bionic eye super machine as new character which can see all and know all with the terran technology. It even talks to the princess idiot and takes commands from her. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have a new princess; Lemrina who loves Slaine and does whatever he asks for. They should have married and it would be a better finale. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI would happily watch more orbital knight vs terran action rather than this season2. It would be better even Slaine dies in a heroic fashion or escaped with Lemrina to Vers... \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is total dissapointment for me as I would like to see Slaine achieve his goals.\\n\\n\r\nNeverthless thanks for all who has participated in making of this series.",

            "content": "After a mediocre at best Season 1, the makers of Aldnoah were given a chance to start over fresh off a dark and gritty ending. Or they can just say \"Screw it!\", take a mulligan, and turn this into an okay space drama for Season 2. Sorry, gotta include some spoilers...\r\nThe story takes place about a year or so after the events of Season 1. Inaho didn't let that gunshot to the head slow him down one bit as he has gone from emotionless and robotic to a full blown cyborg, Princess Asseylum is now the universe's prettiest pickle, and Slaine is now Frank Underwood-inghis way up the Imperial ranks. All while we get the one-note themed bad guy mechs from Season 1. There's ice guy, sandstorm guy, invisible guy, lightning guy, laser guy, multi-form guy, collect them all! Each provides a moment of sweet, sweet, 'splosion porn amidst a plot that is now assembled of pieces of other, superior, mech shows. \\n\\n\r\nI'd be remiss if I didn't admit, on at least 2 or 3 occasions, I said out loud, \"That's from this Gundam series!\" or \"Borrowing from Code Geass, are we?\" The whole show just feels old hat. The art suffers from blandness due to the boring use of CG for all the mechs that appear, no once do I remember a shot of them being hand-drawn. They have no beauty. They're just... there. They're not even original anymore! The \"Herschel\" suit is just Char Aznable's Sazabi from \"Char's Counterattack\" with some odds and ends changed! If you're gonna bring that suit in, at least bring Char with it, his presence would have greatly helped this series! \\n\\n\r\nSorry, I was ranting... So, why after all that do I give it a 6? Because, honestly, it kept me watching. I wasn't excited for each episode, but I was curious. Sub vs. Dub is a win for Sub, but I will note improvement for the English cast. To wrap this up, if you're in the mood for a mech drama in space, give \"Aldnoah.Zero\" a shot. It's everything you've seen before, done over again. And for some fans that's enough. Hope you enjoy it more than I did. 6/10 and I'm being generous. Check it out. Cheers!",

            "content": "Being upfront, I came into this series with poor expectations as-is, The title card on Hulu invoked Appleseed (The 2004 3D anime) and that had a story that sorta rubbed me the wrong way and Zone of Enders, that gainaxed mech combat game. but comparing it (seasons 1 and 2) to Zone of Enders, or even Appleseed was a mistake because that would have been a somewhat refreshing step away from abused norms, into some interesting graphics or at least combat that carried some weight behind it instead the show is a shameless clone with hardly a original idea in it's body. \r\nMost of themain plot is ripped various seasons of Gundam and its' spinoffs. The Martian humans' attack on Earth humanity, comes from the original Mobile Suit, and the special alien-made engines powering Suits which is debatable of having came from either 00 or Code Geass, the Deucalion's Season 1 design is basically the Egg Carrier from Sonic Adventures (see the bonus rant at the end), with everything else being a spoiler-laden mass robbery from Gundam Seed. The story had only 2 unique plot-points to really call it's own, the first in Season 1 with awesome nods to WW2, training highschool students to operate the latest military hardware in preparation for war, something any war history buff would squee at, and the second plot point being the sentient eye implant, both ultimately squandered being introduced and plot-relevant once and after 3 episodes never impacting the story again, which brings me to the animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe series' graphics leave something to be desired, oft notably dropping animation quality during 2D moments most notably while characters are emoting especially dramatically, dropping below the \"cinematic\" 24 frames standard in non-interactive entertainment (tested true by rewinding the scene where Princess' servant breaks out in tears and replaying it several times), and with the 3D models occasionally loosing focus to the backdrop during action-heavy scenes I can't say the show holds up visually. Audio doesn't hold up much better, character's lines don't always sound right as the Mic's condenser kicks in mid-line and they suddenly get quiet mid-emote with a few episodes outright sounding like the entire thing was recorded through a tin can.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series is kinda disappointing even though I went in with low expectations it failed to meet even those by blandly copying countless other shows and not doing any of it justice by being better in any way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBonus Rant:\\n\r\nI'm not usually the type to outright rip on or get VERY mad at something in Anime, but I can't let this pass, the series' Deucalion ship design (for the majority of season 1) is a Chinese knockoff of Dr. Gerald Robotnick (aka E.G.G.M.A.N.)'s Egg Carrier, taking off from being disguised in a heavily forested area, with diamond-shaped rear thrusters, the VERY distinct hull shapes designed to house the front and rear Beam Cannons with their distinctly placed and shaped shrouding perfectly intact, the fore-deck rising launchpads designed to aid in mass-deploying jets, the similarly designed deck cannons that break same when attacked, the only notable changes are that they slimmed down the overall shape to be more flat and reduced the enormous wings to a vestigial spoiler-like thing dangling haplessly off the back end. This annoyed me a TON and nobody seems to have noted the thinly veiled plagiarism it represents in their reviews. Shame on you Gen Urobuchi and Pinakes for stealing designs from the magnificent Doctor Robotnick, I won't let you get away with this! >:(",

But A-1 films decided that they should milk more out of the franchise and make the anime shit.  For people who wants to watch this season of Aldnoah, dont.  Watch season 1 and not this abomination of ananime.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story was fucking shit, people were too pussy to pull the trigger, pointing their gun at someone and not shooting cliche\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFucking marvelous, the art looks amazing and the animation in the fighting scenes are really well made.  The angles are quite nicely drawn as well and everything is quite in proportion (there isnt girls with huge tits, small body and eyes bigger than their mouth)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is one of the best ones ive ever heard from animes.  Hiroyuki Sawano's music are never bad.  The battle music and the OST are really good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll the characters are really well developed.  Except for Slaine, he is a massive fucking asshole and he deserves to be killed A LOT earlier.  Honestly the character development is quite good but then i just absolutely despise Slaine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe OP is really good,  ED is really good as well.  Just that people being too pussy to kill people really ruins this season.  Honestly if possible ill give enjoyment a solid 0 because it ruined season 1.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEverything is really well made, except for the plot where if people actually pulled the trigger the story can have a lot more plot twists eg the princess pretending to be Slaine etc.",

GO WATCH S1 AND S2...AND THEN READ THIS! Got it?......Good\r\nNow...this season is damn near universally HATED by many Aldnoah fans and anime fans in general for how much they fucked up after the ending to S1 of this series, sorta like Dragon Ball GT...and I can see why people would hate this, but I don't think people are looking at this from a different perspective.\r\nLooking at my score for thisshow, you're probably thinking I'm absolutely crazy for rating this show this high. This will be a more subjective review, so if you don't want to listen to me explain myself, that's perfectly fine; I have the highest respect for garbage men, and the work that they do. lol\\n\\n\r\nNow...The review...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nNow personally, I think that the story is more interesting than S1 of this show. This stems from the fact that the entire show focuses on Slaine himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason why I think this show is more interesting than S1 is because the story utilizes elements from the Tragedy of MacBeth which is actually cool, and when I was watching this show, I didn't realize it until I sat and thought about the story. His entire buildup across the season simulates MacBeth's rise to power, and he planned to keep going until he ruled over the entire army in order to make a paradise for Princess Asseylum, similar to how MacBeth wanted the throne for his own personal reasons.\\n\r\nHis eventual fall during the last episode was when it all clicked for me, this whole season was about the rise and fall of Slaine utilizing elements from MacBeth and when I realized that, I appreciated the direction they tried to take the show in, even though most people didn't like it.\\n\\n\r\nNow as amazing these concepts and elements are, the execution for most people was absolutely horrendous due to \"plot-holes\" and plot contrivances (not plot holes), stuff not making sense and Deus Ex Machina becoming more OP...even though Slaine was pretty OP himself; being able to counter Deus Ex Machina is an impressive feat and, this will make people hate me, IT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE! He's had more experience with the top mech users after the 19 month ceasefire in addition to having an ability to accurately predict where the fired shots are going, even with the \"wind\" in space (Now THAT makes no sense).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the overarching story is a letdown, but that's not the focus of the story; the story is focusing on Slaine and his entire character arc, which is a really interesting change in focus, although it wasn't executed very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Action: 8\\n\r\nThe art in this show is very similar to its predecessor, if not exactly the same. It's good no matter how you look at it. Low-key, some of the images for this show are absolutely beautiful. Look up some images if you have some spare time, it's really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is almost exactly the same as S1, which I found pleasing to look at, even though some of the CGI animation might not look like the best thing in the world. I'll give the animation a pass mainly because they're usually in motion, and when they're in motion, in combination with certain environmental effects, it looks good in my opinion\\n\\n\r\nThe action is just as fantastic as S1, possibly even better with the fights between Inaho and Slaine being the highlights in terms of action. That was some of the most intense action I've seen since I watched Hunter x Hunter. Those fights were actually intense, and I couldn't tell who was going to win between the two due to the both of them have Deus Ex Machina-type abilities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, great art, solid animation with the coolest fight scenes I've seen in a while.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI feel as if the OST in S2 is equally as impressive as S1. Usually the second season of an anime is either completely superior to S1 or disappointing; in this case, I think it's on equal ground with S1. As I always say, give it a listen, you won't regret it...I hope\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nHOLY SHIT! Slaine is one of the best characters in anime conceptually. His entire character arc was a fantastic idea, again, using elements from MacBeth which I found really interesting...except that the execution was a complete mess. Although, I will give the execution a pass to a certain extent. Some of the things that he says might be contradictory to his character, but I can somewhat forgive that due to his overall change in character as the show progresses. \\n\r\nOverall, he's my favorite character in this series and one of my favorite characters in all anime due to his progressive corruption and his character arc having elements of MacBeth which I appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nNow...the new addition to the series, Lemrina Vers Envers. She's a very interesting character with some interesting motivations and a more unique backstory compared to other characters in anime (at least in my opinion). Her views on her royal lineage, the way she views her sister, her own sense of worth, and knowing what her place is in the military is a very interesting thought process. It's something cool to think about.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are more or less the same except that the main character became Deus Ex Machina 2.0...that's it, no other character goes through a significant change in character or personality except for the ones I mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nNot gonna lie, I initially placed my enjoyment at a 5, but once I thought about the characters of this show and what the story actually was focusing on, this jumped up to a 7 immediately. All these ideas plus Lemrina Vers Envers' character motivation and thought process really got me thinking about that specific character which has only happened with Slaine within this show.\\n\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed this show for what it delivered; the action, the progression of Slaine and Lemrina Vers Envers' character motivation kept me thinking even to this day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThe story had a different focus, and it paid off for me personally. Art, action, animation, and OST are all fantastic on their own. The characters not that much impressive, but Slaine and Lemrina Vers Envers more than made up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is definitely underrated and people should give this show either a first watch or a second chance to look at this show with multiple perspectives.",

A few times it was actually sloppy it seemed, but for the most part was still good...just not on the same level as Season 1 was.  \r\nCharacters...well I like the characters for the most part but I blame the portions I don't like on story/writing.  The story was simply not as good in this one because many of the actions of the characters didn't make sense.  They felt forced, especially Slain.  Iwish they had stayed truer to how Season 1 felt...minus the last episode where things started to get questionable.  Then how they followed up and explained the final episode of season 1 in the first couple of episodes of season 2 just set the stage for a season that in no way could follow up to S1.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that had this been a standalone show, with no season 1, I may have rated it an 8.  As it is however, it is a bit of a let down after experiencing Season 1 and I admit I was a bit disappointment at how they shifted some of the characters and story, which is what left this as a 7 instead. \\n\\n\r\nStill a good and entertaining watch, but still had hoped for more after seeing S1, as it was truly great.",

            "content": "(((Spoiler Alert!)))\r\nNegative Aspects:\r\nLet\u2019s start with the plot holes\u2026\r\nThe start of the series was very good\u2026I actually liked the relationship between the Princess and Slaine and I was looking forward the whole series  to see him save the Princes\u2026but in the middle of the series things start to get crazy\u2026like ok , Slaine found out that she is alive , Slaine Tries  to join the princess , no problem until here\u2026Slaine helps Inaho to save the ship but gets betrayed by him. at that moment I was thinking like \u201c\u2026ok what the hell is wrong with you?! He\u2019s left his fellow comrades to helpyou , how can he hurt you? If you\u2019re afraid that he\u2019s a spy , just keep an eye on him and use him later , I know you\u2019re Smarter than this!\u2026and what the hell do you mean by \u201c use her for your own end?! \u201d \u201d\u2026\\n\r\nLet\u2019s pass away this one\u2026I have No problem with shooting Inaho but why did you first try to save Saazbaum from getting killed by Inaho? What would you accomplish by doing this? He\u2019s tried to kill your beloved Princess while Inaho is trying to protect her during the mission? then you didn\u2019t have to suffer for the Princess\u2019s Injury.\\n\r\nIn the second season Slaine got completely insane\u2026like you know that the Princess wants peace , so why are you trying to attack the earth after killing Saazbaum?  I mean you shouldn\u2019t  got that serious , just use the fake Princess to put an end to the war!...and why the hell did the Princess Married some random guy in her way? You can gain authority on him just by doing nothing!\\n\r\nPositive Aspects:\\n\r\nThere were a lot of this plot holes\u2026but let\u2019s be a bit positive , The Background Music was by Hiroyuki Sawano which worked on AOT and was Awesome , and changed my view on Mecha animes which I hated\u2026but  the overall action was great and the plot made me watch it to the end to see what happens next. it was actually kind of addicting. You would definitely like the Battles and the way Inaho finds his enemy weakpoints and how he defeats them. Also it\u2019s kind of Awesome seeing each side doing differend operations to stop their foe. It\u2019s not definitely a Masterpiece but was Entertaining and worth to watch\u2026\\n\r\nI would Recommend watching it\u2026\\n\\n",

            "content": "SEASON TWO; It's pretty much more of the same from season one except now we add the bratty princess with unrequited love for Slain. The villains are just as incompetent as season one, but it's still cool to watch them fall to Inaho. I learned to accept this incompetence as arrogance on the part of the Martians. But I'm here for the hot mech on mech action, not to be blown away with depth of story telling or multi layered character exploration. It's a show about giant robots battling one another, and you should expect too much more from it than that. So it delivers.Does it have it's flaws? YES! The fact that I could ignore them is proof that this is a quality series. But I'll also admit that I don't expect too much from the mecha genre.\\n",

            "content": "This has to be one of the most disappointing anime I have seen. I really enjoyed the first season because of Slaine's character and the plot twist I didn't expect. Also, it was a new story that I could get into. But in this second season, it took everything I loved about this character, threw it in my face, and gave it a happy ending to Inaho, which happens to be one of the blandest characters in most anime I've seen. If anything, I recommend watching the first season for its music, well animated scenes, and the development of Slaine and other side characters suchas Rayet and Cruhteo. I'm so disappointed; I wanted a lot more of this season. I gave it a 6 because I love Slaine as a character.",
