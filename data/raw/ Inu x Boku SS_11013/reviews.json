            "content": "A teenage girl struggling with her interpersonal skills; a loyal man struggling with his intrapersonal skills. Inu x Boku SS tells of the tale involving these two troubled persons. Over time, it is inevitable that one will change depending on his/her surroundings. The influences that come from peers and others are undoubtedly strong. To be able to thrive in such environments, one must be able to filter these influences and only be changed by those which they feel will benefit them. In the end, it is always others that do the shaping; one cannot merely wish to be transformed and have it happen. Whether thesechanges are good or bad is a whole different story. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nSoothing and calming visuals are few and far between. The light colors, the soft lighting, the detailed facial expressions of the characters - all these make for great artwork. Throw in some chibi drawings of the characters during the comedic scenes and the varying art styles are sure to impress viewers. Even the sparkles which are popular (and often overused) in sh\u014djo anime/manga were moderated such that they didn't feel overwhelming. On the sh\u014dnen side of things, the handful of battle scenes and transformations were animated smoothly as far as I could tell. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nFirst off, the supporting characters of the series, though unique and interesting, were a bit underdeveloped. However, the extensive character development of the two main characters made up for this. At first, the female protagonist, Shirakiin Ririchiyo, is your typical, sharp-tongued teenage girl who often unintentionally isolates herself from others. But as the series progresses, she slowly opens the door to her heart, accepting the warmth of those around her while trying to control her tongue. On the other hand, the male protagonist, Miketsukami S\u014dshi, is a self-despising and deceptive man who knows nothing about emotion and feelings. But, similar to Ririchiyo, he too changes drastically throughout the series. What's most heartwarming is that the two, although having totally different personalities, are actually the ones responsible for each other's development. Ririchiyo shows S\u014dshi the meaning of emotion and feelings while he proves to her that he will be by her side, no matter what, even if it means being verbally abused. Along with the other characters, the two end up transforming each other for the better, resulting in two solid characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe strong point of this category is the elite cast of seiy\u016bs that were part of the project. All of them did an excellent job in their respective roles, with no character having an unfitting voice. The OP was quite good as well - a fast-paced song with gradual progression in pitch. The downside of having multiple EDs is that only the good ones will be memorable. However, the ones used in this series were more or less unique so, even though they weren't exactly excellent material, they were somewhat memorable. BGM did its job well, with some of the pieces successfully standing tall on their own during dialogue-less scenes, while others set the mood well. \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, for the most part, the story was boring. Save for the first and last few episodes, the pace of one manga chapter per episode caused the story to be dragged out longer than necessary. Furthermore, the anime original fillers were fairly poor in terms of entertainment value. The first couple of episodes were tolerable given that they were used to introduce the characters and the plot. In the last couple of episodes is where the plot actually picks up from the first few episodes. Those two episodes alone would make for an easy 9/10 as they were both interesting and content-filled. However, with more bad than good, the story gets a 6/10 from me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nHaving read the manga prior to watching the anime, I can say that this was a faithful adaption with a couple of original episodes added in. I indulged more in the characters than in the story for the most part which, although not necessarily a bad thing, is slightly disappointing. To be honest, I wasn't quite satisfied with Inu x Boku SS. I felt like it could've been better if more chapters were to have been adapted. With that being said, the possibility of a season two, which I will anxiously wait for, is moderately high given the decent popularity of the show and the remaining non-animated source material. The good thing about Inu x Boku SS is that it has both sh\u014djo and sh\u014dnen elements so I would recommend it to virtually anyone looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy with interesting characters.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nWhen this anime first started airing recently I was unsure what it was going to be about. At the end of finishing this series, I still am unsure what this series qualify as. Inu x boku was supposedly a comedy story incorporating some supernatural and mysterious themes. However, it seems like the director changed their mind during the middle of the series.\r\nThe main plot follows around a young woman named Ririchiyo. Basically, she's a very delicate person, so delicate and shy that she can barely express herself. In fact, to the point where she almost expresses the opposite of what she meansevery time. Thus, she has no friends at school. But then one day she moves to a new environment where her lifestyle is replaced by supernatural beings. But that's all there really is \"supernatural\" about this series. Besides just the characters, nothing is distinctively different about inu x boku, than if you compare it to a cheesy school drama. Also, it can barely qualify as a \u00a0mystery because no suspense was really built throughout the series. This series was very slow paced in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the only unique part of this series. Ririchiyo along with some supporting characters have some very interesting conversations. And, with Ririchiyo's personality, it just makes it so much more fun to watch. The comedy included in the show was based mostly on the stupid conversations, thoughts, fantasies, or actions some character started. It will fit the taste of basically anyone with a sense of humor. But don't be fooled! There really is only one character development in this series. His name is soushi, and a servant of Ririchyo\"sama.\"Not very much is known about soushi except that he has a strange attraction to his master until the very last few episodes, and that is why I think the characters turned out a lot worse than they could of. This goes back to my point about the series being seriously paced; therefore making it an anime not everyone will like. But this anime is 12 episodes so it's not a big deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe artistic aspect of this series was probably the strongest. The producer made the characters with very cute designs, thus making the audience more connected to the characters. The delicacy put into Ririchiyo almost made it express her personality better. The music put into this anime was worth some efforts, and could be very favorable. But what I liked most about it was that they played it during some of the most appropriate scenes and it complemented very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe results of inu x boku was definitely unexpected than what it seems to be on the surface. Although not what I expected, which was a mysterious drama about the supernatural of some sort. This series still impressed me in the end concluding with a relationship I did not think would blossom in just one season. However, it was still very slow paced for that one season. So if you're looking for an anime with character developments, you may or may not like it.\\n\\n\r\n I will end it in this paragraph and keep this review short and clean. Because that's what this anime really was, a short and innocent story about our kind Ririchiyo and her adventure with her air-headed friends in the Ayakashi mansion. To be precise, that's exactly how this anime played out until the last few episodes, then it's all out surprises. If you're going to watch this series, do keep in mind the old cliched saying \"never judge a book until you're done reading the whole thing.\" But if inu x boku really was a book then I'm pretty sure it could be described as one of those trending books that becomes famous after its first publish, soon to be forgotten as the decade carries on.",

            "content": "Does a very good job on sticking with the manga. Luckily the manga is ahead so for those like me who have read the manga way before the anime was released you know how things turn out and you can focus on the artwork and seeing your favorite characters in motion :3\r\nStory: There really isn't a \"story\" per se. The manga is slowly picking up but as you can see from the first 11(?) episodes released currently it's mostly the main (what? 6-7 characters?) conversing with each other and little things between Ririchyo and Soushi. 7/10\r\nArt: Very Nice. Nice style to it. 10/10\r\nSound: The OPis beast. It just goes so well with the animation. If you don't understand then read/watch the show/manga and then re-watch the OP and tell me if you understand how it flows so well with the animation. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are nice. Loyal bodyguard who has a past with the protagonist, tsundere protagonist, friends, etc etc. Everyone is suprisingly nice. There are times when certain people seem like \"antagonists\" but there really is no \"bad guy\". 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's a light refreshing series to watch. I high ly recommend reading the manga thought since it has the anime + more. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy :) see you in my next review\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Apparently me stating that this review was created at the time of the eleventh episode, the fact that I put \"12 out of 12\" for the MAL version of when I wrote this is bothering certain people. I understand completely what these people are complaining about. Why should I be limited to 12 out 12? Why not give me 20+ out of 12. I have knowledge on the manga which surpasses the limits of the animes episodes. Therefore 12+ is all free game as stated above. It doesn't matter what happens in episode 12 or 50 for that matter. That's like reviewing a restaurant that you've been to before anyone else had the chance. I'm allowed to review it however I want. I've sampled the dishes before the general public.\\n\\n\r\nyou feelin me?\\n\\n\r\nENJOY THE SERIES.",

            "content": "Inu X Boku SS was one of those anime's i had seen around, or saw some tiny references to, but it never gave me any incentive to watch the anime and it seemed to me like it was one of those anime that focuses to much on fan service and comical stuff. That being said after having not a lot to watch i gave it ago. \r\nStory 7\r\nThe concept itself was ok, nothing special, your typical romcom anime. The story had a slow start, i didn't feel particularly pulled into the story until about episode 11 where Miketsukami past was revealed the episodes inbetween ifelt was purely fan service and it was there to make viewers laugh, and believe me it did =D. The ending i thought was pretty nice, although it did feel a bit rushed but it was quite heartwarming and im sure romance viewers will like it. But one thing that annoyed me was that episodes 3-10 was basically just introducing a bunch of characters, and Shirakiin being all like \"Oh i need to repay and thank Miketsukami\" and when it did happen Miketsukami was all like \"I don't deserve your thanks\"... what the fuck is up with that just accept her appreciation \\n\\n\r\nArt 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this wasn't bad for an anime that came out in 2012 its to be expected, i quite like some of the character design, Miketsukami fox form is pretty cool, so is Shirakiin's demon form or w/e she looked pretty kawaii. I absolutely Love the character design for Zange chan the bunny ears just works so god damn well, completely suits his personality and really draws out the comical moments from him. Renshou demon form is pretty jokes, his scroll look is pretty funny and provides quite a lot of priceless moments in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6\\n\\n\r\nThe OST wasn't anything special, although this isn't exactly an anime that really focuses on music, Each character had an opening and ending, which is pretty cool in my opinion, some of the voice actors was pretty good, Zange chan, Shirakiin's voice actor worked pretty well and really suited them. But this anime isn't really focused on the sound its more about the comedy it provides.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7 \\n\\n\r\nThere was a wide variety of different characters each with a personality that made this anime pretty funny, Shirakiin with her bad habit of being rude to others led to some rather comical moments, that coupled with Miketsukami, who is totally in love with her is quite funny. I loved the bits when she calls him a dog and he basically acts like one =P. I Love Zange chan personality, that sarcastic attitude yet trying to act nice and innocent is pretty jokes, and his \"Love\" is way to over the top, man his love for Miketsukami is jokes. Even though i like all the characters in Inu X Boku SS it seems that there is a major lack of character development, not much is said about some of the characters past, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of character development between some of the side characters and Shirakiin for example her relationship with Nobara isn't very developed considering shes one of the first side character Shirakiin meets. It seems that the only 2 character that got the most attention was Shirakiin and Miketsukami but i guess they are the main characters, the romance between them was pretty nice as well, i would've liked to see more about zange chan and the others, especially Sorinozuka and his past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, is one of those ones which is just filled with comical scenes with the slight serious scenes the only really serious episodes was after 11. I quite enjoyed it interms of i was laughing quite a lot, even though most of the jokes seems to be based around the same thing taking the piss out of Banri, or Shirakiin's bad habit even though its so repetitive i cant help but still laugh =D, Miketsukami's love for Shirakiin or Nobara's pervertedness is just hilarious and will surely make you laugh your head off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was an ok anime it's your typical comedy romance anime, where its filled with loads of comedy and then right at the end it hits you with romance. I personally quite liked the plot of the story but there wasn't really much development of the main story which is the problem i found with this anime =/. If you want to watch an anime that'll make you laugh your head off, then Inu x Boku SS is definitely something for you.",

            "content": "Inu x Boku SS\r\nTo clarify i haven't read the manga and after i finished the anime i was reading comments that the story is a lot more different from the manga and i read a little about the manga and i agree is way too different, it has more of a tragic approach and the anime is more comedy, even in the serious parts something funny happens, but because i have just watched the anime and not the manga i liked the anime a lot, maybe because i laughed a lot and really enjoyed it.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is about a girl (Ririchiyo, who in fact isa Youkai) who wants to be alone in this special mansion, because she tends to make people go away with her harsh words, she then meets this man in this mansion (Soushi) who appeared all of a sudden and tells her that he will be her SS, she wants to make him go away but she fails because he knows her from a long time, but she can't remember and that's where their relationship could seem close but it's distant at the same time. The story was good, but from what i read from the Wikipedia characters, it could have been outstanding and thought ''why didn't they adapted the things like that?'' tho i didn't change my score on the story because of that, it's just that it was just good for a supernatural rom-com, nothing new to see but keeps you entertained, overall was good.\\n\\n\r\n[Art & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style and animations were very well made, nothing much to say, i liked it and felt it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music was great, the background music matched the moments and were really enjoyable, the VA and the OP were great, there are different ED and all of the were really good, specially the one from Ep. 5, that one was hilarious, overall was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe character development was really good, they were really memorable even tho they have weird names you can remember their personalities and all of them were funny and interesting.\\n\r\n-Soushi could seem the typical guy who is in love or tries to be the kindest guy with the girls but he's not, and sometimes maybe you feel he's too kind for your blood to handle but that kindness is presented with comedy and it was ok and i was surprised but kinda expected his back story.\\n\r\n-Chiyo was really good and you can feel the chemistry between Soushi and Chiyo.\\n\r\n-Karuta for some reason was adorable.\\n\r\n-Natsume is funny whenever he talks.\\n\r\n-Rensho was damn hilarious and the music they put on him everytime he transforms made it even funnier.\\n\r\n-Kagerou was funny with his S and M division of things, and the support characters with their little on screen time were funny too, but it wasn't perfect and it showed at times, overall is very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI have to state that the comedy is a strong point in the anime for you to enjoy it and the romance was satisfaying even tho it's almost at the end, not to mention the music and characters made it more enjoyable; It has flaws and if you have read the manga obviosly you won't like it because the story has a lot of changes for the anime to be more happy, the ending was good and i wanted to see more after seeing their dialogues, the OVA is really great, go watch it too, overall the enjoyment was very good.",

            "content": "Inu x Boku SS or what others may refer to as - Dog and Me.\r\nAdapted by the manga Inu x Boku SS. It\u2032s not too long ago when I read the manga, but when I found out that there will be an anime, I thought of trying to watch it until it comes out. Honestly, it made me a little bit impatient. Because I really wanna see the animated version sooner.\r\nAnd of course, my hopes didn\u2032t let me down. As I thought, the animated version is great and much like-able.\r\nIf you are reading the manga, and currently at the latest chapter. You might be impatientin waiting for the latest episodes of the anime to come out, why? It\u2032s easy. It\u2032s because of the scenes in the manga which is really making the anime fans (of InuBoku) to be impatient, they would want the scenes in the manga to be animated faster; and I am one of them.\\n\\n\r\n- Inu x Boku SS isn\u2032t an anime that\u2032s out-of-the-ordinary. It\u2032s just like some Supernatural anime, but with a bit of Romance and light comedy (just a really light comedy). Living in a apartment complex, in which you have neighbors, who are not what you would call 'normal'. Instead, you have neighbors who is a demon, a nine-tailed fox, a giant skeleton and a whatnot. That\u2032s a new pace for some watchers.\\n\r\nBut I think that it\u2032s mainstream -- no?\\n\\n\r\nThe story start\u2032s of at a flashback, yes, flashback. I must say that these flashbacks which starts the story is really good. It makes you understand the story more and tell what\u2032s the cause or reason of the problem. Flashbacks are kind of annoying, especially if it doesn\u2032t have a connection or whatsoever from the episode of the storyline. But in InuBoku, it has a connection from the story, related to a past of the character.\\n\\n\r\n- InuBoku\u2032s animation or art is rather light and soft. It\u2032s not very unique, nor plain. But the art is just normal. The characters are really well-drawn, especially the guys or the bishounens. And the girls are cute too. It does have some flaws in it, but I can\u2032t just point out where. Sometimes, the characters are drawn as chibis, when they are performing a light joke/comedy on-screen. Mostly, Ririchiyo\u2032s the one who is drawn as chibi.\\n\\n\r\nThe coloring fits perfectly to the characters, what I meant to say was, the hair color of the characters and other body parts which is easily seen. What catches your attention the most, that is.\\n\\n\r\n- InuBoku\u2032s opening themes and ending themes were .. I don\u2032t know what to say. I don\u2032t really pay attention to the opening songs that much. Most likely, I just skip them. But I have heard a bit of the opening theme. It gives you a rock-theme feeling. I guess it doesn\u2032t fit InuBoku at all, does it?\\n\\n\r\n- Here we have the not-admitting-it, the loyal one, the taciturn one, the pervert one, the sadist, the bad boy, the masochist one (?!), the brother-like one, and maybe a mix of everything and anything. The characters of InuBoku are all great, each and every one are most likely introduced, but not in a character introduction way. They really made quite an amusing set of characters here, all living in the same apartment complex, and of course, all of them are not normal. All of them have supernatural powers.\\n\\n\r\nThey transform whenever it is needed, or by saving their masters, or people whom they serve.\\n\\n\r\n- InuBoku is an enjoyable anime, even though some of you might not like it, why not give it a go? I believe that it\u2032ll improve and be more exciting in the following episodes. I agree that InuBoku is not an out-of-the-ordinary kind of anime, the story is not that unique either, it\u2032s quite mainstream. But give it a little credit, why not watch it \u2032till it satisfies your enjoyment? Every now and then, all of us anime watchers should move on to a new pace. Having a rule like - I won\u2032t watch an anime that is boring; yes, I agree, even though some anime are boring and a crap, you still need to give it a go and give it a little credit. It might not meet your expectation, but whatever.\\n\r\nAll in all, InuBoku is an enjoyable anime, though I\u2032m looking forward into more excitement on the upcoming episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPlease comment on my profile, whether you found this review Helpful of Not. Thank you :D",

            "content": "So, when I watched the last - and completely unnecessary to the plot- episode of this series, my reaction was not: \"Ooown, how cute!!!\" , nor: \"This is an amazing anime!!!\" \r\nIt was literally:\r\n\"Wait, that's it?\" \r\nI think that pretty much describes my experience with it, if you're not up to reading the entire review.\r\nStory: 5\r\nMaison de Ayakashi is this super elite mansion with wealthy kids that happen to be descendants from monsters from Japanese Culture. \r\nNot only that, but they also have one secret service assigned to each resident, for their protection and stuff.\r\nWhat may seem like a promising idea to explore Oriental Mythologywith some good dosis of action and adventure, turned into a mushy romance between this one girl who was socially awkward(Ririchiyo) and her rather \"stalky\" obsessive and submissive secret service agent(Miketsukami).\\n\r\nThe whole time I kept expecting some surpring twist that would actually make it\u2026 interesting.\\n\r\nYou sai t floating in between genres, comedy, romance, drama, mistery and supernatural, but it didn\u2019t actully defined itself in the end, it was like watching someone trying to do 5 things at a time. Eventually it will go wrong. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not bad, I mean, is a bit of a clich\u00e9, and that really makes it a tad disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\r\nOkay, I gotta admit I love the character design, and the whole ambience of the anime was well captured.  The \u201calternate\u201d/monster forms where rather cool and the sceneries where really appealing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nNo matter how Much I love characters with proper background stories, in this case you had polar opposites. While the Ririchiyo told us almost her entire childhood, you really end the anime knowing practically nothing about the remaining characters, that are given the same importance \u2013 i level of story line \u2013 as the chairs and teacups used in the breakfast scenes. They can be kinda funny but that's their main purpose \u2013 besides the absurd ammount of fan service you get with the female characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI\u2019m givin\u2019 it na 8 just because of all the different endings, that where not only original, but also entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 6\\n\r\nIt's not terrible, you can watch it at a saturday night when you're bored, but it\u2019s not one of those titles that I would recommend watching, because honestly it wouldn't even occur to me, as all in all the story is kinda forgettable when in comparison with other animes in all the genres this one tried to be.",

Also with friends at her school too. I have this feeling her past will catch up to her.  She decides to break away from her family and life. In order for her to live independently she lives in this mansion \"Ayakashi Kan\" (House of Spirit/Demons/Ghosts/Youkai) where she meets her SS-Secret Service Miketsukami, Soushi who is her servant, guard etc. She rejects the SSand him but i have feeling she''s change along the way. Other members of this mansion live here and have their own personal SS. But this mansion houses\" people\" with special abilities/powers. We find out Ririchio SS is a fox spirit( at first i though OMG -Inuyasha like  demon  XD) but not really.  Looking forward for more episodes.",

            "content": "I was drawn into watching this anime because of three reasons.  \r\n1. Yoko Hikasa, Aki Toyosaki, and Kana Hanazawa were cast in it\r\n2. Ririchiyo Shirakiin looked cute\r\n3. The picture I saw hinted at romance\r\nI liked how the animation style switched between normal and chibi to make the funny moments even funnier.  The story was mostly fun and light-hearted and was not about fighting like I was expecting.  They only had to fight three or four times and they were not that serious.  The story did not have that many screwed up events in it.  The worst one concerned Miketsukami butit wasn't as bad as other good shows I've seen.  (Gosick had worse for example)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime pushed all of my buttons.  It was cute.  There was romance.  There was just the right amount of sex appeal, which was centered around Ririchiyo Shirakiin's cleavage and was sprinkled with Nobara being a creeper and Chino's chest.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were excellent.  I loved how unique and sometimes stupid, in terms of fighting ability and functionality, their transformations were.  \\n\r\nMy favorite characters were Ririchiyo, Karuta, and Chino.  I see myself in Ririchiyo Shirakiin but instead of doing that annoying, uptight \"humph\" before every conversation, I don't say anything.  We both have trouble saying what we mean and are honest when we write.  \\n\r\nI like Karuta Roromiya because of her voice and her love of food.  Her throwback form is unexpected and awesome.  \\n\r\nI hated and liked Kagerou at the same time.  I hated him for the type of person he was but liked and laughed so hard at him because of how he flaunted it.  I've wondered what it would be like to be classified by him.  I have an idea of what he would say...\\n\r\nChino was so cute.  She acted cute, her other form was so cute, and I could hear and see Yui.\\n\r\nThe other workers at Maison de Ayakashi are diverse and funny.  \\n\\n\r\nI usually don't like songs sung by guys but the opening song, Nirvana by MUCC, is good.  Most of the ending songs are awesome, especially sweets parade.  SM Hantei Forum made me laugh so hard.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ending made me so happy because I enjoy a good romance and it left the story wide open for development.  Out of the dozen shows I followed this season, Inu x Boku SS is my favorite.  Season 2 Please.",

            "content": "This anime 'Inu Boku SS' seems to point to 'Dog and me secret service', but, it isn't the literal meaning of course, that would be a bit boring unless you had some super cool dogs! anyway.\r\nThe story is based on a girl named Ririchiyo who lacks social skills and can never say what she really thinks. The Fox Spirit, Miketsukami Soushi is her secret service agent and pledges his life to protect her. In the beginning you feel like there is an underlying story behind his commitment or a reason for his attitude towards his job.\r\nEven though she is projected, I feel that the maincharacter is Soushi, as he commands a certain presence in this anime that drags attention to him. Even if the anime focuses on her problems and how she evolves to make friends, it is really his character that it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finding out about him, it is like that we would go back and watch the series again, just to find out where he gives cues about his life and his reasons.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes a bit slow when it focuses on her;  and then heats up near the absolute end only because you want to know what will happen!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked the anime as the ending was sort of expected but, the end scene was a bit cliche I feel. Anyway, the art of all the transformed ayakashis are really good!!! Love the little horns on Rirchiyos head :P\\n\\n\r\nNot too much action though, sort of wished there was a fight where we couldn't decide who would win! well, that was there but it ended unexpectedly.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, enjoy and pay attention through out the anime for little hints ;)",

            "content": "So I am not quite sure why some people are not so happy with this series.  I thought it was very sweet and enjoyable, and I really really liked it.\r\nStory:\r\nWhile the story was not an overarching plot-line, nor was it extremely deep, it was very enjoyable.  This series was more of a rom-com than anything else, but it definitely had some drama to it, and the supernatural aspect of it actually worked to enhance the story overall.\r\nArt: \r\nNothing special or extraordinary in the art department, but the series had beautiful, bright colors, and the characters were unique and beautifully drawn.  The artis a teeny bit \"bishie\" but it works quite well, no complaints here.  \\n\r\n(as a side note, while there isn't a TON of fan service, there are definitely a few scenes that are NSFW)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't too memorable, but there were a few pieces that were beautiful and added to certain scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nThis is where the series really shone for me.  I was able to connect and related to Ririchiyo and her social awkwardness and inability to connect with people due to a dark childhood.  Miketsukami on the other hand is a bit harder to get a read on at first.  He seems slightly perverted and is definitely obsessed with Ririchiyo, but we don't really know why until the last few episodes.  But you can't help but like him and have a soft spot for his kindness towards Ririchiyo.  By the end of the series the character development is phenomenal (especially for Ririchiyo).  I ended up loving both Ririchiyo and Miketsukami, and the side characters are lovely and memorable as well.  The side characters have a ton of diversity as well: there is a Trans character, two gay characters, and lots of different family situations, which is very impressive and definitely added to my enjoyment.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this series a lot.  I thought the story was sweet and the characters are wonderful to watch.",

            "content": "There is something very unfortunate about a show that chooses to confirm certain traits and elements of the story that the viewer sometimes wanted kept to the power of the imagination. \r\nOne of the most important things to get out the way when watching this show: The place and role of the main characters, in this case the male and female leads, Miketsukami Soushi and Shirakiin Ririchiyo. Miketsukami is a 22 year old incarnation of the Kyuubi, the fox spirit, and Ririchiyo is a 15 year old high school student. Keeping in mind that this is a clear 7 year difference in age, one cannotblame the casual anime watcher feeling a bit uncomfortable in a situation like this. Seeing as how Japanese culture views older male partners coupling with younger girls and women as acceptable, this is not a fault within the show itself. Although again, it may be odd to some, hence the confusing mix of feelings one feels as he/she completes this show. I say a confusing mix, because Inu x Boku, admittedly, presents a very solid storyline that fulfills its goals and generally feels satisfying. The characters are fleshed out, the humor is original, the animation is very good, and the situations are unique to themselves. There would seem to be a paucity of complaints, but it is because it is such a solid show that problems arise. \\n\\n\r\nThe big one, and this may not be a problem to most (much more of a personal problem). The age gap between our respective love couple. The reason for such discontent with the romance aspect of this show is because the show presents such a deep past that links together with the present to create a meaningful, not-spur-of-the-moment love that is justified in all sense. The feelings of loneliness, lost identity, and the need for \"reciprocation\" between one another in the process of healing, are all perfectly identifiable and explainable in every sense. As people, the love is honestly genuine. But yet, I just can't seem to rid the thought of, \"What if the age gap was a bit smaller? Would it feel more... relatable? More 'romantic'?\" Of course, all of this rests on the subjective opinion that the closer you are in age, the more likely you are to understand your loved one. It may be true in some sense, but the show sets up the plot so that it proves such an idea otherwise, which I find impressive and also a bit frustrating. For me, at the end of the last episode, it felt unbalanced even when the show went to great lengths to make sure that it didn't. \\n\\n\r\n\"Happiness from love transcends age difference\". I wonder then, where the line is drawn, if at all? \\n\\n\r\nOne thing Inu x Boku had going for it was the small cast of interesting SIDE characters. Although their own stories were trivially small compared to the main leads', it kept the show moving and respectably created an atmosphere full of personality and purpose. Aside from the 'main' side characters(yes, main side characters), some of the side characters made relatively few appearances, which wasn't a problem necessarily. But, I would have liked to have seen all of them more equally. However, the interesting personalities of the characters that DID make recurring appearances were enough rapports to continue on the main storyline. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the personality of the main male character simply did not resonate with me, but I found his obedience and extreme level of devotion somewhat dull and expected. It became a punchline that quickly grew old a few episodes in, and I felt that they could have done a much better job of refining his personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was not particularly noteworthy, and I don't remember any of the musics played. Looking back, it almost seemed like an afterthought, like it blended a bit too much into the background. \\n\\n\r\nInu x Boku is an original love story, but could have most definitely stood out more than it did. Short and sweet, but nothing that popped out.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"The time you have lived thus far; we will remember it, again & again, the story of a long, long time we will live out together\"\r\nInu x Boku SS is one of the series that made a lot of us, laugh, cry, and smile all at the same time. This is one of the greatest and almost beautiful love story I have seen in a very, very long time.\r\nFirst of all let's start with the storyline...well, there really wasn't any at all. But this really follows the manga so well, I'd almost say they got it word for word! The first episode describes a youngsixteen year old girl named Ririchiyo who is moving into an apartment on her own. Serving her \"until the death\" is Soushi, a young, mysterious man that seems almost emotionless. Though the first part of the series the storyline seems to be not picking up and I was starting to lose interest until BAM, it hit me like light and I was hooked for the rest of the season. The series also accompanies many other characters that have a personality all of their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was simply beautiful, it gives us everything, including detail, emotions, and the feeling of the characters. Watchers may find themselves feeling the same emotion as the main girl Ririchiyo (in which she goes thought some confusing mixed feelings continually throughout the series). \\n\\n\r\nAs I first said a couple paragraphs before this, almost all of the characters pull of many moments that create a sense of personality. One thing I absolute hate about some Anime is that some characters seem \"robotish\" or \"no personality\" and that's clearly out right BORING for me. I find myself itching for some personality or at least some creativity of some sort I can relate or want to relate too and this anime delivers it luckily.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, absolute LOVE \u2665 Once you finish this whole series you find yourself feeling all fuzzy inside and that's a promise! I recommend watching this if you want some romantic comedy and girls, if you have a heart that is dying to melt watch this! I guarantee you won't regret it~",

The way the series introduced the Ririchiyo's problems as well as the other residents at the apartment was also great. Overall, the first episode was an excellent start to the series.\r\nBut then, as the story progressed on, Ririchyo changed. Instead of being some badass character who wanted to get along with everyone, she changed into a shoujo who fell in love, and the latest few episodes focused a lot on her feelings and shoujo character development.\r\nComparing to the comedy, and the set up of the first few episodes, the latest fewepisodes were really disappointing. It loses the comedic feel to it, and begins to show signs of some cliche shoujo\\n\\n\r\nAccording to MAL, this series has 12 episodes, so I'm having my fingers crossed that the last few will become much more exciting and action-filled. \\n\\n\r\nThough I must add, the sound and the OST is absolutely awesome. They fit the scenes and the atmosphere very well.",

            "content": "What was I expecting when I started watching Inu x Boku SS? I really don't know, something entertaining at the very least? Unfortunately, Inu x Boku is nothing of the sort, just an episodic hodgepodge of random scenarios with little-to-no overarching plot. I'm actually not sure what this was supposed to be. A romance? If so, it certainly lacked progression until the very end. A comedy? Well, it didn't really make me laugh very much, which I admit, is somewhat subjective, but the humor didn't work for me, outside of a few characters or episodes. Supernatural? I guess it had supernatural elements. Honestly, those werethe highlight of the show, but the supernatural powers got so little focus that they may as well have been just a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, Inu x Boku is going to blow absolutely nobody away. It's rather basic in every way and is starting to look a little dated as the years pass. That's not to say it's not acceptable, but it may look really old in a few years. The big win for Inu x Boku was the songs. I really liked the opening and the changing endings, it added an air of personality to each episode, which was refreshing. Outside of those things, nothing about Inu x Boku is a technical marvel, it's only acceptable at best.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Kagerou Shoukiin\\n\\n\r\nI was a hair away from saying that Karuta was my favorite, but I had to give it to my S&M dude. Honestly, his introductory episode was the funniest in the entire series, I was legit laughing out loud because of his antics. I aspire to go around labeling things as sadistic or masochistic now because of him.\\n\r\nTo be clear, I did like some of the cast, even if it's not as many of them as I would have liked. Sorinozuka, or the scroll dude, was really funny as well, especially with his interactions with Nobara, his perverted, lesbian secret service agent. Nobara in general was a hilarious character. However, I cannot say that I loved the main two characters very much. They kind of felt as if someone was like, \"Hey, we have these two pieces of cardboard for main characters, so let's give them a personality.\" and then they decided to make one piece of cardboard a self-pitying loli tsundere and the other an overly attached stalker. I felt zero connection to either of them throughout the entire series. Not once did I feel anything other than boredom when they came onto the screen. If you've followed my reviewing at all, you know I'm a huge shipper and this show didn't even make me bother with shipping characters, because they were so mediocre outside of a select few.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know if I'm disappointed by Inu x Boku or just relieved to be done with it. To make a confession, I was kind of half asleep for the last 3-4 episodes, if not even longer, so I may have missed out on the best the show had to offer. However, I feel as if that proves my point though. Inu x Boku couldn't even command enough of my attention for a single cour, that's how bland it is.",

They could of done much more  with what they gave us, I feel they could of expanded some more on the things that we were first told in the first episode about their ancestors and such and less about the main protagonists everyday life (mainly school), that I could of done without. because they spent good amount of time each episode of the protagonists morning routine. \r\n  However, If youcan get those quirks out of the way, you have yourself a rather well done anime. There is one thing that really stood out with this anime, and that was it's character development. You really learn lot about most of the characters anywhere from their personalities to there past or really just anything about them, and I feel that really helped the show out.\\n\r\n The comedy was well done, short lived jokes but they were enjoyable to laugh at.\\n\\n\r\n The art and sound I found no problems. The art wasn't anything special or finely detailed, and the sound was normal. Very average but not bad.\\n\\n\r\n I gave this anime a 7 out of ten. I recommend this anime for those who are looking for a romance with a few fight scenes. Enjoy.",

Its about a girl, Ririchiyo, who doesn't really know how to socialize with other people and by going to this dorm, Ayakashi Kan, where she meets many interesting people who she later calls friends. On her first day she meets a guy, Soushi Miketsukami, who swears to protect her as like her body guard. Soushi is very loyal like a dog otherwise referred to as the Inu. Many twists in turns happen in this anime I found myself intregued and wanting more and more each week.If you like a anime where you laugh at almost all the episodes which at the same time cheering on Ririchiyo as she begins to fall in love with a certain guy in here but I will say no more or I might spoil it. The point is if your into romcoms this is the anime for you. This is a anime not only for girls but for guys. :)\\n\\n\r\n(10) Art: The art is amazing! I'm sure most of you noticed how hot the guys are in Inu X Boku SS! xD I find that all the characters are drawn out well, I read the manga and the art is right on. I actually judge wheather I like the show or not by the image. Like if the art is crappy then I find it hard to enjoy it more without a clear picture. \\n\\n\r\n(10) Sound: Sounds were good and clear. I actually think their voices suited them well. \\n\\n\r\n(10) Character: The characters have great personalities and their looks and voices went with them very well! :)\\n\\n\r\n(10) Enjoyment: You will surely enjoy this anime, one episode will have you hooked and wanting more!! :)\\n\\n\r\n(10) Overall: Overall this anime is the best! It has everything good that you look for in a anime! It has the surprise factors, everything! I guarentee you this once you watch that very first episode you will fall in love with this series. After you finish you will be wanting more and believe you me I am! :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "That turned out to be very different from what I originally expected, but that became clear in the very first episode.  After that the plot became extremely obvious -- yes, including the Big Reveal; though maybe one has to have some vague familiarity with Cyrano de Bergerac to see that coming.  I feel most of the potential of the anime was wasted on routine comedy bits, and consequently I feel let down.\r\nStory:  Decent set-up, both in regard to the cast being half-youkai, and Ririchiyo's acid tongue, though the whole \"secret service\" nonsense made me roll my eyes.  But the show didnothing much with the youkai past a couple of action scenes, and Ririchiyo's tongue wasn't all that acidic.  Instead much time was spent on weak comedy gags that I would have wanted to see spent on fleshing out the potentially interesting cast of characters.  The mystery wasn't very mysterious to me, and I think the writer failed in finding a good way to give us much of the information during the first 10 episodes, instead of infodumping it all in one giant lump at the end.  It tried some feeble foreshadowing by giving occasional flashes of Miketsukami, but they were actually a bit misleading.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Very nice art, especially the character art -- each character looked completely different so there was no need to try and distinguish them by hair color, and at the same time the art felt very unified (I noticed that especially since I recently watched Baby Steps which had very uneven character design).  Animation was fluid and smooth, and there were lots of small details that are not often animated.  Ririchiyo's hair was basically its own character.  The changing EDs got their own animations which was fun.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Quite the star voice talent here, and while some of the comedy sounded way over the top, it was obviously designed that way.  I liked the OP but not the performance by MUCC, it sounded as it exceeded the range of the lead singer.  The ED changed frequently and was sung by one or more cast members. BGM was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ririchiyo was the only one who got any serious development.  She was intellectually very bright, but at the same time emotionally naive, which always strikes me as odd -- how can one be so very naive if one is actually well-read?  I would have liked her to be a bit more astute, though in several important moments she was actually completely on the ball.  I liked her rather a lot.  Miketsukami started out so fawningly obsequious that despite his innate hotness (of course he also had to be a fox spirit, my favourite) I didn't really care for him at first because humans behaving like doormats make me very uncomfortable -- but he was also very competent, and I figured out his secret early on, that changed my mind.  got some development during the big infodump, and as I mentioned above, I would have preferred more of that during the run-up.  All the other characters get minimal personalities, and while they are well delineated, there's no development; they're just props, some more than others.  I could really do without the ridiculous tranny and camp gay characters; it'd be nice to just once get a decent trans or gay character instead, outside of BL anime.\\n\\n\r\nI rather enjoyed it, but felt a bit empty afterwards.  If you like standard anime comedy where women poke each other's large boobs, and people totally overreact, then you might enjoy the humour.  I found the situational humour born from Ririchiyo's outer expressions and inner feelings funnier, though I also liked Zange's mischief.  Otherwise it's a cute, little romance (I am not bothered by the age difference; she's a pretty mature 15 year old, and they're not doing anything H yet).\\n\\n\r\nOh, and if you watch the special, you'll see that Kagerou was right about one thing:  Miketsukami totally is an S.  ;)\\n\\n",

Mind you, this review is solely based on my opinion alone, It isn't related to the manga in anyway.\r\nSo, main question: Is this anime worth watching?\r\nWell, the answer is complex. It depends on how you want the story to turn out. Lots of people have expressed their views on this anime, most of them liking how it turned out, while others wanting it to be a dark-toned anime, inspired from the dark manga. Inu x boku SS is an anime, that atfirst glance, is seen as cheery. And, yes it is. It takes a different approach than the manga, being someone who read the manga after watching the anime, I see it as a light-hearted romantic comedy, with a few supernatural themes added here and there. If you like this genre of romance, then I guarantee you will like this anime, a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are outstanding, the art is amazing, the voice actors did an amazing job voice-acting and overall, the story is eye-catching and not cliche at all.\\n\\n\r\nGive this a go, I promise it will not disappoint anyone who holds a strong liking for romance and supernatural anime.

            "content": "A teenage girl struggling with her interpersonal skills; a loyal man struggling with his intrapersonal skills. Inu x Boku SS tells of the tale involving these two troubled persons. Over time, it is inevitable that one will change depending on his/her surroundings. The influences that come from peers and others are undoubtedly strong. To be able to thrive in such environments, one must be able to filter these influences and only be changed by those which they feel will benefit them. In the end, it is always others that do the shaping; one cannot merely wish to be transformed and have it happen. Whether thesechanges are good or bad is a whole different story. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nSoothing and calming visuals are few and far between. The light colors, the soft lighting, the detailed facial expressions of the characters - all these make for great artwork. Throw in some chibi drawings of the characters during the comedic scenes and the varying art styles are sure to impress viewers. Even the sparkles which are popular (and often overused) in sh\u014djo anime/manga were moderated such that they didn't feel overwhelming. On the sh\u014dnen side of things, the handful of battle scenes and transformations were animated smoothly as far as I could tell. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nFirst off, the supporting characters of the series, though unique and interesting, were a bit underdeveloped. However, the extensive character development of the two main characters made up for this. At first, the female protagonist, Shirakiin Ririchiyo, is your typical, sharp-tongued teenage girl who often unintentionally isolates herself from others. But as the series progresses, she slowly opens the door to her heart, accepting the warmth of those around her while trying to control her tongue. On the other hand, the male protagonist, Miketsukami S\u014dshi, is a self-despising and deceptive man who knows nothing about emotion and feelings. But, similar to Ririchiyo, he too changes drastically throughout the series. What's most heartwarming is that the two, although having totally different personalities, are actually the ones responsible for each other's development. Ririchiyo shows S\u014dshi the meaning of emotion and feelings while he proves to her that he will be by her side, no matter what, even if it means being verbally abused. Along with the other characters, the two end up transforming each other for the better, resulting in two solid characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe strong point of this category is the elite cast of seiy\u016bs that were part of the project. All of them did an excellent job in their respective roles, with no character having an unfitting voice. The OP was quite good as well - a fast-paced song with gradual progression in pitch. The downside of having multiple EDs is that only the good ones will be memorable. However, the ones used in this series were more or less unique so, even though they weren't exactly excellent material, they were somewhat memorable. BGM did its job well, with some of the pieces successfully standing tall on their own during dialogue-less scenes, while others set the mood well. \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, for the most part, the story was boring. Save for the first and last few episodes, the pace of one manga chapter per episode caused the story to be dragged out longer than necessary. Furthermore, the anime original fillers were fairly poor in terms of entertainment value. The first couple of episodes were tolerable given that they were used to introduce the characters and the plot. In the last couple of episodes is where the plot actually picks up from the first few episodes. Those two episodes alone would make for an easy 9/10 as they were both interesting and content-filled. However, with more bad than good, the story gets a 6/10 from me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nHaving read the manga prior to watching the anime, I can say that this was a faithful adaption with a couple of original episodes added in. I indulged more in the characters than in the story for the most part which, although not necessarily a bad thing, is slightly disappointing. To be honest, I wasn't quite satisfied with Inu x Boku SS. I felt like it could've been better if more chapters were to have been adapted. With that being said, the possibility of a season two, which I will anxiously wait for, is moderately high given the decent popularity of the show and the remaining non-animated source material. The good thing about Inu x Boku SS is that it has both sh\u014djo and sh\u014dnen elements so I would recommend it to virtually anyone looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy with interesting characters.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nWhen this anime first started airing recently I was unsure what it was going to be about. At the end of finishing this series, I still am unsure what this series qualify as. Inu x boku was supposedly a comedy story incorporating some supernatural and mysterious themes. However, it seems like the director changed their mind during the middle of the series.\r\nThe main plot follows around a young woman named Ririchiyo. Basically, she's a very delicate person, so delicate and shy that she can barely express herself. In fact, to the point where she almost expresses the opposite of what she meansevery time. Thus, she has no friends at school. But then one day she moves to a new environment where her lifestyle is replaced by supernatural beings. But that's all there really is \"supernatural\" about this series. Besides just the characters, nothing is distinctively different about inu x boku, than if you compare it to a cheesy school drama. Also, it can barely qualify as a \u00a0mystery because no suspense was really built throughout the series. This series was very slow paced in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the only unique part of this series. Ririchiyo along with some supporting characters have some very interesting conversations. And, with Ririchiyo's personality, it just makes it so much more fun to watch. The comedy included in the show was based mostly on the stupid conversations, thoughts, fantasies, or actions some character started. It will fit the taste of basically anyone with a sense of humor. But don't be fooled! There really is only one character development in this series. His name is soushi, and a servant of Ririchyo\"sama.\"Not very much is known about soushi except that he has a strange attraction to his master until the very last few episodes, and that is why I think the characters turned out a lot worse than they could of. This goes back to my point about the series being seriously paced; therefore making it an anime not everyone will like. But this anime is 12 episodes so it's not a big deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe artistic aspect of this series was probably the strongest. The producer made the characters with very cute designs, thus making the audience more connected to the characters. The delicacy put into Ririchiyo almost made it express her personality better. The music put into this anime was worth some efforts, and could be very favorable. But what I liked most about it was that they played it during some of the most appropriate scenes and it complemented very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe results of inu x boku was definitely unexpected than what it seems to be on the surface. Although not what I expected, which was a mysterious drama about the supernatural of some sort. This series still impressed me in the end concluding with a relationship I did not think would blossom in just one season. However, it was still very slow paced for that one season. So if you're looking for an anime with character developments, you may or may not like it.\\n\\n\r\n I will end it in this paragraph and keep this review short and clean. Because that's what this anime really was, a short and innocent story about our kind Ririchiyo and her adventure with her air-headed friends in the Ayakashi mansion. To be precise, that's exactly how this anime played out until the last few episodes, then it's all out surprises. If you're going to watch this series, do keep in mind the old cliched saying \"never judge a book until you're done reading the whole thing.\" But if inu x boku really was a book then I'm pretty sure it could be described as one of those trending books that becomes famous after its first publish, soon to be forgotten as the decade carries on.",

            "content": "Does a very good job on sticking with the manga. Luckily the manga is ahead so for those like me who have read the manga way before the anime was released you know how things turn out and you can focus on the artwork and seeing your favorite characters in motion :3\r\nStory: There really isn't a \"story\" per se. The manga is slowly picking up but as you can see from the first 11(?) episodes released currently it's mostly the main (what? 6-7 characters?) conversing with each other and little things between Ririchyo and Soushi. 7/10\r\nArt: Very Nice. Nice style to it. 10/10\r\nSound: The OPis beast. It just goes so well with the animation. If you don't understand then read/watch the show/manga and then re-watch the OP and tell me if you understand how it flows so well with the animation. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are nice. Loyal bodyguard who has a past with the protagonist, tsundere protagonist, friends, etc etc. Everyone is suprisingly nice. There are times when certain people seem like \"antagonists\" but there really is no \"bad guy\". 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's a light refreshing series to watch. I high ly recommend reading the manga thought since it has the anime + more. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy :) see you in my next review\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Apparently me stating that this review was created at the time of the eleventh episode, the fact that I put \"12 out of 12\" for the MAL version of when I wrote this is bothering certain people. I understand completely what these people are complaining about. Why should I be limited to 12 out 12? Why not give me 20+ out of 12. I have knowledge on the manga which surpasses the limits of the animes episodes. Therefore 12+ is all free game as stated above. It doesn't matter what happens in episode 12 or 50 for that matter. That's like reviewing a restaurant that you've been to before anyone else had the chance. I'm allowed to review it however I want. I've sampled the dishes before the general public.\\n\\n\r\nyou feelin me?\\n\\n\r\nENJOY THE SERIES.",

            "content": "Inu X Boku SS was one of those anime's i had seen around, or saw some tiny references to, but it never gave me any incentive to watch the anime and it seemed to me like it was one of those anime that focuses to much on fan service and comical stuff. That being said after having not a lot to watch i gave it ago. \r\nStory 7\r\nThe concept itself was ok, nothing special, your typical romcom anime. The story had a slow start, i didn't feel particularly pulled into the story until about episode 11 where Miketsukami past was revealed the episodes inbetween ifelt was purely fan service and it was there to make viewers laugh, and believe me it did =D. The ending i thought was pretty nice, although it did feel a bit rushed but it was quite heartwarming and im sure romance viewers will like it. But one thing that annoyed me was that episodes 3-10 was basically just introducing a bunch of characters, and Shirakiin being all like \"Oh i need to repay and thank Miketsukami\" and when it did happen Miketsukami was all like \"I don't deserve your thanks\"... what the fuck is up with that just accept her appreciation \\n\\n\r\nArt 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this wasn't bad for an anime that came out in 2012 its to be expected, i quite like some of the character design, Miketsukami fox form is pretty cool, so is Shirakiin's demon form or w/e she looked pretty kawaii. I absolutely Love the character design for Zange chan the bunny ears just works so god damn well, completely suits his personality and really draws out the comical moments from him. Renshou demon form is pretty jokes, his scroll look is pretty funny and provides quite a lot of priceless moments in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6\\n\\n\r\nThe OST wasn't anything special, although this isn't exactly an anime that really focuses on music, Each character had an opening and ending, which is pretty cool in my opinion, some of the voice actors was pretty good, Zange chan, Shirakiin's voice actor worked pretty well and really suited them. But this anime isn't really focused on the sound its more about the comedy it provides.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7 \\n\\n\r\nThere was a wide variety of different characters each with a personality that made this anime pretty funny, Shirakiin with her bad habit of being rude to others led to some rather comical moments, that coupled with Miketsukami, who is totally in love with her is quite funny. I loved the bits when she calls him a dog and he basically acts like one =P. I Love Zange chan personality, that sarcastic attitude yet trying to act nice and innocent is pretty jokes, and his \"Love\" is way to over the top, man his love for Miketsukami is jokes. Even though i like all the characters in Inu X Boku SS it seems that there is a major lack of character development, not much is said about some of the characters past, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of character development between some of the side characters and Shirakiin for example her relationship with Nobara isn't very developed considering shes one of the first side character Shirakiin meets. It seems that the only 2 character that got the most attention was Shirakiin and Miketsukami but i guess they are the main characters, the romance between them was pretty nice as well, i would've liked to see more about zange chan and the others, especially Sorinozuka and his past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, is one of those ones which is just filled with comical scenes with the slight serious scenes the only really serious episodes was after 11. I quite enjoyed it interms of i was laughing quite a lot, even though most of the jokes seems to be based around the same thing taking the piss out of Banri, or Shirakiin's bad habit even though its so repetitive i cant help but still laugh =D, Miketsukami's love for Shirakiin or Nobara's pervertedness is just hilarious and will surely make you laugh your head off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was an ok anime it's your typical comedy romance anime, where its filled with loads of comedy and then right at the end it hits you with romance. I personally quite liked the plot of the story but there wasn't really much development of the main story which is the problem i found with this anime =/. If you want to watch an anime that'll make you laugh your head off, then Inu x Boku SS is definitely something for you.",

            "content": "Inu x Boku SS\r\nTo clarify i haven't read the manga and after i finished the anime i was reading comments that the story is a lot more different from the manga and i read a little about the manga and i agree is way too different, it has more of a tragic approach and the anime is more comedy, even in the serious parts something funny happens, but because i have just watched the anime and not the manga i liked the anime a lot, maybe because i laughed a lot and really enjoyed it.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is about a girl (Ririchiyo, who in fact isa Youkai) who wants to be alone in this special mansion, because she tends to make people go away with her harsh words, she then meets this man in this mansion (Soushi) who appeared all of a sudden and tells her that he will be her SS, she wants to make him go away but she fails because he knows her from a long time, but she can't remember and that's where their relationship could seem close but it's distant at the same time. The story was good, but from what i read from the Wikipedia characters, it could have been outstanding and thought ''why didn't they adapted the things like that?'' tho i didn't change my score on the story because of that, it's just that it was just good for a supernatural rom-com, nothing new to see but keeps you entertained, overall was good.\\n\\n\r\n[Art & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style and animations were very well made, nothing much to say, i liked it and felt it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music was great, the background music matched the moments and were really enjoyable, the VA and the OP were great, there are different ED and all of the were really good, specially the one from Ep. 5, that one was hilarious, overall was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe character development was really good, they were really memorable even tho they have weird names you can remember their personalities and all of them were funny and interesting.\\n\r\n-Soushi could seem the typical guy who is in love or tries to be the kindest guy with the girls but he's not, and sometimes maybe you feel he's too kind for your blood to handle but that kindness is presented with comedy and it was ok and i was surprised but kinda expected his back story.\\n\r\n-Chiyo was really good and you can feel the chemistry between Soushi and Chiyo.\\n\r\n-Karuta for some reason was adorable.\\n\r\n-Natsume is funny whenever he talks.\\n\r\n-Rensho was damn hilarious and the music they put on him everytime he transforms made it even funnier.\\n\r\n-Kagerou was funny with his S and M division of things, and the support characters with their little on screen time were funny too, but it wasn't perfect and it showed at times, overall is very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI have to state that the comedy is a strong point in the anime for you to enjoy it and the romance was satisfaying even tho it's almost at the end, not to mention the music and characters made it more enjoyable; It has flaws and if you have read the manga obviosly you won't like it because the story has a lot of changes for the anime to be more happy, the ending was good and i wanted to see more after seeing their dialogues, the OVA is really great, go watch it too, overall the enjoyment was very good.",

            "content": "Inu x Boku SS or what others may refer to as - Dog and Me.\r\nAdapted by the manga Inu x Boku SS. It\u2032s not too long ago when I read the manga, but when I found out that there will be an anime, I thought of trying to watch it until it comes out. Honestly, it made me a little bit impatient. Because I really wanna see the animated version sooner.\r\nAnd of course, my hopes didn\u2032t let me down. As I thought, the animated version is great and much like-able.\r\nIf you are reading the manga, and currently at the latest chapter. You might be impatientin waiting for the latest episodes of the anime to come out, why? It\u2032s easy. It\u2032s because of the scenes in the manga which is really making the anime fans (of InuBoku) to be impatient, they would want the scenes in the manga to be animated faster; and I am one of them.\\n\\n\r\n- Inu x Boku SS isn\u2032t an anime that\u2032s out-of-the-ordinary. It\u2032s just like some Supernatural anime, but with a bit of Romance and light comedy (just a really light comedy). Living in a apartment complex, in which you have neighbors, who are not what you would call 'normal'. Instead, you have neighbors who is a demon, a nine-tailed fox, a giant skeleton and a whatnot. That\u2032s a new pace for some watchers.\\n\r\nBut I think that it\u2032s mainstream -- no?\\n\\n\r\nThe story start\u2032s of at a flashback, yes, flashback. I must say that these flashbacks which starts the story is really good. It makes you understand the story more and tell what\u2032s the cause or reason of the problem. Flashbacks are kind of annoying, especially if it doesn\u2032t have a connection or whatsoever from the episode of the storyline. But in InuBoku, it has a connection from the story, related to a past of the character.\\n\\n\r\n- InuBoku\u2032s animation or art is rather light and soft. It\u2032s not very unique, nor plain. But the art is just normal. The characters are really well-drawn, especially the guys or the bishounens. And the girls are cute too. It does have some flaws in it, but I can\u2032t just point out where. Sometimes, the characters are drawn as chibis, when they are performing a light joke/comedy on-screen. Mostly, Ririchiyo\u2032s the one who is drawn as chibi.\\n\\n\r\nThe coloring fits perfectly to the characters, what I meant to say was, the hair color of the characters and other body parts which is easily seen. What catches your attention the most, that is.\\n\\n\r\n- InuBoku\u2032s opening themes and ending themes were .. I don\u2032t know what to say. I don\u2032t really pay attention to the opening songs that much. Most likely, I just skip them. But I have heard a bit of the opening theme. It gives you a rock-theme feeling. I guess it doesn\u2032t fit InuBoku at all, does it?\\n\\n\r\n- Here we have the not-admitting-it, the loyal one, the taciturn one, the pervert one, the sadist, the bad boy, the masochist one (?!), the brother-like one, and maybe a mix of everything and anything. The characters of InuBoku are all great, each and every one are most likely introduced, but not in a character introduction way. They really made quite an amusing set of characters here, all living in the same apartment complex, and of course, all of them are not normal. All of them have supernatural powers.\\n\\n\r\nThey transform whenever it is needed, or by saving their masters, or people whom they serve.\\n\\n\r\n- InuBoku is an enjoyable anime, even though some of you might not like it, why not give it a go? I believe that it\u2032ll improve and be more exciting in the following episodes. I agree that InuBoku is not an out-of-the-ordinary kind of anime, the story is not that unique either, it\u2032s quite mainstream. But give it a little credit, why not watch it \u2032till it satisfies your enjoyment? Every now and then, all of us anime watchers should move on to a new pace. Having a rule like - I won\u2032t watch an anime that is boring; yes, I agree, even though some anime are boring and a crap, you still need to give it a go and give it a little credit. It might not meet your expectation, but whatever.\\n\r\nAll in all, InuBoku is an enjoyable anime, though I\u2032m looking forward into more excitement on the upcoming episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPlease comment on my profile, whether you found this review Helpful of Not. Thank you :D",

Eventually it will go wrong. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not bad, I mean, is a bit of a clich\u00e9, and that really makes it a tad disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\r\nOkay, I gotta admit I love the character design, and the whole ambience of the anime was well captured.  The \u201calternate\u201d/monster forms where rather cool and the sceneries where really appealing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nNo matter how Much I love characters with proper background stories, in this case you had polar opposites. While the Ririchiyo told us almost her entire childhood, you really end the anime knowing practically nothing about the remaining characters, that are given the same importance \u2013 i level of story line \u2013 as the chairs and teacups used in the breakfast scenes. They can be kinda funny but that's their main purpose \u2013 besides the absurd ammount of fan service you get with the female characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI\u2019m givin\u2019 it na 8 just because of all the different endings, that where not only original, but also entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 6\\n\r\nIt's not terrible, you can watch it at a saturday night when you're bored, but it\u2019s not one of those titles that I would recommend watching, because honestly it wouldn't even occur to me, as all in all the story is kinda forgettable when in comparison with other animes in all the genres this one tried to be.",

Also with friends at her school too. I have this feeling her past will catch up to her.  She decides to break away from her family and life. In order for her to live independently she lives in this mansion \"Ayakashi Kan\" (House of Spirit/Demons/Ghosts/Youkai) where she meets her SS-Secret Service Miketsukami, Soushi who is her servant, guard etc. She rejects the SSand him but i have feeling she''s change along the way. Other members of this mansion live here and have their own personal SS. But this mansion houses\" people\" with special abilities/powers. We find out Ririchio SS is a fox spirit( at first i though OMG -Inuyasha like  demon  XD) but not really.  Looking forward for more episodes.",

The picture I saw hinted at romance\r\nI liked how the animation style switched between normal and chibi to make the funny moments even funnier.  The story was mostly fun and light-hearted and was not about fighting like I was expecting.  They only had to fight three or four times and they were not that serious.  The story did not have that many screwed up events in it.  The worst one concerned Miketsukami butit wasn't as bad as other good shows I've seen.  (Gosick had worse for example)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime pushed all of my buttons.  It was cute.  There was romance.  There was just the right amount of sex appeal, which was centered around Ririchiyo Shirakiin's cleavage and was sprinkled with Nobara being a creeper and Chino's chest.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were excellent.  I loved how unique and sometimes stupid, in terms of fighting ability and functionality, their transformations were.  \\n\r\nMy favorite characters were Ririchiyo, Karuta, and Chino.  I see myself in Ririchiyo Shirakiin but instead of doing that annoying, uptight \"humph\" before every conversation, I don't say anything.  We both have trouble saying what we mean and are honest when we write.  \\n\r\nI like Karuta Roromiya because of her voice and her love of food.  Her throwback form is unexpected and awesome.  \\n\r\nI hated and liked Kagerou at the same time.  I hated him for the type of person he was but liked and laughed so hard at him because of how he flaunted it.  I've wondered what it would be like to be classified by him.  I have an idea of what he would say...\\n\r\nChino was so cute.  She acted cute, her other form was so cute, and I could hear and see Yui.\\n\r\nThe other workers at Maison de Ayakashi are diverse and funny.  \\n\\n\r\nI usually don't like songs sung by guys but the opening song, Nirvana by MUCC, is good.  Most of the ending songs are awesome, especially sweets parade.  SM Hantei Forum made me laugh so hard.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ending made me so happy because I enjoy a good romance and it left the story wide open for development.  Out of the dozen shows I followed this season, Inu x Boku SS is my favorite.  Season 2 Please.",

The Fox Spirit, Miketsukami Soushi is her secret service agent and pledges his life to protect her. In the beginning you feel like there is an underlying story behind his commitment or a reason for his attitude towards his job.\r\nEven though she is projected, I feel that the maincharacter is Soushi, as he commands a certain presence in this anime that drags attention to him. Even if the anime focuses on her problems and how she evolves to make friends, it is really his character that it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finding out about him, it is like that we would go back and watch the series again, just to find out where he gives cues about his life and his reasons.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes a bit slow when it focuses on her;  and then heats up near the absolute end only because you want to know what will happen!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked the anime as the ending was sort of expected but, the end scene was a bit cliche I feel. Anyway, the art of all the transformed ayakashis are really good!!! Love the little horns on Rirchiyos head :P\\n\\n\r\nNot too much action though, sort of wished there was a fight where we couldn't decide who would win! well, that was there but it ended unexpectedly.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, enjoy and pay attention through out the anime for little hints ;)",

I thought it was very sweet and enjoyable, and I really really liked it.\r\nStory:\r\nWhile the story was not an overarching plot-line, nor was it extremely deep, it was very enjoyable.  This series was more of a rom-com than anything else, but it definitely had some drama to it, and the supernatural aspect of it actually worked to enhance the story overall.\r\nArt: \r\nNothing special or extraordinary in the art department, but the series had beautiful, bright colors, and the characters were unique and beautifully drawn.  The artis a teeny bit \"bishie\" but it works quite well, no complaints here.  \\n\r\n(as a side note, while there isn't a TON of fan service, there are definitely a few scenes that are NSFW)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't too memorable, but there were a few pieces that were beautiful and added to certain scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nThis is where the series really shone for me.  I was able to connect and related to Ririchiyo and her social awkwardness and inability to connect with people due to a dark childhood.  Miketsukami on the other hand is a bit harder to get a read on at first.  He seems slightly perverted and is definitely obsessed with Ririchiyo, but we don't really know why until the last few episodes.  But you can't help but like him and have a soft spot for his kindness towards Ririchiyo.  By the end of the series the character development is phenomenal (especially for Ririchiyo).  I ended up loving both Ririchiyo and Miketsukami, and the side characters are lovely and memorable as well.  The side characters have a ton of diversity as well: there is a Trans character, two gay characters, and lots of different family situations, which is very impressive and definitely added to my enjoyment.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this series a lot.  I thought the story was sweet and the characters are wonderful to watch.",

            "content": "There is something very unfortunate about a show that chooses to confirm certain traits and elements of the story that the viewer sometimes wanted kept to the power of the imagination. \r\nOne of the most important things to get out the way when watching this show: The place and role of the main characters, in this case the male and female leads, Miketsukami Soushi and Shirakiin Ririchiyo. Miketsukami is a 22 year old incarnation of the Kyuubi, the fox spirit, and Ririchiyo is a 15 year old high school student. Keeping in mind that this is a clear 7 year difference in age, one cannotblame the casual anime watcher feeling a bit uncomfortable in a situation like this. Seeing as how Japanese culture views older male partners coupling with younger girls and women as acceptable, this is not a fault within the show itself. Although again, it may be odd to some, hence the confusing mix of feelings one feels as he/she completes this show. I say a confusing mix, because Inu x Boku, admittedly, presents a very solid storyline that fulfills its goals and generally feels satisfying. The characters are fleshed out, the humor is original, the animation is very good, and the situations are unique to themselves. There would seem to be a paucity of complaints, but it is because it is such a solid show that problems arise. \\n\\n\r\nThe big one, and this may not be a problem to most (much more of a personal problem). The age gap between our respective love couple. The reason for such discontent with the romance aspect of this show is because the show presents such a deep past that links together with the present to create a meaningful, not-spur-of-the-moment love that is justified in all sense. The feelings of loneliness, lost identity, and the need for \"reciprocation\" between one another in the process of healing, are all perfectly identifiable and explainable in every sense. As people, the love is honestly genuine. But yet, I just can't seem to rid the thought of, \"What if the age gap was a bit smaller? Would it feel more... relatable? More 'romantic'?\" Of course, all of this rests on the subjective opinion that the closer you are in age, the more likely you are to understand your loved one. It may be true in some sense, but the show sets up the plot so that it proves such an idea otherwise, which I find impressive and also a bit frustrating. For me, at the end of the last episode, it felt unbalanced even when the show went to great lengths to make sure that it didn't. \\n\\n\r\n\"Happiness from love transcends age difference\". I wonder then, where the line is drawn, if at all? \\n\\n\r\nOne thing Inu x Boku had going for it was the small cast of interesting SIDE characters. Although their own stories were trivially small compared to the main leads', it kept the show moving and respectably created an atmosphere full of personality and purpose. Aside from the 'main' side characters(yes, main side characters), some of the side characters made relatively few appearances, which wasn't a problem necessarily. But, I would have liked to have seen all of them more equally. However, the interesting personalities of the characters that DID make recurring appearances were enough rapports to continue on the main storyline. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the personality of the main male character simply did not resonate with me, but I found his obedience and extreme level of devotion somewhat dull and expected. It became a punchline that quickly grew old a few episodes in, and I felt that they could have done a much better job of refining his personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was not particularly noteworthy, and I don't remember any of the musics played. Looking back, it almost seemed like an afterthought, like it blended a bit too much into the background. \\n\\n\r\nInu x Boku is an original love story, but could have most definitely stood out more than it did. Short and sweet, but nothing that popped out.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

This is one of the greatest and almost beautiful love story I have seen in a very, very long time.\r\nFirst of all let's start with the storyline...well, there really wasn't any at all. But this really follows the manga so well, I'd almost say they got it word for word! The first episode describes a youngsixteen year old girl named Ririchiyo who is moving into an apartment on her own. Serving her \"until the death\" is Soushi, a young, mysterious man that seems almost emotionless. Though the first part of the series the storyline seems to be not picking up and I was starting to lose interest until BAM, it hit me like light and I was hooked for the rest of the season. The series also accompanies many other characters that have a personality all of their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was simply beautiful, it gives us everything, including detail, emotions, and the feeling of the characters. Watchers may find themselves feeling the same emotion as the main girl Ririchiyo (in which she goes thought some confusing mixed feelings continually throughout the series). \\n\\n\r\nAs I first said a couple paragraphs before this, almost all of the characters pull of many moments that create a sense of personality. One thing I absolute hate about some Anime is that some characters seem \"robotish\" or \"no personality\" and that's clearly out right BORING for me. I find myself itching for some personality or at least some creativity of some sort I can relate or want to relate too and this anime delivers it luckily.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, absolute LOVE \u2665 Once you finish this whole series you find yourself feeling all fuzzy inside and that's a promise! I recommend watching this if you want some romantic comedy and girls, if you have a heart that is dying to melt watch this! I guarantee you won't regret it~",

Overall, the first episode was an excellent start to the series.\r\nBut then, as the story progressed on, Ririchyo changed. Instead of being some badass character who wanted to get along with everyone, she changed into a shoujo who fell in love, and the latest few episodes focused a lot on her feelings and shoujo character development.\r\nComparing to the comedy, and the set up of the first few episodes, the latest fewepisodes were really disappointing. It loses the comedic feel to it, and begins to show signs of some cliche shoujo\\n\\n\r\nAccording to MAL, this series has 12 episodes, so I'm having my fingers crossed that the last few will become much more exciting and action-filled. \\n\\n\r\nThough I must add, the sound and the OST is absolutely awesome.

            "content": "What was I expecting when I started watching Inu x Boku SS? I really don't know, something entertaining at the very least? Unfortunately, Inu x Boku is nothing of the sort, just an episodic hodgepodge of random scenarios with little-to-no overarching plot. I'm actually not sure what this was supposed to be. A romance? If so, it certainly lacked progression until the very end. A comedy? Well, it didn't really make me laugh very much, which I admit, is somewhat subjective, but the humor didn't work for me, outside of a few characters or episodes. Supernatural? I guess it had supernatural elements. Honestly, those werethe highlight of the show, but the supernatural powers got so little focus that they may as well have been just a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, Inu x Boku is going to blow absolutely nobody away. It's rather basic in every way and is starting to look a little dated as the years pass. That's not to say it's not acceptable, but it may look really old in a few years. The big win for Inu x Boku was the songs. I really liked the opening and the changing endings, it added an air of personality to each episode, which was refreshing. Outside of those things, nothing about Inu x Boku is a technical marvel, it's only acceptable at best.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Kagerou Shoukiin\\n\\n\r\nI was a hair away from saying that Karuta was my favorite, but I had to give it to my S&M dude. Honestly, his introductory episode was the funniest in the entire series, I was legit laughing out loud because of his antics. I aspire to go around labeling things as sadistic or masochistic now because of him.\\n\r\nTo be clear, I did like some of the cast, even if it's not as many of them as I would have liked. Sorinozuka, or the scroll dude, was really funny as well, especially with his interactions with Nobara, his perverted, lesbian secret service agent. Nobara in general was a hilarious character. However, I cannot say that I loved the main two characters very much. They kind of felt as if someone was like, \"Hey, we have these two pieces of cardboard for main characters, so let's give them a personality.\" and then they decided to make one piece of cardboard a self-pitying loli tsundere and the other an overly attached stalker. I felt zero connection to either of them throughout the entire series. Not once did I feel anything other than boredom when they came onto the screen. If you've followed my reviewing at all, you know I'm a huge shipper and this show didn't even make me bother with shipping characters, because they were so mediocre outside of a select few.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know if I'm disappointed by Inu x Boku or just relieved to be done with it. To make a confession, I was kind of half asleep for the last 3-4 episodes, if not even longer, so I may have missed out on the best the show had to offer. However, I feel as if that proves my point though. Inu x Boku couldn't even command enough of my attention for a single cour, that's how bland it is.",

They could of done much more  with what they gave us, I feel they could of expanded some more on the things that we were first told in the first episode about their ancestors and such and less about the main protagonists everyday life (mainly school), that I could of done without. because they spent good amount of time each episode of the protagonists morning routine. \r\n  However, If youcan get those quirks out of the way, you have yourself a rather well done anime. There is one thing that really stood out with this anime, and that was it's character development. You really learn lot about most of the characters anywhere from their personalities to there past or really just anything about them, and I feel that really helped the show out.\\n\r\n The comedy was well done, short lived jokes but they were enjoyable to laugh at.\\n\\n\r\n The art and sound I found no problems. The art wasn't anything special or finely detailed, and the sound was normal. Very average but not bad.\\n\\n\r\n I gave this anime a 7 out of ten. I recommend this anime for those who are looking for a romance with a few fight scenes. Enjoy.",

Its about a girl, Ririchiyo, who doesn't really know how to socialize with other people and by going to this dorm, Ayakashi Kan, where she meets many interesting people who she later calls friends. On her first day she meets a guy, Soushi Miketsukami, who swears to protect her as like her body guard. Soushi is very loyal like a dog otherwise referred to as the Inu. Many twists in turns happen in this anime I found myself intregued and wanting more and more each week.If you like a anime where you laugh at almost all the episodes which at the same time cheering on Ririchiyo as she begins to fall in love with a certain guy in here but I will say no more or I might spoil it. The point is if your into romcoms this is the anime for you. This is a anime not only for girls but for guys. :)\\n\\n\r\n(10) Art: The art is amazing! I'm sure most of you noticed how hot the guys are in Inu X Boku SS! xD I find that all the characters are drawn out well, I read the manga and the art is right on. I actually judge wheather I like the show or not by the image. Like if the art is crappy then I find it hard to enjoy it more without a clear picture. \\n\\n\r\n(10) Sound: Sounds were good and clear. I actually think their voices suited them well. \\n\\n\r\n(10) Character: The characters have great personalities and their looks and voices went with them very well! :)\\n\\n\r\n(10) Enjoyment: You will surely enjoy this anime, one episode will have you hooked and wanting more!! :)\\n\\n\r\n(10) Overall: Overall this anime is the best! It has everything good that you look for in a anime! It has the surprise factors, everything! I guarentee you this once you watch that very first episode you will fall in love with this series. After you finish you will be wanting more and believe you me I am! :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "That turned out to be very different from what I originally expected, but that became clear in the very first episode.  After that the plot became extremely obvious -- yes, including the Big Reveal; though maybe one has to have some vague familiarity with Cyrano de Bergerac to see that coming.  I feel most of the potential of the anime was wasted on routine comedy bits, and consequently I feel let down.\r\nStory:  Decent set-up, both in regard to the cast being half-youkai, and Ririchiyo's acid tongue, though the whole \"secret service\" nonsense made me roll my eyes.  But the show didnothing much with the youkai past a couple of action scenes, and Ririchiyo's tongue wasn't all that acidic.  Instead much time was spent on weak comedy gags that I would have wanted to see spent on fleshing out the potentially interesting cast of characters.  The mystery wasn't very mysterious to me, and I think the writer failed in finding a good way to give us much of the information during the first 10 episodes, instead of infodumping it all in one giant lump at the end.  It tried some feeble foreshadowing by giving occasional flashes of Miketsukami, but they were actually a bit misleading.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Very nice art, especially the character art -- each character looked completely different so there was no need to try and distinguish them by hair color, and at the same time the art felt very unified (I noticed that especially since I recently watched Baby Steps which had very uneven character design).  Animation was fluid and smooth, and there were lots of small details that are not often animated.  Ririchiyo's hair was basically its own character.  The changing EDs got their own animations which was fun.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Quite the star voice talent here, and while some of the comedy sounded way over the top, it was obviously designed that way.  I liked the OP but not the performance by MUCC, it sounded as it exceeded the range of the lead singer.  The ED changed frequently and was sung by one or more cast members. BGM was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ririchiyo was the only one who got any serious development.  She was intellectually very bright, but at the same time emotionally naive, which always strikes me as odd -- how can one be so very naive if one is actually well-read?  I would have liked her to be a bit more astute, though in several important moments she was actually completely on the ball.  I liked her rather a lot.  Miketsukami started out so fawningly obsequious that despite his innate hotness (of course he also had to be a fox spirit, my favourite) I didn't really care for him at first because humans behaving like doormats make me very uncomfortable -- but he was also very competent, and I figured out his secret early on, that changed my mind.  got some development during the big infodump, and as I mentioned above, I would have preferred more of that during the run-up.  All the other characters get minimal personalities, and while they are well delineated, there's no development; they're just props, some more than others.  I could really do without the ridiculous tranny and camp gay characters; it'd be nice to just once get a decent trans or gay character instead, outside of BL anime.\\n\\n\r\nI rather enjoyed it, but felt a bit empty afterwards.  If you like standard anime comedy where women poke each other's large boobs, and people totally overreact, then you might enjoy the humour.  I found the situational humour born from Ririchiyo's outer expressions and inner feelings funnier, though I also liked Zange's mischief.  Otherwise it's a cute, little romance (I am not bothered by the age difference; she's a pretty mature 15 year old, and they're not doing anything H yet).\\n\\n\r\nOh, and if you watch the special, you'll see that Kagerou was right about one thing:  Miketsukami totally is an S.  ;)\\n\\n",

Mind you, this review is solely based on my opinion alone, It isn't related to the manga in anyway.\r\nSo, main question: Is this anime worth watching?\r\nWell, the answer is complex. It depends on how you want the story to turn out. Lots of people have expressed their views on this anime, most of them liking how it turned out, while others wanting it to be a dark-toned anime, inspired from the dark manga. Inu x boku SS is an anime, that atfirst glance, is seen as cheery. And, yes it is. It takes a different approach than the manga, being someone who read the manga after watching the anime, I see it as a light-hearted romantic comedy, with a few supernatural themes added here and there. If you like this genre of romance, then I guarantee you will like this anime, a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are outstanding, the art is amazing, the voice actors did an amazing job voice-acting and overall, the story is eye-catching and not cliche at all.\\n\\n\r\nGive this a go, I promise it will not disappoint anyone who holds a strong liking for romance and supernatural anime. And those who have read the manga, this might seem okayish but give it a go, anyways. Who knows? You might enjoy it.",

It isn't a ground breaking anime by any means but its just a lighthearted romance comedy. The female protagonist is pretty chill even though i hate tsunderes in general. What got me is the male protagonist. I hated his personality so much. He was creepy to the max. I know they tried to make his creepiness funny, but idk. It just didn't work for me. The age gap wasn't helping either. ACT YOUR AGE! Sometimes i justwanted elbow him in the throat. His back story explains why he's that way but come on bruh!  The other characters were cool and funny which really made the anime enjoyable to me. The art was pleasing to the eyes. I think the art was the best part about this anime. Overall it was a 7 in my book.",

So it can be relative by a huge margin. \r\nBut I digress, both were interesting enough, the story has its rythm, slowly expanding, developing and introducing new characters, and the art supported the anime very well. The OP is beautiful,if a character needs to be portraited in a certain way, make the viewer believe in those emotions, it got it across overall quite well. A plus for the cute moments, I really enjoyed those alot, if the art sucked, it would had diminuished the enjoyment greatly.\\n\r\nI also want to mention that while I felt satisfied with the story conclusion's, it felt a bit rushed in the latter parts of the last episode. \\n\r\nAnd episode 11 by far was the best episode, in terms of storytelling, it gave some much needed feedback Soushi, and I was honestly touched with its story. It gave the needed development for a character, better than I though it would give.\\n\\n\r\nNothing special for the sound, but the OP song is great, plus having more than 5 EDs for different episodes, that fit in nature with the content previously showed, was a good idea, and makes waiting and watching the ED more meaningfull.\\n\\n\r\nI said the anime was a bit excentric. The reason is due to the cast.\\n\r\nThe 2 main characters (aka MCs) are Ririchiyo and Soushi.\\n\r\nI came to enjoy alot Ririchiyo personality, she main she too lofty at first, but that is due to her difficulty in how to approuch other people, and in fact she is a very caring, cute and kind person, despite her harsh tongue, she is a very sensitive and shy person. One of the pleasures of the anime, was seeing her develop, grown closer to others, and of course, those cute moments! Ririchiyo you soo kawaii~~\\n\r\nFor the other MC, finding for yourself would be better, but I was plenty surprised. Better than I expected for sure (reference to episode 11 again).\\n\r\nBut it is the great variety and amount of supportive cast that makes the anime so excentric, in a good way, I pretend to make it short, so you get a guy who classifies everything as either masochism or sadism, likes to put a spikey collar on his SS agent, a girl that seems emotionless, but is actually very kind and attentive person. A deliquent who keeps affirm himseld to be as so, but is probably one of the more fragile and generous persons in the anime, a guy that hears rabbit ears, and has a \"naughty\" personality, these are the main supportive cast, but I could go a bit further, with other personas, everyone adds something to the anime. On paper they may seem generic, but it really works well and is refreshing, and the whole cast is animated and interacts with each other.\\n\\n\r\nMay enjoyment depends greatly of the characters, I would say it got even better the last episodes, with some great laughs and more emotive scenes, but looking back, there were plentyful of scenes that were very enjoyful and meaningful.\\n\r\nBut again, my enjoyment got a higher grade with episode 11, something that was left empty, finally was put into its proper place, thus the whole picture started to make more sense.\\n\r\nI found myself liking the anime more after it ended, than when I was at the middle term of it.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to give the show a score, it would be a 8.4, but I do think it is more important to read the text with why you may come to enjoy the anime, so for a TL;DR, focus more on what is below, than the rating itself.\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nIt is a romcom, more excentric than usual, the cast is very interesting, dont expect much from the story, there are some cute moments, that will leave you all cozy and happy, there is romance, but IMO the latter part of the segment was a bit rushed, nothing that affected the overall experience thought.\\n\r\nIf you look to have a fun time, with something more meaningfull than some shitty romcoms, give the show a try, dont expect alot of action or amazing plot development, but something with its charm and originality that will graduality keep your enjoyment, with some minor twists here and there. Besides that just ignore the controversial aspect of the MC relationship (wait for episode 11 for the most of it), and have a good time.  \\n\\n",

The art I gave a 9-- it's very good and beautiful. The sound was phenomenal-- no weird noises inthe background, no odd voices. For the character, I gave it a 10 because I could not only relate to them, but they also delve a little deeper into the main two at least, and it creates more character development. \\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this one-- even stayed up until six am and finished the series in less than 2 days (I started at night, otherwise it would have only been a day.) I wish I would have spread it out more because I really miss them already. \\n\r\nOverall I'm giving it a 9.\\n\\n\r\n\u10e6\\n\\n\r\nInu x Boku is about Shirakiin Ririchiyo, a girl who suffers from a bad habit of always having a sarcastic, rude retort on her lips. She's afraid to get close to others and has lived a pretty lonely life.\\n\r\nBecause of who, or rather what, she is, she goes to Ayakashi Kan mansion where she wants to be alone. Instead, however, she finds friends and people like her, along with a Secret Service Fox Spirit, Miketsukami, whom she did not request. He is very loyal and kind towards her, and almost creepily dedicated to her.\\n\r\nThis was a big reason why this anime stood out to me-- in others like this, the Fox Spirit (or whatever they may be) is typically annoyed at having to watch after someone, but this time, it's the girl being looked after that's annoyed (until she realizes she's not annoyed by him), while he goes as far as to bow down to her and ask her to call him her \"Loyal Dog.\"\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, (and sorry if this review isn't the best, it's my first), this was an amazing anime, full of romance and friendship and a girl finding her place and trying to fix herself all the while. \\n\r\nAt first, s",

            "content": "When I began watching this anime series not too long ago from this dated critique, it felt like this anime was trying to make us believe we knew everything about each of the character's backgrounds. Ririchiyo (the main protagonist) has the problem of being smart-mouthed and verbally abused the people around her. Then she meets Miketsukami, her new SS bodyguard at Maison de Ayakashi. He is unnerved by her verbal language, and continues to serve her as a devoted ''dog''. However, the first few episodes replay the same routine with Miketsukami waking her up, giving her breakfast, and her watching a video about dog obedienceon a flatscreen TV at the mall. The story takes a turn when she goes to high school at freshman year. \\n\\n\r\nThere were many comedic scenes, especially Miketsukami's invisible ears and tails and Nobaru's ''Maniac'' when it comes to girl magazines. \\n\\n\r\n The art style was indeed enjoyable and it matched with many recent anime styles nowadays. And there were moments when the characters turn into ''chibis'' for adorable reference. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose the turning points would be Episode 11 and 12, explaining Miketsukami's past and how he knew so much about Ririchiyo. The two confess to each other, becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. The OVA shows the development in their relationship as Miketsukami tries to teach her on how to become more intimate. The show ends in a happy ending...for now.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler: \\n\r\nFor Arc 2 of the manga, here comes the biggest PLOT TWIST. \\n\r\nIf the animation team were to animate the second part of the manga, then things go downhill fast. It becomes more bloodier than the first 12 episodes, resulting in massive trauma and pain for everybody. I could understand why they didn't animate the whole manga and another reason being they couldn't find a simpler way on how to show reincarnation. All the characters travel to a new timeline, with different ages signifying their death and their birth (If you die first, you were born first. Banri (the golden-hair boy with blue  eyes) is the youngest since he was the one to die last during the Night Parade. \\n\\n\r\nI was basically going through many emotions on seeing how they cope to Miketsukami's death. The Miketsukami that reincarnated didn't remember anything from his previous life, making him distant from the other characters. Still, the manga ended on a very happy note, featuring their son wearing glasses. \\n",

There's no doubt that people of such demographic I've mentioned above will not be able to get enough of shitty comedy gags presented in this anime. The 10% of significant plot screen time will just be the icing on the cake.\r\nPlot:\r\nThe story is nothing you haven't seen before (granted you're somewhat anexperienced anime viewer). Two people searching for someone to help understand themselves due to their cruel circumstances in the past caused by strict family traditions with a mix of Japanese folklore.\\n\\n\r\nCast:\\n\r\nCharacters are fun and diverse, but the poor choice of gags render them insignificant and dull.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nAnimation is fluid, and the art quality is pretty much what you would expect in anime these days.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVoice acting is fine. OP and ED songs are crappy to mediocre depending on your music taste, though there's one INS song I liked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn my opnion, this anime should have been a short 3-4 OVAs to maximize the romance aspect and not not be ruined by 10 episodes of crappy redundant comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I'd suggest you watch 1-3 episodes first and see if you agree with my feelings toward the comedy aspect of the show. If you do, I'd suggest you skip to episode 10 and thank me later.\\n\\n\r\nStay safe.",

However Inu x Boku manages to keep them apart which means the viewer can enjoy both the seriousness of the romance and the laughter separately. Furthermore the action scenes, while few and far between, are used to help drive the romance at key moments. Just don\u2019t expect flashy fight scenes.\r\nThe characters are all fairly individualand none are alike and often appear to be opposite to what they first seem to be. Also they all provide their own different comedy moments with their personalities and characteristics which are so varied that there really should be something for everybody. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, this anime does have a familiar romance plot however it goes about delivering that in an unusual way which is interesting and refreshing. The characters are likable and will grow on you even if your first impressions of them weren't fantastic. It\u2019s an anime that will leave you thinking about it for days after you have finished with it.",

I would recommend it to anyone who likes rom-coms, action and some very emotional scenes.\r\nIt is full of character development. Throughout the anime there are many scenes which look into the past to see what made the characters the way they are. The storyline was quite interesting but also quite cliche. It was a typical story of a girl meeting a guy who fell for her and she for him. However the twists and turns in the plot of the storywere quite riveting, as you do not expect what happens and the story behind a character near the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nThe plot was a little cliche. However the fact that the residents of the hotel/house were part demon/spirit etc. was interesting and different to other animes.\\n\r\nRirichiyo was an interesting character however she was a quite typical tsundere whose personality and actions got a bit annoying after a while. This combined with the personality of Karuta made a few main characters a little boring and cliche. However all in all the character development was quite well done and it is quite easy to sympathise and connect to Ririchiyo and a few of the other main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it was an interesting, quite different, yet quite slow paced anime which was quite enjoyable and full of emotional scenes intertwined with comedic scenes.",

(WONT SPOIL IT HMPH!)\r\nArt: REALLY REALLY NICE!\r\nCharacter: You have your main female protagonist... which is a total tsundere... but unlike many of the tsunderes in other anime, she does have a reason for her behavior and a sad past. And then there is the main male character... And oh boy... Black Butler being my fav anime... I amquite attached to the complex of master-servent..... but not like this.... THIS REALLY WAS SOMETHING!\\n\r\nAnd then you have some other supporting characters that are majorly in for the comedy part of the show... and maybe just one or two are actually relevant to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: The opening was really really really mega awsome! And what I liked about this anime in comparison with others is that each episode had a different ending. So nice!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I personally am a shipping fangirl... and whenever I watch a show... It doesnt matter which show.. I imediatly found an OTP. And this was perfect!

            "content": "*spoiler free* \r\nI'm going to be honest, when I started this show (it was recommended by a close friend) I wasn't sure if I would like it. The first few episodes were alright, but they were extremely episodic, and while they were entertaining while watching them, the motivation to watch them really wasn't there because of the initial lack of character development and continuous storyline. \r\nHowever, towards the end, the story and character development picked up and made a genuinely interesting anime! \r\nThe art was very beautiful, and while I didn't initially like the opening theme, it grew on me. Each episode has a differentclosing too, which was a nice touch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this! \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if: you want a crack version of SebastianXCiel where they're around the same age, you like the butlerXmaster stuff, you like episodic shows, you like hints of supernatural, you like tsundere romance\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if: you're looking for a strong overarching plot, you're looking for something other than romance, you're looking for a show where the supernatural element is heavily played upon\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "Essentially what Inu x Boku SS is, is a series about a teenage girl who has put up a social barrier, looking down and pushing away any and everyone that tries to be nice to her.  This is mainly because of the fact of how she's generally looked at.  Being from a prestigious family, people more often than not don't help her out of goodness, but for reward or recognition from her family.  So with that said she moves into a mansion that is very specific as to who may live in there, and each tenant is assigned a secret service (SS)agent. \\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10:  The story isn't particularly compelling, it does have supernatural elements to it, but they aren't delved into very deeply.  They're certainly touched upon and a focal point of the show, but in a way that may not satisfy people who would watch this solely for the supernatural element.  That said, it's just enough to moves things along nicely, and throw a couple of \"curveballs\" that makes suspending belief a lot easier.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10:  There wasn't anything special really about the art, however that doesn't mean it was good and solid throughout.  The character designs were all fantastic and colorful, but the setting wasn't anything to call home about.  The fights in the show were actually well done for the most part, though they weren't ever very long or focused upon to show much off.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:  Surprisingly, this was one of my most liked aspects of the show.  The opening and ending were great and fit the show perfectly.  As well as the soundtrack throughout the series that played throughout the battles and more relaxed/comedic scenes, it all complimented everything that was going on very nicely.  The voice actors were also a wonderful crop, Miyano Mamoru (Okabe Rintarou, Yagami Light) was unique again, Hana Kanezawa, Sugita Tomokazu etc.  They were all perfect for their respective roles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:  This was my favorite part of the entire series, was the cast of diverse and colorful characters, perfectly voiced as I mentioned already.  Though my favorite part, there were a couple of recurring quirks for a couple of characters that were sometimes somewhat off-putting.  Rirchiyo I thought was a good main girl overall, but at some point I thought she got to \"cutely bashful\", and took it too far sometimes.  That being said, overall she was good as were the others given my rating, and is the backbone of this series for sure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:  Not much to say here other than I really enjoyed this series for what it was, a great comedy/supernatural/slice of life/romance sort of show.  At some point or other, all of these elements are prevalent and were mostly well executed.  At 12 episodes it's a nice quick watch, and I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of any of the genres I just mentioned.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:  For those looking for an enjoyable watch that can make you laugh from time to time and make you feel for the characters, I recommend this to you.  The first 2-3 episodes are good, but then more gets quickly introduced to the story giving it more life, so hold out until then if you aren't immediately attracted or pulled in.",

Art I give a 10,  Sound I give a 9, character i give a 10, Enjoyment i give a 11,000,000,000 ,Overall i give it a 10. hopefully you'll have as much as enjoyment as i did with this series, only thing i was disappointed in was that crunchyroll told me there was 13 episodes when there was only 12. I was so hurt. but enjoy the anime! I'd definitely rewatch this in the future!!",

I wish that it would have so much more action instead of making this into shoujo slice of life thing. It's so boring, I mean the comedy and the fan service is great but I am getting so bored with this. Plus these people are DEMONS/SPIRITS, they're not exactly scary. It would be wonderful serious if it wasn't so fluff and happy. It also tries toseem badass when they turn into demons and it make the series seem really like a try-hard. They're is too much light in this series for the Demon thing to work, especially with this art. So I give the Story 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWonderful. I love the smooth lines and everything. Its so simple yet detailed and the colors are simple. Very well put together, so a 10/10 for Art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVoices are okay but the opening doesn't look right with this kind of series. I like the ending song so 7/10 for Sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOkay so lets start with Ririchiyo, she's a tsundere who feels guilty everytime she says something bad, which I have never heard a tsundere do. Soushi creepy loli butler dude, a little too loyal for me. Karuta I love her character, she has moe written all over, she is perfect they should have made the show about her. Wataku, I ship him with Karuta. The snow lady and the paper italian dude, don't know about them. Yes so overally I only like Karuta and Wataku. Because of them I give Character a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI guess I enjoy watching this show because of Karuta. so 8/10 because of Karuta.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n6/10, Do I recommend this? Yes, if you're bored. If you're looking for something really good it'll be in you're favorites then no I wouldn't recommend this.",

            "content": "Ririchiyo is a broken girl, as a descendant of a demon with rich blood, she is treated like an object rather than a person. To get away from all the deceit and fake smiles, she moves to Demon Manor, a place full of other descendants like her, specifically to be alone. However, every tenant of Demon Manor is assigned a protective guard, aptly named \"Secret Service\". How will Ririchiyo react when she meets her bishounen guard?\r\nWhen I started watching this I felt a lot of deja vu with other series. The main heroine Ririchiyo looks a lot like the heroine from Ookami Kakushi, the descendedfrom demons theme reminded me of Zakuro/Inuyasha, and the unlimited-willed destined male reminded me of Kaichou-wa Maid sama and Special A. Regardless of speculative feelings, the series is a very direct girl meets boy show similar to Kaichou and Special A. The main deviation from the similar series is that the main heroine is a loli tsundere. This is a series where you will either love or hate the main character; you can either blame her for her non-stop, acrid mouth or you can sympathize with her inexperience at dealing with people. Overall, I thought it was a decent watch but nowhere near Kobato or Kaichou levels.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nRandom characters aside, the animation here is pretty standard fare. Backgrounds are nicely detailed, colors are slightly faded, and the overall setting is believable.\\n\\n\r\nNow the actual residents of Demon Manor are something to behold. All the residents can transform into their demon form, be it a raccoon dog, mini-troll, or a paper scroll. Once you get over the initial wtf it isn't that bad as the supporting characters really take a back stage to the main action. I will never get the Japanese addiction with heterochromia and eye patches.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fairly tranquil series, there are a few minor scuffles but nothing that would satisfy a true action seeker. There is also relatively little fan-service/ecchi to cover up so I don't know how they're going to sell the Blu-Rays...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI typically don't like many dude OPs, this is one of them. The EDs are voiced by the VAs and range from Ririchiyo's lullaby to a questionably-informative S&M description. It doesn't get much better when you move to the BGM. Usually I'm fine with minimalist, instrumental BGMs; but in this case the series is already slow enough that adding a few slow pieces really is asking for bedtime.\\n\\n\r\nVA-wise, uber-young Rina Hidaka gets her shot at playing tsundere. I'm not completely certain but perhaps she was trying to make the tsun sound a bit forced given Ririchiyo's history. The only major surprise for me was having Kana Hanazawa play such a quiet, monotone character; I still hear \"Kobato ganbarimasu!\" and \"Tu-tu-ru~\" ringing in my ears...\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis is a very linear story with an ending you can predict after seeing the first episode. You can also predict a fair amount of how they get there as well. What you probably won't predict is the major mystery piece, how is it that Ririchiyo had previously saved her questionably-indebted fox-demon servant/guard/dog? This is the only thing that will probably keep you watching.\\n\\n\r\nPlot-wise, there isn't much going on in this series, you can practically jump from episode 3 to episode 10 without missing much in terms of plot. What you will be missing out on is a lot of character interactions. The climax near the end of the series, I don't even know if I should call it a climax, isn't really much of one as it's more of an entire episode of \"ooooooh that's what it's all about.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis series is all about character interactions, specifically how Ririchoyo's interactions with her inu changes her personality forever. It differs, arguably in a good way, from a lot of peers in that it focuses heavily on one relationship. Apparently Ririchiyo had previously freed her inu in the past somehow. So in the middle, you get a lot of Ririchiyo trying her best to hide her dere under a lot of forced Tsun.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this is supposed to be a somewhat romantic series. However, unlike Kaichou and even Kobato, I think there is just too much fiction to make it feel tangible. In that sense I never really grew attached to Ririchiyo. If you watch the first 2 eps and feel for Ririchiyo, this will be a good series for you.\\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting characters, they're pretty weak and only contribute minor humor points; their backgrounds are mostly left blank and many of them leave you with just more questions.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nAs I said in the beginning, this show will be a toss up based on how well you can connect with the main protagonists. This series is very character driven as there really isn't even an antagonist in the series. This is a bit of an endurance run as you're really not rewarded for watching until the very end, and they don't try very hard to keep you watching. Overall, the series setting mixes things up a bit, but I think there are just much stronger \"find your perfect guy\" series out there.",

            "content": "Inu x Boku SS is an enjoyable and simple romance comedy I would suggest to watch in between some more demanding anime. If you enjoy a love story that is lightweight, well-rounded and sweet while balanced with some entertaining comic relief (plus plenty handsome bishonen and cute loli girls), this anime will suit you well.\r\nArt - 8\r\nI liked the artstyle of this anime quite a bit. Fitting with the story, the art is very light and smooth; all characters are uniquely designed and memorable. The anime also picks up some art-clich\u00e9s, though mainly in a humorous way (e.g. the male main character sparkling) and duringcomic-relief scenes, the characters are often depictes as chibi, which I found to be appropriate and entertaining. In terms of the animation, I have no complaints. The fighting scenes are well done but nothing special, which I didn't mind since they're not the core of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Enjoyment - 7\\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed the story as a whole, the anime felt a little slow to me at times. Many episodes seemed like fillers even though the anime is quite short to begin with. Having said that, every episode has its own entertainment value and compliments the whole story in the end; also I had a lot of fun discovering every side character's personality, sometimes even more than focussing on the main plot. How the love story between the two main characters, Ririchiyo and Miketsukami, played out, was a little predictable to me but nevertheless a pleasure to watch, mainly because of the character development taking place in the second part of the anime. For some reason, I didn't find the source of the characters' powers all that convincing and they didn't add much to the romance-focussed anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn general -- Inu x Boku SS does not supply you with the most original love story or the most epic fighting scenes of all times, but manages to draw you in nonetheless. It is a great watch for everyone looking for a funny and heartwarming story with not too much substance to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\nAt first I assumed most of the characters, main and secondary, were based on clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, as is often the case in anime of that kind, though I was surprised by how quickly they all managed to win me over within only a few episodes. Ririchiyo is quite relatable and you quickly get to discover her personality and quirks. Miketsukami seems like a typical bishonen that everybody immediately falls in love with, but his back story is quite interesting and unique. I definitely enjoyed the dynamic between the two. However, it was the supporting characters that really helped me get into the anime the most. I liked most of the comic relief they brought to the show, and the way they helped Ririchiyo's character development. In the end I would have loved some more development of the secondary characters as well, but overall I was contented.\\n\\n\r\nIn general -- If you're not entirely sure whether to watch this anime or not, I can promise you that the characters are worth giving it a try.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nInu x Boku SS was interesting and humorous enough to keep me watching, which is rarely the case for I'm not a fan of romance-comedy in general, and overall I happened to enjoy it quite a bit. I would recommend everybody to give it a try even though this might not be your preferred genre either. Coming from a lot of shonen/seinen anime with tons of fights and gore, this made for a nice change.",

            "content": "Inu x Boku SS is about characters descendant from spirits who live in a secluded mansion with their bodyguards.  First off, I wanted to love this anime, but I couldn't, and I will get into that.  The story follows Shirakiin Ririchiyo who has a distorted personality because of her past.  She struggles to change herself and things begin to look brighter when she meets her bodyguard Miketsukami S\u014dshi.    The anime wasn't awful but it didn't reach it's potential in my opinion and here's my breakdown:\r\nArt: The art was beautiful.  That's one thing this anime really had going forit.  It was a refreshing style I haven't seen much before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters were each unique, though many lack change and that got a bit dull as the anime continued and the only characters I felt I really knew were the two main characters.  I wanted more of the supporting characters, but when an anime is only 12 episodes long I guess you can't expect much.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Here is where I have my problems with this anime.  The anime started with momentum and I was hooked and then it just flatlined.  I was bored out of my mind with the entire middle of this anime.  Nothing was really happening.  It was like I was being forced to watch filler episodes because that was all it was.  Thank goodness the end was strong.  The few beginning episodes and the three end episodes were the only ones worth watching.  I would have given this anime such a higher rating if the rest of the episodes were like the beginning and end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find this anime frustrating because it could have been so good but it just lacked in the end.  I'm assuming the manga is so much better (I haven't read it) but the anime was just lackluster.",

The characters aren't repetitive in the show they stick to their nature through out.  I like the settings and the back story. I do feel they could have kept with the supernatural element a bit more in my opinion but that wasn't exactly key to the in depth meaning to the story so it's respectable and it does well without.\\n\\n\r\nThis show gets an A+ in my book :)",

            "content": "(Story 9)\r\nLately i have been watching lots of romantic Anime and so far, this was the cutest one i have ever seen. Besides its romantic genre, we find in the story line a complex issue whereby ,Ririchiyo Shirakiin, a little girl from a royal descent wants to be accepted no matter how she is. Transferred to Room 4 of the Ayakashi Mansion, she, thus, builds up a new life and meets with new comrades. However, the one who clearly understands her inner feelings is  S\u014dshi Miketsukami, her loyal servant with a mysterious past. As the story enfolds, we learn to understand the characters evenif there's not much said on the two main protagonists' fellow friends. Much emphasis is on Miss Ririchiyo and Miketsukami and how their relationship strongly progresses throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nWithin the plot:there is a need to mention that only supernatural human being lives in The Maison de Ayakashi.it is a high security apartment building where humans with demon ancestors or y\u014dkai live and are protected by their own Secret Service bodyguard. So  Miss Ririchiyo is guarded by Miketsukami-khun. \\n\\n\r\n(Art 8)\\n\r\nInu x Boku treats the super-naturalistic and the naturalistic separately, whereby humans are rarely getting involved with the yokai/ demon and vice versa.We also find that humans hardly question themselves about those living in the mansions. This anime does not provide immensely distorted characters though transformed into demons. Instead some are given comic and funny transformations. Hence, the attention of the viewer is captured in a blink without being overly artistic. what makes the anime unique is the bond shared by a teenage girl and her loyal servant who is much older than her. Moreover, the anime provides us with some painful flashbacks of the main protagonists from time to time. From a personal point of view, this helps to create a high sense of pathos,likes and dislikes towards the characters. Moreover, Naokatsu Suda (director) has successfully achieved an atmosphere of love, conviviality and charm through the characters however, there is no such place to discover in the anime as the characters remain stagnate around the mansion, school and common places such as shopping mall. Finally, what i like the most about Inu x boku is how the characters are  aesthetically  drawn as expected from a 2012 production.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound 6)\\n\r\nI do not recall much about the music through out the anime may be because i did not pay much attention to the music background. The characters however, strikes us the most with their voice and gestures (which i'll not describe here, see characters). The opening song remain the same from the beginning till the end of the anime series. However, the funniest is the ending songs as it changes randomly in the anime. Note that, viewers must watch the anime even if the ending song is over as the anime continues just before that.\\n\\n\r\n(Characters 8)\\n\r\nRirichiyo Shirakiin ,Voiced by: Rina Hidaka \\n\r\nA half-human, half-oni high school girl who transferred to Room 4 of the Ayakashi Mansion in a bid to start anew.Always being lonely, she is somehow independent as interacting with people is a nightmare for her. She is only dressed in Ultra Blue or black so that we can relate it to her painful past.She is not tall nor has an imposing body feature, the way she talks indicates directly her position as being superior and complex in the anime. Her body ironically does not fit her voice as her body is so tiny and thin compared to the roughness and coldness of her voices. At times her voice changes from bold to light when she is calm and thankful. Ririchiyo has characteristics of a tsundere ( a person who is initially cold,hostile), she is actually a tsunshun (lovey dovey) in terms of personality.\\n\\n\r\nS\u014dshi Miketsukami  Voiced by: Yuichi Nakamura\\n\r\nThe assigned SS Agent to Ririchiyo is probably one of the most appealing character of the anime. S\u014dshi is descended from of the evil nine-tailed fox who was soushi's past life. He's very calm, polite, and gentle to everyone he interacts with, plus he is devoted to his Ririchiyo, blindly obeying her and protecting her with his life if the situation calls for it. Any girl out there will dare to fall in love with him due to his sympathetic cuteness and  his pick up lines were made in such a way that his charming personality attracts you. I am talking out of experience. \\n\\n\r\nOther Characters :Rensh\u014d Sorinozuka,Nobara Yukinok\u014dji, Kager\u014d Sh\u014dkiin,Karuta Roromiya,Banri Watanuki,Zange Natsume. Overall, one can sense the presence of each characters in the anime. They were made to complete each other and most of them have comic appearances in the anime.\\n\r\nThey all have enjoyable voices that suits their personality traits and characters.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment 7)\\n\r\nThough this anime lacks some action and fight scenes whereby the main protagonists would show their real power,abilities, skills, attitude, will and motives, the series provide us with a good and simple comedy line. It is more described as being a light drama due to those flashbacks, however, if you are a fan of romantic genre anime, you would probably enjoy the scenes till the end.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall 7)\\n\r\nas you can see i love this anime because of its simplicity. There's no form of dislike nor resentment towards this anime. This is Romance.\\n",

The only other complaint I'd have is that the background info was kinda sparse, so I had to research on my own what the various creatures were. But that wasn't much of a hassle. Overall, I think it'sa really cute, light-hearted Rom Com that is tinged with a meaningful message. The relationship between the two was built at just the right pace and kept me wanting to know more!",

The romance provided you with a really good happy feeling and the comedy would leave you laughing. The main downside of the anime though was how they completely ignored that all the characters living in the building were half monsters. The first few episodes put a little focus on it and even provided a little bit of action to the show, but over time it slowly faded away and left you wanting more. If they put a little more focus on it, it would have been a far greater anime.",

Other than that, it\u2019s pretty much like Black Butler with a pretty girl instead of Ciel. All of the master/servant/secretly perverse servitude fetish-bases are covered in this series. \r\n\t\u2022 David Production, the infamous company behind JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, produced this series, so the visuals do look very nice. The same chief director as JoJo\u2019s was actually in charge of this series as well; there\u2019s some animation studio cross-contamination. Aesthetically, a very pleasing andindulgent show for the audience. The directing is very good.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The character are mostly all schlocky shoujo manga stereotypes and a weird S&M dude, so the bread and butter of the series are main two protagonists and their relationship, which is rather complex. Something that I\u2019m quite fond of. I liked the duplicity of Soushi\u2019s character and how Chiyo-chan  is not only incredibly moe, but she also is a character that has issues and works on them as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The main characters reminded of the main characters in Kare Kano. The ending was the weakest point of the series, because it felt incredibly rushed and under-developed. The plot is incredibly flippant and deviates a bit from the original manga\u2019s content. It would have done better with a second season, rather than have a bunch of things mashed together, resulting in a rushed, unsatisfying end. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Anime often does this because it as meant as promotional material for the manga, but fer chrissake, you had something really good cooking with Inu x Boku! I was actually invested in the Riri and Soushi\u2019s relationship. I\u2019m not sure whether I would recommend this series or just tell you to check out the manga, since the ending is so unseemly. Because the plot\u2019s coagulation, I decided to give this series a 5/10.\\n",

There's no hardly any action scenes, no heart racing moments, it's basic story line telling of a rich girl and her butler basically.. I still to this moment have no clue what the end goal was apart from that they got together? I found most moments awkward and stupid.. Any romance scenes felt like I was watching two 12 year olds awkwardly oodling each other. It was honestly just.. boring! The backstories weren't that bad even thoughthey could of added abit more to it then it would of been alot better. I like how they made the two end up together aswell (by this I mean the letters they used to send together and not the ending) As for how they came together, I found it really boring and emotionless.. Like wow he found a love letter on accident! Honestly it was all just boring.. I'm pretty sure I fell asleep at some point. I'd also like to add that the age gap between these guys made it awkward for me.. It sometimes made me sick thinking that a 22 year old would date a 15 year old.. Maybe it was just me..\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: I actually liked the art of this anime and found it quite enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Nothing stood out to much to me but it all sounded good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: Some characters were really fucked up and some were actually alright.. The main male lead was borderline stalker/rapist, nothing about the \"romantic\" scenes were anything shy from rapey vibes... Like for christ sake he had a massive wall full of pictures of her at the end (or in the ova).. Anything he said made me cringe and also sick to the stomach. The main female lead wasn't all to bad and I actually enjoyed her backstory to it, she showed how her past affected her on trusting and putting up a barrier to her character. Supporting character weren't that bad either and I really enjoyed most of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it.. But it was boring to say the least. Some scenes seemed pointless and thrown into just fill the 12 episodes. Some parts would get into it about the backstories and the characters but other than that.. Boring!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Don't go into th",

            "content": "A supernatural, slice of life romance about half-youkais that live in Maison de Ayakashi with a particular focus on the two main characters: Ririchiyo and her Secret Service Agent Miketsukami. The real treat of the show is its characters.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story was not outstanding, but it wasn't terrible either. One thing that I was very glad about was that the show deviated from a standard high school comedy. The school-life itself was a very minor part of the show, and the anime focused on the character interactions at Maison de Ayakashi. The supernatural details served as a platform to keep the plot going with littlemishaps occurring to bring the characters together. The plot isn't the main course, but rather a means to make the characters shine. The show also has an actual ending that is very meaningful; it has a beautiful climax that really showcases the internal struggles of the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nNeedless to say, the art style is very beautiful. The show is relatively well-animated; the parts that are lax in animation usually have cute chibis and make the scenes thoroughly enjoyable. The character designs themselves are very appealing; I think we can all agree that Ririchiyo is as cute as a button, and Miketsukami is as hot as the sun. I appreciate the little garter belts on Ririchiyo's thigh highs, and the fact that Miketsukami's gloves cover only half his palms. These small details are delicious.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe background music usually suites the mood; I appreciated the heartfelt use of the piano during touching moments. Of course, each of the Secret Service \"Pairs\" get their own ending songs that pertain to their relationships. The seiyuus themselves sing the endings, and it's very enjoyable to hear the lyrics within the context of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI came into Inu x Boku SS thinking that it was going to be a generic show. Let me say this: I hate tsunderes. No matter who they are, I find a way to hate them. I thought Ririchiyo was going to be a classic tsundere, but she was far more than that. The core of the tsundere archetype is the fact that they're prickly, when in reality they're quite sweet. The latter is usually not expanded on that much, and tsunderes usually never care about how rude, abusive, and straight up mean they are. They just fill a moe, bland character. Ririchiyo on the other hand, is self-aware and even wants to change her horrible habit of using harsh words. She struggles to express her true feelings and has genuine communication issues that stem from her complex childhood. She was literally isolated her whole life and bullied at school as a child. It's a given that she's going to be messed up. It's the first time that I've seen such expansion on why a tsundere acts the way they do. Not only that, she tries so hard to change herself and yearns to understand more about Miketsukami, to the point of throwing away her foolish pride. This aspect of her is very endearing, and this development also really adds to the meat of this romance. It's much more meaningful that way. There's also more than what meets the eye for Miketsukami as well; he's tasty bait for the fangirls since he's a loyal, handsome dog, but his obedience and questionably strong servitude exist because of his tragic backstory. At first the characters seem rather generic, but they have much more depth to them; this was a very pleasant surprise. The side characters aren't as well-developed as Ririchiyo and Miketsukami, but they still add to the show. It's particularly interesting to see the relationships of the other SS \"partners.\" Even the super minor staff of the mansion are well-defined, whether it's the okama maid or the \"bartender\" who can always be seen shaking a cocktail in the background. It's nice to see such small details. All in all, it was a pleasure to see the cast of characters grow throughout these 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm also a sucker for these kind of master/servant relationships, but this is the best I've seen. The most healthy (?) as well. I ate up everything this show threw at me. I might be a little biased because I am definitely the target audience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\r\nEven if this isn't your kind of show, it's definitely worth a watch for these characters. Oh, and it actually ends conclusively, wholesomely, and beautifully. Very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\n*Note, pay close attention to the opening after Miketsukami's backstory is revealed. In fact, this episode plays the opening as the ending for this very purpose. In terms of foreshadowing, metaphor, and substance, this opening is so meaningful.",

We start off with a girl named Ririchiyo, who has trouble expressing her feelings and as a result puts on a cold front whenever she interacts with someone, and how she is going to be living in a new place.\r\nTo say this anime is over-the-top and overdramatic is an understatement. From the first few minutes in, you should already by cringing by laughter at how excessively \u201cextra\u201d the anime is. However, that\u2019s what makes it so good. Since it is too much at times, it is a very lighthearted anime that gives you laughs. \\n\\n\r\nPlot 8/10 \u2013 The main plot of the anime was following Ririchiyo as she finds her way around her new life in a new place with a little incidents here and there. It wasn\u2019t anything extravagant or complicated, but it was nice and simple. It was easy to follow and fit well with the whole atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 \u2013 The art was great and was very well done. There were some parts where it seemed a little awkward, but overall, I thought it was great animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 \u2013 The anime focused mainly on Ririchiyo and how she developed. But it also explained more about some of the other characters, which was great. The character development was very decent, but I did wish that we got to explore some of them more throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 \u2013 It was a good show that got laughs out of me and was worth watching. The characters were great throughout the show and there were many enjoyable aspects of this show. It was cute, humorous, and had a touch of fantasy. I\u2019d recommend this anime to anyone who wants something light hearted and funny to watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now this was quite a hard anime for me to score. There were parts I liked and parts I disliked, a few that made me smile and rather more that made me cringe. On the whole I gave it a 6, which is not a bad score by any means. It just shows that I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as some other anime.\r\nFirst off, just let me say that the opening and endings are great. Catchy and fun, and it was a really nice idea to have each character sing one personalised ending song \u2013 it brought a little more life into the anime.The other sounds complemented the setting, and the voice actors suited most of the characters well (it was a talented cast, after all).\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t find much fault with the art or animation either, the art beautifully detailed (especially in regard to the main characters), generally matching the mood (and actually quite cute in the chibi moments \ud83d\ude0a). \\n\\n\r\nThe story started out interesting enough (with the idea of a mansion full of part-humans who need protection) and became interesting again at the very end, with part of the mystery being explained. There were a few original parts (e.g. the quirky personalities of the SS agents) that stopped the series from being a generic rom-com \u201chot guy protects special girl and eventually they end up falling in love\u201d anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was largely episodic, and I found the pacing to be very slow during the middle episodes (For example, almost 3 episodes were spent revolving around making coffee!) but those were in any case mainly for introducing the supporting characters, not progressing the story.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters had interesting (if one-dimensional) personalities, that was one of the stronger suits of the anime. I did actually really like Natsume\u2019s character (I think all the Kuroshitsuji comparisons are spot on!), and although I initially disliked Soushi\u2019s character it did actually fit him very well. Ririchiyo was a refreshing break from the traditional tsundere and was really very nicely played, with the best development of any character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere were however several moments, that although initially funny, soon became nothing more than an overused series of gags. Nobara\u2019s yuri obsession and Kagerou\u2019s S&M obsession basically took over their respective characters, and ended up causing me to cringe at them far more than I laughed (\u201cMy human toilets?\u201d Really??) Karuta\u2019s food obsession also eventually bored me, it seemed like all she ever did was eat and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a decent anime, so, why did I give it a 6? Mainly because, when I reached the end I sat back and asked myself \u201cwas this an anime I really enjoyed? Did each episode make me want another?\u201d and the answers were no overall. Although nearer the end the anime did indeed improve, as character development increased and backstory was revealed, it never had me particularly excited waiting to see the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d recommend if you like supernatural rom-coms that are mainly episodic by nature, but do be prepared to cringe a bit.

            "content": "Story:\r\nThis anime though I have heard that it strayed from the manga quite a bit in favor of comedy, I don't actually care. Why? Because when it comes to books and movie adaptations. The film should always be judged by it's own merit. \r\nSo while this was not the drama many were expecting, I say that it did the comedy with dramatic undertones quite well. \r\nThe story itself takes place within a world where youkai have interbred with humans at one point or another and the family lines created by these human/youkai hybrid live together with one another for protection. \r\nThe Story follows Ririchiyo whodue to some pain in her past has social issues that cause her to snap at people without meaning to causing her to have a somewhat callous appearance, she desperately wishes to overcome these issues. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know about a lot of you peoples here on the forum, but I can really relate with that myself. Sometimes it's just easier to hide behind a hard exterior when you don't want to look stupid, or feel too shy to say the things you really want to say. Ririchiyo's characterization really shows these traits and her story of overcoming them is quite touching. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, that other stuff that happens. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to say something bad about it, there were a few spots where it seems to drag a bit, but I can't bring myself to dislike those bits.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the art.\\n\r\nIt was well done, the characters were pleasing to the eye and their designs matched up with their personalities quite well. \\n\\n\r\nI really like the different Yokai forms they had. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI loved the characters, every single one of them was memorable and likeable in their own ways. Even the over perfect bishie ended getting a pretty interesting back story to save him by the end of the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nI think my favourite characters out of the cast was a tie between Karuta and Nobara.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime, though upon doing some reading on the manga while writing the review, I gotta say I wish it was- Whoops, almost let it ruin my review. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 for how much I enjoyed it. \\n\r\nI'll be reading the manga properly. \\n\\n\r\nAs for overall, 8/10.\\n\r\nthere were some bits that could have been sanded down to a fine finish. For example, I would have liked some more back story for Soshi, I feel like he could have really used it. Not to mention more spot light on their relationship. I feel like it just ended the moment they started being an item, I would have loved to see the relationship dynamic after they were together. \\n",

            "content": "I think overall this anime was pretty decent. It had some strong points, but it also had weak points. \r\nStrong points\r\nI think the art was superb. The characters were nicely drawn and had a very unique look to all of them. All the colors were vivid and crisp. If i had to have any style of art it would be this.\r\nThere was some excellent character development. This is probably one of the most important things that either makes or breaks an anime. The characters have to go through trails and tribulations that either change them as a whole or make them see something in adifferent light. The main female Shirakiin, Ririchiyo is a perfect example of a dynamic character. viewers can slowly see the difference in her personality. other characters develop as well but  she is the main focus.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a great love story! I wont elaborate and give anything away, but its touching and bitter sweet all at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nComedy. There was quite a bit of comedy as well which really made the anime seem lighter in just the right places. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters as a whole were very lovable. I fell in love with almost every character that was introduced. They all seemed to have some intriguing quark about them. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives \\n\\n\r\nPLOT! Oh my god. This anime probably could have been one of my favorites had it actually had a decent plot. I think what happened was they thought they could just make a story and focus on only characters and good art to hold it up, not the case. There really was no direction for the story in fact it seemed like they just took it episode by episode instead of planning it out, however I would not want this to stop anyone from enjoying it. This anime is just a bit more random due to its weak plot. It more or less comes together at the end. \\n\\n\r\nso who would i recommend this anime to? People who...\\n\\n\r\nlike a good love story \\n\\n\r\nlike seemingly abrasive female characters with a soft side\\n\\n\r\na bit of a random plot\\n\\n\r\ngood character development \\n\\n\r\ndevoted lead male character\\n\\n\r\nlove anime that has a fantasy side\\n\\n\r\npeople who don't mind demons as main characters \\n\\n\r\nSo I hope this helped! xoxo\\n",

The art is wonderful and the humour makes it even more enjoyable. The whole concept of the 'ancestral blood' and everything is really interesting too. Although it lacks in any real plot, it's interesting enough to keep you entertained. The only thing i would say is bad is the lack of fighting. Homestly, when they drew they're swords and weapons and started fighting i was off my chair. IT LOOKED SO AWESOME - ESPECIALLY WITH THE BEAUTIFUL ART.But i was back in my chair after 3 seconds because that's how long the fight lasted. Overall, it's a really good anime that i recommend to everyone who loves good art, good characters and just wants a decent anime to watch. However, if you're looking for a deep storyline or good, long fights, this probably isn't the anime for you.",

            "content": "Story: I did not give this section a rating simply because there really was no defined plot line. It was more like a reality show following the main character Ririchiyo around, and witnessing the crazy events her and her friends encounter on a day to day basis. This simplicity may turn off a lot of people from watching it, however I wholeheartedly believe everyone should give this a chance.\r\nI would say comedy was the defining genre by far. It seemed like every thirty seconds, something would happen or something would be said that would cause me to laugh out loud.\r\nThe romance aspect was the secondmost prevalent genre and I am happy to say you will not be disappointed!\\n\r\nThere are supernatural moments since all the main characters have weird powers and weird monster things sometimes appear, just don't watch this if you want a dominant supernatural series, you will be disappointed.\\n\r\nThe last episode is actually the Inu X Boku SS Special. I got my hopes up when I saw they had a special, until I found out it was just the 12th episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I would personally say the artwork is pretty simplistic in relation to other series I have seen. The majority of the time is spent inside buildings, especially the house, so there was no real need to spent lots of time on scenery. \\n\r\nI thought the character designs were creative and different whenever they transformed into their youkai forms. As normal humans, they looked pretty normal and usual for anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Like the majority of series, I skipped the opening so if you want a detailed review of the openings and closings, I don't have one.\\n\r\nThere were quite a few English voice actors I recognized such as Chris Patton, Brittney Karbowski, and Monica Rial. I thought they were amazing in their parts and they fit together quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: My favorite character was Kagerou Shoukiin who is played by the amazingly talented David Matranga. Every time this character appears, it is so freaking hilarious, especially when he goes on his Masochist/Sadist tirades. \\n\r\nThere was such a diverse field of personalities, it was sometimes overwhelming but that shows it was done correctly. There was the main character who spoke her mind, but felt bad whenever she hurt someone's feelings. You have the perverted SS agent who gets a nosebleed every time she sees one of the girls in a cute position, or fantasizes about such. There is the quick tempered character that always seems to be up for a fight in order to look good in front of his crush. This list goes on and on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: In all, I gave this series a 9 out of 10. If you are looking for a short and hilarious anime to give you a break from all the serious series out there, I think this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "Prior to the anime's airing, I gave the manga a quick preview, and quickly got hooked. It feels like a shoujo romance story at heart, but doesn't have any of the excessive melodrama I hated so much. I usually like shoujo short stories because it presents the novelty of the story without diluting it with character exposition arcs and unrelated side stories. Those methods works to lengthen the serialization (more profit) and adds value to the secondary characters, but it doesn't do much for the story, or for the people that just aren't that into shoujo.\r\nInu x Boku isn't shoujo, but it has all theelements of what I liked about it. With a powerful ending and an interesting back-story, all it needs to do is to work on the execution, and it did. It's true that Inu x Boku is full of bits and pieces that have nothing to do with the storyline, but these bits develops the environment where our protagonist Ririchiyo settled into, which is rather integral to the storyline. Most importantly, these bits never took itself too seriously; they mostly serve as a bonus content to our secondary characters, or provide light humor, a distinct style of Inu x Boku.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also the main draw of the series. There's not one character I cannot find something really unique about him/her, and most importantly none of them felt even a tiny bit clich\u00e9. The one that really stands our is our main character, Ririchiyo. She's not even a tsundere, she's a tsunshun! Which means she gets depressed after being a tsun, so says Nobara. (If I see one more loli tsundere, I would have to kill Kugimiya Rie) Her monologues aren't witty, but they certainly helped expressed her character differently. Some may say that her character is too unrealistic, but even I can see part of myself in her, so I can relate. Also, while I'm never really into lolis, she certainly is cute!\\n\\n\r\nAnd like what many other bloggers have said, the awesome ending really deserves some recognition. I'm not surprised having read the manga, but I don't think other people would expect Inu x Boku to have one of the best endings this season. Or for the past few seasons, for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nI won't give David Productions too much credit, because much of the value comes from the original material. I would say, though, that it's really rare that a manga adaptation was done so smoothly. They literally animate scene-to-scene from the manga, yet the end result is completely different from, say, Deadman Wonderland. DW turns out to be shit. Inu x Boku is ingenious.\\n\\n\r\nBut the show isn't without fault. The lack of content in the middle of the season was obvious, and the speed at where the story progress is god-awful. Not that they don't try to fill up the blanks with comedy, but it couldn't totally cover it up. Having awkward pauses isn't ideal.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values were good. Not exactly brilliant in terms of animation quality, but they got the comedic timing down very well. The OP is also definitely one of the best amongst the ones I've watched this season. And oh, I'm not sure if this was the intention in the original material, but cloning Hirasawa Yui into Chino was a stroke of genius. Don't tell me no, because someone somewhere down the production line definitely see that resemblance. Dammit, it's a same face and voice!\\n\\n\r\nI'm way past the point where I remember the shows that I really enjoyed, but THIS... I'll definitely remember this.",

It all starts with a girl named Ririchiyo, who didn't have attention and love from her parents and other people that  surrounded her as a child. Upon changing to Ayakashi Mansion and meeting her new SS' agent, Soushi, things start to change, as she gets to know what's like having frinds, people who care for her...\r\nHer mean attitude towards everyone is just an way to hide her real feelings and supress all the suffering she had... Spending time with Soushi soon makes her able to showthose feelings... It suddenly turns out to be love... This plot takes some time to be revealed, but that's what made it more interesting and exciting. A deep truth comes along as it happens...\\n\\n\r\nAlthough main characters, who reside in this mansion are descendants from \"monsters' families\" and have supernatural powers, plot isn't focused on their transformations nor battles and this kind of thing... Basically a romance afterall.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone is lovely in here and there are also types you can't find on every anime. I mean, there's a lesbian and even a \"cross-dressing maid\" dude, like, what? Besides that, Kagerou really blows it by being the weirdest one... Making use of such uncommon characters, that's impressive and make it different from many others... Point!\\n\\n\r\nArt was what caught me, it's simply gorgeous! Everything looks so simple, still, it kept my attention. Chibi made it even better and the use of soft colors amazed me. OP theme matches nicely to the song, which is great, and there are variated ED themes, awesome!\\n\\n\r\nIt surely isn't one of the best I've watched... Still, I don't think it was a waste of my time, it was pretty good... A heartwarming story about a girl who slowly learns about how to be more sociable and, specially, how to love someone... The way she begins to show her sweet emotions... I totally fell for her...",

Same as all other animes it was ok good quality sound.\r\nI enjoyed this anime even though it's short and i'll give overall of 9/10 because it was enjoyable but you may find this cliche also",

            "content": "Inu X Boku Secret Service was a show that I was not originally interested in seeing. In fact, I only did stumble upon it after trying to decide what show I should watch next. The art seemed pretty enticing at the time and the bio put this show out to be a short but enjoyable watch; ranging at only 12 episodes. In the end, i'm really glad I did pick this up because I can safely say that even though it's nothing really worth talking about; the quirky characters, comedy, drama, and even moments of action kept me well invested in the 4 hour runtime it presented me. This is an over the top comedy with plenty of Heartfelt scenes. If this is your cup of tea, then i'm sure that your experience with this show will no less be as enjoyable as it was with mine!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nInu X Boku SS follows the life of female protagonist Ririchiyo, Shirakiin. As we see her move to this new Hotel/Apartment complex called, \"Ayakashi Kan,\"  we meet her undying servant, Soushi Miketsukami who is obsessed in pleasing Ririchiryo to her greatest satisfaction. Aside from some added fantasy elements and exposition that bind all the residents of Ayakashi Kan together, majority of the show is dedicated towards the growing relationship between Ririchiryo, Miketsukami and all the fellow tenants that reside in Ayakashi Kan. What makes this such a fun setup to watch however is thanks to the interactions between all the characters and the wacky events that happen. Starting with the main driving force of the series: the relationship between Ririchiyo and Miketsukami is a comedic yet palpable one. Both characters receive much development and grows at a smooth pace, making almost all their actions seem reasonable and in context to the character. It was fun to see Miketsukami start off as a self depreciative, over-obedient servant into a more laid back, but still caring individual by the end of it. However, it does not stop there, and half of the spotlight is also given to the other members living in Ayakashi Kan. Despite being one dimension and even remaining mostly static throughout the series, the residents all have a certain quirk to them that will no doubt harbor favorites. Whether it's the silent-but adorable Karuta (my personal favorite!), the mindless Tsundere Watanuki, or the simply strange Natsume, each character is uniquely different and is what really gives the show the charm it deserves. Despite this however, the show does nothing to break any boundaries and remains nothing more than a good time. In addition, since most of the episodes each have their own scenario with the relationship between Ririchiyo and Miketsukami really the one thing that connects the episodes together, the pacing can sometimes be all over the place. This ranges from fun episodes that have a fast and wacky pace, to the next episode potentially being slow and dramatic. At times it can somewhat jarring, but nonetheless it did nothing to ruin my experience.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe animation was produced by the company simply known as, \"David Production\" whose other works include: Jojo's Bizzare Adventure (2012) and Level E. The overall art in Inu X Boku SS was once again nicely detailed and well animated, but nothing of a master stroke. The character designs on the other hand  were greatly distinctive, making each character easily stand out to suit their personality. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nA major fault on my part is to recognize an OST during a show, as I hardly notice it due to my one sided attention being on the dialogue and events on the screen. Therefore, for an OST to really stand out as \"Good\" for me, it has to make it self heard by highly enhancing the mood at the particular moment or simply just having a good and solid beat that I can even listen to without any context. Sadly, Inu x Boku never had any of that for me. The OP Nirvana (no, not the english band Nirvana) by MUCC (No, also not the band english MUSE) provided a good rock piece, and the End Credits featured a variety of character themed ending animations plus songs. While the themes fit the characters themselves, none of them particularly grabbed my interest and I unfortunately skipped them.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, the best thing about Inu x Boku SS was indeed the characters. As previously mentioned, most of the cast each had their distinctive character trait that can make you absolutely love or hate them, but in the end; the show really needed to make likable characters for their two mains: Ririchiyo and Miketsukami. Thankfully, Inu X Boku does well for these two as even though Ririchiyo  may not be liked by everyone due to her Tsunshun personality (A new character archetype created in the show where she would act cold towards someone but get depressed afterwards due to regret), she well makes up for it due to her naivety and some-what laid back personality that makes characters sympathize (and laugh at) with, but also allows her to not be completely helpless. Miketsukami also shows high appeal as throughout most of the show he is covered in mystery, but also has this overly obedient side that is used to great comedic effect. No doubt however that he will/did definitely appeal to many Josei fans as his never ending will to please Ririchiyo seems like the ideal butler.. Kinda like another well loved Butler (Cough cough).\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nThe time I spent at Ayakashi San was definitely a satisfying one. I easily grew attached with all the characters, and I effortlessly devoured the episodes more faster than you can say your favorite long running Shounen series. Though it wasn't anything groundbreaking, this was a show that flew under the radar and definitely deserves all the attention it can get. If you're looking for a good comedy and want or don't mind a bit of substance to it then the only thing I have left to say is: Enjoy your stay at Ayakashi Kan! \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect upon starting Inu x Boku SS, but as it was recommended to me by a friend I decided to give it a go. And I am glad I did.\r\nI enjoyed the story of Inu x Boku SS, at least what there was of it. It was relatively simple - a teenage girl, who has difficulty interacting with others, moves to a 'special' academy in order to be alone, where she meets her mandatory S.S. agent, who is a very self-depreciating but sweet man. The story really revolves around their interactions and the development of their feelings toward each other,and the consequent changes that happen to them. Of course there is a decent amount of filler, however personally I found most of them pretty entertaining, but by the time the last few episodes rolled around and the story progressed a little more it was getting a little tiresome to be watching constant filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Inu x Boku SS was very clean and well-animated. I really enjoyed the art of this series (I gave it a 10). I thought that the exaggerated chibi style and facial expressions for comedic effect were great, often they produced a laugh from me where otherwise I probably wouldn't have. The art of the characters was very crisp and each of them was easy to recognise however the designs themselves weren't overly original.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound did what its purpose is - setting the scene in certain situations. It was well placed and nothing sounded out of place, though it wasn't hugely memorable. I enjoyed the OP, but I don't really recall any of the EDs. None of  them were awful, they just weren't particularly amazing where I would commit them to memory. I thought the voices were very good though, which saved the sound score from more than a relatively average score (It got an 8 from me) - they all fit well with their characters and made them more believable.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I wasn't expecting to be astounded or moved by was the characters in this anime, though I was rather pleasantly surprised. The two main characters are the driving force of this anime, though it doesn't have much of a present plot the way their characters develop because of the other was intriguing and sweet, and it made me want to keep watching to see if each would succeed in helping the other develop. I also enjoyed most of the supporting cast, with the exception of Natsume Zange (stupid bunny guy). One of my favourites was Roromiya Karuta, because the idea of such a quietly-spoken sweet person turning into a giant skeleton tickled me.\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime. It kept me wanting to watch, if only to see how each of the main characters turned out or if they changed by the end of the series. I would recommend this anime to anyone looking for a romantic anime with comedic moments and an element of the supernatural included within the story, too.",

Not the monster parts they were good. Butstill i liked the pace of the show and how i was never bored because their feelings developed quickly ect. at times when i was a little bored the funny moments made up for them. \\n\r\nIt was too dark for my taste but honestly i still loved it \\n\r\nart: 10!!!!! i gave art a 10 because it was very nicely drawn. like how a true anime should look, true to the manga also! the whole cast looked very attractive and everyone wants that right? it made it so much easier to like them and heartbreak for them haha! the calming and eerie colors made it suitable for the theme. Truly chilling at times and added to the story. I could barely think of time when their bodies were ever distorted which is common in anime. Although it got very inappropriate and graphic at times at least it was artistically indecent? \\n\r\nSound 10! i gave the sound a 10 because its perfect! It added to the mood when there were funny moments AND serious moments. The theme song is truly amazing. like it fit into the whole show perfectly. i listen to it all the time and it just explains the whole show in 3 short minutes filled with sadness and passion kind of get chills when i hear it! The voices for the english dub were PERFECTLY suited for the characters especially for S\u014dshi Miketsukami! Chris pattons voice made it seem so much easier to sympathize and fall in love with the character! And Ririchiyo Shirakiin sassy and sometimes vulnerable voice is literal perfection \\n\r\ncharacter 10: i fell in love with all their quirks and stories especially the main ones although the supporting cast didnt have much depth with their history they did add alot of dimension to the show in a cheery way and it was good that they didnt add to much for the main cast had a very complicated and messed up back story we needed out full focus on them\\n\r\nenjoyment 10: because it was sad at times and funny and made my chest hurt, made me fall in love with fictional characters and made me want to watch again and again. if thats not enjoyment i dont know what is!\\n\r\nWATCH THIS ANIME IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. the manga had a different but sad ending though so i dont recommend it. ignorance is bliss. im literally wallowing in my sorrow. learn from my mistake and dont get your heartbroken with this piece of poetic injustice they call manga ok",

            "content": "After watching the first episode I was expecting this series to turn into a bishonen harem show, but to my delight, I was mistaken. The closest similar anime I can think of is Fruits Basket, though Inu x Boku has more comedy and less heart-warming-ness (?) than FB. The slightly ecchi humor may not be for everyone, but I think it's a good balance for the more wholesome themes of love, friendship, and trust that make up the rest of the story. Watching as Ririchiyo slowly retracted her thorns and thawed her heart was sweet. (And her outfits are just TOO cute!) \r\nFor most ofthe show, the only thing I didn't like about the series was her bodyguard's inexplicably extreme level of devotion and submission to her. Of course, that isn't explained until the series' climax and then it all makes sense. If there's one thing that I would've liked to have seen, it would have been more exploration or usage of the secondary characters. They seemed intriguing enough that each one could've provided an episode or two of backstory/sidequest. \\n\r\nOverall, I like that Inu x Boku did not fall into any of the typical overdone anime storylines and/or tropes that we've come to expect. It's a modest, mildly sweet, and fairly unique work.",
